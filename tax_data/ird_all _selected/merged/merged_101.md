our parts: 1. A short overview of the Child Support Amendment Bill (the Bill), and a brief background on previous consultation on the proposals (pages 9–10). 2. A high-level summary of key themes of submissions received on the Bill (pages 10–11). 3. A table showing Inland Revenue’s recommended changes to the Bill, including matters raised by officials (page 12). 4. Comment on each of the issues raised by submitters. The ordering of issues in this report follows the relevant order in the Child Support Act 1991 (pages 13–104). Overview of the Bill The proposals in the Bill are aimed at reducing complexity, improving fairness, increasing compliance with the Child Support Act 1991, and improving Inland Revenue’s administration of the scheme. These changes are made possible by the move of child support to Inland Revenue’s new systems and processes as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. This Bill therefore supports that move. The proposals: • simplify the penalty rules • introduce automatic deductions of financial support from source deduction payments made by employers to newly liable parents • introduce a time bar of four years on reassessments of child support for past years • include interest and dividends in child support assessments for salary and wage earners; and move from taxable income to net income, preventing carried forward tax losses lowering income for child support purposes, and • make technical amendments to assist with the administration of the scheme. Inland Revenue’s regulatory impact assessment and commentary on the Bill are available on the tax policy website. 1 The commentary is intended to provide background information, explanations of the proposals, and examples of how the proposals (if enacted) would be expected to apply. On 9 July 2020, the Minister of Revenue released Supplementary Order Paper No 538 to the Bill (the SOP). The SOP proposes to repeal incremental penalties on overdue child support and simplify the penalty write-off rules. Inland Revenue’s supplementary analysis report and commentary on the SOP are available on the tax policy website. 2 1 Child support bill introduced, Inland Revenue (11 March 2020), Tax policy news item with links to the supporting documents, available at https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/news/2020/2020-03-11-child-support-bill-introduced 2 Repeal of child support incremental penalties proposed, Inland Revenue (9 July 2020), Tax policy news item with links to the supporting documents, available at https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/news/2020/2020-07-09-repeal-child- support-incremental-penalties-proposed 10 Previous consultation on proposals in the Bill Between 2015 and 2017, the then Government released a series of discussion documents. These documents considered options to improve tax administration, as part of developing Inland Revenue’s multi-year Business Transformation (BT) programme. This transformation has largely been completed. Child support will move to the new platform in 2021. Most of the key proposals in this Bill were originally proposed in the 2017 Government discussion document Making Tax Simpler – Better administration of social policy. 3 Targeted consultation on the proposal to introduce a time bar was undertaken in 2019 with: • National Beneficiary Advocacy Consultative Group • The Federation of Budget Advisors • Citizens Advice Bureau, and • Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand. The Legislative Design and Advisory Committee was consulted in relation to the proposed discretionary power for Inland Revenue to modify an aspect of the child support assessment calculation when unintended outcomes are reached by the formula. Summary of the key themes from submissions on the Bill This report covers 50 submissions on the Bill and the SOP. Eight submitters were organisations: • Birthright New Zealand • CCS Disability Action • Child Advocacy New Zealand • the National Beneficiary Advocacy Consultative Group • National Council of Women of New Zealand • New Zealand Law Society • the Office of the Children’s Commissioner, and • the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. The other submissions were from individuals, or the submitter did not identify whether they were an individual or a group. Many submitters indicated that they had personal experience of the child support scheme, usually as a receiving carer or liable parent. 3 Making Tax Simpler – Better administration of social policy (July 2017), A Government discussion document, available at https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2017/2017-dd-mts-9-social-policy An extensive engagement strategy was developed to support the release of the discussion document, including online public consultation which provided a vehicle for the public to comment on the proposals. It included an online forum with views sought on specific questions, short summaries of the key proposals, a simplified online survey, and animated videos of the proposals. The summaries, surveys and videos were available in te reo Māori and nine languages other than English, and the video was also available in New Zealand Sign Language. Officials also met with key interest groups around New Zealand, for example, the National Beneficiary Advocacy Consultative Group. 11 Submissions on proposals in the Bill Four submitters indicated that they generally supported the intent of the Bill. Some submissions commented on the process of the Bill and the development of legislation, and Inland Revenue’s provision of information about the proposed changes. These are discussed on pages 97–102 of this report. Other submissions commented on the: • maximum age of a qualifying child (pages 20–21) • definition of income (pages 40–49) • time bar (pages 63–65) • exemption from paying child support due to long term illness (page 66) • automatic deductions from wage and salary (pages 73–74), and • grace period (page 79). Submissions on child support issues not contained in the Bill Many of the submissions raised issues with child support policy that are not related to the proposals in the Bill. The proposals in this Bill are focussed on supporting the move of child support to Inland Revenue’s new system. Fundamental changes to the child support scheme were not proposed as part of this Bill. The issues raised by submitters that were not related to the proposals in the Bill include submissions on how child support is calculated. A number of issues raised by submitters were based on misunderstandings of the current legislation. These misunderstandings occurred particularly about the child support formula. For example, some submitters were not aware that the formula now takes into account both parents’ income. The formula was comprehensively revised by the Child Support Amendment Act 2013. The revised formula takes into account both parents’ income, up-to-date costs of raising children, and a greater range of care levels. When applicable, we have commented on these issues, addressing misunderstandings and explaining the reasoning behind the policy. Submissions on issues not related to child support Some submitters commented on issues related to the separation of parents but not related to child support. These included Family Court and legal cost issues. These are not within the scope of Inland Revenue’s functions and we have not commented on them. 12 Recommended changes to the Bill Table 1 lists the changes to the Bill recommended by Inland Revenue following consideration of submissions and includes matters raised by officials. Table 1: Changes to the Bill recommended by Inland Revenue Number Clause(s) Recommendation Page number in this report 1 2 Change the start date for the Bill from 1 April 2021 to 1 April 2022 or an earlier date as set by Order in Council. 16 2 4 Ensure that the new definition of “social security beneficiary” applies retrospectively from 26 November 2018, which is when the previous definition was repealed from the Child Support Act 1991. 18 3 4 Correct the cross-reference in clause 4(2). 19 4 6 Change “reasons outside a person’s control” to “reasonable cause” to align wording with other similar provisions. 29 5 8, 10 Clarify the wording of “no child expenditure table applies”. 32 6 14 Amend the definition of “election period” so that an election period covers the correct span of time. 57 7 14 Amend the definition of “year-to-date income” so that year-to-date income is derived from the correct period. 59 8 18 Ensure that the integrity exceptions in sections 82(2)(a)(i) and (ii) apply to new section 81A (timeframe for notification of existing circumstances). 61 9 44 Remove the amendment to the definition of “relevant payments” in section 135JA(1) as it is redundant. 82 10 46 Give a person 30 days in which to pay when offsetting reverses and results in an additional amount to pay, and the reversal is not due to a reassessment. 83 11 48 Correct the cross-reference in clause 15(2) of schedule 2 of the Bill to section 5(3) of the Child Support Act 1991 to refer to section 5(4). 95 12 - Include the Supplementary Order Paper in the revision tracked Bill. 75 13 - Introduce a transitional provision (until the grace period comes into effect) allowing for the write-off of penalties in the same circumstance as the current section 135GB. 80 14 - Allow for the write-off of penalties when child support assessed has also been written off as it is an inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources to collect the amounts. 81 13 General submissions 15 SUPPORT FOR PROPOSED AMENDMENTS Issue: Support for proposed amendments Submissions (Anonymous D, Estella Carmichael, National Beneficiary Advisory Consultation Group, National Council of Women of New Zealand) The submitters expressed support for the aims and many provisions of the Bill. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 16 APPLICATION DATES FOR THE PROPOSALS Clause 2 Issue: Application dates for the proposals in the Bill Submission (Matter raised by officials) Child support was intended to move to Inland Revenue’s new system (START) in April 2021. However, due to COVID-19 this has been delayed until the second half of 2021. Because of this delay, the majority of the proposals in the Bill require new application dates. As the following changes need to be implemented in START, officials recommend that they apply from 1 April 2022 or an earlier date as set by Order in Council • changes which relate to the administration of the scheme (such as the time bar for reassessing child support) will need to be delayed, and • changes which relate to how child support is assessed (for example, the inclusion of interest and dividend income in the income used to assess child support). These need to apply from the beginning of the child support year to align with the annual assessment run for child support. The 1 April 2021 application date can remain unchanged for: • the proposals in the Supplementary Order Paper which repeal the imposition of incremental penalties and simplify the penalty write-off rules, and • proposals which either align the law with current practice, or do not require systems changes to be implemented. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 17 OBJECTIVES OF THE CHILD SUPPORT ACT 1991 Section 4 Issue: Child Support Act 1991 should prioritise the best interests of children and young people Submissions (Child Advocacy New Zealand, National Council of Women of New Zealand, Office of the Children’s Commissioner, Tamika McCallum) The child should be placed first and foremost. (Child Advocacy New Zealand) The Bill should include a statement that the best interests, rights and welfare of children underpin the legislation. (National Council of Women of New Zealand) We encourage the Government to reassess the impact of the Bill on children, and to align the Bill with the Child and Youth Wellbeing Strategy and the Child Poverty Reduction targets. (Office of the Children’s Commissioner) Amendments should be considered with a full scope of other recommendations made by the public to ensure the Child Support Act 1991 focuses solely on the best interests of the child. (Tamika McCallum) Comment The Bill has not reconsidered the objectives of the Child Support Act 1991. The current settings for the Child Support Act 1991 are fundamentally about the payment and receipt of child support. This objective is to ensure that children are appropriately supported by both their parents even when they are not living together as a family. The focus of the Bill is on improving the administration of the child support scheme, including encouraging liable parents to comply. This is expected to help the timely collection and transfer of child support to the receiving carer. A child support scheme that collects and distributes financial support in an effective manner can contribute to these children’s material wellbeing. Introducing overarching objectives in the Child Support Act 1991 that are specifically centred on the welfare and best interests of the child would require significant consideration that is outside the scope of the Bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 18 DEFINITION OF “SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFICIARY” Clause 4, section 2 Issue: Support for proposed amendment – definition of “social security beneficiary” Submission (Jo Ellen Pethers) Support for reinstating the definition of “social security beneficiary”. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Retrospective application date for the new definition of “social security beneficiary” Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “social security beneficiary” was repealed from the Child Support Act 1991 following changes made as a result of the Social Security Act 2018 rewrite. However, the definition is still referred to as being specifically defined in the Child Support Act 1991 in various sections of that Act. Clause 4 of the Bill contains a proposal to reintroduce a definition of “social security beneficiary” into the Act. The current application date for the proposal is 1 April 2021. This means that there would be a period from 26 November 2018 (when the definition of “social security beneficiary” was repealed) to 1 April 2021 during which there would be no definition in the Act. Officials consider that the new definition of “social security beneficiary” should apply retrospectively from 26 November 2018 being the date the previous definition was repealed from the Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 19 Issue: Numbering Submission (New Zealand Law Society) There is a minor numbering error in clause 4(2). Comment As a result of amendments made in the COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Other Regulatory Urgent Measures) Act 2020, the numbering in the clause needs to be updated. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 20 LIABILITY TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT UNDER FORMULA ASSESSMENT Clause 5(1) Issue: Support for proposed amendment – minimum age financially independent Submission (Jo Ellen Pethers) Support changing the age at which a child can be considered financially independent. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Clause 5(2) Issue: Support for proposed amendment – maximum age qualifying child Submission (Anonymous D) Support changing the maximum age of “qualifying child” as it provides consistency with and alignment to concepts used in other social policy products which will assist compliance and understanding. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Oppose proposed amendment – maximum age qualifying child Submission (Child Advocacy New Zealand, Graham Howell, National Beneficiary Advocacy Consultative Group) Child Advocacy New Zealand opposes section 5(4) of the Child Support Amendment Bill because it disadvantages particular groups of vulnerable children. Child Advocacy New Zealand recommends that section 5(4) read “children to the age of 20 will qualify for child support if they are enrolled at and attending an approved education or training establishment.” This will ensure that children are supported up to the age of 20 if they are enrolled at or attending an approved education or training establishment. This reduces the barrier of limited access to financial support. (Child Advocacy New Zealand) 21 Do not lower the maximum age of qualifying child. Education is important, and reducing the age goes backwards. (Graham Howell) We believe this provision is substantively unfair and unjustified. We believe the provision is inconsistent with, and breaches, New Zealand’s obligations under international human rights law to which it is a state party, principally the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. (National Beneficiary Advocacy Consultative Group) Comment The intention behind this proposal is to align the “maximum qualifying age” of a child for child support purposes with similar rules in the Working for Families legislation. Administrative consistency across these social policy products will make the rules easier for customers of both the Ministry of Social Development and Inland Revenue to understand and comply with. The proposed amendment does not completely align the rules as the Working for Families rule also applies when the dependent child is in tertiary education. The rule for child support would not be extended to cover qualifying children who are in tertiary education because government support may be available in respect of the child. This is similar to the current rules which mean a child is no longer a qualifying child if they become financially independent, by starting full-time work, for example. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCROC) defines a child as a person under the age of 18 years unless under the law appliable to them they attain majority earlier. The proposal to change the maximum age of a qualifying child for child support purposes only affects those over the age of 18. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Schooling of child Submission (Liz Boyd) Children can be forced to stay at school by the receiving carer just so they can receive child support. Comment To qualify for child support, the child must be: • under 18 years of age or 18 years of age and enrolled at and attending a registered school in New Zealand or an overseas school • a New Zealand citizen or ordinarily resident in New Zealand • not married, in a civil union or de facto relationship, and • not financially independent. 22 The Bill proposes that the maximum age of a qualifying child be aligned with similar tests for Working for Families and main benefit recipients. However, the Bill does not propose any changes to the existing requirement for children over 18 to be at school. This requirement to be at school ensures that they are financially supported by their parents while they are finishing the school year. For children under the age of 18 there is no requirement to be at school. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Child support should cease if the child is not attending school Submission (Anonymous G) Child support should cease when a child turns 16 and leaves school or is not attending school regularly. Comment An objective of the Child Support Act 1991 is to affirm the right of children to be maintained by their parents. A child ceases to qualify for child support at age 18, reflecting that for children, guardianship ends when they turn 18. There is a small extension for children aged 18 and still attending school. If a child under the age of 18 is financially independent, they will cease to qualify for child support reflecting their ability to maintain themselves. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 23 SHARED CARE Section 14 Issue: 50:50 care Submissions (Amy Burling, Andreas Ola, Anonymous B, Anonymous C, Anonymous E, Anonymous G, Caine Mead, John Barr, John Clarkson, Joshua Colgan, Liz Kelly, Malcolm Halcrow, Nadja McKellow, Rose Carruthers) When child custody is 50:50 shared care, child support should not be implemented. An equity plan where income differences between either parent are vastly different could be applied – for example, a $25,000 difference between parents could be a good milestone to consider applying an equity plan in 50:50 shared care arrangements. (Amy Burling) Child support should be prorated according to visitation and then should subsequently be prorated according to the number of days the parent with most to lose has been allowed to see the children. (Andreas Ola) If care 50:50 then there should be no mandatory payments. If it is not 50:50 care, the parent who has less care should pay support payments to cover the days that they do not have the child up to 50 percent only. (Anonymous B) The maximum a parent should have to pay is 50 percent of the cost of raising a child. (Anonymous C) Custody should be 50:50 with no exchange of child support, except in proven cases of abuse, not alleged cases. (Anonymous E) Child support should only ever be 50 percent to prevent the custody of a child being used for financial gain. If there is 50:50 shared care, there should be no child support. (Anonymous G) Change child support so that when there is 50:50 care there is no money exchanged. I understand your theory on why it is as it is but it costs the same in each household to raise a child. Often the paying parent has extra costs relating to childcare as they are the working parent. (Caine Mead) The first rule must be 50:50 custody required and enforceable via Oranga Tamariki and social services unless there is proof and conviction that would show the child would be at risk. This must be the starting rule. If either party takes off, there must be no requirement to pay for the child until they are in the 50:50 arrangement. (John Barr) That a principle is brought into the Act that the best form of child support is time spent with the child. Where equal shared care is in place, no child support should be paid to the other parent. This would encourage parents to advance their careers and not punish them for working hard. Where equal shared care is opposed by a parent, they are not entitled to child support. (John Clarkson) Automatic 50:50 custody (if no abuse conviction). (Joshua Colgan) Calculations need to be calculated by time spent in each home, shared care arrangements and parental orders. (Liz Kelly) 24 During the lockdown my children were in my care for seven weeks. In this situation I should not need to pay child support. (Malcolm Halcrow) When sharing care equally, child support should not be paid as expenses at both houses are the same and it puts half siblings in the paying home at a disadvantage. (Nadja McKellow) If 50:50 care, there should be no liable parent. The Government should be aiming for 50:50 shared care as that is what is best for children and the best way to make that happen is by taking away the financial incentive to go for full custody. (Rose Carruthers) Comment The matter raised in these submissions is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. The submissions are based on the premise that if parents are sharing the care of the child equally, there is no need for any financial adjustment to be made between parents. The approach of no child support payable when there is 50:50 care ignores the possibility of parents having materially different incomes and, therefore, materially different expenditures to support their children. An objective of the Child Support Act 1991 is that parents with a like capacity to provide financial support should provide like amounts of financial support. Different levels of care have different costs which is why it is a factor in the assessment formula. The child support rules are intended to follow the care arrangements. If parents cannot agree between themselves, the Family Court can determine care arrangements. Inland Revenue does not determine levels of care. A consequence of taking care levels into account may be that there is an incentive to have a higher level of care. In 2013, the child support formula was amended. It is intended to replicate, as far as possible, the financial arrangements that would exist if the parents were living together. This means that both parents’ incomes and care arrangements are considered as part of the child support assessment. Example 1 Yukio and Anastasia share 50:50 care of their daughter Ilsa (aged 13), with each parent caring for Ilsa on alternating weeks. Yukio has a new partner and no children with the new partner. For the 2019 calendar year, Yukio received $12,050 during the year through a jobseeker support benefit. Anastasia was employed and earned $65,000 over the same period. For the child support year 1 April 2020 – 31 March 2021, Anastasia would be the liable parent and the child support amount would be $423.70 per month. If no child support were payable because 50:50 shared care were in place, Yukio would receive no child support. Example 2 Felix and Cecilia share 50:50 care of their son Lucius (aged 7), with each parent caring for Lucius on alternating weeks. Felix earns $60,000 per annum, and Cecilia earns $65,000 per annum. Neither parent has any other children. Based on these details, Cecilia would be the liable parent, and the child support amount for the child support year 1 April 2020 – 31 March 2021 would be $79.50 per month. If no child support were payable because 50:50 shared care were in place, Felix would receive no child support. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 25 Issue: Ongoing daily care Submission (Jo Ellen Pethers) During the 2013 changes, a passage defining over what period of time an ongoing daily care percentage is calculated was removed. I suggest an addition to section 15(6) which would apply when establishing proportions of care: the Commissioner – (c) must assess the care provided for a period within the relevant child support year, where a child is qualifying and an assessment is active under the formula assessment scheme. (d) subsection (b) applies regardless of the implementation of subsection (c). Comment The matter raised in this submission is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Access Submissions (Anonymous E, Chris Renau, Greig Giblin, John Barr, Liz Boyd, Mason Keats, Patrick Mulligan, Rose Carruthers) In the case of parental alienation, where one parent is doing everything he can to see his child and the other parent will not allow it, there should be no exchange in child support. (Anonymous E) Inland Revenue made me a liable parent without access rights or decision making. I would like to see a fair system; this one penalises parents. (Chris Renau) Link child support with access. If the receiving parent does not allow the liable parent to see the child/children, the receiving parent should be financially penalised. (Greig Giblin) Contact with the children must determine a part of child support money. If the father is denied contact and cannot get contact, child support money should not be required. (John Barr) There are parents in this country who are kept from their children due to parental alienation regardless of the court orders for shared care. One of the reasons that parents do this is so they no longer have to pay any child support. (Liz Boyd) 26 I am penalised not only for having to pay a court system to see my own child, I will be forced to pay even more than I can afford. I have not seen my son in over three years. (Mason Keats) If the ex-partner does not allow access (with no reasonable grounds), no child support should be paid (this would act as a penalty for not allowing access). (Patrick Mulligan) If the receiving parent stops contact with paying parent, the child support liability should be reduced. (Rose Carruthers) Comment The matter raised in these submissions is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill and is not within the scope of Inland Revenue’s functions. While recognising the difficulties associated with levels of care, and the disincentive that a lack of contact can have on making child support payments, the child support scheme is fundamentally about establishing the amount of financial support that parents living apart have to pay towards raising their children. Officials consider, therefore, that the two issues are separate. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Recognising changes in care when the change is the result of one parent withholding access Submission (Anonymous D) If a receiving carer breaches a care agreement with the liable parent to restrict that liable parent’s care of the children to levels below the recognised care threshold, Inland Revenue should be very cautious in making a determination that a change in care has occurred. Comment The matter raised in this submission is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. If a change of care occurs because one parent withholds access, Inland Revenue does not automatically reduce the other person’s care from when it occurred. Before making a decision, Inland Revenue considers: • what the care arrangement was before the change, and • what the other person is doing to enforce any agreement or order. If active steps are being taken (for example, through the courts), Inland Revenue may consider that the change is just temporary and that a change to care levels has not occurred. If a court hearing or mediation is imminent, Inland Revenue may wait for the outcome before making a decision. 27 However, if no steps have been taken to enforce any arrangement or order, or the Court case has been prolonged for a period of time, Inland Revenue may decide that the change is not temporary and that a change to the “ongoing daily care” has occurred. The Child Support Act 1991 provides that parents have objection rights to the decision Inland Revenue made. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Removal of children from New Zealand Submission (John Barr) The borders should be tightened to reduce the chances of a child being removed from the country. Better enforcement of court orders is needed. The Police and Oranga Tamariki need to have access to a register of court orders that get updated on the day any changes get made through the court. Even if it is only a note to say that the courts/child’s lawyer need to be contacted before any action can be taken. Comment The matter raised in this submission is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill and is not within the scope of Inland Revenue’s functions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Recognised care Submissions (Anonymous C, Anonymous D, John Clarkson, Joshua Keizer) There is no recognition for having less than 28 percent care, but there are still costs. (Anonymous C) It is ridiculous that a liable parent should potentially have to pay as though they had 0 percent care to a receiving carer even if they share the care of the child/children (but do not reach the 103-night care threshold). (Anonymous D) The 28 percent threshold for recognised care should be removed. This threshold is a ridiculous method to use, encourages parental alienation, and judges abusing their positions. The Judge in this case, admitted in a later hearing that she ensured I would pay maximum child support by reducing the time I got to spend with my child to less than 27 percent. With the existing calculator, 28 care under 27 percent pays the maximum possible. The calculation used is unjust and unfair and being abused. (John Clarkson) Not recognising a reasonable level of contact or even custody (such as one to two nights each weekend) disadvantages the payer. The children have costs during this time, which liable parents are already paying for in child support. Currently, the two best solutions are to have the children all the time or never spend any time with them. The mechanism to administer care should be made more flexible by lowering the 28 percent recognised care threshold or by allowing deductions to represent other expenses incurred. (Joshua Keizer) Comment The matter raised in these submissions is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. The child support formula assessment recognises that a parent provides for their child if they provide ongoing daily care for at least 28 percent of the time. However, a person must care for a child at least 35 percent of the time to be entitled to receive child support payments. The 28 percent threshold to recognise care was implemented as part of the major changes to the child support scheme as part of the 2013 child support reforms. In developing the 28 percent threshold a number of factors were considered, including: • the level of regular and shared care that starts to give rise to dual costs • how the extra costs are borne by each parent • the degree of complexity that the child support scheme should bear • the financial impact of any change, as it affects paying parents, receiving parents, children, and when the child support offsets benefit payments, the Government • the degree to which the approach encourages paying parents to comply, and • the costs involved in implementing the approach. Various levels of care were considered, in addition to the current thresholds, to provide recognition to those paying parents who provide high levels of care: • care in excess of 14 percent of care (on average one night a week) • care in excess of one-third of care (to align with Working for Families tax credits), and • retaining the 40 percent of care threshold that applied at the time. It was determined that the 28 percent threshold was, on balance the preferred option based on analysis of available research and consideration of the factors outlined above. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 29 TIMEFRAMES FOR PROVIDING ORDERS OF PARENTAGE Clause 6, section 19 Issue: Support for proposed amendment – introduction of timeframe Submissions (Anonymous D, Jo Ellen Pethers) I fully support any amendment that requires a receiving carer or a liable parent to act in a proper and timely manner. (Anonymous D) I support the proposed amendments. (Jo Ellen Pethers) Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Extending time limits for establishing paternity Submission (New Zealand Law Society) New sections 19(4)(b) and (6)(b) use the term “outside the applicant’s control”, in relation to circumstances justifying Inland Revenue’s exercise of discretion to extend the specified time limits for establishing paternity. The New Zealand Law Society recommends that clause 6 is amended to provide greater clarity and certainty for applicants and Inland Revenue. Section 135B(2)(a) of the Act might provide a useful model; that section defines “reasonable cause” for delay as an event or circumstance that “is beyond the control of the liable person, including a serious illness, an accident, or a disaster”. Comment Officials consider that clause 6 should be amended to provide greater clarity around circumstances justifying Inland Revenue’s exercise of discretion to extend the specified time limits for establishing paternity. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 30 CHILD LEAVING STATE CARE Clause 7, section 25 Issue: Inland Revenue should inform carer of application process Submission (Anonymous D) The proposals appear sound, taking into account the observation regarding safety concerns. However, Inland Revenue should be obliged to inform and assist the parent into whose care the child is placed to ensure that they are fully informed of the ability to apply for the formula assessment and how to do so. If not already in place, the respective government departments should be enabled to share contact information for the parent in order to ensure that Inland Revenue can make contact on a timely basis. Comment When a child moves from being in the care of Oranga Tamariki to the care of one of their parents, Inland Revenue will not necessarily know into whose care the child has gone. Inland Revenue will only know the date the child left Oranga Tamariki’s care. Even if Inland Revenue did have the parent’s contact information, Inland Revenue will not have the background information to know when it would or would not be appropriate to contact the new carer. Further, as the parent is likely to have been liable to pay child support while their child was in Oranga Tamariki care, they are likely to already have familiarity with the child support scheme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Aim of the proposal Submission (Jo Ellen Pethers) I feel neutral about this amendment, it only seems to simplify the wording and shift the placement of a provision. Comment The proposed amendment is not a simplification of the provision. Rather, the purpose of the proposed amendment is to clarify that child support should end when a child leaves State care which would reinforce the current practice and protect the safety of the child. 31 Currently, when a child leaves State care and is placed with one of the parents, Inland Revenue’s practice is to stop child support. This practice is followed due to safety concerns for the child and carer – if child support were not ended, a notice would be issued to both parents which would include the name of the carer. However, Inland Revenue’s approach is not consistent with the current legislative provisions. This amendment would align the legislation with operational practice. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 32 AMOUNT OF CHILD SUPPORT PAYABLE UNDER FORMULA ASSESSMENT Clause 8, section 30, schedule 3 Issue: Rationale for repeal of mixed age expenditure table Submissions (Jo Ellen Pethers) I feel neutral about this amendment as I struggle to envision a circumstance where one of the three mixed age expenditure tables will not be applicable. Comment If a child support calculation includes at least two children in the same child support calculation and they fall into different age brackets, the use of the mixed age table can lead to an inequitable outcome. For example, if the children do not live in the same household (for example, one child lives with the mother and the other with the father), the use of the mixed age table does not allocate costs appropriately to each child (although the total expenditure for all children is correct), with the result that the parent with the older child is not receiving the appropriate amount of child support. The amendment would repeal the mixed age expenditure table to ensure that costs of children are allocated appropriately between younger and older children. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Clarifying when no child expenditure table applies Submissions (New Zealand Law Society) If the phrase “no child expenditure table applies” means that schedule 3 does not apply because the combination and ages of children living in the household do not fit within the categories in schedule 3, then this should be clearly stated. If something else is meant by the phrase, then new subsection (3) should be amended to provide clarity. The same recommendation regarding the unclear meaning of “if no child expenditure table applies” is made in respect of clause 12, which similarly amends section 35B (dependent child allowance). Comment The amendment would repeal the mixed age expenditure table to ensure that costs of children are allocated appropriately between younger and older children. An expenditure table would not apply in a situation when at least two children in the same child support calculation fall into different age brackets. That is, at least one child is 12 or under, and 33 at least one other child is 13 or older. Officials consider that the meaning of “if no child expenditure table applies” should be clarified in the drafting of the Bill. Recommendation That the submission that the provision be clarified be accepted. Issue: Discretion to adjust expenditure calculations Submission (Jo Ellen Pethers) I strongly oppose the amendment as it undermines the integrity of the formula assessment scheme. It is a more or less an underhanded, unrestrained addition to the legislation which allows Inland Revenue to interfere with the core principles of the formula assessment scheme at its discretion. Where Inland Revenue is exercising discretion, it has lost its impartiality and eroded certainty in law. I further oppose this amendment as a liable parent can currently have their assessment contested by way of review. This review seeks exceptional circumstances for departure and the situations of the liable parent, the receiving carer and the child are considered before a departure order can be made. If it is necessary for Inland Revenue to make decisions departing from assessments, we should ask ourselves is the formula correct. Comment The objective of the proposed discretion is to address situations in which the application of expenditure calculations results in an unintended and unjust outcome. The proposed discretion would therefore allow Inland Revenue to modify the expenditure amount used in child expenditure calculations in certain situations. This can occur in situations where the care arrangements for children are particularly complex. For example, if a parent has two dependent children in their care full time, and a third dependent child enters their care on a shared care basis, that parent’s dependent child allowance can decrease, when it might otherwise be expected to increase or at least stay the same. 34 Example 3 Caoimhe earns $61,351 and has two dependent children in her care, Ruairi and Rawiri. Caoimhe has a dependent child allowance of $14,417.20. Figure 1 $9,816.12$4,601.08$14,417.20 R u ai r iRawir i Total expenditure Caoimhe’s daughter Matilda comes to live with her fifty percent of the time. It could be reasonably expected that Caoimhe’s dependent child allowance would increase by fifty percent of the expenditure permitted for Matilda (in this instance, around $920). Figure 2 $9,816.12$4,601.08$15,337.23 R u ai r iRawir iMatilda Total expenditure $920.025 $920.025 However, this is not the outcome reached under current rules. Since the formula for the dependent child allowance divides expenditure equally amongst the children, Matilda is allocated an equal third of total expenditure, of which Caoimhe is permitted only fifty percent (in this instance, $2,709.54). As such, Caoimhe’s dependent child allowance decreases from $14,417.20 to $13,547.70, even though there is an additional child in her care. Figure 3 $5,419.08$5,419.08$13,547.70 R u ai r i Rawir i Matilda Total expenditure $2,709.54 $2,709.54 The administrative review process is not a suitable mechanism to address this problem because administrative reviews enable factors outside of the standard child support formula to be taken into account. This problem is not the result of a factor beyond what the formula ordinarily considers but is the result of complex interactions within the current formula. Officials considered whether the child support formula itself should be amended. However, this would introduce significant complexity that would have to be built into Inland Revenue’s new IT system, and since the formula currently caters for the vast majority of circumstances, a discretion would be preferable. Before drafting the Bill officials sought advice from the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee (LDAC) on two options: 1. A more clearly delineated (and less flexible) power to identify within the total expenditure the actual marginal cost of dependent children (using information based on the formula) for the purposes of calculating the dependent child allowance in situations when dependent children do not share the same care arrangement. 35 2. A broader discretion permitting Inland Revenue to modify expenditure calculations when complex care arrangements for children in the same calculation are not adequately accounted for by the usual method. The narrower discretionary power (option 1) would allow Inland Revenue to identify the actual marginal cost of dependent children per the child expenditure table, instead of simply dividing total expenditure by the number of children. However, this offers less flexibility for Inland Revenue in determining the correct position and may lead to unfair outcomes in unusual circumstances. The broader power (option 2) would permit Inland Revenue to deal with cases like, and including, the example above by modifying expenditure calculations in an appropriate manner when perverse outcomes are reached. The advantage of such an approach is that it would allow Inland Revenue to resolve unanticipated, complex and unusual cases that might otherwise require intricate legislative fixes each time a new situation is identified. The expenditure calculations do serve the vast majority of cases, and so such instances would be infrequent. Moreover, perverse outcomes would require technical and particular changes, and so due to their specificity are appropriate to delegate. A person would have the right to object to any assessments or reassessments resulting from the application of this discretion under the Child Support Act 1991. LDAC’s advice on the proposed discretion is included below: 3. LDAC does not object to the proposed discretionary power for the Commissioner. LDAC notes Inland Revenue’s advice that the more clearly delineated power may “lead to unfair outcomes in unusual circumstances,” and that the broader power would allow the Commissioner “to resolve complex and unusual cases.” 4. LDAC does, however, recommend that the Bill include a test for the exercise of the discretion to modify calculations. This would keep the exercise of the discretion within proper boundaries. Inland Revenue notes that “\[t\]he expenditure calculations do serve the vast majority of cases, and so such instances would be infrequent.” The legislation should reflect this – namely, that the discretion only applies in exceptional or unusual situations. The inclusion of factors that the Commissioner may or must “have regard to” may assist in limiting the scope of the discretion. Such factors could include whether applying the formula would lead to an unfair outcome, or result in an unintended outcome, or whether the care arrangements are complex. ... 6. LDAC notes that there will be the safeguard of a statutory right to object to the expenditure calculations. The right to object under section 91 is, however, limited to objections on specified grounds. This safeguard will be less effective if there are no criteria for the Commissioner’s proposed discretion to modify expenditure calculations. A parent who wishes to object to an assessment needs to know how the Commissioner has made that assessment. Otherwise, the parent will find it difficult to formulate grounds for an objection. Section 92(3) states that every notice of objection “shall state fully and in detail the grounds of the person’s objection.” A parent may not even have grounds to object if the discretion is without the limits suggested above in paragraph 4, as the Commissioner would be giving effect to the provisions of the Act in exercising a broad discretion. 36 7. A statutory test will also help the person assessing an objection to determine whether the objection should succeed. In the first instance this will be the Commissioner, but if that objection does not succeed, the parent may then appeal to the Family Court. A statutory test will support transparent decision making and effective appeal rights. A person affected by a statutory decision should have an adequate pathway to challenge the decision. The Bill as currently drafted reflects the broad discretion. Reflecting LDAC’s advice, it contains a statutory test limiting the use of the discretion to when there are exceptional circumstances and the outcome would be unjust or inequitable if the calculations were not modified (clauses 8 and 12). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Expenditure table Submission (Jo Ellen Pethers) If expenditure relevant to the formula is calculated using an average weekly earnings figure and this is translated into formula derived from average income, would it not be sensible to standardise the relationship between expenditure, average income and taxable income. Then, compare the relationship at a start point of gross not net amounts. A percentage drawn from a comparison of a person’s income to the income of the other parent has a direct effect on the liability or entitlement calculated by the formula assessment. Comment The matter raised in this submission is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. The expenditure table is based on research which measured the expenditure for raising children in New Zealand for the purposes of the child support assessment formula. 4 The results of the research showed that the average expenditure for raising children in New Zealand varies according to the age of the child, the household’s level of income and the number of children in the household. As such, the expenditure table considers the combined income of both parents once any allowances have been deducted, and the age and number of children. This produces an expenditure figure which is an estimate of the amount that would be spent on the upkeep of the children if both of the parents and the children lived together as a family. The expenditure figure is compared against each parent’s income and the care they provide to determine how much, and by whom, child support is payable. 4 Costs of raising children, Iris Claus, Paul Kilford, Geoff Leggett and Xin Wang (June 2009), available at https://www.nzae.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Costs\_of\_raising\_children\_NZAE\_paper\_v2.pdf 37 The income that factors into this calculation is a gross amount (that is, it has not had tax deducted). The formula does not compare parents’ income against each other, but instead combines them to represent the household income as if the parents and children were living together as a family. This approach provides a figure which represents the cost of raising the children in question, and which can be compared against each parent’s capacity to provide financial support and the care they provide to determine a fair child support amount. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Increase when child turns 13 Submission (Anonymous E) Child support should not increase when a child turns 13. Child support receiving parents are the only people in New Zealand who get a pay rise when their children turn 13. This is stated to be because the child will cost more to raise at 13. Yet no boss in New Zealand will give their employees a raise because they now have a teenager. Comment The matter raised in this submission is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. As part of the changes to the child support formula in the 2013 reforms, officials considered a variety of domestic and international research on child support matters. New Zealand research was specifically undertaken to support the development of the proposals and to understand the cost of raising children in New Zealand. The findings are available on the New Zealand Association of Economists’ website. 5 One of the factors the researchers considered was the cost of children by age. The results indicated that, on average, the costs of teenagers were higher than those of children aged 12 years and under. This was true for both high- and low-income households. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 5 Costs of raising children, Iris Claus, Paul Kilford, Geoff Leggett and Xin Wang (June 2009), available at https://www.nzae.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Costs\_of\_raising\_children\_NZAE\_paper\_v2.pdf 38 Issue: Child expenditure Submission (National Council of Women of New Zealand) The Council supports the General Policy Statement in the Explanatory Note that: providing Inland Revenue with a discretion to adjust child expenditure calculations in situations where complex care arrangements for children in the same calculation are not adequately accounted for by the usual method. We believe this is important for families of a child with severe or complex disability needs because parents report that the financial support from Ministry of Health, Ministry of Social Development and Ministry of Education never fully cover the true costs incurred. It is very common for families to contribute their own funding top-up, and this should be included as a shared cost in the assessment calculations. Comment The purpose of this amendment is not to increase the expenditure used in child support formula calculations to reflect situations when parents face greater costs for their children (for example, because those children have severe or complex disability needs). The discretion is designed to address situations in which the application of expenditure calculations results in an unintended and unjust outcome. This can occur in situations when the care arrangements for children are particularly complex. If a parent does have additional expenses due to the specific needs of a child or person in their care (for instance, the circumstances set out in the submission), they are able to apply for an administrative review of their child support assessment to have the additional expenses factored into their assessment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Exceptional circumstances – disability and health-related costs Submission (CCS Disability Action) We want to raise the importance of child support assessments taking into account a child’s disability and/or health-related care needs. In line with this, we recommend a new section 30(4a) that explicitly mentions disability and/or health-related care needs as a potential exceptional circumstance. 39 Comment If a person considers that they have circumstances which are not taken into account in the child support formula (such as a child’s disability or health-related care needs), they are able to apply for an administrative review of the assessment. An administrative review is a means of having a child assessment reviewed if a parent has a cost or circumstance which is not taken into account by the standard formula. Inland Revenue manages the administrative review process, but the actual review is carried out by a Review Officer who is an independent person, usually a lawyer, contracted to Inland Revenue to carry out hearings. In this way, there is an existing capability to take specific situations into account in the child support assessment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 40 DEFINITION OF “INCOME” Clauses 9 and 10, sections 34 and 35 Issue: Support for proposed amendment – changes to definition of “income” Submissions (Anonymous D, Dean Hyde) I support the inclusion of investment income and the move to net income. (Anonymous D) I would like to express my support for the move from a position of assessing liability on the current basis of taxable income to that of net income, thereby removing the ability of the liable parent to offset their current liability by losses from previous financial years. I would further like to express my support for the proposed inclusion of interest and dividends from investments to be included within the definition of “income” for the purpose of assessing a parent’s liability. (Dean Hyde) Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Object to move to “net income” Submission (Jo Ellen Pethers) The definition of “taxable income” should remain. I oppose the use of net income rather than taxable income. The alteration of the formula assessment in this way, as the expenditure on children is estimated using average incomes (earning before tax) and the use of net income, is simply a method to reduce liability without justified reasoning. An expenditure amount would then be read from the expenditure table resulting in a significant decrease in child support payable. But for what reason? The proposal is unnecessarily complicated and would usually provide more administrative complications than they are worth. Comment Currently, the Child Support Act 1991 uses taxable income as the basis for child support assessments and the Bill proposes moving to net income. Taxable income is a person’s income after losses carried forward from an earlier year have been taken into account. Net income is a person’s income before these losses have been taken into account. These terms are defined in the Income Tax Act 2007. “Net income” as defined is not income after tax has been deducted, it is the person’s gross earnings. Moving from a “taxable” to a “net” income base will mean that tax losses carried forward would no longer reduce the income used to calculate child support obligations. 41 One of the objectives of child support is that the level of financial support that parents provide for their children is determined according to their relative financial capacity. Reducing a person’s income by deducting tax losses that have been occurred in earlier periods is at odds with that objective. Because both parents’ net incomes are used in the child support assessment, relativity would be maintained, even if after tax income were used rather than net income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Income should be after tax Submissions (Anonymous A, Patrick Mulligan) The legislation should be tested on the net income not gross income. (Anonymous A) Child support should be calculated after tax, not before. (Patrick Mulligan) Comment Income for child support purposes is based on gross income. No deduction is given for taxes. This is consistent with the other social policy products administered by Inland Revenue, that is, Working for Families tax credits and student loans. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Income should not be based on gross earnings Submission (Anonymous G) Child support is based on gross earnings and this means that the paying parent is paying taxes for both parents. Comment Currently, the Child Support Act 1991 uses taxable income as the basis for child support assessments and the Bill proposes moving to net income. Taxable income is a person’s income after losses carried forward from an earlier year have been taken into account. Net income is a person’s income before these losses have been taken into 42 account. These terms are defined in the Income Tax Act 2007. “Net income” as defined is not income after tax has been deducted, it is the person’s gross earnings. This approach is consistent with the other social policy products administered by Inland Revenue, that is, Working for Families tax credits and student loans. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Inclusion of investment income widens the gap of child poverty Submission (Tamika McCallum) Basing child support on income levels rather than a true account of the cost of basic living and child-related expenses further widens the gap of child poverty. Therefore, although including investments within an individual’s income may increase their child support liability, it further widens the gap of child poverty. Comment Currently, for parents whose only income is income that has had tax deducted at source, only their employment income is included in their child support assessment. That is, interest and dividends subject to resident withholding tax are excluded. This is because, in the past, interest and dividend income was not generally known until the end of the tax year. However, from 1 April 2020 interest and dividend income information has been reported to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis. Therefore, the Bill proposes that this income now be taken into account in child support assessments. The child support formula takes into account both parents’ income in order to ensure that the amount of child support calculated reflects parents’ ability to provide financial support. It is important that the definition of income used accurately reflects a parent’s financial ability to support their children. Including investment income will help achieve this. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Widen the definition of “income” further Submissions (Anonymous D, Julie MacClure) The Committee should amend the definition further by enacting the amendments that were contained in earlier reforms. (Anonymous D) 43 PIE income should be included in child support assessments. (Julie MacClure) Comment The wider definitions of “income” used for Working for Families tax credits and student loans purposes are generally aligned. During the 2013 child support reforms it was agreed to widen the definition of “income” for child support to include most of the other adjustments used in the Working for Families tax credits and student loan definitions of income. 6 However, this was not implemented, due to issues with Inland Revenue’s FIRST system and compliance costs. Appendix 2 to the 2017 discussion document Making Tax Simpler – Better administration of social policy set out a comparison of the key income definitions for Working for Families tax credits, child support (the current rules and the 2013 reform proposal) and student loans. 7 The definition of “income” has a big impact on the amount of support or extent of liability for payments. Determining what is included as income is a significant policy decision. The current approach for social policy is to use a common definition of income, such as the Income Tax Act 2007 definition of “net income”, and to make adjustments to include or exclude other specific types of income as appropriate – for example, types of exempt income, portfolio investment entity income, a person’s share of the undistributed income of a closely held company. This Bill proposes that the definition of “income” used for child support purposes be more closely aligned with those other wider definitions by incorporating interest and dividend income and no longer offsetting losses from earlier years. These proposed changes would mean that the definition of “income” used better reflects a parent’s financial capacity to pay child support. Interest and dividend information is now reported to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis. It is, therefore, easy for Inland Revenue to include these amounts as income. Widening the definition further to include, for example, non-locked in PIE income which is not provided to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis, would mean that parents would need to provide this information each year. In order to keep compliance costs to a minimum it is proposed that these other factors are not included as income for child support formula assessment purposes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 6 Supporting children – a summary of feedback on the discussion document (July 2011), available at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2011/2011-other-supporting-children-feedbacksummary 7 Making Tax Simpler – Better administration of social policy (July 2017), available at https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2017/2017-dd-mts-9-social-policy 44 Issue: Use of actual income Submissions (Anonymous D, Jo Ellen Pethers) I consider that a better approach to income would be to fully review the first child support year(s) in all cases, once actual income amounts can be confirmed from filed tax returns and actual proportions of care for the period can be calculated and confirmed. (Anonymous D) Instead of a past year’s income, current income and current care should be used to assess current ability to pay. (Jo Ellen Pethers) Comment The income components of the child support formula (which draw on both the receiving carer’s and the liable parent’s incomes) are based on a parent’s income from a previous year. Because Inland Revenue assesses child support for the current year – that is, before the income a parent will earn is confirmed – it is necessary to use a proxy for what a parent will earn. Using a past year’s income provides a low-cost proxy for a person’s income for the coming year, which has a low compliance burden for parents because Inland Revenue will, in most cases, hold this information and not need to seek it from them. The parent’s actual income in the current year will flow through and be included in a future year’s child support assessment. Using lagged income provides a degree of certainty for parents that the amount they are paying or receiving is less likely to change over the year. If every child support assessment were squared up at the end of the year, there would be no certainty and greater potential to cause over- and under-payments. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Proposal should be retrospective Submission (Anonymous D) The proposed amendment to the definition of “income” should be retrospective (at least for the proposed statute bar period if not right back to 1992). Comment If every child support assessment were amended to take into account both parents’ investment income and move to net income, there would be changes to many child support assessments which could result in over- and under-payments. There would be no certainty for parents. In some cases, the parents will have left the child support scheme. 45 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Income used in assessments Submissions (Andreas Ola, Anonymous A, Anonymous G, John Clarkson, John Dunlop, Joshua Keizer, Liz Kelly, Mason Keats, Patrick Mulligan, Rose Carruthers) Both parents should contribute based on combined monthly income of both parties less a percentage of total monthly household income. Child support assessments should be based on the actual amount incurred by the receiving carer for essential costs. (Andreas Ola) The amount of child support paid should be assessed on the receiving parent’s income and halved. (Anonymous A) The income used for the child support assessment should be based on the basic 40-hour wage and should not include overtime or secondary income. This prevents the new family from being able to get ahead, do repairs to a property or to treat their family. (Anonymous G) This system was based on a 1950’s household, where typically the man went to work, and the woman stays at home with the kids. In 2020 that is no longer the case. Typically, both parents work and are involved with the child. (John Clarkson) If the child support assessment is based on the former partner’s income it should be when they were living together and only increase with inflation and the mother also should have to provide for the child. (John Dunlop) The incremental cost of child support only increases as our income does. I only received half my pay increase this year. (Joshua Keizer) In phone calls Inland Revenue says it is not the new partner on the receiving end’s responsibility to support the children, so why is it the new partners responsibility on the paying parent’s side? Where is the fairness in this? Do not use paying parents’ spouses’ details if you do not consider the receiving parents’ spouses’ income. (Liz Kelly) Child support should be assessed by looking at the situations of each person. The one size fits all approach does not work. (Mason Keats) Income of both parties should be assessed. The father should not be in poverty. I was a child of poverty due to child support. (Patrick Mulligan) If the receiving parent has moved on and has a partner supporting them, their income should be taken into account for times like that. (Rose Carruthers) Comment The issues raised in these submissions are out of scope of the proposals in the Bill. 46 The formula for assessing child support was comprehensively revised in 2013. The changes were intended to achieve a more equitable outcome based on up-to-date costs of raising children, both parents’ income and recognising a greater range of care levels. The formula used to assess child support now takes into account both parents’ income. The formula also takes into account the level of care parents provide for their children, and any other children of their own they might have in their care for whom child support is not paid (such as children from a new relationship). In the case of blended families, the Child Support Act 1991 recognises the obligation that parents have towards their own children and not their new partner’s children. Any new children from the relationship can be accounted for in child support assessments as dependent children. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Cap or fix the amount of child support Submissions (Anonymous C, Anonymous E, Anonymous G, John Clarkson, John Dunlop,) Cap the amount of child support. I have been paying essentially a mortgage every month which has completely stunted my ability to get ahead. (Anonymous C) Being income based, allows one parent to lie about their income. In some cases, it’s the self- employed paying parent lying about their income to get out of paying child support. In our circumstance, it is the self-employed receiving parent lying about her income to receive more in child support. If it were a set amount, there would be no need for being dishonest. (Anonymous E) Child support should be a set amount per child. It does not cost more to raise a child when you get a promotion, get back pay or do overtime. (Anonymous G) That a fixed amount should be set for child support and not based on how much someone earns. How can one child cost $1,000 a month to bring up, yet another on $76 a month! It is an illogical argument for maintaining status quo. (John Clarkson) Child support should have a ceiling. The ceiling should be a more realistic sum like $150 per week and only increase with inflation. (John Dunlop) Comment Taking the income of both parents into account reflects the parents’ relative abilities to contribute financially towards the expenditure for raising their children. It also reflects the likely expenditure on the children were the parents living together. Research has shown that as parents’ incomes increase, the amount spent on children increases. 47 Capping or fixing the amount of child support not only dilutes this principle but it would also be less transparent and add a further layer of complexity to the formula. Further, if child support were a fixed amount, lower income parents might not have the financial capacity to pay the amount. The income tax system requires details of everyone’s income to be provided at the end of a tax year to ensure that income is taxed at the correct rate. If a person has income from which tax has not been deducted at source, they are required to advise Inland Revenue of this income. The child support scheme then uses this income as a basis for assessments. There are penalties for not declaring income to Inland Revenue. If a person considers that the other parent has income that has not been taken into account in the child support assessment, they can apply for an administrative review of the assessment. The changes to the definition of “income” proposed in this Bill will include interest and dividend income in child support assessments and prevent parents from using losses from prior tax years to lower their income for child support purposes. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Child support when calculating taxable income Submissions (Birthright New Zealand, Office of the Children’s Commissioner) A further complication for many care giving parents is that child support is included by Inland Revenue in a person’s annual income, even if there is a track record of that child support not being paid. This results in further financial disadvantage when families should be receiving child support payments (but are not) and find themselves not being entitled to Working for Families tax credits or the in-work tax credit until the end of the financial year. This places them in even more of a financial struggle due to the non-payment of the paying parent. (Birthright New Zealand) Child support received should not be included when calculating taxable income. (Office of the Children’s Commissioner) Comment The matter raised in these submissions is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. Child support is not included as income for income tax purposes. Child support paid and received is taken into account for Working for Families purposes. This is because the wider income definition used for Working for Families reflects the family’s capacity to cover its living costs and expenses. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 48 Issue: Child support abating government assistance Submission (Tamika McCallum) Currently, child support is recognised as income for determining Working for Families or benefit entitlements. It is not income. Child support is to pay for living costs and expenses. Comment The matter raised in this submission is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. Income is a central factor when considering eligibility for government assistance which is intended to provide income support to families and individuals. As child support is money available to a family to cover its living costs and expenses, it is appropriate for child support to be taken into account for the purposes of determining entitlement to these types of assistance. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Recognition of opportunity costs Submissions (Kathleen Lauderdale, National Council of Women of New Zealand) Failing to account for, or accurately assess, the real costs of children’s care, housing and pay foregone in care duties for (usually) mothers impacting on lifetime earnings, contributions to superannuation and lack of access or resources to seek and access equitable contributions in both time and money. I am concerned that the current Act has never been enforced equitably. The extra costs of care of children have consequently disproportionately fallen upon women and deprived children of the equitable support of both parents. A Royal Commission of Enquiry should be held investigating how the costs of care of children have disproportionately fallen on women and deprived children of the equitable support of both parents. (Kathleen Lauderdale) The formula for assessing amounts of child support should take into account the monetary value of unpaid work and opportunity costs of the custodial parent. (National Council of Women of New Zealand) Comment The matter raised in these submissions is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. The purpose of the child support scheme is to ensure that children are financially supported by both their parents even when they are not living together as a family. It is not intended to provide recognition for the opportunity costs associated with caring for children. Taking into account 49 unpaid work and opportunity costs would significantly increase the compliance and administration costs of the scheme. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Receiving carer’s lifestyle Submissions (Anonymous G, Clinton Davis, Kevin Tutauha, Nadja McKellow, Rose Carruthers) If the receiving carer decides not to work, child support should be worked out at 50 percent. If the receiving carer leaves work to have another baby with their new partner, the paying parent’s child support rises to 100 percent. The paying parent should not be paying for circumstances outside their control. The paying parent’s family is penalised because the receiving carer is having a baby. (Anonymous G) The ex has just built a new house, I am paying for her lifestyle. The child support system cripples the paying person. (Clinton Davis) Receiving parents need to try to find work during school hours and try to seek employment opportunities. (Kevin Tutauha) When assessing child support, take into consideration why the receiving parent has a lower income. When it is due to, for example, maternity leave, the amount of child support should not be raised as it is penalising the paying parent. (Nadja McKellow) It is not fair that two parents can have a child, then move on and have more children with a new partner and the paying parent has to pay through the roof for child support because the other parent chooses to stay at home with new children to a new partner instead of working, this creates unfairness for the new children to the paying parent. (Rose Carruthers) Comment The matter raised in these submissions is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. The purpose of the Child Support Act 1991 is to ensure that parents who do not live with, or who share the care of, their children support their children financially. Requiring a receiving carer to work is not within the scope of the Child Support Act 1991. An objective of the Act is that parents with a like capacity to provide financial support for their children should provide like amounts of financial support. To this end, the child support formula considers the incomes of both parents. It is not an objective of the Act to influence a parent’s capacity to provide financial support, but instead only to consider that capacity. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 50 LIVING ALLOWANCE Clause 11, section 35A Issue: Living allowance is inadequate Submissions (Anonymous A, Anonymous E, Anonymous G, Clinton Davis, Greig Giblin, Liz Kelly) Living allowance should be worked out with the liable parent and everything is considered – including, rent, food, power, vehicle expenses and financial commitments. The liable parent must provide evidence of living costs and then child support is assessed rather than using a common formula as every liable parent’s circumstance is different. (Anonymous A) The current living allowance is a set amount of $1,685 per month, regardless of what your income is. If child support is income based, the living allowance should be too. Someone on $30,000 a year will not have the same living costs as someone on $200,000 a year. (Anonymous E) Living allowances should be realistic. The living allowance should include a recognition for paying parents who have to financially support their new spouse and step-children due to illness or redundancy. (Anonymous G) The current living allowance is a joke as look at a median rent, that is over the living allowance, and I am meant to pay and also have a place to have my kids when I can see them. (Clinton Davis) Previously, if you were in a relationship and your partner had children, your living allowance would be adjusted to cover this. The living allowance should cater for liable parents with other children and a partner in the home. (Greig Giblin) The living allowance is unliveable. You cannot live on such a minimal amount there is no space with high child support payments to ever be able to progress in life or live. (Liz Kelly) Comment The matters raised in these submissions are outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. The Child Support Act 1991 upholds a child’s right to be maintained by their parents even if they are not living with them. It also ensures that a child’s right to be maintained by their parents is not affected by a new partner’s children. The formula for child support uses both parents’ income but first deducts a living allowance, any dependent child allowance for children in a parent’s care and any multi-group allowance where a parent is paying or receiving child support for children in other relationships. It also takes into account the care each parent provides for the children and the costs of raising them. The living allowance component of the formula recognises basic living costs for parents, that is, it broadly represents an amount that the parent uses to support themselves and which is therefore not available to contribute towards the cost of raising their child. It is important to note that the amount left after any allowances have been deducted is not the amount of child support paid to the carer. Instead, this is the amount of income which will feed 51 into the child support formula (together with the income of the other parent) to determine the amount of child support payable. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 52 DEPENDENT CHILD ALLOWANCE Clause 12, section 35B Issue: Possible drafting error Submission (Jo Ellen Pethers) The provision is not clear. I wonder if the reference to “dependent child” should in this amendment be “qualifying child”. Comment The use of “dependent child” in this clause is correct as this clause relates to the dependent child allowance. The dependent child allowance takes into account any children in a person’s care other than the children for whom child support is paid (for example, children born in a new relationship). A child for whom child support is paid is referred to as a “qualifying child”. If the provision referred to a “qualifying child” instead of a “dependent child”, the allowance would be based on any qualifying children in a person’s care, and so would not function correctly. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Cost of children Submissions (Anonymous C, Anonymous D, Anonymous G, Kevin Tutauha) Details on what is in the basket and how is it calculated should be provided. It should be done on the marginal costs of raising a child (the base costs of a single person should be deducted from costs of a single parent with one child). That is, only the costs of the child, not the costs of the other parent. There is a given amount of alimony worked into child support after a given point. (Anonymous C) What makes up the child expenditure costs is unclear. (Anonymous D) The basket of goods used for calculating child expenditure needs to be reviewed and needs to be more realistic. (Anonymous G) Payments need to be fair and reasonable. Currently I pay $800 a month and this amount keeps climbing year after year. I do not spend $800 on my child who lives with me. The amount of child support assessed seems disproportionate. (Kevin Tutauha) 53 Comment The matter raised in these submissions is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. The formula for calculating child support payments is based on a number of factors. One of the factors is the amount of money that families, on average, spend on their children. The child support formula was updated in 2013 to more accurately reflect the costs of raising a child. This followed research into the costs of raising children. 8 The research used statistical information from the Household Economic Survey (HES) on amounts that households spend on living costs. The research estimated what parents spend on raising their children at different levels of household income by looking at the additional expenditure that households with children incur compared to households with an equivalent living standard but without children. The items that make up the basket of goods being compared were housing costs, energy consumption, food, clothing and footwear, household goods and services, childcare, health, transport, leisure, personal care and possibly education. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Children of paying parent and new spouse should be included Submission (Anonymous G) The children of the paying parent and their new spouse should be included in the child support assessment. The same child expenditure amounts should be applied to these children. Comment The matter raised in this submission is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. The Child Support Act 1991 upholds a child’s right to be maintained by their parents even if they are not living with them. It also ensures that a child’s right to be maintained by their parents is not affected by a new partner’s children. This is because a new partner’s children are supported by their own parents. The formula does recognise other dependent children that each of the parents may have in their care, by way of the dependent child allowance. The dependent child allowance takes into account any children in a person’s care other than the children for whom child support is paid, for example, children born in a new relationship. 8 Costs of raising children, Iris Claus, Paul Kilford, Geoff Leggett and Xin Wang (June 2009), available at https://www.nzae.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Costs\_of\_raising\_children\_NZAE\_paper\_v2.pdf 54 Recommendation That the submission be declined. 55 ESTIMATIONS Clause 16, section 44 Issue: Section 40AA (Interpretation for purposes of sections 40 to 45) Submission (Jo Ellen Pethers) I have no objections to an alteration of notification periods. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: 15 percent threshold for estimations Submission (Anonymous D) The 15 percent estimation threshold should be entirely removed (now that Inland Revenue systems are improved) or at least reduced, so that potential overpayment amounts are not so unreasonable and unfair. Comment In order to be able to submit an estimate of income, a person needs to expect to experience a drop in income of 15 percent or more. By estimating, the person is assessed for the ongoing period on what they expect to earn in the rest of the child support year. At the end of the child support year, a person’s estimated income is reconciled with their actual earnings to ensure they have paid the correct amount of child support. This can result in under- or overpayments if a person’s estimated income is different to their actual income. If a parent believes their estimate is no longer accurate, they are able to revoke the estimate or submit a new one. The 15 percent threshold exists to prevent unnecessary estimations. Estimations create uncertainty for the other parent because their child support will be reassessed based on a change on the other side of the assessment, which they may have been unaware of. As such, it is desirable to ensure that individuals are only able to estimate in situations where there is genuine need. If the threshold did not exist, it would increase the potential for the estimating parent to under- or overpay their child support, because they would be able to submit an estimate even if their income were not likely to change much. If this estimate were significantly lower than their estimated income, this would be reconciled when the assessment is squared up, resulting in further amounts to pay. 56 Because child support is based on a past year’s income, if a parent is unable to submit an estimate because their income is within 15% of the past year’s income they have been assessed on, the current year’s income will be taken into account in a future year. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Aligning back-dating estimations and grace period timeframes Submission (Anonymous D) The timeframe proposed in relation to the start-date of an estimate should be aligned with the 60- day period of the proposed “grace period”. Comment Inland Revenue’s standard processing timeframe for child support applications is ten working days. Once an application has been processed, an attempt will be made to contact the relevant parties, usually on the same day. A purpose of this call is to educate people new to the scheme, including on how estimations work. This means that within ten working days of Inland Revenue receiving a child support application, if it is accepted, an attempt to contact the person should have been made. Therefore, for a person new to the scheme who is able to estimate, the 28-day timeframe is adequate. The 28-day timeframe will apply from initial notification. The 28-day timeframe is intended to help ensure that child support is assessed correctly from the start and reflects that contact attempts will have been made soon after the application is processed. Further, it is consistent with other timeframes to notify Inland Revenue of changes in details on which the assessment is based. Extending the timeframe for estimating income when child support is first assessed to 60 days would risk undermining certainty in the amount of child support assessed. If child support has been paid when the estimation is given, it could result in the receiving carer being put into debt. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: COVID-19 and estimations Submission (National Beneficiary Advisory Consultation Group) We recommend to the Committee that it reconsiders the “estimation square up” provisions to make sure it is fit for purpose in the light of changed circumstances. 57 Comment If a parent expects to earn less than 85 percent of the income they have been assessed on, they can estimate their income based on what they expect to earn in the remainder of the year and have their child support liability reassessed. When a customer estimates, their child support obligation is squared up at the end of the year. That is, their estimate is compared to the actual income earned in the period to ensure their child support obligation is not under- or over-paid. The estimation provisions recognise that when a person’s income reduces by a significant amount, regardless of the reason for the reduction, this will have an effect on their capacity to financially support their children. Although more people may have income reductions and fluctuations due to COVID-19, the existing provisions cater for this. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Definition of “election period” for the purposes of backdated estimations Submission (Matter raised by officials) The current definition of “election period” as per clause 14(1) of the Bill does not result in the correct outcome for backdated estimations. This is because the wording of clause 14(1)(c) which states in relation to backdated estimations that the election period: “... starts on the first day of the month in which the notice is given...”. A backdated estimation relates to an earlier period than the month in which it is given. Therefore, if the relevant election period were to begin in the month in which the estimation is given (as currently drafted), it would begin later than the estimation itself. 58 Example 4 On 1 January, Calliope applies for child support naming Oeagrus as the father of Orpheus. Calliope needs to establish paternity, and so also applies for a paternity order on 1 January which is granted on 1 April. This is supplied to Inland Revenue, which subsequently accepts the application from the original application date (1 January). Oeagrus is identified as the liable parent and notified of his liability on 2 April. Not only was Oeagrus’ income for the year relating to the period 1 January – 31 March (year 1 liability) less than 85% of the income on which he was assessed, he also expects to earn less than 85% of the income on which he has been assessed in child support year beginning 1 April (year 2 liability). Under the proposal, he would now have 28 days to apply for a backdated estimation for the period 1 January – 31 March (year 1 liability); and until the end of April to estimate for the child support year beginning 1 April (year 2 liability). Oeagrus submits his estimations in April. In figure 4, the red and blue lines show the periods which each estimation is intended to cover. However, because the current wording states that a backdated estimation is effective “from the first day of the month in which notice is given and ends on the last day of that child support year”, Oeagrus’ backdated estimation is effective not from 1 January as intended. Instead, as the backdated estimation was given in the month of April, it begins on 1 April (the green line in figure 4). Figure 4: Periods for which election periods apply (intended election period compared to outcome per current clause 14(1)) Officials consider that a backdated estimation given under the new section 40(8) should begin on the first day of the month in which the assessment begins. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 59 Issue: Definition of “year-to-date income” Clause Submission (Matter raised by officials) In relation to a backdated estimation made under section 40(8), the current definition of “year-to- date” income as per clause 14(3) of the Bill does not specify the correct period from which year- to-date income should be derived. As currently drafted, when an election is made which is to be backdated to a previous year, the beginning of the year-to-date period would be tied to the month in which the election is given. As such, it would begin in the current year, and not the previous year to which the estimation is to be backdated. Further, it would end with the end of the month immediately preceding the month in which the election were given – that is, the year-to-date period would end on the last day of the month before the month in which it begins. Example 5 Arjun and Gita have a daughter together, Siva. Gita provides full time care for Siva. On 1 January, Gita applies for child support naming Arjun as the other parent. Gita needs to establish paternity, and so also applies for a paternity order on 1 January which is granted on 1 May. This is supplied to Inland Revenue, which subsequently accepts the application from the original application date (1 January). Arjun is identified as the liable parent and notified of his liability on 2 May. Not only was Arjun’s income for the period 1 January – 31 March less than 85% of the income on which he was assessed, he also expects to earn less than 85% of the income on which he has been assessed in child support year beginning 1 April. Under the proposal, he would have 28 days to apply for a backdated estimation for the period 1 January – 31 March, and for the child support year beginning 1 April. Arjun submits his estimation on 2 May. Arjun’s estimation is composed of two parts: year-to-date income, which should cover the period 1 April – 31 December; and his estimated income for the period 1 January – 31 March. However, per the current clause 14(3) of the Bill, the year-to-date income is not derived from the period 1 April – 31 December. Instead, the period ends on the last day of the month immediately preceding the month in which the election is given (31 April), and begins on the first day of the child support year (1 April). This is shown in figure 5. Figure 5: Year-to-date income when backdating an estimation to a previous child support year (intended year-to-date period compared to outcome per clause 14(3)) For estimations which are backdated within the current year, the result is that the year-to-date period begins in the correct year but extends over the beginning of the period being estimated for and ends in the month in which the estimation is given. 60 Example 6 Lauri and Rosa have a daughter together, Saara, but do not live together. Lauri provides full time care for Saara. On 21 June, Lauri applies for child support naming Rosa as the other parent. The application is accepted, and Rosa is identified as the liable parent. Rosa is notified of her liability on 5 July. Rosa believes that her earnings across the child support year will be less than 85% of the income that she has been assessed on. Under the proposal, she would have 28 days from 5 July to submit an estimation which will be backdated to the start of her liability on 21 June. Rosa submits this estimation on 1 August. Rosa’s estimation is made up of the income she has already earned through the year (year-to-date income), and what she expects to earn for the rest of the year (that is, what she expects to earn in the election period). The figure below shows the period from which year-to-date income is intended to be derived, and the period which the election period is intended to span. It also shows the period from which year-to-date income would be derived per the current clause 14(3). Figure 6: Year-to-date income when backdating an estimation within a child support year (intended year-to-date period compared to outcome per current clause 14(3)) Officials consider that the definition of year-to-date income should be tied to the month in which the election period begins. This would mean that the year-to-date period would end on the last day of the month immediately preceding the month in which the election period would begin and would begin on the first day of that child support year, as originally intended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 61 CIRCUMSTANCES AT TIME OF ASSESSMENT Clause 18, new section 81A Issue: Support for proposal Submission (Jo Ellen Pethers) I have no objection to the inclusion of the section. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Timeframe for advising of existing circumstances Submissions (Anonymous D, New Zealand Law Society) The timeframe for advising of circumstances when child support is first assessed should be aligned with the grace period. (Anonymous D) It may be reasonable to extend the limited exceptions from sections 82(2)(a)(i) and (ii) to new section 81A, as it is not apparent why those exceptions should not apply. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment The new section 81A, which establishes a timeframe for advising of circumstances when child support is first assessed, has a different policy intent to the proposed grace period, and so each amendment has a different timeframe. Currently, there is no timeframe for advising of circumstances which exist when child support is first assessed. This means that in these situations the assessment is considered incorrect and could be amended from the start of the assessment, which can create overpayments and uncertainty for receiving carers. The new section 81A is intended to address this and encourage timeliness in advising of circumstances. In contrast, the proposed grace period is intended to enable Inland Revenue to work with newly liable parents to help them understand how to comply with their obligation and get it right from the start. Sections 82(2) of the Child Support Act 1991 provides for determining whether Inland Revenue should action a change of circumstances from the date on which it occurred or the date on which Inland Revenue was notified of the change. The provisions which the New Zealand Law Society suggest should be included in the new section 81A function so that if a parent notifies Inland Revenue of a change over 28 days after it happened, the change will only be backdated from the date on which it occurred if the effect is to increase their own liability or entitlement. This ensures that the other parent will not have debt from an overpaid entitlement or new liability amounts to pay because of the delay in notification. In this way, parents cannot benefit from delaying 62 notification of changes in circumstance to Inland Revenue and are incentivised to act in a timely manner. Officials consider that the exceptions from sections 82(2)(a)(i) and (ii) should apply to new section 81A. Recommendation That the recommendation that the exceptions from sections 82(2)(a)(i) and (ii) apply to new section 81A be accepted. 63 TIME BAR Clause 20, new section 87A Issue: Support for proposal Submission (Jo Ellen Pethers) I have no opposition to the proposed time bar. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Alignment of time bar with other Inland Revenue Acts Submission (Anonymous D) In general, the time bar should be aligned to be consistent with other Inland Revenue Acts. Comment The proposal to introduce a time bar for reassessment of child support is broadly aligned with the time bar that exists for income tax purposes which restricts reassessments to four years from the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer provided their income tax return. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Time bar limitations Submissions (Kathleen Lauderdale, Julie MacClure, National Council of Women of New Zealand, Peter Read) I would oppose any limitations to time frames to address the inequities and abuses the inequitable administration of the original Act has caused. (Kathleen Lauderdale) The time bar should not proceed because once in effect it would void recourse when income has not been disclosed to Inland Revenue or a court order is made. (Julie MacClure) 64 The Bill should explicitly provide for an exception from the four-year rule where a child acquires or is diagnosed with a long-term illness or disability. (National Council of Women of New Zealand) The time bar for reassessments should be limited to one year where the change would reduce the amount payable. The reason being that these cause overpayments to receiving carers. This is unfair as the receiving carer expects certainty in payments and is entitled to rely on the entitlements calculated by Inland Revenue. (Peter Read) Comment The current unrestricted timeframe for reassessments creates uncertainty for liable parents and receiving carers and possibly debt as a result of increased assessments (for liable parents) or overpayments (to receiving carers) which then needs to be repaid. Often the reassessment results in no change to the child support payment obligation but creates a notification to all parties that a reassessment has occurred, which can cause confusion and stress. In some cases, the liable parent and receiving carer have exited the child support scheme and the reassessment brings them back in. In practice, most reassessments to a past year occur within four years of that child support year ending. Less than 2 percent of reassessments occur more than four years after the end of the child support year. A four-year time bar, applying from the end of the relevant child support year would allow for 98 percent of current reassessments to occur. The proposal includes specific exceptions to allow reassessments outside the four-year time frame to balance equity concerns and to maintain the integrity of the child support scheme. For example, a reassessment could occur at any time if information provided by a person in the child support assessment is fraudulent or wilfully misleading or if information is missing, or a court order is received that applies to an earlier period. There is no exception in this proposal for a time bar for cases when a child acquires or is diagnosed with a long-term illness or disability. In this situation a carer can apply for an administrative review of the child support assessment. There is a specific ground in the administrative review provisions that covers the special needs of a child. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Children applying for child support Submission (Tremayne Thompson) When a carer has not received child support, a child should be able to make a claim for past periods. Comment This issue is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. 65 The purpose of the child support scheme is to recognise the costs incurred by carers in looking after a child. When a child is able to support themselves independently, it is not the purpose of the child support scheme to provide support for previous periods when child support was not received. Officials note that in situations where the child does not live with a carer other forms of support are available to the child, such as the Youth Payment which supports young people aged 16 or 17 who cannot live with their parents or guardian and are not supported by them or anyone else. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 66 EXEMPTIONS Clauses 22 to 33, sections 89A to 89Z Issue: Support for amendment Submission (Jo Ellen Pethers) I have no objection to these amendments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Proposed exemption for people suffering from long-term illness or injury is not child-centric Submission (Nikita Leeks) Clause 27 (which proposes an exemption for people suffering from long term illness or injury) should be removed due to the strong emphasis this clause places on the wellbeing of liable parents rather than the associated child. Comment The Bill proposes amendments to the hospital patient and prisoner exemptions so that the existing exemptions would be extended to liable parents who are overseas. The Bill also proposes a new exemption be introduced for people who have a long-term illness or injury who are unable to work, with similar income criteria to the existing exemptions. Temporary exemptions from payment of child support for hospital patients and long-term prisoners exist to provide relief from payment on the grounds that a person has extremely limited income (and no capacity to earn an income) for a period of time. One of the objectives of the Child Support Act 1991 is that the level of financial support to be provided by parents for their children be determined according to their relative capacity to provide financial support. The exemptions support this by recognising that, in some limited circumstances, people have no capacity to pay. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 67 ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEWS Clauses 34 and 35, sections 96BA and 96D Issue: Support for amendments Submission (Jo Ellen Pethers) I have no objection to the amendments to sections 96BA (time period for certain applications that are time barred) to 96D (offsetting determination). Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Exchange of information during an administrative review Submission (Anonymous A) Personal financial income statements should not be supplied to the other parent. This is a breach of privacy especially in circumstances of domestic violence. Comment The matter raised in this submission is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. An administrative review is a means of having a child assessment reviewed if a parent has a cost or circumstance which is not taken into account by the standard formula. Inland Revenue manages the administrative review process, but the actual review is carried out by a Review Officer who is an independent person, usually a lawyer, contracted to Inland Revenue to carry out hearings. Part of the administrative review process is to exchange the information provided by the parties. This is so that both parties know what matters the other person intends to raise and can prepare for the hearing. Under the Child Support Act 1991, only information that is provided to Inland Revenue in the course of proceedings is shared. A relevant person is not entitled to receive any other information in Inland Revenue’s possession. Personal information such as address or contact details, or bank account details, are not shared. As part of the wider child support process, carers and liable parents are able to request that their name be omitted to protect the safety of a parent, carer or child. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 68 Issue: Retrospective administrative reviews decisions Submission (Anonymous D) There appears to be a tendency for administrative review decisions to only be granted for prospective periods. It is unfair that relief afforded through administrative reviews is not applied to the full, relevant, period as a liable parent therefore has no means of recovering excessive overpayments arising from assessments that have not yet been subject to proper rigour. Comment The matter raised in this submission is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. Administrative reviews are administered by Inland Revenue, but the review itself is undertaken by a Review Officer, who is an independent person, usually a lawyer, contracted to Inland Revenue to carry out hearings. Review Officers will generally only look to recommend departures for a current period. This approach is based in the precedent set by the High Court decision of Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Aspinall. Departures can be made for retrospective periods if considered just and equitable to do so after considering the facts of the case. For instance, the High Court decision in IPD v KME & Anor was that jurisdiction to make a departure order retrospective exists, but whether or not that discretion is exercised will depend upon an assessment of all the facts and circumstances (which may be infinitely different) so as to ultimately determine whether it is just and equitable and otherwise proper to make such order. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Administrative reviews should be evaluated Submission (Anonymous G) Administrative reviews need a complete overhaul. They are currently dishonest, biased and rude. Comment The matter raised in this submission is outside the scope of the Bill. Administrative reviews are undertaken by a Review Officer, who is an independent person, usually a lawyer, contracted to Inland Revenue to carry out hearings. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 69 Issue: Costs of access to children and travel cost Submissions (Chris Renau, Greig Giblin Mason Keats, Liz Boyd) I have been treated unfairly by Inland Revenue, mainly a decision to deny costs in relation to travel. (Chris Renau) Child support is money that could have been used to fund a lawyer so that I could see my children (which I’ve only been able to see once in four years). There should be a new clause for child support reviews to cover legal expenses when trying to get a fair custody arrangement so one can see their children. (Greig Giblin) I have taken part in many administrative reviews and I am told time and time again that “I just pay for the essentials” and that legal representation is a luxury item. (Mason Keats) Parents that have been alienated often run up lawyer bills into the thousands or tens of thousands of dollars just to see their children. Access to children incurs many costs, in my personal case, the children have been moved four hours away, so to see them it is very expensive. (Liz Boyd) Comment The matter raised in these submissions is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. An application for an administrative review can be made under the ground that a parent’s contact costs are more than 5 percent of the income they are assessed on. Contact costs could include the cost of legal fees for maintaining contact with a child, or travel costs. The reason for the 5 percent de minimis threshold is to provide a benchmark from which to determine if a contact cost is unusually high and consideration ought to be given to factoring it into the child support assessment. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Support for proposed amendment – removal of offsetting administrative review ground Submission (Jo Ellen Pethers) I support the repeal of sections 105(2)(e) and 106B. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 70 JURISDICTION OF COURTS Sections 97 to 127 Issue: Court proceedings Submissions (John Barr, John Clarkson) You could consider child support not being required to be paid whilst court proceedings are ongoing. This would lessen the chance of one parent taking the other to court on their whim. If the parents want to take it to court they should both need to pay or both not need to pay. This is to stop abuse of being able to get legal aid when the other parent cannot and cannot afford a lawyer and being beaten over the head with court again and again. (John Barr) That lawyers are not allowed to be used by either party or Inland Revenue in disputes. This creates an instant disadvantage to the paying parents, does not resolve issues and only adds further costs. (John Clarkson) Comment The matter raised in these submissions is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 71 URGENT MAINTENANCE ORDERS Clauses 38, 39 and 45, sections 116 and 137(a) Issue: Oppose repeal of urgent maintenance orders Submission (Jo Ellen Pethers) I oppose the removal of urgent maintenance orders. This is because an application to the Court will not necessarily result in the approval of the order but if the Family Court decides the child is in urgent need of financial assistance then with the welfare of the child in consideration, this should be granted. Comment The Child Support Act 1991 contains a provision for a person to apply to the courts for an urgent maintenance order if they have made an application for child support to Inland Revenue, but the child support application has not been processed. It is believed the provision was included in the Child Support Act 1991 to cover the period of transition when child support moved to Inland Revenue in 1992 in case there were any unforeseen circumstances that could mean Inland Revenue was unable to raise an assessment. An order under this provision has never been granted because Inland Revenue can assess child support in a more timely manner than obtaining a decision from a court. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Oppose the repeal of rules setting out order payments are applied Submission (Jo Ellen Pethers) I strongly oppose the removal of section 137(a) which sets out the order in which payments are applied as I believe it is important that guidance and structure is applied when allocating money payable to an account. Comment Section 137 sets out the order in which payments are applied by Inland Revenue. Under section 137(a) a payment is first allocated to any urgent financial assistance payable under an urgent maintenance order. The Bill proposes that the provision which allows a person to apply to the Family Court for an urgent maintenance order be repealed. The repeal of section 137(a) is a consequential amendment following the repeal of the urgent maintenance order provision. 72 Recommendation That the submission be declined. 73 AUTOMATIC DEDUCTIONS Clause 41, section 129A Issue: Support for proposal Submissions (Jo Ellen Pethers, Office of the Privacy Commissioner) I am not opposed to this proposed change. (Jo Ellen Pethers) My comments on the Bill relate only to clause 41 and I do not recommend any changes. I consider the Bill’s provision for compulsory automatic deduction of child support payments by newly liable parents is justified and includes a mechanism that can protect individual privacy. (Office of the Privacy Commissioner) Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Compliance costs Submission (Anonymous D) Every liable parent should be equally entitled to maintain their privacy and to not be subject to Inland Revenue sharing their personal circumstances with any of their employers. The proposed provision should not proceed. The current provisions are entirely sufficient and additional compliance costs should not be imposed on employers by forcing them to make child support deductions except as currently required. Compulsory deductions for newly liable parents would also be inconsistent with Inland Revenue’s own research as outlined in the discussion in the Commentary on the Bill on the proposed grace period. Comment Automatic deductions would assist liable parents first entering the scheme by helping them get their payments right from the start and avoid them going into debt. Currently, compliance for new liable parents in the first few months is very low – less than a third pay on time. Additional compliance burden on employers because of this amendment would be attenuated because deductions by employers become compulsory once a liable parent defaults on their payment, and so in many cases employers already make deductions. Additionally, a person can choose employer deductions as their payment method. The discretion to allow payment by another method would provide flexibility to consider other options for payment when source deduction is not appropriate for a person, including for privacy reasons. 74 Before the introduction of the Bill, officials consulted with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) on the proposal for compulsory payment of child support by automatic deduction for newly liable parents. It was noted that Inland Revenue would have a discretion to allow another payment method in cases when automatic deductions would be inappropriate, including for privacy reasons. OPC advised that they supported the proposal for automatic deductions for newly liable parents as a measure consistent with applying good privacy values. They also suggested that it would be prudent to support operational practice of contacting the liable parent with a suitable provision in the Bill. Before submitting on the Bill, OPC asked officials whether the operational practice of contacting the liable parent to discuss the payment of child support, before the automatic deduction takes effect, should be reflected in the Bill. Inland Revenue provided OPC with information on the operational practice, confirming that Inland Revenue would attempt to contact the newly liable parent by phone before issuing the deduction notice to a liable parent’s employer; and that if contact is made, the liable parent could ask Inland Revenue to use its discretion to pay by a different method. Inland Revenue confirmed that the operational practice of contacting the person to discuss the payment of child support, before the automatic deduction requirement takes effect, was not reflected in the Bill. The Privacy Commissioner then submitted to the Committee on the Bill about the proposal for compulsory automatic deductions for newly liable parents. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 75 PENALTIES AND WRITE-OFFS Clauses 42 to 44, Supplementary Order Paper, sections 134 to 135JA Issue: Support for proposal – changes to penalty rules Submission (Nikita Leeks) The submitter supports clause 42 and agrees that the use of enforcement tools provokes the required financial payments from liable parents in support of the wellbeing of the child. The submitter supports clause 43 and agrees that a grace period complements the need to limit strain within the family unit and removes unnecessary enforcement actions within the beginning of the process. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Incorporate the Supplementary Order Paper into the Bill Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Supplementary Order Paper contains proposals to repeal child support incremental penalties and simplify the penalty write-off rules. Officials consider that these proposed amendments should be incorporated into the Bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Existing penalties should not be written off Submission (Birthright New Zealand) The proposal to wipe pre-2021 penalty debt without consideration of the impact of the unpaid child support on the intended recipients is not the right strategy. There is an opportunity for Inland Revenue to not only improve the efficiency and effectiveness with the administration of child support but to also shift the culture of the perception and attitudes around child support with the paying parents and debtors. 76 Comment The Bill and Supplementary Order Paper do not propose that pre-2021 penalties be written off when child support moves to the new technology platform START. To ensure parents who are charged penalties on or before 31 March 2021 are not worse off under the new rules, the Supplementary Order Paper proposes that a “fair and reasonable” penalty write- off provision be retained that would only be used to write-off penalties charged on or before 31 March 2021. Inland Revenue would use this provision when something has occurred that, had the current legislation still existed, would have meant that the penalty would have been written off, for example, the person had entered into and complied with a payment arrangement. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Debt collection practice Submission (Birthright New Zealand) Debtors should be categorised based on the nature of the debt, level and attempts made to address the child support debt. For example, debtors could be grouped based on their compliance history and different rules applied. Comment The matters raised in this submission relate to Inland Revenue’s debt practices and are outside the scope of this Bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Penalties or interest paid to receiving carers Submission (Birthright New Zealand) Rather than writing off penalties, we recommend that any penalties which are collected should be passed on to the receiving carer who has incurred the impact of the non-payment and the opportunity cost of using their own finances to meet the interim shortfall. Alternatively, use-of-money interest could be charged and this passed on to receiving carers. 77 Comment Penalties are used as a tool to enable Inland Revenue to collect a receiving carer’s full entitlement. Historically, penalty write-off has been used as an incentive to encourage non-compliant liable parents to pay. If penalties were passed on to receiving carers, the problem would arise that should Inland Revenue write off an amount of child support debt to encourage a liable parent to be compliant, the receiving carer would lose out as they would no longer receive the written off penalties. Conversely, if the penalties were not written off to ensure that the full amount were passed on to the receiving carer, it would remove a key tool for Inland Revenue to encourage liable parents to meet their obligation to support their children financially. Ultimately, it is not clear that the approach of passing on penalties to receiving carers would improve compliance. There are a variety of reasons why a parent might fail to meet their child support obligation. For example, a newly liable parent might not have a full understanding of how to meet their child support obligation, or an individual’s employer might fail to deduct the correct amount of child support. In these cases, rules allowing penalties to be written off provide Inland Revenue more flexibility in collecting a receiving carer’s entitlement. Inland Revenue has finite resources to dedicate to collection. Passing on penalties would create an obligation to collect them on the receiving carer’s behalf and would not allow Inland Revenue to prioritise collecting assessed child support. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Consistency of administrative regimes across Inland Revenue Acts Submission (Anonymous D) The Child Support Act 1991 is an Inland Revenue Act administered by Inland Revenue. Administrative regimes, such as for the imposition of penalties, should be aligned across all Inland Revenue Acts to aid consistency and understanding. Comment When appropriate, similar rules across the Inland Revenue Acts are aligned. This Bill contains proposals that align, or better align, definitions with similar rules in the Working for Families legalisation, for example, the amendment in clause 5(1) which aligns the minimum age a child can be considered independent. However, in some cases it is not possible to align the rules. In the case of child support and penalties, often the debt is owed to the receiving carer rather than the Crown (as is the case with tax and student loans). In addition, child support is payable each month. There are proposals in this Bill aimed at getting things right from the start and engaging more quickly with parents when there is non-compliance. Therefore, imposing penalties and interest in line with the rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994 would not be appropriate. 78 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Greater compliance tools Submissions (Anonymous G, Estella Carmichael, Jasmine Bell, Nikita Leeks, Sarah McKenzie) Perjury and fraud should be acted on. (Anonymous G) That child support is enforced with harsher penalties for unpaid child support. (Estella Carmichael) Make compulsory withdrawals from the liable parent’s wages or bank account when it is due. (Jasmine Bell) With the financial wellbeing of the child as the primary subject, it is therefore recommended that this section is amended to ensure that all measures are available for the enforcement of financial responsibility in support of the child within a family unit. (Nikita Leeks) Paying parents returning to New Zealand they should be arrested at the border when owing over $10,000 and have to pay the full amount before leaving the country. When a paying parent receives an inheritance, Inland Revenue should deduct overdue child support. (Sarah McKenzie) Comment The child support scheme is intended to collect child support that has been assessed and pass it on to the receiving carer. It is in the best interests of the child that these payments are made in full and on time. Inland Revenue helps parents to pay child support on time by contacting them early, talking to them when they are first assessed and sending a reminder text for their first due date. If a parent falls into debt, early intervention is a priority. Inland Revenue will try to contact the parent as soon as possible after their payment is missed. Regular repayments will be set up with parents who cannot pay the full amount. A number of provisions in the Bill are aimed at ensuring that liable parents get things right from the start, for example, automatic deductions and the grace period. Initial penalties will continue to be applied as they are important for compliance. However, incremental penalties compound and create further debt for liable parents, which can lead to disengagement with the scheme and spiralling debt. 9 Inland Revenue has a suite of tools to collect overdue child support, including: 9 Research undertaken by Inland Revenue shows that customers feel that the current penalty rules are overly punitive and complex. 79 • enforced deductions from New Zealand sourced employment income • enforced deductions from New Zealand bank accounts • legal action, for example a charging order over property • use of overseas debt collectors or Government agencies to locate or collect debt in Australia • information matching with Department of Internal Affairs upon renewal of New Zealand passport to obtain contact information • Customs match informing of border crossings for certain debtors, and • arrest at the border. Inland Revenue does not receive information about inheritances. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Grace period Submission (Tamika McCallum) The 60-day grace period without penalty should be allowed only on one instance. Comment The grace period is one of several proposals in the Bill that are aimed at people new to the scheme and at “getting it right from the start”. It provides an opportunity for educating parents and gives them time to adjust to making regular payments. Inland Revenue considers that a more positive early experience with the child support scheme results in increased compliance. The provision would apply whenever someone is new or re-joining the scheme. This means a person could qualify for a grace period more than once. There may be a long period of time between a person being a liable parent and there may also have significant changes to the child support scheme since the last time they were a liable parent. Allowing the grace period each time a person returns to the scheme better supports the policy intent of helping people to “get it right from the start”. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 80 Issue: Government guarantee of child support Submission (Tamika McCallum) Child support should be paid in advance by Inland Revenue and then recouped, so that late payments by liable persons of child support do not affect the receiving carer or child. Comment The matter raised in this submission is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Transitional provision to cover the period between the repeal of section 135GB and enactment of grace period Submission (Matter raised by officials) The current section 135GB provides that if a liable parent falls into debt and enters into a payment arrange within the first three months of their liability, the initial penalties relating to this debt qualify to be written off. The proposed grace period will serve a broadly similar function as newly liable parents would not be penalised for the first three months of their liability. It is proposed that section 135GB be repealed from 1 April 2021. With the delay of the child support Business Transformation changes, the grace period is now intended to apply from later this year. This means there would be a period during which neither provision would apply. As a result, customers who fall into debt when they are first assessed and come to a payment arrangement with Inland Revenue in a timely fashion would not be able to have their penalties written off. Officials consider that the inability to write off penalties is contrary to the policy intent for Inland Revenue to work with newly liable parents to help them get it right from the start. Officials recommend that a transitional provision be included in the Bill, until the grace period comes into effect, which would allow for the write-off of penalties in the first three months of a person’s liability, provided that they enter into, and complied substantially or fully with, a payment arrangement within that time. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 81 Issue: Provision to write-off penalties when it would be an inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources to collect the penalty Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Bill was to include a penalty write-off ground in the Supplementary Order Paper that would allow for write-off when it would be an inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources to collect the penalty. However, the provision was mistakenly omitted from the Supplementary Order Paper. Officials have since reconsidered the scope of the write-off provision. Many of the proposals in the Bill are aimed at improving compliance and “getting things right from the start”. These include: • automatic deductions of child support from salary and wages • introducing a grace period, which will give Inland Revenue time to explain the rules and expectations to parents, and • moving the second part of the initial penalty to give Inland Revenue the opportunity to seek payment and explain the consequences of not paying. Additionally, the Supplementary Order Paper proposes that incremental penalties be repealed. These proposals should improve compliance. Officials consider that fewer parents will be penalised and that, when they are penalised, the penalty should be paid to demonstrate that there is a consequence for non-compliance. The other write-off grounds deal with cases when the parent is not culpable. As such, we consider that a broad provision to write off penalties when it would be an inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources is not consistent with the new approach to debt and penalties. Currently, the Child Support Act 1991 allows child support that is owed to the Crown to be written off if recovering the debt would result in serious hardship for the person or be an inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources. When these amounts are written off, any penalties associated with that amount can also be written off. Officials recommend that a provision be included in the Bill allowing for penalties to be written off when it would be an inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources to collect the penalty, when the penalties relate to child support owed to the Crown which has been written off for the same reason. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 82 Issue: Redundant amendment to correct cross-reference in the definition of “relevant payments” Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Bill contains a proposal to amend a cross-reference in the definition of “relevant payments” in section 135JA(1) of the Child Support Act 1991. The definition currently refers to a now repealed section of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for the definition of “earnings related compensation”. However, Supplementary Order Paper No 538 repeals section 135JA(1) from 1 April 2021. This means that the amendment to the definition of “relevant payments” will have no effect. Officials consider that the amendment to the definition of “relevant payments” should be removed from the Bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 83 OFFSETTING Clause 46, section 152B Issue: Oppose amendment Submission (Jo Ellen Pethers) I strongly oppose an amendment that would allow Inland Revenue to offset child support amounts from the past that should already be payable. If an entitlement is due to a parent or carer in respect of a qualifying child under a formula assessment and changes occur, the amount of liability should be made payable before an assessment can be offset. Offsetting removes the liability from a time a child has been cared for and financial commitments for that time have potentially been made. An amendment such as that suggested could lead to potential conflict and upset. Comment Offsetting reduces administrative complexity in situations when both parents are liable to pay each other child support by offsetting one amount against an equal portion of the other amount. Offsetting results in no change to the amount of child support assessed for either parent. Example 7 Dante and Beatrice have a child together, Virgil, but do not live together. Virgil used to live with Beatrice but has recently begun to live with Dante. Now that Dante cares for Virgil, Beatrice is liable to pay $120 of child support per month. Dante owes $1,000 of child support arrears from the period when Beatrice cared for Virgil, which he pays in monthly instalments of $100. Under the proposed amendment, Inland Revenue would offset Dante’s entitlement of $120 per month by the $100 of arrears payments he makes monthly. The effect of this would be that Dante would not have to make any payments, and Beatrice would only have to pay $20. Neither parent would be materially affected by this offsetting but would end up in an identical financial position as they would if offsetting were not in place. However, the complexity of administering the child support arrangement would be reduced by eliminating one transaction. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: New due date when reversal of offsetting results in new amounts to pay Submission (Matter raised by officials) When two persons are each liable to pay the other an amount of child support, the Child Support Act 1991 provides for Inland Revenue to offset one liability against the other. The person with the higher liability pays the difference. 84 In some cases, offsetting can reverse, resulting in new amounts of child support to pay. For example, if a person were found to have been a social security beneficiary during a period in which their liability was offset against their entitlement, because they were not entitled to receive that child support during the period, offsetting would be reversed. If offsetting reverses due to a reassessment of child support, the Child Support Act 1991 provides for a new due date for payment within 30 days to be set. However, when offsetting reverses and it is not due to a reassessment (such as in the example above), there is no provision for a new due date to be set. As such, the additional amount would become due on the date that it would have been payable if the offsetting had not occurred. This means that the person is immediately placed into debt. Officials consider that when offsetting reverses and results in an additional amount to pay, and the reversal is not due to a reassessment, a person should have 30 days in which to pay the new amount from the date notice of the amount is issued to them. This timeframe aligns with other instances when a new due date for payment is set for new amounts of child support. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 85 RESIDENCE Clause 47, section 218 Issue: Consistency with Income Tax Act 2007 rules Submissions (Anonymous D, Jo Ellen Pethers) It would seem appropriate that residency rules are aligned to assure consistency and promote understanding. The desired outcomes would appear to be achieved by applying the Income Tax Act 2007 residency tests. (Anonymous D) I strongly oppose the proposed amendment to section 218. Where a child is to reside should not be a discretionary measure to be implemented by Inland Revenue. It would be more appropriate for the Child Support Act 1991 to be consistent with similar rules in the Income Tax Act 2007. (Jo Ellen Pethers) Comment In order for a person to apply for child support to be administered by Inland Revenue, the liable parent, the child and the receiving carer must be a resident of New Zealand. The criteria for the residency test in the Child Support Act 1991 are based on the equivalent residence test in the Income Tax Act 2007. The residency test in the Income Tax Act 2007 looks at whether a person has been resident for more than 183 days (which is relevant if the person is required to pay tax on income derived overseas). However, the Income Tax Act 2007 differs from the Child Support Act 1991 in that, for a new resident, income tax is calculated and paid after the end of the relevant income year. At that point in time, it is clear that the person has or has not met the residency criteria for that year. In contrast, child support payments are made from when the person first becomes resident. To resolve this timing problem, Inland Revenue’s current practice is therefore that child support residency decisions are usually based on a person’s intended movements. This is because residency for child support purposes needs to be determined in order to accept a child support application or end a child support assessment in a timely manner. If this approach is not taken, a carer could have to wait up to 325 days before Inland Revenue could determine their residency status and then accept their application for support. The proposed amendment would better reflect the current operational practice that a person’s intention to be ordinarily resident (or not) should be taken into account. One submitter raised a concern that the proposal introduces a discretionary power. The proposal does not introduce a discretionary power, but it requires Inland Revenue to look at a person’s intended residence. Example 8 Callum applies for child support through Inland Revenue as he intends to move with his child to New Zealand. However, under the legislation, Callum would not meet the residence test until he had been living in New Zealand for 325 days. If the legislation was followed, Inland Revenue would be unable to process the application for child support and Callum would be unable to receive child support through Inland Revenue for nearly a year. Susie, the liable parent, would be required to pay child support that is backdated from the time that Callum became resident, rather than payments being spread through the previous year. 86 Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Clarify the draft amendment Submission (New Zealand Law Society) As currently drafted the amendment is unnecessarily lengthy and subjective. The New Zealand Law Society questions whether the new subsections will create unnecessary confusion and suggests that clearer and more concise drafting should be considered. Comment Officials have discussed this submission with the legislative drafter and consider that the provision as drafted is fit for purpose. Supplementary material will be provided in the Tax Information Bulletin item which will be prepared when the Bill is enacted. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 87 Other submissions 89 OTHER ISSUES RAISED BY SUBMITTERS Issue: Pass-on of child support to sole parent beneficiaries Submissions (Anonymous B, CCS Disability Action, John Clarkson, Kathleen Lauderdale, National Beneficiary Advisory Consultation Group, National Council of Women of New Zealand, Office of the Children’s Commissioner, Tamika McCallum) It is unjust that one of two people can be held financially responsible for the other when the other is on a sole parent benefit. (Anonymous B) Child support should be passed on to sole parent beneficiaries at least for disability related costs associated with the care of children. (CCS Disability Action) That child support is not used to cover the benefits bill. This should be paid from the normal tax take. Working parents should not be forced to pay for those that choose to sit on their backsides because they know the other parent will be made to pay for them. This is spousal support, not child support. (John Clarkson) Mothers are not told that the legal right to child support will be taken away from them if they accept a benefit under any circumstances (which I propose breaches their Human Rights and right to access Justice). (Kathleen Lauderdale) We are disappointed the Government did not take account of the Welfare Expert Advisory Group (WEAG) report and its recommendations relating to child support, notably passing on child support payments from liable parents to parents who are on the sole parent benefit. In particular, the WEAG recommended “passing on” child support received by Inland Revenue to the adults actually caring for dependent children, including those receiving Unsupported Child Benefit. We believe this recommendation must be acted upon and implemented as a matter of priority, such as via a supplementary order paper attached to this Bill. (National Beneficiary Advisory Consultation Group) The Bill should include a pass-on provision for sole parents on a benefit. (National Council of Women of New Zealand) We are disappointed by the omission of the WEAG recommendation specific to the Bill. WEAG recommendation 27 states Pass on all child support collected to receiving carers, including for recipients of Unsupported Child’s Benefit. (Office of the Children’s Commissioner) It should not be used to offset Government assistance and it should not be used to place individuals into a lower standard of living. (Tamika McCallum) Comment The matter raised in these submissions is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. One of the objectives of the Child Support Act 1991 is to “ensure that the costs to the State of providing an adequate level of financial support for children and their carers is offset by the collection of a fair contribution from liable parents”. Therefore, a proposal to pass on child support payments to sole-parent beneficiaries would be a fundamental change to the Child Support Act 1991. 90 Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Data Submission (Kathleen Lauderdale, Peter Read) I would like to see the median and average amounts paid per child to (usually) mothers. This analysis needs to be investigated thoroughly and published. Causal and contributing factors to involvement of other agencies needs assessing. How much resource was provided to mothers and children in Oranga Tamariki care for example by fathers. How much was provided by fathers to children suffering child abuse? How much child support was provided to youth made homeless or suffering mental health issues? How much time and resource did mothers have available to them to support themselves and then their children? An analysis covering matters such as this and what proportion of housing a child was covered by child support (collected and passed on) per child for example will give insight into the crisis this mis- or non-application of this Act has caused. (Kathleen Lauderdale) The Select Committee should request the following information from Inland Revenue: • the number of default assessments issued each year • the amount of overpayments generated • the value written off each year, and • details of audit processes in place to ensure section 152 is being correctly administered. (Peter Read) Comment The matter raised in these submissions is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. Data used to inform the proposals in the Bill can be found in the regulatory impact assessment. 10 Additional statistical information about child support amounts collected can be found on Inland Revenue’s website 11 and its annual reports. 12 Some of the other information referred to in the submissions is not collected by Inland Revenue, such as figures on amounts provided by children suffering from child abuse. 10 Child support Business Transformation (August 2019), Regulatory impact assessment prepared by Inland Revenue, available at https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2020/2020-ria-child-support 11 Child support customers and collection 2008 to 2017, Inland Revenue, available at https://www.ird.govt.nz/about-us/tax-statistics/social-policy/child-support-customers-collection 12 Inland Revenue annual reports, available at https://www.ird.govt.nz/about-us/publications/annual-corporate- reports/annual-report 91 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Section 152 Issue: Write-offs Submission (Peter Read) Overpayments of child support are usually written off under section 152 of the Child Support Act 1991 (relief in cases of serious hardship) as this is easier than addressing the many causes of them occurring such as retrospective changes in circumstances. Further, the other causes of overpayments should be analysed. Take the opportunity of this Bill to have Inland Revenue review the problem and cost of overpayments. Comment The matter raised in this submission is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. A change in the details on which child support is assessed can cause child support to be reassessed. This can result in the child support amount changing. If the liable parent’s liability is reduced, and they have paid the original amount, they will have a credit and the receiving carer will have a corresponding debt relating to the overpaid amount. Inland Revenue is unable to identify a retrospective change in circumstance before it happens because it is based on information which it did not know at the time. However, the way that the rules for notifying of changes of circumstances work ensure that if the information is not provided to Inland Revenue in a timely manner, the change will only be applied retrospectively if it would not impact on the other parent by reducing their entitlement or increasing their liability. Two amendments in the Bill relate to receiving carer overpayments by improving certainty that child support will not be reassessed after a significant period of time. The first is the proposed 28-day timeframe to advise of circumstances when child support is first assessed. Currently, there is no time limit on when an assessment can be reassessed due to circumstances which existed at the start of the assessment. In these situations, the assessment is considered incorrect and should be corrected from the start of the child support assessment. This can cause overpayments to carers. The proposed amendment would ensure consistency with the rules governing changes of circumstances, encourage parents to notify circumstances in a timely manner and improve certainty. The second is the proposed time bar for reassessing child support. This would restrict reassessment of a child support year to four years from the end of a relevant child support year (subject to specific legislative exceptions). By providing a limited time period for reassessments, the time bar will improve certainty for parents and carers. 92 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Compliance Submission (Kevin Tutauha) Australia child support and New Zealand child support need to work closer. I should not have to try and track down the mother who lives in Australia. When information is provided on a parent, it should be followed up on, not left for six years. After all, she is a citizen of that country and has an equivalent of an IRD number one would assume? Comment The matter raised in this submission is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. There is a child support reciprocal agreement with Australia which allows for the enforcement of payments when a liable parent moves to Australia or a parent liable under the Australian child support scheme moves to New Zealand. The agreement outlines which agency has the responsibility to assess the child support obligation and collect the child support payments. Generally, this is dependent on the child’s country of residence. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Integrity of the child support system Submission (Anonymous D) Due to the current inability for a liable parent to automatically recover amounts of overpaid child support, even when a receiving carer has actively misled Inland Revenue as to the care arrangements, Inland Revenue needs to do more to ensure the integrity of the child support system. Any undue delay by a receiving carer which results in that parent’s unjust enrichment should be penalised to no lesser degree than a liable parent is penalised for late payments and the liable parent should be immediately be refunded any previous overpaid amounts. Comment The matter raised in this submission is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. When a liable parent overpays child support, Inland Revenue can refund the overpayment to the liable parent. Inland Revenue will not refund the overpayment if the liable parent has arrears; the money has either not been paid to the receiving carer, or if it has been paid, then the liable parent 93 has no future liability; or there are no missing income details that could impact on the child support assessment. These rules are in place to avoid causing unnecessary debts to receiving carers due to overpayments. If the overpayment is refunded, but had already been paid to the receiving carer, this will be fully refunded to the liable parent and become a debt to the receiving carer. Reassessments can occur for a number of reasons. To avoid overpayments or underpayments occurring both receiving carers and liable parents should advise Inland Revenue of changes in circumstances in a timely manner. Many of these changes are not otherwise visible to Inland Revenue. When a liable parent overpays child support, Inland Revenue automatically refunds the overpayment to the liable parent and the receiving carer then owes the amount to Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Non-disclosure of income and assets Submissions (Estella Carmichael, Kathleen Lauderdale, Liz Boyd) It has been really hard to get child support enforced by Inland Revenue, and we have provided them with the details of the business we believe she is contracting to and income information is followed up. (Estella Carmichael) Non-disclosure of all resources available and superficial analysis of budgets have preferred (usually) a non-custodial father. Failure to check income, assets and support available to them or even require disclosure has been a failure effecting 100,000s of children consequently living in poverty in New Zealand. (Kathleen Lauderdale) In my personal case, the alienator left a high paying job to work for himself and is able to structure his income. Thus, his income is minor officially, but much more unofficially. (Liz Boyd) Comment The matter raised in these submissions is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. If a person believes that the child support assessment does not take into account the income, earnings capacity, property and financial resources of either parent or the child (or children), they are able to apply for an administrative review of their child support assessment. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 94 Issue: Comments on sole parent support Submissions (Chantall Sumner, John Clarkson, National Council of Women of New Zealand) In some cases, grandparents have taken the full responsibility of caring for and raising their grandchildren. This is because the children’s parents are not able to care for their children. The grandparents struggle along as they want to do the best for their grandchildren. The parents may be in receipt of a single parent benefit. (Chantall Sumner) The term “primary carer” should be is abolished and both parents should be able to claim for childcare subsidies and other benefits, which are related to the child. (John Clarkson) The Council wishes to see in this section, or elsewhere appropriate in the Bill, an account taken of the impact of receiving child support payments on a parent who is receiving the “Supported Living Payment – Care of the Sick and Infirm” from Work and Income. This payment is for parents who cannot work due to the caring responsibilities of their disabled child. It is income-tested, and child support payments are treated as income by Work and Income. In such a case, there can be ineligibility or an indenting of the benefit payment to the parent based on the amount of child support funding the parent receives. (National Council of Women of New Zealand) Comment The matter raised in these submissions is outside the scope of the Child Support Act 1991 and the proposals in the Bill and is not a matter within the scope of Inland Revenue’s functions. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Information (Kathleen Lauderdale) Mothers are not given the information they require at any time that they are entitled to child support. Comment The matter raised in this submission is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. Inland Revenue does not hold the information to proactively identify people who would qualify for child support. 95 Inland Revenue produces guidance documents on general and specific child support topics, 13 including Helping you to understand child support. 14 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Cross-reference error Submission (Matter raised by officials) The cross-reference in clause 15(2) of schedule 2 to the Bill refers to section 5(2) of the Bill amending section 5(3) of the Child Support Act 1991. However, the reference should be to section 5(4) of the Child Support Act 1991. Officials recommend that the cross-reference be corrected. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Child support spent on the children Submission (Anonymous A) The money paid should be spent on the children not used as a source of extra income which does not benefit the children. Comment The matter raised in this submission is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. One of the objectives of the Child Support Act 1991 is to “affirm the right of the child to be maintained by their parents”. The amount payable is intended to approximate the average amount spent on a child according to their parents’ incomes. How child support received is used by the receiving carer is outside the scope of the Child Support Act 1991. If the Act were to prescribe how the payments should be spent, the compliance costs 13 How child support works, Inland Revenue, available at https://www.ird.govt.nz/child-support/how-child-support- works 14 Helping you to understand child support (IR100 April 2020), Inland Revenue, available at https://www.ird.govt.nz/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/forms-and-guides/ir100---ir199/ir100/ir100-2020.pdf 96 and administration costs of the scheme would increase. This would also limit parents’ choices in determining the best use of the child support received. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The child support scheme should be repealed Submission (Jim Boyd) Get rid of child support altogether and let parents decide how to cater for the needs of their children. If they cannot reach agreement, let them go to mediation. Comment The matter raised in this submission is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. The child support scheme is a mechanism for determining the amount of child support payable when parents are unable to come to an agreement between themselves. The Child Support Act 1991 provides a formula to determine the amount of child support payable or receivable. When a relationship has ended it can be difficult for parents to agree how to support their children financially. A formula assessment provides an objective method to determine the amount. Inland Revenue does provide other options which allow customers, who are not sole parent beneficiaries, to elect the child support arrangement most suitable for their circumstances. If parents want to negotiate the amount of child support payable but would still like Inland Revenue to administer payments, they can opt for a voluntary agreement. Alternatively, if parents would like to arrange child support entirely between themselves, they are able to make their own private arrangement which does not involve Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Applications for past periods Submission (Tremayne Thompson) I recommend that a provision should be amended to this Bill making it easier for parents to be able to make a claim for the 17 years (or however long in other people’s cases) that a parent has not made child support payments. A back-payment system, if you like. 97 Comment The matter raised in this submission is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. There is a variety of reasons why a person might not have applied for child support, for example, the parents may have negotiated a private arrangement between themselves. Private arrangements can be agreed at any time and are outside the Child Support Act 1991. If a parent were able to apply for child support for past periods, officials consider that it would be necessary for reasons of fairness to allow for any child support paid under a private arrangement during that period to be taken into account. This could create a substantial compliance and administrative burden in verifying what was paid under a private arrangement. This problem could be intensified if a substantial period of time had elapsed. There is nothing in the Child Support Act 1991 preventing most people (except for those who are required to apply for a formula assessment such as beneficiaries) from entering into a private arrangement at any time, including in the circumstances outlined by the submitter. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Liable parent payment schedule Submission (Greig Giblin) I am a wage earner who works on a four on four off schedule, so there is quite a difference between one fortnight and the next. Paying child support monthly is unrealistic. There should be more flexibility for the liable parent’s payment schedule. Comment Child support is an annual assessment that is divided up into monthly instalments. A liable parent must ensure the full payment is made by the relevant due date. However, there is flexibility in that a liable parent can make full or partial payments towards this. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 98 Issue: Children should be considered financially independent at a set income threshold Submission (Anonymous G) Once a child is earning $150 per week child support should not be paid. It is impossible to find out the information to know if a child should be considered financially independent, such as whether they work 30 hours a week. Comment The submission is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. Financial independence is currently based on a number of hours worked test. Secrecy provisions prevent Inland Revenue from disclosing information about a child’s work hours or earnings to parents. However, a parent could provide information they hold to Inland Revenue who could follow up to ensure that the information Inland Revenue holds is correct. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 99 Legislative process submissions 101 LEGISLATIVE PROCESS ISSUES RAISED BY SUBMITTERS Issue: Submission process and engagement Submissions (Birthright New Zealand, Jo Ellen Pethers, Tamika McCallum) The engagement that Inland Revenue has undertaken with paying and receiving parents is not sufficient to support the recommendations in the Bill. Before any further changes are made, research on a representative sample size should be undertaken. (Birthright New Zealand) The changes proposed in the amendment Bill have far greater financial implications than the wording of the Bill lets on. Proper notice of the proposal should be implemented before modifications to legislation begins. The financial impacts of these amendments should be disclosed. And the public should be given time to react and respond. The Bill should be clear about the overall reduction of provisions offered to support children from broken families. instead of writing explanatory notes which disguise these changes as “procedural”. (Jo Ellen Pethers) Appropriate time should be given to the public for consultation and feedback and clear notification of the amendment Bill should be provided to the public. This has not been done, as such the submitter requests that there be an extension of time for further submissions from the public. (Tamika McCallum) Comment Most of the key proposals in this Bill were originally proposed in the 2017 Government discussion document Making Tax Simpler – Better administration of social policy. This document contained proposals aimed at improving the way social policy entitlements and obligations, including child support, are administered by Inland Revenue. Extensive public consultation took place on the proposals in the discussion document. Following public feedback, the Government made decisions on the proposals and these have been incorporated into this Bill. Because of time constraints, consultation on the proposal to introduce a child support time bar was limited to interest groups rather than parents and carers. Some of the minor or technical changes were not consulted on because of their minor nature. However, the use of discretion for those in unusual circumstances was included in the 2017 discussion document Making Tax Simpler – Better administration of social policy. Research was also conducted with a small number of liable parents and receiving carers to gauge their attitudes towards the penalty rules and how they see penalties affecting compliance. As part of the normal process a regulatory impact assessment (the RIA) was completed and is publicly available, on both Inland Revenue’s tax policy website and the Treasury’s website. The RIA provides: • a high-level summary of the problem being addressed • the options considered • an analysis of the costs and benefits of the options 102 • the consultation undertaken, and • the proposed arrangements for implementation and review. In addition, Inland Revenue has produced a Commentary on the Bill, which is intended to provide background information and explanations of the proposals, and examples of how the proposals (if enacted) would be expected to apply. The Commentary is also available on the tax policy website. The Bill has followed the usual legislative process, including the select committee process for receiving public submissions on the Bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Child impact analysis Submission (Office of the Children’s Commissioner) A child impact assessment should be undertaken on all Bills considered by Select Committees. Comment Although impacts of the proposals in the Bill on children was not specifically identified, much of the analysis contained in the RIA relates to the financial impacts on the carers of children for whom child support is payable. As the proposals in the Bill are primarily related to improving administration, rather than fundamentally changing the child support assessment formula, the impacts on carers (and therefore children) are expected to be positive but minimal. To ensure that impacts on children are more directly considered in future bills, Inland Revenue officials intend to undertake child impact assessments for future Inland Revenue bills that are likely to impact on children. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Plain language Submissions (Child Advocacy New Zealand, Liz Boyd, National Council of Women of New Zealand) Law should be accessible and understandable. (Child Advocacy New Zealand) The Bill should be translated to plain everyday language so that it is completely clear what the specific changes are, regardless of your education. (Liz Boyd) 103 Public information and advice about the new requirements and methods of assessment should be produced in plain language and in a range of languages and accessible formats. (National Council of Women of New Zealand) Comment Complexity in the Bill reflects the technical nature of many of the amendments. Inland Revenue has provided guidance explaining the amendments in the form of the Commentary on the Bill. This includes examples of how the rules would work in practice. When legislation has been enacted, Inland Revenue produces a Tax Information Bulletin item setting out the changes. Inland Revenue also produces guidance documents on general and specific child support topics on its website. 15 As part of producing this information, Inland Revenue applies guidelines on web accessibility standards, including using plain language. Inland Revenue is currently planning how it will communicate the proposed changes to child support customers (liable parents and receiving carers), and to employers (for automatic employer deductions). This will involve considering the impacts on different groups of customers and the channels that will be used to make sure that messages reach the target audiences. This may include translation of some content into different languages, including te reo Māori. The range of channels is expected to include emails and letters, digital advertising, and website updates. Inland Revenue will also be working closely with other government agencies (including Oranga Tamariki and the Ministry of Social Development), and community and advocacy groups. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Human rights-based approach Submission (National Beneficiary Advisory Consultation Group) We wish to draw the committee’s attention to the benefits of a human rights-based approach to social welfare, recommended by Māmari Stephens and other informed commentators. We believe this approach should be applied to all social policy legislation and express our disappointment that it was not applied in the course of this Bill. Comment The proposals in this Bill were developed in accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTTP). One of the key components of the GTTP is consultation with stakeholders. Many of the elements of a human-rights based approach to social welfare, as suggested by Māmari Stephens, 15 Available on Inland Revenue’s website at https://www.ird.govt.nz/child-support 104 are incorporated into the GTTP, for example, participation in policy development and ongoing engagement. Many of the key proposals contained in the Bill were originally proposed in the 2017 discussion document Making Tax Simpler – Better administration of social policy. Key stakeholders and government agencies were consulted during the development of the proposals. An extensive engagement strategy was developed to support the release of the discussion document, including online public consultation which provided a vehicle for the public to comment on the proposals. It included an online forum with views sought on specific questions, short summaries of the key proposals, a simplified online survey and animated videos of the proposals. The summaries, surveys and videos were available in eleven languages including in New Zealand Sign Language. Officials also met with key interest groups around New Zealand. As previously noted, the proposed amendments in the Bill support the move of child support to new systems and processes as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. They do not change the fundamentals of the scheme, including the amount of child support assessed. The assessment of child support is a function of factors such as income and care percentages and reflects that children should be appropriately supported by both their parents, even when they are not living together as a family. Recommendation That the submission be noted.
March 2021 1 Fact sheet: Business continuity test (BCT) Feature Details Main test Primary negative test. UK style major change block to loss carry forward. The Australian test requires a company to assess whether it can carry losses forward after a change in ownership based on it meeting a “same or similar” threshold (a positive test). The UK test has a starting presumption the losses can be carried forward, unless a major change test is triggered (negative test). The proposed BCT for New Zealand will permit losses to be carried forward after a change in ownership as long as there is not a major change as described in the legislation. Definition of major change set out with reference to Australian style factors (for example, similarity of activities and assets). The proposed BCT for New Zealand will allow losses to be carried forward unless there is a major change in the nature of the company’s business activities, having regard to the assets used and other relevant factors. Relevant factors would include business processes, use of suppliers, markets supplied to, and the type of product or services supplied. Not every change will be a major change. Any change in business activities (including use of assets) must be considered against the unchanged business activities (including use of assets) employed by the company to generate income to establish whether the change is “major”. Generally, this would be a question of scale (in other words, how significant is the change in the context of the operations of the entire company). The test is not intended to give special weight to any particular factor. Carve-outs from definition of major change for business development. The Australian test has a factor which permits changes that result from the development or commercialisation of its business. It is important that the New Zealand BCT recognises that companies change in order to innovate and grow. The UK uses its guidance material to achieve a similar result but is more specific as to exactly what type of changes are carved out. The proposed New Zealand BCT will adopt this approach but include it in legislation to provide greater certainty. The proposed carve-outs are: • changes to increase efficiency, increase scale, or to keep pace with developing technology; and • rationalising the company’s product or service range by introducing new items produced using the same or largely the same assets of the company (excluding land but including fixtures to land) or of a kind relating to those already being produced or previously produced. March 2021 2 Feature Details Main test Excluding land (but not fixtures) is an integrity measure as it may be easy for a company to argue that it is using largely the same assets (if land is a large part of the assets) and this could allow a complete change of the business (for example, farming to a factory producing widgets). Defined time period for measurement of business continuity, gradual change is not a relevant consideration. Measurement of the business and whether it meets the continuity test can be examined from the time of the ownership change until the earliest of: • the end of the income year in which the losses are utilised; or • the end of the income year five years after the ownership change (except as noted below). Using this defined time period rather than the Australian approach of measurement from the time of a change in ownership up until when the loss is used will reduce compliance and administrative costs while also ensuring that a business is not unduly constrained from making major changes indefinitely. Anti-avoidance measures Purpose statement. This will set out the purpose of the policy: to remove an impediment to sensible business reorganisations while preventing loss trading. Pre-purchase dormant company rule. This rule would sit alongside a “major change” as a way in which the business continuity test will not be met. This rule will disallow carry forward of losses if the change in ownership occurs at any time after the scale of activities in the business carried on by the company has ceased and before any significant revival of the business. Anti-injection rule similar to section 175-10 of the ITAA 1997 (Australia). This rule would be modelled on Australia’s general income tax anti-injection rule, but will apply only to companies carrying losses forward in reliance on the BCT and be limited to transactions with associated persons. Anti-cost transfer rule This rule would be the opposite of the anti-injection rule by stopping a company artificially transferring costs to another group member for no charge which essentially artificially increases the loss company’s income. Change in business before change in ownership. This rule would be modelled on Australia’s anti-avoidance rule preventing a business being changed before a change in ownership for the purpose of meeting the business continuity test (including dormant company rule) after the change. The test would look back two years before the ownership change. March 2021 3 Feature Details Main test Application to losses arising from the 2013–14 income year onwards. Rather than apply the business continuity test to the full stock of losses, the proposal would apply the test to losses arising from the 2013–14 income year onwards. Loss grouping rules retained. The commonality rules that must be met for loss grouping would continue to apply to any carry forward loss to prevent a loss company being subsumed into a profitable group. However, we would allow companies purchased as a ‘group’ to continue to offset within the group as long as the 66% ownership commonality test is met. The test would consider the business activities of the group, rather than at an individual entity level, when a group is acquired. Removal of the five-year rule for companies who have significant DB 31(3) bad debt deductions. Companies who are holders or dealers in financial arrangements are permitted to take bad debt deductions for capital losses will not have the five-year continuity rule applied to them and they must meet the BCT until the losses are utilised. The current rules for the carry forward of mining company losses will remain unchanged. Mineral mining companies essentially have their own similar business test built into the existing mining tax rules. This regime would continue for those entities and not the new BCT.
1 March 2021 Questions and answers: Business continuity test (BCT) Background New Zealand’s loss continuity rules are among the most stringent in the world. For losses to be carried forward, at least 49% continuity of ownership of the company is required to be maintained from when the loss arose until the time it is used. This test creates an impediment for businesses obtaining capital in order to innovate and grow because this can result in a breach of the 49% ownership continuity threshold. The Government wants to address this impediment, with a particular focus on start-ups and small-medium enterprises. The intention was to release a discussion document canvassing various options for reform of the loss continuity rules. However, the arrival of COVID-19 changed priorities. The Government wanted to have the regime in place for the 2020–21 income year and on 14 April 2020, Cabinet made the decision to accelerate this work in response to the economic impacts of COVID-19 with application to the 2020–21 income year to allow businesses that may require recapitalisation due to the COVID- 19 situation to take advantage of the new test. A model based on the Australian same or similar test could be developed and implemented quickly, so this model was chosen. Since April 2020 officials have been working with a private sector reference group including a number of experienced tax practitioners as well as consulting with Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, the Corporate Taxpayers Group and the members of the New Zealand Law Society Tax Law Committee to develop a business continuity test for New Zealand. Legislation will be introduced in a supplementary order paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill at the Committee of the whole House stage in mid-March. Questions and answers Q1. What is a same or similar business test? The same or similar business test is essentially a business continuity test which allows a company to carry its losses forward after a change in ownership as long as the underlying business continues. This test is intended to remove the impediment to capital raising while still preventing loss trading. Q2. How much will loosening the loss continuity rules cost? The fiscal cost is estimated to be $60 million forgone revenue per year. 2 Q3. The Australian same or similar test is still quite a restrictive test for businesses – especially due to changes made because of COVID-19, is it suitable for New Zealand? In introducing a same or similar business test to New Zealand the Government wanted to encourage growth and innovation of firms whilst stopping the ability of firms to trade in tax losses, as officials worked through the Australian regime with external practitioners it became clear a “copy and paste” of that test to New Zealand would not meet the Government’s goals for this change. Given that officials, in conjunction with the private sector, have designed a bespoke business continuity test (BCT) for New Zealand that is a hybrid of both the Australian and United Kingdom tests. Q4. Does this mean the 49% continuity test has been replaced? No, if a company continues to satisfy the existing 49% continuity rules they will not need to rely on the BCT. Q5. How will the test work in practice? The proposed BCT for New Zealand will allow losses to be carried forward unless there is a major change in the nature of the company’s business activities, having regard to the assets used and other relevant factors. Relevant factors would include business processes, use of suppliers, markets supplied to, and the type of product or services supplied. Not every change will be a major change. Any change in business activities (including use of assets) must be considered against the unchanged business activities (including use of assets) employed by the company to generate income to establish whether the change is “major”. Generally, this would be question of scale (in other words, how significant is the change in the context of the operations of the entire company). Q6. Will there be any exceptions to a firm that has had a major change to grow its business? It is important that the New Zealand BCT recognises that companies change in order to innovate and grow. The UK uses its guidance material to achieve a similar result but is more specific as to exactly what type of changes are carved out. The proposed New Zealand BCT will adopt this approach but import it to legislation to provide greater certainty. The proposed carve-outs are: changes to increase efficiency, increase scale, to keep pace with developing technology; or rationalisation of the company’s product or service range by introducing new items produced using the same or largely the same assets of the company (excluding land but including fixtures to land) or of a kind relating to those already being produced or previously produced. Q7. Why is land excluded when determining if the carve out for a change in product or service applies? Excluding land (but not fixtures) is an integrity measure as it may be easy for a company to argue that it is using largely the same assets (if land is a large part of the assets) and this could allow a complete change of the business (for example, farming to a factory producing widgets). 3 Q8. Will all companies get to carry forward losses now? No, some companies will fail the major change test and the carve outs will not apply, the result will be that the losses are forfeited. Q9. How long do I have to maintain the BCT? For most companies they will need to maintain the BCT until the end of the income year which is five years after the breach in continuity. The exceptions to this are companies with section DB 31(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 deductions which relate to bad debt losses who will have to maintain the BCT until the losses are used. Q10. Are all companies subject to the BCT? No, mineral mining companies will not be subject to the BCT as those companies essentially have an existing business continuity test in the current regime which they can rely on. Q11. Are the commonality rules changing also? No, there is no change to the commonalty rules that require 66% commonality of ownership for companies to offset losses. So, if a company acquires another company that has losses it will not be able to offset preacquisition losses. Q12. Can I just buy a company that isn’t doing anything but holding losses and use those losses? No, the BCT will not allow dormant companies to carry forward losses under the BCT. Q13. Are there any limitations on what I can do with the company after purchase? There will be a number of anti-avoidance provisions as part of the BCT to protect the tax base. Anti- income injection rules similar to those in Australia will be part of the test as well as rules to stop costs being transferred out of the loss company to other associated companies artificially increasing the income of the loss company. Q14. Will all carry forward loss balances be subject to the BCT? No, only losses incurred from the 2013–14 year onwards will be able to be carried forward under the BCT. Q15. Will the continuity rules for imputation credits change at the same time? The current rules for the carry forward of imputation credits will not be changing under the BCT. This was not part of the scope of the proposals. Q16. Will Inland Revenue be putting out any guidance for taxpayers? Yes, officials have been working with the Tax Counsel Office to develop some guidance which will be released in draft after the SOP is released. This has been worked on as part of the policy development process.
The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Please refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. ird.govt.nz March 2021 Bright-line test proposed changes Pr oposed extens ion t o 10 years, excluding new builds, and changes to the treatment of times when the p roperty is not the owner's main home. This fact sheet summarises changes the Government intends to make to the taxation of residential property. Once legislation is enacted, more details will be available at ird.govt.nz/property This fact sheet is to inform people making decisions about buying or selling property of the proposed changes and how they might affect them. Extension of the bright-line test to 10 years The bright-line test means if you sell a residential property within a set period after acquiring it you will be required to pay income tax on any profit made through the property increasing in value. The current bright-line period is 5 years. The Government has announced it intends to extend the bright-line period to 10 years for residential property except newly built houses (new builds). Inherited properties and those which have been the owner's main home for the entire time they owned it will continue to be exempt from all bright-line tests. To determine what length of bright-line test a property is subject to the following flow-chart can be used. The section on the next page explains when property is acquired for these purposes. ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Please refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. When a property is acquired For tax purposes, a property is generally acquired on the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is entered into (even if some standard conditions like getting finance or a building report still need to be met). Full information on when a property is acquired is found in QB 17/02 on taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz For the purposes of the changes outlined in this factsheet, a property acquired on or after 27 March 2021 will be treated as having been acquired before 27 March 2021, if the purchase was the result of an offer the purchaser made on or before 23 March 2021 that cannot be withdrawn before 27 March 2021. The date you acquire property determines whether the bright-line period is 5 or 10 years. This will also determine which set of rules relating to the main home exclusion and change of use will apply to your property. In either case, the period is then counted from the date the land is transferred to you (generally the settlement date). There will be consultation on what will be considered a new build The definition of a new build will be worked out in consultation with the tax and property communities over the coming months, but it is intended to include properties that are acquired within a year of receiving their code compliance certificate under the Building Act 2004. Legislation to define 'new builds' and exclude them from the proposed 10-year test is intended to be introduced into Parliament after consultation. The Government intends for the legislation to be retrospective such that new builds acquired on or after 27 March 2021 would continue to be subject to a 5-year bright-line test. Changes to the treatment of times when a property is not the owner's main home The government is making the rules fairer around the change of use of a main home with respect to the operation of the bright-line test. Any residential property that has been used as the owner's main home for the entire time they owned it will continue to be exempt from any bright-line test. For residential properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021, including new builds, the Government intends to introduce a 'change-of-use' rule. This will affect the way tax is calculated if the property was not used as the owner's main home for more than 12 months at a time within the applicable bright-line period. If a property switches to or from being the owner's main home and the period when it is not their main home is 12 months or less, they do not need to count that as a change-of-use – those non-main home days are 'treated as' main home days. For example, if an owner takes a few months to move into a property, or owns it for a few months after moving out, this does not trigger the bright-line test. The owner of a property subject to the change-of-use rule will be required to pay income tax on a proportion of the profit made through the property increasing in value, calculated as follows: •subtract the purchase price from the sale price •subtract the cost of capital improvements the owner has made •subtract the costs to buy and sell the property, and •multiply the result by the proportion of time the property was not being used as the owner' s main home. If a residential property was acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and before 27 March 2021, the existing main home exclusion rules will continue to apply. These can be found at ird.govt.nz/property. In short, the main home exclusion from the existing 5-year test applies on an all or nothing basis, depending on whether the property was used for most of the bright-line period as the main home. Changes-of-use do not need to be accounted for. ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Please refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. What the proposed changes mean for you This section describes what the proposed changes mean for you if you acquire a residential property on or after 27 March 2021. If you sell the property more than 10 years after acquiring it (or 5 years for a new build), you will not pay tax under the bright-line test on any gain in value. If you sell the property within 10 years of acquiring it (or 5 years for a new build), and it was your main home for the entire time you owned it, you will not pay tax under the bright-line test on any gain in value. However, if the property was your main home, but was used for other purposes for more than 12 months during the time you owned it, you must pay income tax on the profit from the gain in value of the property as detailed in the previous section. If you sell the property within 10 years of acquiring it (or 5 years for a new build), and it was never your main home for the entire time you owned it, you will pay tax under the bright-line test on any gain in value. Any profit from a gain in property value that is considered taxable income (including under any of the bright-line tests) will also affect any other obligations or entitlements you have based on taxable income, such as student loan repayments, child support payments, and Working for Families. This effect would be in the year you need to include the income on your tax return. Short-stay accommodation The legislation will also ensure that residential properties used to provide short-stay accommodation, where the owner does not live in the property, are subject to the bright-line test, and cannot be excluded as business premises. Other land sale rules still apply There are other rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 that can tax gains on the sale of land (including residential land). For example, there are tax rules that apply to speculators, land developers and dealers. Those rules will continue to apply, regardless of when the property was purchased. The bright-line tests potentially apply only if none of the other land sale rules apply. Regardless of the bright-line tests, anytime you purchase property with the intention of selling it you must pay tax on the profit unless an exemption applies. Examples The following examples are provided to help clarify the proposed new rules. For the sake of simplicity, we have rounded all dates to years when in reality they would be counted by days. We have also not included any costs related to acquiring or selling the properties, where in reality such costs could be deducted from any profit prior to calculating the proportion that is taxable income. Detailed examples will be available in commentary to the draft legislation. Main home to rental property Manaia buys a property in 2022 for $800,000. It is not a new build. The property is used as her main home until 2028 when she moves overseas and rents it out. In 2030 she sells the property for $1.1 million. She did not make any improvements to the property. Manaia owned the property for 8 years. Because it was not a new build the applicable bright-line period is 10 years. Because she sold it within 10 years of buying it, the bright-line test applies. The property was Manaia's main home for the 6 years she lived in it (2022 to 2028) so she will pay tax for the remaining 2 of the 8 years she owned the property. Her additional taxable income in the year she sells the property is $75,000 – being 2/8ths of the $300,000 ($1.1 million - $800,000) profit. Manaia will need to add this to her income in her tax return and pay tax on it accordingly. Rental property to main home Joseph buys a new build house in 2025 for $1 million and immediately lists it for rent on a short-stay accommodation website. The property is used for short-stay accommodation until 2027 when Joseph moves in and uses it as his main home. He spends $100,000 on double glazing and a new deck. Joseph sells it 2 years later (in 2029) for $1.2 million. Joseph owned the property for 4 years. Because it was a new build the applicable bright-line period is 5 years. Because he sold it within 5 years of buying it, the bright-line test applies. The property was Joseph's main home for the 2 years he lived in it (2027 to 2029) so he will pay tax for the remaining 2 of the 4 years he owned the property. His additional taxable income in the year he sells the property is $50,000 – being 2/4ths of the $100,000 ($1.2m - $1m - $100,000) profit. Joseph will need to add this to his income in his tax return, and pay tax on it accordingly. ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication.

Rental interval Jermain buys a property in 2023 for $600,000. It is not a new build. The property is used as his main home until 2026 when he rents it out. He spent $40,000 adding a bedroom. Jermain moves back into the property in 2028, before selling it in 2031 for $800,000. Jermain owned the property for 8 years. Because it was not a new build the applicable bright-line period is 10 years. Because he sold it within 10 years of buying it, the bright-line test applies. Jermain used the property as his main home for the 6 years he lived in it (2023 to 2026 and 2028 to 2031), so he will pay tax for the remaining 2 of the 8 years he owned the property. His additional taxable income in the year he sells the property is $40,000 – being 2/8ths of the $160,000 ($800,000 - $600,000 - $40,000) profit. Jermain will need to add this to his income in his tax return, and pay tax on it accordingly. Property sold within 12 months of change-of-use Lilly acquires a property in 2022 which she uses as her main home. In 2025 she buys a new property and moves into it. It takes 9 months to sell the old property. As Lilly was already living in her new home, there has been a change-of-use for the old property during the 9 months it took to sell – it is no longer her main home. Because the time between the change-of-use and date the property was sold is less than 12 months, Lilly does not need to pay tax on any gain in value. New home build Teuila acquires a property on 3 December 2022, which received its code compliance certificate on 28 August 2022. She rents the property out continuously until she sells it in 2030. Teuila owned the property for 8 years. Because it was a new build the applicable bright-line period is 5 years. Because she sold it after more than 5 years she has no tax to pay under the bright-line test. Property acquired before 27 March 2021 Junior bought a property in 2020 for $500,000, which he used as his main home for 1 year. He then rented out the property for 3 years before he sold it in 2024 for $600,000. He made no capital improvements to it. Because Junior acquired the property before 27 March 2021 (and after 29 March 2018), the applicable bright-line period is 5 years, and the change-of-use rule does not apply. Because he sold it within 5 years of buying it, the bright-line test applies. Junior used the property as his main home for 1 out of the 4 years he owned it. Under the bright-line test for properties acquired before 27 March 2021 this does not qualify as his main home, as it was not his main home for most of the time he owned it. Under those same bright-line rules, Junior's additional taxable income in the year he sells the property is the full $100,000 profit (the difference between the purchase and sale price: $600,000 - $500,000). Junior will need to add this to his income in his tax return, and pay tax on it accordingly.
Pa ge 1 of 2 Interest limitation – information sheet 1 September 2021 Interest deductibility proposals at a glance The Government intends to limit the ability to deduct interest to make residential properties a less attractive investment option and to help level the playing field for first home buyers. The proposal is that, from 1 October 2021, interest will not be deductible for residential property acquired on or after 27 March 2021. For properties acquired before 27 March 2021, generally investors’ ability to deduct interest will be phased out between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025. Some properties are excluded from these rules and some exemptions are proposed. This information sheet provides a quick overview of the proposals. These proposals will be considered by Parliament and may change. P hasing out interest deductions for properties acquired before 27 March 2021 Date interest incurred Percentage of the interest that can be claimed 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 100% 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021 100% 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022 75% 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 75% 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024 50% 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 25% Acquired date for tax purposes For tax purposes, a property is generally acquired on the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is entered into (even if some conditions still need to be met). An investment could also qualify for phased-out deductions even if they acquired the property on or after 27 March 2021 provided they did so as a result of an irrevocable offer made on or before 23 March 2021. Full information on when a property is acquired can be found in QB 17/02 available on taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz Generally, any residential investment property in New Zealand that is suitable for people to live in long-term will be affected by these proposed changes. Typically, this would mean a house or an apartment, whether it is used for providing short-term or long-term accommodation. Exemptions To minimise any impact on housing supply, property development and new builds will be exempt from the proposed rules. For more information on this, see information sheet 4 – Exemptions for property development and new builds. Types of property to be excluded from the changes The main home is not affected by these proposals. Commercial property unrelated to the provision of accommodation is not affected by the interest limitation proposal. Pa ge 2 of 2 The following types of residential property are proposed to be excluded from the rules: •Main home – the interest limitation proposal w ould not apply to interest related to any income-earning use of an owner-occupier’ s m ain home, such as a flatting situation. •Farmland. •Certain Māori land, papakāinga and kaumātua housing, and land transferred as part of a settlement under te Tiriti o Waitangi/Treaty of Waitangi. •Emergency, transitional, social, and council h ousing. •Commercial accommodation such as hotels, motels, and hostels (but not short-stay accommodation provided in a residentia l dw elling). •Care facilities: hospitals, nursing homes, hospices, and convalescent homes. •Retirement villages and rest homes. •Employee accommodation. •Student accommodation. •Land outside New Zealand. For more information on this, see information sheet 2 – Properties not affected by the interest deductibility proposals. Exclusions for certain organisations To reduce compliance costs, it is proposed that the interest limitation rules will not apply to most companies where their core business does not involve residential land. These are companies where residential property (including new builds) makes up less than half their total assets. Companies where five or fewer individuals or trustees own 50% or more of the company (referred to as close companies) will generally have to apply the rules even if their core business does not involve residential land. An exception is proposed for close companies that are Māori authorities or wholly-owned by a Māori authority. Such companies are distinct from other close companies, as they are accountable to a larger member group. Kāinga Ora and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are proposed to be excluded from the interest deductibility changes because they provide emergency, transitional and social housing. For more information on this, see information sheet 3 – How the rules work for certain entities . Will interest deductions be permanently denied in all cases? Previously denied interest deductions may be available when residential property is sold if the sale is taxable, although the deduction may be limited to the gain on sale. What is the process from here? The proposals discussed here will need to be considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee (a parliamentary select committee). As part of its process, the Committee will usually call for public submissions on the proposals. Typically there is a six-week submission period. The Committee will then usually make its recommendations to Parliament. The proposals presented in these information sheets may change as a result of the select committee and parliamentary processes. To make a submission to the Committee, see www.parliament.nz/en/pb/sc/how-to-make-a- submission Other information sheets on the proposals are available on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website . Detailed commentary on the draft legislation will also be published shortly to help inform public submissions on the proposals. This information sheet provides a brief description of the Government’s proposals. It does not attempt to provide comprehensive coverage. For full details of the proposals refer to the Supplementary Order Paper.
Page 1 of 2 Interest limitation – information sheet 2 September 2021 Properties not affected by the interest deductibility proposals This information sheet provides general information on the way that proposals the Government is introducing are likely to work. Under existing rules, a person who owns a residential investment property is allowed to deduct the interest costs they incur from acquiring that property. This means that they can reduce the amount of tax they are required to pay. The Government intends to limit that ability to deduct interest to make residential properties a less attractive investment option and thus level the playing field for first home buyers. Some properties, because of their physical structure or purpose, would not be affected by the proposed rules. This information sheet provides a quick overview of the types of properties not affected by the rules (so you will be able to deduct interest expenses for them where applicable). These proposals will be considered by Parliament and may change. The proposal In general, any house, apartment, or other such building in New Zealand that a person could live in would be affected by these changes. Bare land that could be used for residential property will also be affected. It does not matter whether the pr op erty is rented out long-term, used for short- stay accommodation, or even left vacant. You’ll still be able to deduct interest for some properties Certain properties will be unaffected by these rules. This means that if you satisfy the other requirements for claiming deductions, you will still be able to deduct interest for these properties. Main homes are not affected by these changes. You generally can’t claim interest deductions for private use, but if you use your main home to earn income (such as from a flatmate or boarder), you will be able to deduct some interest against that income. Provided you meet the other requirements for claiming deductions, you will still be able to deduct interest against income from these unaffected properties: • A portion of the main home if it is used to earn income (for example, from flatmates or boarders). • Properties used as business premises (except for an accommodation business), like offices and shops. This includes residential properties to the extent they are used as business premises (for example, a house converted into a doctor’s surgery). • Hospitals, hospices, nursing homes, and convalescent homes. • Retirement villages and rest homes. • Hotels, motels, hostels, inns, campgrounds. • Houses on farmland. • Bed and breakfasts where the owner lives on the property. • Employee accommodation. • Student accommodation. • Land outside New Zealand. In addition, the proposals also include a land “business” ex emption and a “development” exemption. For more information on this, see information sheet 4 – Exemptions for property development and new builds. Page 2 of 2 Māori collectively owned land and housing The Government is proposing that land would not be affected by the proposals if it is collectively owned by a Māori authority (or entity eligible to be one) and used to provide housing to a member of the relevant iwi or hapū (papakāinga and kaumātua housing). Also unaffected would be land transferred as part of a Treaty settlement and certain types of Māori land title. Emergency, transition, social, and council housing If your property is used for emergency, transitional or social housing when you leased it to the Crown (for example, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development or Kāinga Ora) or to a registered community housing provider then you can still claim interest deductions. What if part of my property is affected and part is excluded? If you own a piece of land which has both a residential property and excluded property on the same legal title such as a two-storey building with a shop on the ground floor and a flat on the top floor, you will still be able to deduct interest for the portion of the property which is excluded. You’ll need to use a reasonable method to apportion the interest between the two. This information sheet provides a brief description of the Government’s proposals. It does not attempt to provide comprehensive coverage. For full details of the proposals refer to the Supplementary Order Paper.
Page 1 of 2 Interest limitation – information sheet 5 September 2021 How interest deductions are affected This information sheet provides general information on the way that proposals the Government is introducing are likely to work. The Government intends to limit the ability to deduct interest to make residential properties a less attractive investment option and thus level the playing field for first home buyers. For property investors who borrowed to acquire residential property before 27 March 2021, interest deductions will be phased out between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025 as shown in the table. Residential property investors who borrow to acquire residential property on or after 27 March 2021 will not be allowed to deduct interest incurred after 1 October 2021 (unless an exception applies). Certain exemptions apply and certain property types are excluded. This information sheet provides general information on what interest is proposed to be either phased out or become immediately non-deductible from 1 October 2021. These proposals will be considered by Parliament and may change. Phasing out interest deductions for properties acquired before 27 March 2021 Date interest incurred Percentage of the interest that can be claimed 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 100% 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021 100% 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022 75% 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 75% 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024 50% 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 25% Date property acquired For tax purposes, a property is generally acquired on the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is entered into (even if some conditions still need to be met). Full information on when a property is acquired can be found in QB 17/02 on taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz Funds borrowed on or after 27 March 2021 If you borrowed funds on or af ter 27 March 2021 for your property, interest deductions will no longer be allowed from 1 October 2021 except if you used those funds to purchase property acquired: • before 27 March 2021 (for example, you entered into an agreement but settlement was in May 2021), or • as a result of an offer you made before 24 March 2021 that you weren’t permitted to withdraw before 27 March 2021 (for example, as part of the contractual terms and conditions in a tender process). If either of these exceptions applies, your ability to deduct interest will be phased out according to the table above. Note: If one of the exemptions for property development or new builds applies your interest deductions will not be limited under the proposed rules. For more information on this, see Page 2 of 2 information sheet 4 – Exemptions for property development and new builds. Refinancing on or after 27 March 2021 Refinancing up to the level of the original loan will not affect the deductibility of your interest. If the original loan qualified for phasing out, then that treatment remains the same. Variable loans, such as a revolving credit or overdraft Deductions for interest on a variable loan will also be phased out as per the table above. This is provided the amount outstanding (after subtracting any expenditure on deductible or private activities) is the same or lower than the amount that was outstanding on 27 March 2021. If the amount outstanding is higher than the amount outstanding on 27 March 2021, only interest on the amount outstanding on 27 March 2021 will be deductible under the phased approach. Interest on the remainder of the amount outstanding will be non-deductible. Borrowing used for other purposes The interest limitation rules will not affect borrowings for non-residential property purposes. For example, if you borrow against a residential property to buy a truck for a transport business, your interest deductions will not be affected. If you took out a loan before 27 March 2021 and cannot work out how much of the loan was used for residential property and how much was used for other business property, a special transition rule will apply. Under that transition rule, the loan will be treated as being used to acquire your other business property first (based on the market value of that business property) and then the balance will be applied to the residential property. Property rented out and also used privately The interest limitation rules will apply to interest relating to residential property that is rented out some of the time and used privately some of the time. This is the case with many holiday homes. Interest expenses for such properties will be entirely non-deductible from 1 October 2021 unless the interest qualifies for the phased approach because the loan is a pre- 27 March 2021 loan (as discussed above). The interest limitation rules will not apply if the interest relates to income you earn in your main home, for example, from a flatting or boarding situation. You will still be able to deduct some interest against that income. Changes in how property is held Proposed rollover relief will allow you to change how you hold the property after 27 March 2021 but still allow you to deduct a portion of your interest expense during the interest phase-out period. Relief will be provided for some transfers to family trusts and for transfers to or from look- through companies and partnerships. This is consistent with the relief proposed for the bright- line test. Specific relief is proposed for transfers of land subject to the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 and transfers to trusts as part of settling Treaty claims. Relief will also be provided for relationship property settlements and transfers on death. This is in line with existing rollover relief provided under the bright-line test. This information sheet provides a brief description of the Government’s proposals. It does not attempt to provide comprehensive coverage. For full details of the proposals refer to the Supplementary Order Paper.
Page 1 of 2 Interest limitation – information sheet 6 September 2021 Changes to the bright-line property rule This information sheet provides general information on the way that proposals the Government is introducing are likely to work. Along with proposals to limit the deductibility of interest, the Government has also proposed the following changes to the bright-line property rule: • a 5-year bright-line property rule for new builds acquired on or after 27 March 2021 • changes to the main home exclusion to ensure the main home is not taxed • changes to how technical transfers of ownership are handled This information sheet provides a quick overview of these proposals. These proposals will be considered by Parliament and may change. The bright-line property rule means that if you sell a residential property you have owned for less than a specified period, you may have to pay income tax on any gain. The bright-line period that applies depends on when the property was acquired: When the property was acquired The bright-line period that applies On or after 27 March 2021 10 years Between 29 March 2018 and 26 March 2021 inclusive 5 years Between 1 October 2015 and 28 March 2018 inclusive 2 years For more information see the property section on Inland Revenue’s website at ird.govt.nz/property New build bright-l ine property rule If you acquire a “new build” on or after 27 March 2021, then a new 5-year bright-line property rule will apply (instead of the 10-year bright-line property rule). You must meet these requirements: • You must acquire the new build no later than 12 months after it receives its code compliance certificate (CCC). • Your new build must have its CCC by the time you sell it. Generally, residential property will be considered a new build where a self-contained residence has been added to land, and it has received a CCC confirming this on or after 27 March 2020. Apart from the difference in length, the same rules that apply for the 10-year bright-line property rule will also apply for the bright-line property rule for new builds. Changes to the main home exclusion The main home exclusion currently ensures the bright-line property rule does not apply to residential land if you use more than half the land for a main home. However, the exclusion doesn’t apply if you use less than half the land for a main home. This means that if you use most of the land for a residential rental property and only have a small main home portion, and then you sell your land during the bright-line period, any gain on sale will be taxed. This happens even though you have a main home on the land. The Government proposes to change the treatment where the main home portion is smaller than the rental property, so that any gain on sale will be apportioned. The gain that relates to the periods the property is used as a main home will not be taxed under the bright-line property rule. The portion of the gain that relates to the rental property would be taxed. This change will apply to all property acquired on or Page 2 of 2 after 27 March 2021. This means it would apply to both the 5-year new build and 10-year bright- line property rules. Technical changes of ownership will not affect the bright-line property rule Proposed rollover relief will allow you to change how you hold a property without triggering the bright-line property rule. When the legal ownership of a property changes but the effective ownership is the same, the transfer will be ignored if it is in one of the prescribed situations. This means the original owner will not be taxed on the realised gain on the property, and the new owner will be treated as having acquired the land when it was acquired by the original owner. Relief will be provided for some transfers to family trusts and for transfers to or from look- through companies and partnerships. Specific relief is proposed for transfers of land subject to the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 and transfers to trusts as part of settling Treaty claims. This is consistent with the relief proposed for interest limitation purposes. Rollover relief will only be provided if the amount received on transfer is equal to or less than the original owner’s acquisition cost. No relief will be provided if the amount received is more, but the original owner will be taxed based on that amount if it is different to the market value of the property. The rollover relief will apply to disposals of residential land occurring on or after 1 April 2022, even if the original date you acquired the property was before the introduction of the bright-line property rule. This information sheet provides a brief description of the Government’s proposals. It does not attempt to provide comprehensive coverage. For full details of the proposals refer to the Supplementary Order Paper.

The closing date for feedback on the proposals was 12 July 2021. Scope of the exemptions Q1. Why are deductions allowed in situations where a tenant or boarder is within the main home, but not when they’re in a separate dwelling on the same title? The interest limitation rules are intended to capture property that can be easily substituted for owner-occupied property. Unlike rental accommodation within the main home, accommodation provided in an identifiably separate dwelling on the same title could be easily converted into an owner-occupied property. Including this kind of property in the interest limitation rules is intended to prevent conversion issues. Q2. Why is apportionment an option for the business premises exclusion under the interest limitation measure but not under the bright-line test? The bright-line test is designed to be just that – a bright line, or an easy to apply rule with clear results. For this reason, the business premises exclusion from the bright-line test works on an all-or-nothing basis. The Government thinks that this approach would not work for the interest limitation rule. Q3. Why is short-stay accommodation in a residential property not carved out along with hotels or motels? Don’t they serve the same purpose? The aim is to put short-stay accommodation in a residential property on the same footing as long-term accommodation – that is, the Government wants to ensure that the income tax rules are the same between the two types of accommodation. A tax advantage for short-stay accommodation might encourage people to convert long-term rental properties to short-stay accommodation. This could have the effect of reducing housing supply for New Zealanders. which would be counter to the Government’s objectives. Q4. Why is short-stay accommodation exempt if it is provided in the main home? The purpose is to make sure that short-stay accommodation is subject to the same tax treatment as long-term accommodation where it is provided in a property that could be used for owner-occupation. In this case, short-stay accommodation provided in a house that is the owner’s main home will be exempt from the interest limitation measure to align the treatment with that of flatmates and boarders. This is on the basis that this kind of accommodation cannot be sold separately from the main home and therefore is not substitutable for owner-occupied housing. 1 Available at https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2021/2021-dd-interest-limitation-and-bright-line-rules 8 Q5. Why are retirement villages exempt from the interest limitation measures? The interest limitation rules are intended to cover property that could be easily substitutable for owner-occupation. Retirement villages do not seem to fall into that category as they are purpose built, and subject to a regulatory framework with legal requirements. Q6. Will a retirement home exemption encourage developers to build retirement homes rather than regular residential properties? We don’t think so. New residential property development will be eligible for the new build exemption and should therefore not be affected by the interest limitation rules. Q7. Will residential investment property owned by Māori organisations besides papakāinga/kaumātua housing be exempt from interest limitation? The Government is not proposing that general residential investment properties (for example, inner city apartment blocks) owned by a Māori organisation be exempt from interest limitation, because in this situation the organisation is acting as a standard commercial landlord. Q8. Has a carve-out been considered for social/community housing? Social and community housing are provided by a number of entities, which are generally tax-exempt (usually charities or local authorities). As such, the Government does not currently consider that a separate carve-out is needed. Q9. Has a carve-out been considered for homeless shelters, refuges, and similar forms of emergency shelter? As these shelters are generally run by tax-exempt entities (usually charities), the Government does not currently consider that a separate carve-out is needed. Q10. Has a carve-out been considered for situations where a person is renting to a family member (for example, parents renting to children as a means of helping them into their first home)? The Government is concerned with reducing inequality and increasing access to the housing market for New Zealanders currently unable to afford their own home. It wouldn’t be fair to provide a tax advantage depending on who a landlord rents a property to, as one of the Government’s objectives is to ensure that every New Zealander has a home to call their own. To help achieve this, all potential tenants should be treated the same from a tax perspective. Community Housing Providers and Kāinga Ora Q11. How will the changes affect community housing providers? Most community housing providers have charitable status, meaning that they pay no tax, and are therefore not affected by the changes. An additional tax exemption is also available for some community housing providers that are not charities. A small number of these providers are not charities or otherwise tax exempt and may be affected by the changes. 9 Q12. How will the changes affect Kāinga Ora? Kāinga Ora and its wholly owned subsidiaries will not be subject to the proposed interest limitation rules. This will ensure that the rules do not impact Kāinga Ora’s provision of public housing. Māori land and housing Q13. What is the impact for Māori land and housing? The discussion document does not contain any specific proposals regarding the application of the tax rules to Māori land. Instead, feedback is sought to determine how the proposals would affect Māori housing (on Māori land and on general title land) and whether different tax treatment is necessary for Māori land. The discussion document notes that a carveout may be appropriate for papakāinga and kaumātua housing, recognising the importance of this housing provision for Māori social and economic outcomes. Feedback is sought on this. Purpose-built rentals Q14. How will interest limitation affect purpose-built rentals? There are no specific proposals in the discussion document regarding the purpose-built rental sector. However, the development exemption (if applicable) and new build exemption will both apply to purpose-built rentals. As such, developers of purpose-built rentals and owners of new purpose-built rentals will be able to continue deducting their interest expenditure in the same way as allowed under current law. Some in the sector have expressed concern that, despite the new build and development exemptions, the interest limitation rules will negatively affect the provision of purpose-built rentals in New Zealand. The sector will have the opportunity to raise these concerns through the consultation. Disposal of property subject to limitation Q15. Why is an exemption being considered for property taxed on sale? It’s a question of fairness. One of the intentions behind the denial of interest deductions for residential investment property is to reduce a current tax advantage for property investors due to all interest being deductible while gains on sale are often not taxable. But where the property is taxed on disposal, not allowing deductions would represent over taxation of income. Consequently, it may be appropriate to allow a degree of interest deductibility. None of the options outlined in chapter five of the discussion document, regarding disposal of property subject to interest limitation would enable full deductions on a current basis, other than the development and new build exemptions. This is to say, all proposed options represent a stricter tax treatment than under the status quo. 10 Full denial of deductions remains an option as that would have the strongest impact on the housing market. Q16. Will the proposals to allow some interest to be deducted on sale reduce the effectiveness of the policy for helping first-home buyers get on the housing market? The proposals recognise that there is a trade-off between housing market objectives and tax policy objectives. These proposals therefore reflect the consideration that if full actual income is taxed then there is less need to permanently disallow interest deductions. The Government is not proposing that we adopt the proposals to allow interest to be deducted on sale; rather, it is seeking feedback through submissions on what people think of the idea considering both housing market and tax policy objectives. Development exemption Q17. Why is there an exemption for property development? One of the Government’s objectives in limiting interest deductibility is to improve the affordability of New Zealand’s housing stock. Lowering demand is one aspect of this, however ensuring ongoing supply is equally important. This means that, in designing the proposed interest limitation, consideration was given to ensuring that none of the proposed changes would discourage activity that increased housing supply. The inclusion of a development exemption is one of the main ways this will be achieved. Q18. Do I have to be a developer to get the development exemption? A property developer will get the development exemption for all properties held on “revenue account” (taxable on sale) under section CB 7 (held as part of a land-owning business). A person could potentially make use of the development exemption if they engage in certain activities on the land (land subdivision or development or erecting buildings) for the purpose of creating one or more new builds (new dwellings). However, other requirements for obtaining an interest deduction, such the requirement that the interest expenditure has sufficient connection with deriving taxable income, will still need to be met to claim the deduction. Q19. Will remediation work qualify for the development exemption? Remediation work undertaken by those in the business of developing property will qualify for this exemption if they hold the property as taxable on sale under section CB 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007. We invite submissions on whether remediation work undertaken by those not in the business of developing property should qualify for the development exemption. Remediation work may be linked to prolonging the life of the building/making it habitable which adds to supply in the long term. Renovations that are not substantial, such as renovating a kitchen, may not qualify for this exemption. Comments are invited on where the line between cosmetic remediation and prolonging the life of the building is drawn. 11 Q20. What happens if I buy land without the intent to develop it but later do? While there is no intention of developing the land then the development exemption does not apply. However, a development exemption could apply if the use changes and the land is developed. Submissions are invited on when the interest should become deductible, for example, from when the development activity begins, and how this is determined. Q21. Does the exemption still apply if I hold the land on capital account? The development exemption will apply whether the property is held on capital or revenue account. Different tests may be used for determining whether the exemption applies, but the intent of both tests is that property development that adds to housing supply should qualify (provided the interest is otherwise deductible under ordinary principles). Q22. Does the exemption still apply if I develop the properties for the purpose of holding them to rent out? Yes. The exemption applies irrespective of whether the development is undertaken for the purpose of sale or for renting out by the person who develops the property. New build exemption – questions relevant to both the bright-line test and interest limitation Q23. Why exempt new builds – is it fair to favour one class of investors over others? The Government wants to encourage the supply of new housing. The extended bright-line test and interest limitation rule, if applied to new build investment property, could disrupt the supply of new homes by reducing demand. The new build exemption is intended to encourage investment in new build properties instead of existing properties. This will be helpful in freeing up existing property for first home buyers to purchase. Q24. What is a new build? Will significant improvements bringing up a property to the same standard as a new build qualify? Generally, a new build would be defined as a self-contained dwelling that receives its code compliance certificate on or after 27 March 2021, or is acquired on or after 27 March but received its code compliance certificate in the last 12 months. The new build exemption and five-year new build bright-line are intended to apply to new builds that clearly increase housing stock, so the Government proposes that renovations which bring a property up to the standard of a new build would not qualify. It may be difficult to distinguish between renovations that add to housing stock and those that do not. However, the Government is consulting on this issue, and is interested in any tools that could be used to verify that a once uninhabitable dwelling has been renovated to the standard of a new build. Q25. Does a ‘new build’ only include brand new houses? No. It is proposed that a ‘new build’ would generally only include self-contained dwellings that are added to residential land and receive their code compliance certificates on or after 27 March 2021. A ‘new build’ could be constructed on site, or it could be constructed off 12 site and then added to the land (for example, a modular home), and could make use of existing materials. That means a ‘new build’ could include an existing dwelling that has been relocated, an existing dwelling that is converted into multiple dwellings, or a commercial building that is converted into residential dwellings. Q26. How will the rules be enacted and when will they apply from? Legislation will be introduced shortly before 1 October 2021, which is when the rules apply from. The legislation will be enacted by 31 March 2022. New build exemption from interest limitation Q27. I bought a property off the plans on the 10th of March 2021. It hasn’t been completed yet – will I get the new build exemption? If you acquire a property off the plans and it receives its code compliance certificate on or after 27 March 2021, it is proposed that you would qualify for the new build exemption. Q28. If I buy a new build that received its code compliance certificate (CCC) before 27 March 2021, am I eligible for the new build exemption? It depends on when you buy the new build. If you bought the new build before 27 March 2021, then it is proposed that you wouldn’t be eligible for the new build exemption. On the other hand, if you buy the new build on or after 27 March 2021 and within 12 months of the new build receiving its CCC, then it is proposed that you would be eligible for the exemption. However, a subsequent purchaser (who acquires the new build more than 12 months after its code compliance certificate is issued) would not qualify for the new build exemption. Q29. I have bought a large house that I want to convert into multiple units. Will I get the new build exemption? Yes. If the house is converted into multiple self-contained dwellings (which means they have to have separate access, as well as their own kitchens and bathrooms) then we propose that you would qualify for the new build exemption. Even though you are making use of an existing structure, you are adding to housing supply by enabling more households to live in a building which may previously have only accommodated one household. Q30. If I bought residential land before 27 March 2021 but added a new build to the land after 27 March 2021, can I claim the new build exemption for the new build? Yes. You would be able to deduct interest (provided the interest would have been deductible in the absence of the limitation rules), as long as the new build receives its code compliance certificate on or after 27 March 2021. The new build exemption generally only applies where a dwelling is added to residential land and receives its code compliance certificate on or after 27 March 2021. The date of acquisition would not be relevant if a property receives its code compliance certificate on or after 27 March 2021. Q31. If I live in my property will I no longer get the new build exemption? You cannot get interest deductions where there is no income earning activity (for example, if you are living in a residential property without any flatmates, or you are using it as your 13 holiday home). We are consulting on whether private use of a new build would preclude the owner and any subsequent owners from claiming the new build exemption at a later date (for example, if the property is rented out again in the future). It is proposed that your use of the property would not affect whether you can access the five-year new build bright-line test, but the main home exclusion could apply if you are living in the property. Q32. If the new build exemption applies to subsequent purchasers, how do I know if I qualify? This depends on whether the private use of a new build prevents it being eligible for the new build exemption, which is something the Government is consulting on. If it does, then a purchaser would need to determine two things: 1. When the code compliance certificate was issued for the new build – was it issued on or after 27 March, and are you acquiring the property within the fixed period that the exemption applies to subsequent purchasers? (For example, if the exemption applies for 20 years, are you acquiring the new build within 20 years of the new build receiving its code compliance certificate?) 2. Whether the new build has ever been used privately, for example if it has been owner occupied or used as a bach. Q33. Why can’t a property that qualified for the development exemption while being renovated be considered a new build when bought by an investor? The new build exemption is generally only available where a new dwelling has been added to land. While renovations may increase the life of a building, it could be administratively difficult to determine when a renovation is sufficiently significant to qualify for the new build exemption, which is why it is proposed that dwellings that have just been renovated without resulting in the creation of a new dwelling would not be eligible for the new build exemption. Q34. What interest deductions can I claim if I add a new build to my land? Is it just interest on the loan to construct the new build? It is proposed that any interest that would have been deductible before the interest limitation rules were introduced would continue to be deductible for new builds. This includes interest on the loan to construct the new build, interest on borrowings to acquire the land that the new build is on, and interest on loans to cover expenses such as maintenance, rates, and insurance that relate to the new build. However, such interest would only be deductible under the new build exemption after the code compliance certificate is issued, and where there is sufficient connection with deriving assessable income. Q35. What happens if I don’t qualify for the new build exemption? If you don’t qualify for the new build exemption, and you acquired your property on or after 27 March 2021, then you will not be able to deduct interest from 1 October 2021 and a ten- year bright-line test will apply to that property. If you acquired your property before 27 March 2021 then interest for that property will be phased out over four years, from 1 October 2021, as set out in Table 1. 14 Table 1: Interest claimable from 1 October 2021 for properties acquired before 27 March 2021 Date interest incurred Percent of interest you can claim 1 April 2020–31 March 2021 100% 1 April 2021–31 March 2022 (transitional year) 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021 – 100% 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022 – 75% 1 April 2022–31 March 2023 75% 1 April 2023–31 March 2024 50% 1 April 2024–31 March 2025 25% From 1 April 2025 onwards 0% Q36. Does buying bare land with the intention of building on it qualify for the new build exemption? Where you add a new build to land, it is proposed that the new build exemption would apply from the date the new build’s code compliance certificate is issued, provided the new build is being used to derive assessable income. However, the development exemption may apply while you are building the property. Q37. How long will the new build exemption apply for? The Government is consulting on how long the exemption should apply for and are considering three options. 1. The first option is for the exemption to apply in perpetuity for an initial or early owner of a new build, so the exemption would apply for the entire time they retain their interest in the land. An early owner is a person who adds a new build to their land or acquires a new build no later than 12 months after its code compliance certificate is issued. 2. The second option is for the exemption to apply in perpetuity for an initial or early owner, and for a fixed period for subsequent purchasers (for example, ten or twenty years from the date a new build’s code compliance certificate is issued). 3. The third option is for the exemption to apply for a fixed period for both initial or early owners and subsequent purchasers. For properties with code compliance certificates issued before 27 March, it is proposed that the exemption would only apply to a person who acquires such a new build on or after 27 March provided the new build received its code compliance certificate within 12 months of the date of acquisition. It is proposed that subsequent purchasers (who acquire such a new build more than 12 months after it receives its code compliance certificate) would not have access to the exemption. Q38. Will the new build exemption cover properties built recently, such as in the last two years? It is proposed that the new build exemption would only apply to a new build that receives its code compliance certificate on or after 27 March 2021. A transitional rule would apply for new builds acquired on or after 27 March 2021 that received their code compliance 15 certificates before this date, provided the new build is acquired no later than 12 months after its code compliance certificate is issued. However, a subsequent purchaser (who acquires such a new build more than 12 months after it receives its code compliance certificate) would not qualify for the new build exemption. New builds and the bright-line test Q39. I bought residential land in 2019 and added a new build to the land in 2022, what bright-line test applies to me? Which bright-line test applies depends on when the original plot of land was acquired, even if a new build is later added to the land or the land is subdivided. The previous five-year bright-line test would apply to land acquired in 2019, not the five-year new build bright-line test. Q40. I bought a property in May 2021 that I am renting out. It is on a large section and I want to add a new build to the land. Would the new build bright-line test apply to my entire section? We propose that only the portion of the land attributable to the new build would be subject to the five-year new build bright-line test. Existing tax principles for apportionment would apply to determine the amount of gains taxed on sale. Q41. I entered into a conditional agreement to purchase a newly-built property on 22 March 2021, conditions were satisfied on 30 March 2021, and settlement occurred on 20 April 2021. A code compliance certificate for the property was issued before 27 March 2021. What bright-line test applies? Which bright-line test applies depends on when you acquired the property. A property is ‘acquired’ when the sale and purchase agreement for the property is entered into. Since you acquired the property before 27 March 2021, the previous five-year bright-line test will apply. Rollover – interest limitation Q42. What does rollover relief in the context of interest limitation mean? Rollover relief for interest limitation involves disregarding transfers or disposals of residential property in defined circumstances. For land acquired before 27 March 2021 by the person disposing of it, rollover relief would enable the new owner to continue to deduct a portion of their interest expense until 31 March 2025. If the proposed exemption for new builds from interest limitation is to apply in perpetuity to early owners and rollover relief is to apply to some transfers of these properties, rollover relief would enable the new owner to deduct all their interest expense relating to the property. Q43. What rollover relief is being proposed for interest limitation? As is the case with the rollover relief proposed in relation to the bright-line test, rollover relief for interest limitation is proposed for some disposals of land to yourself, to a family trust, to a look-through company or partnership, or to a Māori authority where it is a trust. 16 Rollover relief for interest limitation is also proposed where a residential property is transferred upon the death of its owner (that is, from the deceased’s estate to a beneficiary of the estate) and where residential property is transferred under a relationship property agreement or as part of a company amalgamation. Q44. Can I transfer land between different companies I own without being subject to interest limitation? The proposed relief only applies to companies that have elected to become look-through companies. Q45. Are there any differences between the rollover relief proposed for the bright-line test and the proposed interest limitation rollover relief? Rollover relief would only apply for the purposes of the bright-line rules when there is zero consideration for a transfer of residential property. Under the proposed interest limitation rules, rollover relief will still be provided if there is consideration for the transfer. Rollover – bright-line Q46. Does rollover relief provide an exemption from the bright-line test? No it is not an exemption. Rollover relief essentially means that a transfer is ignored so that no income tax is payable at that time and instead, taxation is deferred until a later disposal. When the property is eventually sold or disposed of, the original owner’s date of acquisition will be used to determine whether the sale of the land was within the relevant bright-line period. If it was, the original owner’s acquisition cost will then be used to determine the net gain. Generally, the bright-line test provides that an amount derived on “disposing of residential land” is income of the person – the amount being at least the market value of the land. Rollover only deems the person disposing of the land to be disposing of it for cost – when combined with the corresponding deduction, the disposer should not be required to pay any tax in relation to the disposal. The person acquiring the land is deemed to have acquired the land for the original owner’s cost, and acquired it on the date the original owner initially acquired the land. If the acquiror then disposes of the land within the bright-line period (that is, within the relevant number of years since the date the disposer initially acquired the land) they will be taxed on any net gain from that disposal. Q47. Will there still be an exemption for disposals of land on the death of a person (that is, inherited land)? Yes. Inherited properties are provided an exemption from income tax under the bright-line test. This is not changing. Q48. What are the new types of disposals that are being proposed to receive rollover relief? Rollover relief is being proposed for some disposals of land to yourself, to a family trust, to a look-through company or partnership, or to a Māori authority (where it is a trust). 17 Q49. How does the bright-line test work if I want to transfer a house into a family trust? At the moment, settling a residential property on a family trust can trigger the bright-line test. Even if you purchased your property before the bright-line test was introduced, transferring a property to a family trust could bring you into the bright-line test. We are proposing to provide rollover relief (that is, ignore the transfer) for certain disposals of residential property to a trust, where the following conditions are met: • every settlor of the land is also a beneficiary • at least one of settlors of the land is a principal settlor of the trust, and • every beneficiary (excluding the beneficiaries who are also principal settlors) is associated with a principal settlor. Q50. Why are there conditions on when land can be transferred to a trust? The Government is primarily concerned with providing relief for disposals to family trusts. Therefore, the rules are designed to limit relief to trusts set up for the benefit of the family of the principal settlor. Q51. What protections are there around the proposed trust relief to stop circumvention of the bright-line test? In addition to the general conditions required to be met to gain rollover, the general anti- avoidance provisions and the land-rich trust avoidance rule will apply to some trust arrangements intended to avoid the operation of the bright-line test. This could include where beneficiaries were appointed after the disposal of land to the trust for the purpose of circumventing the bright-line test and would deem the trustee(s) to have disposed of the land at market value. Q52. What about if parents want to gift (or sell at cost) residential property to their children to help them get onto the property ladder? Currently, the proposals do not include relief for such disposals as the proposals focus on transactions where there is no underlying change in ownership, aside from the legal structure used. Due to the complexity surrounding the large range of disposals and situations in which it may or may not be desirable to provide rollover relief, these sorts of arrangements are out of scope and not considered in the discussion document. However, the Government is interested in looking at such issues at a later date. Q53. Do the proposals allow me to transfer land to a look-through company without triggering the bright-line test? The Government proposes that rollover relief would also apply where property is transferred between a look-through company and its owners, so long as the property continues to be owned in the same proportions. Q54. Do the proposals allow me to transfer land to a partnership without triggering the bright-line test? The Government proposes that rollover relief would also apply where property is transferred between being partnership property and being personal property of the partners, so long as the property continues to be owned in the same proportions. 18 Q55. Can I transfer land between different companies I own? The proposed relief only applies to companies that have elected to become look-through companies. Companies that have not made such an election would continue to be subject to the bright-line test on transfers of residential land between companies. Q56. How do these proposals affect Māori collectively owned land? Trusts that have elected to be Māori authorities would be entitled to rollover relief. The applicable conditions for these types for entities will likely be different than the conditions for family trusts given the different uses and purposes for trusts that own Māori collectively- owned land. The Government is interested in hearing from submitters about how rollover relief could work in this case and what some of the design features could look like. Q57. Will a company (that is a Māori authority) be able to access rollover relief? The proposals as they currently stand would not provide rollover relief to a company which has elected to be a Māori authority given the complexity surrounding transfers to and from companies. However, the Government is seeking feedback on to what extent the bright-line test affects Māori authorities which are companies and other issues that arise in the administration and governance of Treaty settlement land. Entities Q58. Why is it proposed that some large companies will not have to apply the interest limitation rules? Won’t this allow people to get around the rules by forming large companies? Large companies will still have to apply the rules if more than 50% of their assets by value are residential property. Some large companies are not in the business of renting out residential property but might own small amounts of residential property incidental to their core business. We want to make sure such businesses are not affected by the rules. Q59. How was a 50% threshold for residential investment property-rich companies settled on? The 50% threshold is consistent with the existing “residential-land rich” threshold in the residential loss ring-fencing rules, so taxpayers may already be familiar with it. We wanted to set the threshold at a level so that companies clearly under the threshold will not have to incur compliance and valuation costs in making sure they are below the threshold at all points during the year. Q60. Why are properties exempt from the interest limitation rules (new builds and property under development) still counted as residential investment property under the 50% threshold? Two reasons: • The threshold is aimed at removing compliance costs and providing certainty for companies that hold residential investment property incidental to their core business. A company with mostly new builds still has a core business involving residential 19 investment property so should still have to trace to work out which interest deductions are limited. • If the exemptions cease (for example, new build exemption expires or development stops), the company will have to work out how to allocate its interest. It may not be able to do this unless it had traced its borrowings to the properties initially. Q61. Why is it proposed that Kāinga Ora will be excluded from the rules? Even though Kāinga Ora provides social housing, Kāinga Ora is a Crown agency and not a charity or a “registered community housing provider”. Unlike other social housing providers, it therefore cannot benefit from existing tax exemptions for charities and registered community housing providers. Kāinga Ora also undertakes some property development and building activity. Interest deductions relating to these activities should be covered by the development exemption anyway. So excluding Kāinga Ora will mean that it won’t have to restructure its borrowings to ensure that most/all of its interest deductions relate to development/building (and are therefore allowed), rather than providing social housing (and therefore limited, in the absence of an exclusion). Interest allocation Q62. Why is tracing the preferred approach? Tracing is the preferred approach because it ensures that if you borrow to buy a residential investment property, your interest deductions will be limited; but if you borrow to invest in your business, your interest deductions will be allowed. It is also simpler than introducing a new approach because it is currently used by most taxpayers (other than companies) so many people will already be familiar with it. Q63. Tracing is too complex for “mums and dads”. Tracing is complex for large businesses with many different types of assets and sources of funds. It is not that complex for the average “mum and dad” investor with just one or two residential properties. People can also make tracing easier by having separate loans for separate purposes. The Government would like feedback on what aspects could be improved to make it simpler. Q64. Looking at whether the loan is secured against a residential property instead might be simpler than tracing. Many small business owners borrow against their home or a rental property to fund their businesses and the Government doesn’t want to limit interest deductions in these cases. Also, many banks’ mortgage agreements will say that the security given for a loan will secure any existing and future loans the borrower has with that bank. So loans can’t sensibly be linked to a particular property by seeing what it’s secured against. Q65. What can I do if I have an existing loan that I can’t trace? The discussion document proposes two transitional approaches for taxpayers in this situation: apportionment based on original cost or stacking/ordering based on market values. 20 The approaches are aimed at making compliance easier for taxpayers with pre-27 March loans. The Government welcomes suggestions of alternative approaches. Q66. Won’t tracing mean that rich people can get around the rules by borrowing to fund other business assets instead of borrowing to fund residential property? There are pros and cons to each interest allocation approach. We chose tracing to make sure that if people borrow to invest in their business, their interest deductions will not be affected. It is also more intuitive and already used by most taxpayers. Q67. Why is there no phasing-out of interest deductions for loans in foreign currency? There would be a lot of complexity in making rules for foreign currency loans and few people have foreign currency loans. If a person wants to have the same treatment as a New Zealand dollar loan they can refinance their loan to be in New Zealand dollars. Q68. Won’t it be very difficult to work out what proportion of my interest will be deductible if I had a loan before 27 March and have made repayments and drawdowns on it since then? The high water mark proposal means people who use a loan only to finance their rental property, or properties, acquired before 27 March will be able to deduct all of their interest (subject to phasing) provided the loan balance doesn’t increase after 27 March. Q69. Why can’t I apply the high water mark across my whole portfolio of loans? The proposal can be applied to each loan rather than adding them together. This reduces the complexity of the rules and still allows rental property owners to not have to trace their expenditure when they stay under the high water mark. Q70. Why is the high water mark so complex? Officials have designed the rule to reduce the complexity as much as possible. By having a loan finance only residential rental properties acquired before 27 March 2021 and keeping the loan balance under the high water mark, a person won’t need to worry about the finer detail of the rules and also won’t need to trace new borrowing for the next four years which should reduce their compliance costs. But as with all aspects of the design proposals, we are undertaking consultation to see if the proposals can be improved on or simplified. Interposed entities Q71. Why are such complex rules required? The interposed entity rules are required to support the integrity of the interest limitation rules, by ensuring that people cannot get around limitation by borrowing to indirectly fund residential property. Most people will not have interposed entity structures so will not be affected by the rules. The interposed entity rules would limit interest deductions on loans used to buy shares. How is this consistent with the Government’s earlier promise that it would only limit interest deductions on loans used for residential property? 21 The rules would only limit interest deductions if the loan to buy the shares indirectly funds residential property. Limiting interest on such loans, to the extent they fund residential property, is consistent with the Government’s promise to limit deductions on loans used for residential property. Q72. What should I do if I already have an existing interposed entity? It might be possible to restructure the entity’s funding so that the interposed entities rules do not apply. A private ruling can be obtained from Inland Revenue to confirm how the taxation laws apply to any restructuring arrangement. You may wish to consult a tax professional about your particular situation. Q73. Why is the affected assets percentage for close companies and trusts 10% and 50% for all other types of interposed entities? The reason is because an apportionment approach is proposed for close companies and trusts, so that only a portion of interest deductions are denied, based on how much residential property the entity holds. In contrast, full denial is proposed for widely held interposed entities over the 50% threshold. Further explanation: Close companies and trusts are controlled by a small group of people, so the owners will usually be closer to their day-to-day operations and more able to get the information needed to apply an apportionment approach. A 10% threshold is proposed for these entities so that if they own small amounts of residential property, the rules will not apply. A simpler approach is proposed for widely held interposed entities, as owners of such entities typically do not have the same level of control as owners of closely held entities. A 50% threshold is appropriate so that interest is only denied when a widely held entity mostly holds residential property (but interest will be denied in full, not apportioned). Helping family members with their first homes Q74. I took out a mortgage to lend money to a family member for a deposit on their home. I pay tax on the interest income I am charging my family member and I currently claim deductions for the interest I pay to the bank. Am I affected by the interest limitation rules? No. The interest limitation rules apply to loans used to derive income from residential investment property (for example, rental income or income from sale of the property). Your loan is not used to derive income from residential investment property. Q75. I increased the mortgage on my home in order to gift some money to a family member for a deposit on their home. Am I affected by the interest limitation rules? No. Under current law, interest expenditure involved in making a private gift is not deductible. The interest limitation rules would not affect this. 22 Q76. I want to help my family member get on the housing ladder. I intend to borrow to buy a house to rent to my family member, and maybe sell it to them in the future once they’ve saved up more money. No special exemptions are proposed for property that is rented to family members, so the interest limitation rules would apply. If the house is a new build, you may be able to claim interest deductions against your rental income. There may also be other ways of helping your family member that do not fall within the interest limitation rules. There may also be bright- line consequences that apply when and if you do sell the house. We suggest consulting a tax advisor. Q77. I am a guarantor on a loan that my family member used to buy their home. Am I affected by the interest limitation rules? No. As a guarantor, you generally will not incur interest expenditure. Even if you did, your interest expenditure cannot be deducted under current law anyway as it does not relate to any taxable income.

New Zealand’s poor performance on productivity has been a longstanding concern. An important question is whether New Zealand’s tax settings are a significant contributor. Despite other public sector work on productivity, there has not been any broad analysis of the effects of taxes on inbound investment and their impacts on investment and productivity. 2. Questions of how best to address weak productivity and poor economic performance are complex and there is unlikely to be a single ‘silver bullet’. Many other important productivity issues could be considered including: • competition policy and the degree of monopoly power • migration settings and incentives for firms to invest in productivity improving technology or bring in cheaper labour, and • broader policy settings which may affect the housing market and incentives to invest there. 3. Despite other public sector work on productivity, there has not been any broad analysis of the effects of taxes on productivity. There are likely to be many channels through which taxes affect productivity, but one that will be an important influence of the level of New Zealand’s capital stock is taxes on inbound investment and their impacts on investment. 4. The long-term insights briefing (LTIB) we propose is looking at one particular set of issues. It should be noted that agencies are also looking at productivity issues in their LTIBs, including for example, the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment’s LTIB on The future of business for Aotearoa New Zealand. 1 Our LTIB is narrower but aims to be complementary to and supportive of other work in this area. 5. Work on this topic has been facilitated by work at the OECD which allows us to benchmark how tax provisions are likely to be affecting costs of capital (for example, hurdle rates of return on inbound investment) in New Zealand compared with impacts in other OECD countries. Analysing the effects of taxes on costs of capital will allow us to document the likely cumulative effects of tax changes in New Zealand. It will also help in examining the pros and cons of possible future business tax changes which may impact on costs of capital, capital accumulation and productivity. 1 Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (2021), The future of business for Aotearoa New Zealand: Opportunities and implications for productivity and wellbeing, available at https://www.mbie.govt.nz/dmsdocument/15644-the-future-of-business-for-aotearoa-new-zealand- opportunities-and-implications-for-productivity-and-wellbeing 6 6. We are proposing that Inland Revenue’s 2022 LTIB focuses on tax, investment and productivity. We are seeking input from the public on the topics we are proposing to cover in our LTIB. Background 7. Alongside the Treasury, Inland Revenue provides advice to the Ministers of Finance and of Revenue on the tax and social policies administered through the tax system. As part of providing advice, Inland Revenue has an important stewardship role to ensure that we are well placed to advise present and future governments on tax policy issues which are likely to be of vital interest to New Zealand in the future. 8. Under the Public Service Act 2020 there is a new legislative requirement for public service chief executives to undertake public consultation on the topics to be included in an LTIB as well as on a draft of the briefing. 2 This is required to happen at least once every three years. 9. The purpose of a briefing is to make available to the public: • information about medium and long-term trends, risks, and opportunities that affect or may affect New Zealand society, and • information and impartial analysis, including policy options for responding to the trends, risks and opportunities that have been identified. 10. This is Inland Revenue’s first long term insights briefing and the aim of this paper is to consult the public on the subject matter which should be included in the briefing. What do you think? 11. We are seeking your feedback on the proposed topics outlined in this document for our 2022 long-term insights briefing on tax, investment and productivity. 12. Please indicate whether officials from Inland Revenue may contact you to discuss the points raised, if required. 13. The closing date for submission on the topics to be covered in our LTIB is 6 September 2021. 14. Submissions may be made: • by email to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “LTIB topics” in the subject line, or • by post to: LTIB topics c/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 2 See schedule 6, clauses 8 and 9 of the Public Service Act 2020. 7 15. Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of responses on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. If you consider that any part of your submission should properly be withheld under the Act please clearly indicate this. 16. There will be a further opportunity to provide feedback when Inland Revenue’s draft LTIB is put out for consultation in early 2022. The LTIB will then be finalised and provided to the House of Representatives in mid-2022. Proposed scope of the LTIB 17. Inland Revenue is proposing to focus its 2022 LTIB on tax and its impact on investment and productivity. Investment and productivity are important factors affecting long-term living standards in New Zealand. 18. Our suggested LTIB aims to obtain a better understanding of how taxes are likely to be affecting costs of capital and the likely implications for inbound investment, productivity and economic performance. It also aims to seek views on the merits of reducing costs of capital and making these more uniform and of the pros and cons of different ways of achieving this, should this become a future priority. It considers the possibility that New Zealand may be getting out of line with tax treatments in other countries and that this may be reducing economic performance and well-being in New Zealand. 19. Taxing income generated by inbound investment helps generate government tax revenue to finance government spending. At the same time it will tend to increase costs of capital, lower New Zealand’s capital stock and put downward pressure on wages because with less capital stock labour will become less productive. The main way that this happens is through taxes imposed at the company level. Non-neutral taxes which result in variability of costs of capital across different types of investment can reduce economic performance further if they encourage firms to invest because of the tax benefits rather than on the basis of the best underlying returns. Key trends and issues The company tax rate 20. In the late 1980s and early 1990s New Zealand had a relatively low company tax rate compared to most other OECD countries which, other things equal, will have made New Zealand a relatively attractive place to invest. Since then there has been an ongoing trend for OECD countries to cut their company tax rates prompted by concerns about promoting investment (or at least not discouraging it too much) and Key question to consider • Is tax and its impact on investment and productivity a worthwhile subject to investigate further through an LTIB? 8 reducing international tax avoidance pressures. These tax avoidance pressures are most pressing in countries with relatively high company tax rates. 21. Most other OECD countries have cut their company tax rates more than New Zealand and our relative company tax rate has increased despite cuts in our company tax rate in 2008 and 2011. This is shown in figure 1. 3 In 2020 New Zealand had the ninth highest company tax rate of the 38 OECD countries at that time (combining taxes levied at different levels of government if more than one level of government imposes company tax). Substantial cuts in company tax rates have occurred in non-OECD countries as well. Figure 1: Company tax rates in NZ and some other OECD countries 4 22. The fact that many other countries have been cutting company tax rates more quickly than New Zealand does not necessarily mean that New Zealand should follow suit. As the New Zealand Productivity Commission has stated “New Zealand’s disappointing productivity performance has held back its standard of living, and wellbeing more generally. New Zealand’s productivity performance has continued to lag despite various significant policy efforts, which highlights how difficult it is to lift national productivity. This decades-old problem has persisted through large structural changes in the economy.” 5 This includes times when New Zealand’s company tax rate has been relatively low and when it has been relatively 3 Data for figures 1 to 6 are available on the OECD website at https://stats.oecd.org/ Data for figure 1 was supplemented by some additional information for early years provided to us by the OECD but which is not available on their website. 4 This is OECD data and combines taxes on company profits levied at all levels of government. For example, the United States company tax rate is 25.8% in 2020 which combines a federal company tax rate of 19% with tax levied at the State level. 5 New Zealand Productivity Commission (2021), New Zealand Firms: Reaching for the Frontier, April, page 1, available at https://www.productivity.govt.nz/assets/Documents/Final-report-Frontier-firms.pdf 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 19811983198519871989199119931995199719992001200320052007200920112013201520172019 AustraliaCanada New ZealandUnited Kingdom United StatesOECD unweighted average OECD weighted average 9 high. But it is nonetheless sensible to examine whether New Zealand’s tax settings are the most appropriate. 23. It should also be noted that there may be some movement back towards higher company tax rates internationally. For example, the United Kingdom has announced an intention to increase its company tax rate from 19% to 25%, the United States has announced its intention to increase its Federal company tax rate from 19% to 28% and, most recently, 130 out of 139 jurisdictions have signed up to a new international tax framework promoted by the OECD which would result in a global minimum company tax rate of 15%. Many countries are examining how best to repair their fiscal positions after having responded to COVID-19 and this may reduce the downward pressure on company tax rates. 24. The company tax rate is only one of a much broader set of tax considerations that can influence incentives to invest. Measures such as tax depreciation provisions, other tax incentives such as New Zealand’s R&D Tax Incentive and thin capitalisation rules (which constrain the ability of firms to deduct their interest payments) can all impact on hurdle rates of return and affect investment. Effective marginal tax rates 25. The OECD has attempted to measure the overall effects of tax provisions on incentives to invest taking account of not only the company tax rate but also tax depreciation provisions. The OECD measures do not take account of more detailed tax provisions which are harder to analyse such as thin capitalisation provisions. The OECD reports a range of possible measures including effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) under a range of macroeconomic assumptions. The higher the EMTRs, the higher the hurdle rates of return will tend to be. Results under their high interest rate and high inflation assumptions are reported in figure 2 for OECD countries in 2019, the latest year for which data are available. Figure 2: Composite EMTRs for OECD countries in 2019 26. By the OECD’s estimates, New Zealand was at the high end of composite EMTRs in 2019 for OECD countries although not as high as some other countries including Australia. At the same time, New Zealand had very high estimated costs of capital and EMTRs for some categories of asset including non-residential buildings (highest EMTRs) and inventories (third highest EMTRs).

Foreign direct investment and outbound direct investment 27. In its recent report on frontier firms, the New Zealand Productivity Commission suggests that attracting high-quality foreign direct investment (FDI) and outbound direct investment (ODI) are both critical for very high performing frontier firms to develop in small advanced economies. 6 Figure 3 shows how FDI as a percentage of GDP has been flat or declining in New Zealand whereas it has generally been growing in other OECD countries including Australia and the United Kingdom. Figure 3: FDI as a percentage of GDP 6 New Zealand Productivity Commission (2021), New Zealand Firms: Reaching for the Frontier, op cit. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 2007200820092010201120122013201420152016201720182019 AustraliaNew ZealandUnited KingdomOECD 11 28. As is shown in figure 4 New Zealand’s ODI has been particularly weak. Figure 4: ODI as a percentage of GDP Economic performance 29. In 1950 New Zealand’s GDP per capita was very similar to that of Australia and the United States. 7 OECD data indicates that by 1970 New Zealand’s GDP per capita had fallen to 75% of that in the United States. There had also been a decline in Australia (although a much smaller decline) to around 89% of US GDP per capita. 30. Since 1970 there were further declines in GDP per capita relative to the US until the early 1990s. After that our relative decline appears to have halted and OECD data suggests some small recovery over the last 15 years. But our levels of GDP per capita are much lower than they once were relative to the United States, Australia and many other countries. This is shown in figure 5. 7 In Productivity by the Numbers, May 2021, page 21, available at https://www.productivity.govt.nz/research/productivity-by-the-numbers/ , the New Zealand Productivity Commission provides a longer time series which goes back to 1950 using Conference Board Total Economy Data. This suggests that New Zealand’s GDP per capita declined from 101% to 67% of US GDP over the period 1950 to 2019. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 2007200820092010201120122013201420152016201720182019 AustraliaNew ZealandUnited KingdomOECD 12 Figure 5: Real GDP per capita relative to the US 31. As the New Zealand Productivity Commission has pointed out, our relative levels of GDP per capita look better than they would otherwise look because of hours of work increasing in New Zealand relative to the United States. Labour productivity (GDP per hour worked) has shown no significant sign of recovery. Labour productivity in New Zealand is now 60% of what it is in the United States and lower than what it was (as a percentage of US labour productivity) in the early 1990s as is shown in figure 6.

The first part of the LTIB will be aiming to establish the facts. We will benchmark costs of capital and EMTRs in New Zealand against other countries drawing on work of the OECD. However, we will also be aiming to explore what has happened in New Zealand over a longer period of time (the last 20 years rather than the much shorter period available in the OECD analysis). 8 We will also be looking to at least touch on a broader set of tax changes than those included in the OECD study, including some likely effects of changes in the thin capitalisation provisions. Our analysis for New Zealand is also intended to be helpful in analysing the effects of possible tax changes. 33. The aim of the briefing is to open up the question of whether or not New Zealand’s business tax settings have been part of the reason for New Zealand’s relatively poor productivity performance. We will discuss ways in which tax settings can impact on investment and productivity. An important focus will be on FDI by foreign- owned firms. However, we are also interested in the impacts on other New Zealand firms including companies listed on the NZX and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) which may have little or no foreign shareholding. 34. Measures which lower costs of capital and EMTRs on inbound investment and which make these more uniform are likely to be helpful in improving productivity and economic performance. However, governments will have important distributional goals for the tax system as well as concerns about economic efficiency and productivity. 35. There are many ways of lowering costs of capital which can have different distributional effects. For example, lowering the company tax rate by itself could make it harder for the Government to levy as progressive an income tax on individuals (because high income earners may be able to shelter their income in companies and have this taxed at the company rate rather than at higher personal tax rates). There are obviously measures aimed at maintaining or increasing progressivity which could accompany measures reducing costs of capital such as increasing taxes at the shareholder level. 36. The briefing will be seeking feedback on the pros and cons of different possible approaches which might lower costs of capital and whether these are likely to be improvements on the status quo. Possible measures which might lower costs of capital are likely to include: • reductions in the company tax rate 8 See the data available at https://stats.oecd.org/ under Public Sector, Taxation and Market Regulation » Taxation » Corporate Tax Statistics » Effective Tax Rates. Key question to consider • Are there other global tax trends that are critical to this study which should be considered? 14 • measures which increase the present value of capital write offs for capital expenditure • measures to take account of inflation to reduce overstatements or understatements of capital income • changes to thin-capitalisation rules which might allow multinational firms to claim greater deductions for interest expense • changes to allow multinational firms or other firms with foreign shareholders a notional interest deduction on their equity • specific incentives for particular types of investment or specific types of business, and • more fundamental changes in the tax base such as the dual income tax structure adopted in Nordic countries with a relatively low flat marginal tax rate on capital income with higher progressive tax rates on labour income. 37. It will also be important to consider how these changes might affect the neutrality of tax settings. There will be other issues to consider as well. For example, to what extent should tax reforms in New Zealand be influenced by what is happening in other countries including whether company tax rates are decreasing or increasing? At end of the day many factors will influence future tax policy settings including concerns about the progressivity and integrity of the overall tax system. The aim of the briefing is not to resolve all of these issues but to attempt to benchmark New Zealand’s setting against other countries and to seek views on the merits of reducing the cost of capital on inbound investment and the pros and cons of different ways of achieving this should this become a pressing priority in the future. Key questions to consider • Are these sensible policy options to consider? • Are there other reforms which should also be considered?

Proposing Ministers Minister of Finance, Minister of Revenue Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? Summarise in one or two sentences COVID-19 related public health restrictions at Alert Level 2 or above can create short and severe economic shocks. Cumulatively, they stress firm balance sheets and risk delivering unequitable outcomes. The effects of these shocks on firm revenue, coupled with uncertainty of the nature of Government support in the event of a virus resurgence, risks higher unemployment and firm failure as firms are disincentivised from or unable to employ people or invest. Summary of Preferred Option or Conclusion (if no preferred option) How will the agency’s preferred approach work to bring about the desired change? Why is this the preferred option? Why is it feasible? Is the preferred approach likely to be reflected in the Cabinet paper? Summarise in one or two sentences The recommended approach was to introduce and pre-announce a new one-off Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) available to all firms in the event of an increase from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2, 3, or 4. The recommended sub-options were: -To make the RSP available to all firms that experience a drop in revenue of 30% or more over a 14-day period as a result of higher Alert Level restrictions; and -To pay the lesser of: o$1500 plus $400 per full-time employee (FTE) (up to a cap of 50); or, oTwo times the experienced drop in revenue over the 14-day period. These options were preferred because they: -allow businesses to better plan ahead; -meant the RSP w ould be readily deployable by Inland Revenue in the event it is needed (following the passing of legislation and building the system); -are fiscally sustainable; -cushion the economic blow of higher Alert Levels to firms, limiting scarring effects; 1. Page 3 of 64 Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 2 - support the transition up Alert Levels, boosting social licence for public health regulations; - encourage the shift to a more COVID-19 resilient economy; - ensure that some low revenue firms do not gain disproportionately from the RSP, in excess of their needs to meet fixed costs and transition costs; and - target vulnerable but viable firms. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? Monetised and non-monetised benefits The RSP will support the national effort to eliminate COVID-19, for the benefit of all New Zealanders. The RSP provides additional financial support to firms to allow them to continue to meet fixed costs and cover costs associated with an escalation of Alert Levels, and quickly continue operations as soon as Alert Level restrictions allow. In turn, this benefits individuals employed by those firms. Whilst the Payment is available to all businesses, SMEs are the main financial beneficiaries. This recognises that the vast majority of businesses in New Zealand employ fewer than 50 people, and that smaller firms are less resilient to economic shocks than larger businesses. However, it is important to recognise that while larger firms are more resilient on average, larger firms can need support too. Not allowing large firms to access this form of support would disadvantage firms just on the cut-off, such as firms with 51 employees. This could make it harder for these firms to survive and may incentivise them to get rid of staff in order to become eligible, which we do not want to encourage. For this reason, the RSP will be available to firms of all sizes. Where do the costs fall? Monetised and non-monetised costs; for example to local government or regulated parties The fiscal costs fall to the Crown, however Treasury analysis suggests the long-term fiscal, economic and social impacts of no action would likely be greater. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts? How significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? Compressed timelines create policy development, delivery, and communications risks, which could lead to: - payments being more widely available than is efficient, or being paid to unviable firms, at unnecessary fiscal cost; - damaging the social capital that is critical for the success of the COVID-19 public health strategy; and - business confusion around the access to the scheme, meaning firms may lose out on support they are entitled to. The main mitigations we have undertaken include: - to agree, via Joint Ministers and Cabinet, detailed design rules in order to enable Inland Revenue to build the scheme at pace with as much certainty as possible; Page 4 of 64 Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 3 - a series of measures to boost the integrity of the scheme and minimise gaming risks; - taking a co-ordinated cross-Government approach to communications; - engaging with external business stakeholders to inform the design of the scheme and promote its availability, ensuring the widest audiences are reached. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? How confident are you of the evidence base? Evidence drawn on to inform the design of the RSP include: Regular, detailed qualitative engagement with the business community and monitoring of the effectiveness of existing supports Evidence was consistent from a diverse range of groups that: - greater certainty about the nature of government support in the event of a resurgence was critical, which led the decision to announce the support would be available in advance of any escalation of Alert Levels; - firm balance sheets in the most affected sectors were increasingly stressed; and - additional debt products were less appropriate. Evaluation of the uptake of the Small Business Cashflow Scheme (SBCS) also evidenced the waning appetite for debt. The Payment was therefore designed as a grant. Real-time transaction data, which showed the impacts of Alert Level on revenue - Xero data on revenue drops experienced by firms month- to-month throughout 2020 informed our understanding of Alert Level impacts. 1 - This, alongside information on uptake of the various wage subsidies, allowed us to estimate the number of firms facing significant revenue drops at different Alert Levels and led to the 30% revenue drop test. Survey data on firms’ cost structures and cash reserves - The Annual Enterprise Survey (AES) 2 provided insight into the fixed, variable, and wage costs usually faced by firms of varying size, allowing us to understand the scale of need when normal revenue streams are disrupted. - This gave quantitative support to insights gathered through stakeholder engagement about the difficulty in meeting fixed costs under higher Alert Level restrictions. - Better 4 Business (B4B) 3 research into firms’ cash reserves also echoed messages from stakeholders concerning balance sheet stress and eroded financial resilience. This evidence supported the case for grant-based support. Modelling and analysis of the macro and microeconomic impacts of Alert Levels on the economy. 1 The data provided was anonymised and aggregated to prevent the identification of businesses that are customers of Xero 2 Carried out by Stats NZ, the AES measures the financial performance and position of New Zealand businesses. 3 B4B is part of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. It carries out research on business health. The latest research is available here: https://www.betterforbusiness.govt.nz/resources-2/ Page 5 of 64 Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 4 - The Treasury prepared estimates of economic activity under different Alert Levels for each industry at regular intervals during 2020, updating the analysis as new data became available. - These estimates were initially assumption-driven, based on macroeconomic data, and were updated as new data (including high frequency indicators and information on the uptake of the Government’s financial support) enabled re-examination of previous assumptions. - The Treasury also commissioned modelling of the impacts of border closure and Alert Level settings on sectors and regions of the economy, which was conclusive in demonstrating impacts across all sectors and particularly acute effects on tourism and hospitality firms. This analysis is not yet published.

Page 6 of 64 Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 5 Supplementary Analysis: Resurgence Support Payment Section 1: General information 1.1 Purpose The Treasury and Inland Revenue are solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing: • stakeholders to be consulted on a government exposure draft of planned legislation (amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994) • final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet Page 7 of 64 Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 6 1.2 Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis a) What issues are in or out of scope? e.g., Ministers may already have ruled out certain issues. b) What are the limitations on the range of options considered and the criteria used to assess options? The RSP was recommended following direction from the Minister of Finance to deploy a new economic response initiative that was limited in scope to support the transition of viable firms to new economic settings; be flexible to support firms in higher Alert Level settings, be fiscally sustainable; and readily deployable. This limited the options to forms of support that could reach affected businesses quickly, and therefore risk issuing payments to firms who may not always need it. However, the criteria used to assess options indicated that in order to mitigate potential economic scarring effects, and with tight application criteria built in, thi s was a worthwhile trade-off. c) What limitations exist in relation to the evidence of the problem? d) What is the quality of data used for impact analysis? e) What limitations may there have been on consultation and testing? The Treasury engaged with a diverse range of business groups throughout 2020, including on the specific design parameters of a new Payment in the run up to preparing the Cabinet Paper. Those consulted on the RSP design included Business New Zealand, the Council of Trade Unions, the Auckland Chamber of Commerce, the Corporate Taxpayers Group, the Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, and Māori and Pacific business leaders. In addition to the pace with which consultation was undertaken, a limitation of this evidence continues to be the significant uncertainty around global events and changing, potentially unpredictable domestic conditions. Notwithstanding this uncertainty (which is detailed in the Treasury’s Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update and Half-Year Economic Update publications), the Treasury’s assessment of the impacts of Alert Level restrictions on economic activity and the related risks to aggregate firm solvency over potential series of virus outbreaks led to the conclusion that there was a gap in the support available. This assessment was informed by data from sources including the aforementioned AES, B2B surveys, Xero, and other modelling. The Treasury judges the quality of this data to be both high and comprehensive. f) What are the limitations on the assumptions underpinning the impact analysis? We assume that patterns of revenue impact experienced by firms are broadly consistent with those seen in periods of elevated Alert Levels throughout 2020. As such, we assume that the take up of the Payment would be broadly in line with that of other forms of COVID- 19 financial support tools to date, including the Wage Subsidy (WSS) and SBCS. Whilst the design of the Payment reflects the greater information available than when the pandemic first began, the uncertainty related to the nature of any future COVID-19 outbreak means the impacts may be different each time. Page 8 of 64 Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 7 1.3 Responsible Manager (signature and date): Jean Le Roux Transitions, Regions and Economic Development Growth, Productivity and Services Directorate The Treasury 28 January 2021 s 9(2)(a) Page 9 of 64 Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 8 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the current state within which action is proposed? Set out the current state, e.g., Nature of the market; Industry structure; Social context; Environmental state. The Treasury’s Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update provided the context in which the advice on the RSP was developed. The subsequent Half-Year Economic Update was published on 17 December 2020. Both documents underline that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause widespread economic and social disruption around the world, and the effectiveness and timing of the distribution of vaccines were still unclear at the time of writing. Both reports present a central scenario wherein New Zealand’s border restrictions ease from 1 July 2021 and will lift from 1 January 2022, alongside alternative scenarios attempting to benchmark possible downside scenarios. I n the meantime, New Zealanders should be prepared for the potential that whilst most of the economy will operate normally the majority of the time, Alert Levels may temporarily escalate. 2.2 What regulatory system(s) are already in place? • What are the key features of the regulatory system(s), including any existing regulation or government interventions/programmes? What are its objectives? The below diagram summarises the economic support landscape as of January 2021, including with the addition of the RSP, at different Alert Levels. The suite of interventions support the Government’s first overarching objective to keep New Zealanders safe from COVID-19, including by protecting jobs and livelihoods, and strengthening the economy. It does so by ensuring a package of financial support is in place for businesses and individuals in the event of Alert Level escalations following future resurgences of COVID- 19 in the community, with the aim of limiting the economic and social impacts if outbreaks occur. It also seeks to reduce the risk of resurgences by supporting workers to stay home when sick. These goals are complementary, as protecting New Zealanders from the virus will also support economic activity resuming quickly after any outbreaks. Page 10 of 64 Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 9 • Why is Government regulation preferable to private arrangements in this area? Public health restrictions attempt to provide protection from COVD-19; firmly an intervention that should and could only be undertaken by government. However, the economic costs of the public health restrictions (such as Alert Level changes), land upon individuals and businesses. It is appropriate for government to share some of these costs, consistent with the provision of public goods. The Treasury’s latest estimates that the negative impacts to GDP from Alert Level restrictions (relative to pre-pandemic levels) are: • -25% to -30% at Alert Level 4 • -15% to -20% at Alert Level 3 • -6% to -10% at Alert Level 2 • -3% to -5% at Alert Level 1. These are significant impacts with distributional consequences and scarring effects that require interventions at a scale only the Government can provide via broad-based support. • Has the overall fitness-for-purpose of the system as a whole been assessed? When and with what result? What interdependencies or connections are there to other existing issues or on-going work? Part of the rationale for the introduction of a new RSP at Alert Level 2 was to fill a gap in the support available to businesses as the cumulative impacts of higher public health restrictions added additional stress to balance sheets. In designing the intervention, officials attempted to achieve consistency between the RSP, WSS and the SBCS, where sensible, so as to reduce business confusion. This is reflected in a number of the settings proposed above for the RSP, including many of the settings relating to business declarations and business eligibility. There are other settings that are not in alignment. Some are based on policy grounds, such as the differing revenue drop thresholds under the RSP and WSS reflecting the schemes’ different purposes at different Alert Levels. Others are based on the fact that there will be different agencies implementing the schemes, with different system capabilities and different approaches to achieving necessary scheme integrity. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? • How is the situation expected to develop if no further action is taken, and why is this a problem? (This is the basis for comparing options against each other). • What is the nature, scope and scale of the loss or harm being experienced, or the opportunity for improvement? How important is this to the achievement (or not) of the overall system objectives? • What is the underlying cause of the problem? Why cannot individuals or firms be expected to sort it out themselves under existing arrangements? • How robust is the evidence supporting this assessment? Page 11 of 64 Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 10 The estimated negative impacts from Alert Level restrictions (relative to pre-pandemic levels) described in box 2.2 are significant, with distributional consequences and scarring effects that require interventions at a scale only the Government can provide through broad- based support. We know that Alert Level restrictions have an uneven impact across industries. Industries that find it costly to adapt operations for delivery under Alert Level settings, given the general necessity of in-person, on-site service provision, are under significant pressure. “Essential Services” definitions were used to form a view of which firms were able to operate at the higher Alert Levels. This assessment leveraged off work that was being undertaken by MBIE during the early stages of the COVID response to assess demand for Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) across essential industries, as well as work that was done between Treasury and MBIE on assessing uptake of the WSS. On top of this, firms suffer from the wider demand-side shocks due to reduced tourism activity, the decline in people movement, and economic conditions. Aggregate demand impacts from border closure particularly reduce demand for tourism-related industries such as accommodation, recreational activities etc. Statistics NZ Tourism Satellite Account information was used to inform a view on which industries were most impacted and the relative importance of international vs domestic tourism. The Treasury also commissioned modelling of the impacts of border closure and Alert Level settings on sectors and regions of the economy, which was conclusive in demonstrating impacts across all sectors and particularly acute effects on tourism and hospitality firms. 2.4 What do stakeholders think about the problem? • Who are the stakeholders? What is the nature of their interest? • Which stakeholders share the Agency’s view of the problem and its causes? • Which stakeholders do not share the Agency’s view in this regard and why? The Treasury engaged with Business New Zealand, the Council of Trade Unions, the Auckland Chamber of Commerce, and Pacific, Māori and Iwi business leaders in developing the RSP. Inland Revenue also engaged with the Corporate Taxpayers Group and the Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand. Their interest in the Payment was on behalf of business owners and employees throughout New Zealand. The engagement followed several months of conversations between the Treasury and business stakeholders on the impacts of higher Alert Levels and border settings on different sectors. There was extremely strong consensus from across the spectrum that providing greater certainty on the nature of Government support in the event higher Alert Levels were in place would be critical for businesses to plan and right-size smoothly. The RSP responded to this consistent message. Stakeholders were broadly supportive of the approach to create greater certainty on the landscape of government support, and particularly welcoming of measures that would address non-wage costs in addition to the costs covered by the WSS. There was strong feedback that the integrity of the schemes will be critical, with both Māori and Pacific business leaders raising concerns about possible gaming of support available. It was suggested that the communications approach to the package should be accompanied with clear guidance to maximise accessibility of the schemes, and partnerships with trusted community channels would aid access to the schemes and be critical in helping SMEs – which would likely be most vulnerable – prepare now for future outbreaks. Officials are using this feedback to inform the communications strategy. Page 12 of 64 Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 11 2.5 What are the objectives sought in relation to the identified problem? • Objectives must be clear and not pre-justify a particular solution. They should be specified broadly enough to allow consideration of all relevant alternative solutions. • Where there are multiple policy objectives it should be clear how trade-offs between competing objectives are going to be made and the weightings given to objectives – not just those in direct conflict. • For further guidance, see 2.3 of the Guidance Note on Best Practice Analysis https://treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018-03/ia-bestprac-guidance-note.pdf The purpose of the RSP is to provide support for businesses’ to meet fixed costs and costs when transitioning from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2 or above, in a fiscally sustainable way. The objectives, which formed the criteria against which different options were assessed, are as follows: a) Support firms to maintain viability and employment levels across escalations in public health restrictions; b) Support firms to pay fixed costs (such as rent) if they are struggling to do so as a result of escalated Alert Levels; c) Share the cost associated with escalated Alert Levels between Government, firms and across economic sectors; and d) Encourage the shift to a COVID-19 resilient economy. This required the following scheme attributes, which informed the selection of options (see section 3): - Resilience to different public health scenarios - Providing business certainty, so firms can better plan ahead - Complementarity with existing schemes; and - Fiscal sustainability. Trade-offs In order to support firms to maintain viability and employment levels (objective (a)), there will necessarily be payments made to some firms who would survive anyway, and others that may not have been viable in the medium term (see objective (d)). However, from a fairness perspective, there is a case to equally share the cost of the exogenous shock provided by the pandemic (c). The critical weighting here is in favour of mitigating scarring economic effects for the long-term benefit of all New Zealanders , and designing a scheme that is resilient / can pay out quickly (see box 3.1) . The Payment was therefore designed to be available to all firms but with design features built in to target the most affected and those with the fewest resources to respond to the restricted market settings created by higher Alert Levels. Page 13 of 64 Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 12 Section 3: Option identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? • List and describe the key features of the options. Set out how each would address the problem or opportunity, and deliver the objectives identified. • How has consultation affected these options? • Are the options mutually exclusive, or do they or some of them work in combination? • Have non-regulatory options been considered? If not, why not? • What relevant experience from other countries has been considered? The first-o rder options were as follows: A. Front-loaded WSS-based scheme Lump sum worth 2 weeks of the wage subsidy paid for every change in AL to firms meeting a 40% revenue drop test, with a labour market attachment requirement: Assessment: maintains employment but does not address other costs associated with Alert Level escalation; 40% threshold aligned with WSS but likely too high at Alert Level 2; fiscally expensive. B. Amended WSS-based scheme As above, but restricting payments to escalations in ALs only, and allowing only one payment every four weeks. Assessment: potentially less frequent payments may do more to encourage transition, but challenges of option A remain. C. Lump-sum AL2+ grant \[this was the recommended and agreed approach\] Adapted form of options A&B that is: 1. Less generous per FTE, with a per-firm and per-FTE component to reflect fixed costs; 2. Subject to a less onerous revenue drop test, to reflect impact of AL2 on businesses; 3. Paid every time there is an escalation from AL1 to AL2 or above; and 4. Without a labour market attachment condition, but firms would declare they are viable. Assessment: responds to business feedback that more support was needed for fixed costs (e.g. rent); less generous, thereby better facilitating transition and potentially more equitably sharing the cost between Government and the private sector. D. Ongoing AL2+ grant As (C), but paid on an ongoing basis for every week a region or nation is at AL2 or above Assessment: benefits of Option C but less likely to facilitate transition, fiscally expensive. E. Time-limited AL2+ grant As (D), but with a fixed number of weeks that a firm can claim for over the life of the scheme. Assessment similar to (D); greater cushioning provided for firms than (C) but more expensive. The Treasury also considered grants directly aimed at hospitality firms and others directly identified in public health regulations as needing to make adaptations in order to meet social Page 14 of 64 Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 13 distancing and hygiene requirements. This was ruled out due to the considerable boundary issues involved in categorising businesses by strict sectors. Option C was recommended in light of its strengths in delivering the overall objectives described in box 2.5 above. The sub-options that were consequently considered, which are largely mutually exclusive, are as follows: The public health settings that would trigger the scheme’s activation Based on the above objectives, we recommended that any new grant scheme should be available to businesses based on an escalation to AL2 or higher. This ties the duration of any payments to the time at which many businesses will continue to face substantial cost from public health restrictions. In the event that such an escalation is in one region, the case for only starting the scheme in that region was considered. Regional targeting would pose operational challenges – for example, firms that are registered in a different place to their economic activity, or subject to spillovers from restrictions in a neighbouring region. Those challenges mean that regional targeting will come with hard boundary cases, and would create operational difficulties for IR, though it is technically feasible. As an alternative, there was an option for Ministers to choose to turn the scheme on nationally or by region in the given circumstance. Given that this could undermine business certainty on the support received, which was a significant part of the policy aim informed by consultation, it was concluded that a commitment to provide the RSP when a region or the country was at AL2 or above would be subject to final Cabinet approval at the time of an escalation event. Whether to make the support time-limited, or an ongoing grant at certain Alert Levels The key strategic choice was between supporting firms to adapt to the new restrictions through a one-off or time limited payment, or maintaining as many existing firms or jobs as possible by providing ongoing, certain, support for the remainder of the pandemic. The former approach was judged to best support the objectives, in light of the greater fiscal sustainability associated with one-off payments; likelihood of supporting fewer non-viable firms; and potential to incentivise a transition to new market conditions. The conditions under which firms would be eligible Whilst all means of delivering targeted sector or viable firm support are imperfect, on balance, we recommended taking a similar approach to the Wage Subsidy Scheme and relied on a revenue-drop test. This is because: - It identifies those firms and sectors most affected by AL2 restrictions, whether that is due to the direct impact of public health restrictions or supply chain spill-overs; and - It is well understood by businesses as a common means of determining eligibility for COVID-19 support measures. The alternative identified was to specifically target firms that are subject to specific public health requirements by virtue of providing food and drink for on-premises consumption (hospitality). Treasury’s judgement, having consulted with delivery partners, is that doing so would be exceptionally challenging to define, audit, or operationalise; would create very difficult boundary issues for businesses to navigate and understand; and would create very high levels of customer contact and confusion. The means of calculating the grant value A grant to firms should be fiscally sustainable and ideally account for the fixed costs that firms face which scale relatively slowly with firm size and are hard to adjust quickly (such as Page 15 of 64 Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 14 rent and utilities), and variable costs that can adjust more quickly (such as wages and the transition costs associated with Alert Level changes). In order to achieve this, we recommended that a grant value has a fixed and variable component using FTE 4 employees as a measure of firm size and variable costs. Grant = base value per firm + ( FTE payment \* FTE) To ensure that some low revenue firms do not gain disproportionately from the RSP, we also recommended a design mechanism whereby the amount of payment is capped at two times the fortnightly drop in revenue that the applicant has signalled in its application. This approach means the amount a firm receives will be the lower of the formula amount ($1,500 plus $400 per FTE) or two times the fortnightly drop in revenue. The Treasury estimated this would save a total of $30-50m in fiscal costs. We also explored alternative ways of setting a grant relative to a firm’s size (for example, on the basis of a firm’s revenue or balance sheet), but doing so poses substantial operational challenges and would be more complex for businesses. Whether to restrict the grant to SMEs. Larger firms have stronger balance sheets and access to credit and cash buffers, and the value of the payment will be much less material to their business decisions. However, the fiscal impact of providing the RSP to all firms without a cap on FTE was estimated to be relatively low (given that the base value was a substantial proportion of the cost, and there are very few large firms in New Zealand). On balance, it was preferred to cap the amount of the RSP to firms at the equivalent of a payment to firms with 50 FTE, similar to the original design of the Wage Subsidy, which has the benefits of equal treatment in approach to supporting all businesses. This was also supported by feedback gathered in consultation with stakeholders across the business community, who provided advice that the support would have strongest effect for SMEs. Have non-regulatory options been considered? If not, why not? What relevant experience from other countries has been considered? The Treasury explored whether demand-led schemes could be viable to support objectives including (a) and (d) above. It examined the UK’s ‘Eat Out to Help Out’ scheme, which subsidised meals out. It was concluded that the scheme would run counter to the public health goals at higher Alert Levels to subsidise and therefore incentivise eating out. The IMF’s Policies for the Recovery published in October 2020 was also considered. The publication recommended fiscal strategies including “cash or in-kind transfers to support transition and target those in need, in the event of partial opening”, which supported the case for the approach taken to designing the RSP. In addition, the Treasury engaged with officials in Australia to share ideas on building support schemes which targeted vulnerable but viable firms. 4 FTEs are determined in the same way as for the Wage Subsidy and SBCS: a full time worker is one who regularly works 20 or more hours a week. A part time worker is one who regularly works fewer than 20 hours a week. A part time worker is calculated as 0.6 of a full time worker. The total from classifying all employees is rounded up to the nearest FTE. Page 16 of 64 Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 15 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? • Comment on relationships between the criteria, for example where meeting one criterion can only be achieved at the expense of another (trade-offs) Note: sections 3.2 and 3.3 from the original template are combined as the answers are strongly related. The desired impacts are directly related to the objectives of the RSP: a) Support firms to maintain viability and employment levels across escalations in public health restrictions; b) Support firms to pay fixed costs if they are struggling to do so as a result of escalated Alert Levels; c) Share the cost associated with escalated Alert Levels between Government, firms and across economic sectors; and d) Encourage the shift to a COVID-19 resilient economy. It was considered that grant-based support was more likely to support businesses to maintain viability and employment levels than debt-based alternatives, whilst being fiscally sustainable (given the quantum of funding set aside to respond to resurgence events if needed). Whilst debt based support may help firms manage immediate cash flow issues, it can become restrictive and delay investment in transition as they divert cash from growth activities to financing costs. Furthermore, firms are likely to be more risk averse than the Crown, which pools risk and has a large balance sheet, a long time horizon, and a public interest perspective. An additional part of the rationale for the RSP in delivering the above objectives relates to the impacts on social license for the public health response. Whilst the available evidence demonstrated a broadly high level of compliance with the public health restrictions during the outbreaks in 2020 (for example, traffic flows were much lower as a result of AL3 in Auckland), there was some evidence that the high degree of social capital that supported compliance with the longer national lockdown waned. In addition, at the time of designing the Payment, there was emerging evidence that compliance with restrictions overseas was waning, especially in cases where the economic support was judged to be insufficiently generous to incentivise people to self-isolate rather than work. It was concluded that economic response measures can play a key role in maintaining ongoing social license for public health restrictions, both in compensating individuals for their compliance with restrictions, minimising the impact on jobs and economic wellbeing, and reinforcing social solidarity. Whilst this is a difficult impact to measure and accurately attribute to economic support, the counterfactual would be a significant risk to the health and wellbeing of all New Zealanders.

The recommended approach was to introduce and pre-announce a new one-off Resurgence Support Payment available to all firms in the event of an increase from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2, 3, or 4. The recommended sub-options were: - To make the Payment available to all firms that experience a drop in revenue of 30% or more over a 14-day period as a result of higher Alert Level restrictions; and - To pay the lesser of: o $1500 plus $400 per full-time employee (FTE) (up to a cap of 50), or, o Two times the experienced drop in revenue. These options were preferred because they: - allow businesses to better plan ahead; - meant the RSP would be readily deployable by Inland Revenue in the event it is needed (following the passing of legislation and building the system); - are fiscally sustainable; - cushion the economic blow of higher Alert Levels to firms, limiting scarring effects; - support the transition up Alert Levels, boosting social licence for public health regulations; - encourage the shift to a more COVID-19 resilient economy; - ensure that some low revenue firms do not gain disproportionately from the RSP, in excess of their needs to meet fixed costs and transition costs; and - target vulnerable but viable firms. This approach was informed through consultation with Business New Zealand, the Council of Trade Unions, the Auckland Chamber of Commerce, and Pacific, Māori and Iwi business leaders in developing the RSP. Inland Revenue also engaged with the Corporate Taxpayers Group and the Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand. The engagement on the specific design aspects of the RSP followed several months’ of conversations between the Treasury and these stakeholders on the impacts of higher Alert Levels and border settings on different sectors. There was extremely strong consensus from across the spectrum that providing greater certainty on the nature of Government support in the event higher Alert Levels were in place would be critical for businesses to plan and right-size smoothly. The RSP responded to this consistent message. Stakeholders were broadly supportive of the approach to create greater certainty on the landscape of government support, and particularly welcoming of measures that would address non-wage costs in addition to the costs covered by the Wage Subsidy Scheme. There was strong feedback that the integrity of the schemes will be critical, with both Māori and Pacific business leaders raising concerns about possible gaming of support available. It was suggested that the communications approach to the package should be accompanied with clear guidance to maximise accessibility of the schemes, and partnerships with trusted community channels would aid access to the schemes and be critical in helping SMEs – which would likely be most vulnerable – prepare now for future outbreaks. This feedback has fed into the policy design and operational implementation of the Payment.

However, the analysis sighted in this report indicates that the scarring effects attached to the risks of not cushioning the blow could be significant, with distributional consequences. We therefore judge that the provision of the RSP has potential to support the social license and capital needed to maintain a robust public health response, for the benefit of all New Zealanders. Page 22 of 64 Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 21 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? • When will the arrangements come into effect? Does this allow sufficient preparation time for regulated parties? • How could the preferred option be given effect? E.g., − legislative vehicle − communications − transitional arrangements. The RSP will be given effect through amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994, scheduled to be introduced in February 2021. The RSP was announced on 15 December 2020 and information on eligibility is available on a range of government websites. Cabinet has agreed retrospective payments will be possible in the event there is a resurgence prior to the application opening date, and subject to the legislation being passed. In addition, engagement with key business groups including those representing Māori and Pasifika businesses will be pursued in order to ensure a maximum number of firms are aware of the support available. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the ongoing operation and enforcement of the RSP. Have the responsible parties confirmed, or identified any concerns with their ability to implement it in a manner consistent with the Government’s ‘Expectations for regulatory stewardship by government agencies’? See https://treasury.govt.nz/information-and- services/regulation/regulatory-stewardship/good-regulatory-practice Inland Revenue has not identified any concerns with its ability to implement the new arrangements. How will other agencies with a substantive interest in the relevant regulatory system or stakeholders be involved in the implementation and/or operation? Design decisions have been delegated by Cabinet to relevant Joint Ministers, including the Minister of Finance, Minister of Revenue, and Minister for Small Business. Interdependencies with complementary support programmes such as the Wage Subsidy are regularly under review by the Treasury, IR and MSD. Page 23 of 64 Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 22 6.2 What are the implementation risks? • What issues concerning implementation have been raised through consultation and how will these be addressed? • What are the underlying assumptions or uncertainties, for example about stakeholder motivations and capabilities? • How will risks be mitigated? Compressed timelines create delivery and communications risks, which could lead to: - payments reaching the wrong businesses at an unnecessary fiscal cost; - damaging the social capital that is critical for the success of the COVID-19 public health strategy; - business confusion around the access to the scheme, meaning firms may lose out on support they are entitled to. The main mitigations we have undertaken include: - to agree, via Joint Ministers and Cabinet, detailed design rules in order to enable Inland Revenue to build the scheme at pace with as much certainty as possible; - a series of measures to boost the integrity of the scheme and minimise gaming risks; - taking a co-ordinated cross-Government approach to communications; - engaging with external business stakeholders to inform the design of the scheme and promote its availability, ensuring the widest audiences are reached; and - re-use of components developed for the SBCS as a way to meet challenging system delivery timeframes. Page 24 of 64 Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 23 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? • How will you know whether the impacts anticipated actually materialise? • System-level monitoring and evaluation • Are there already monitoring and evaluation provisions in place for the system as a whole (ie, the broader legislation within which this arrangement sits)? If so, what are they? • Are data on system-level impacts already being collected? • Are data on implementation and operational issues, including enforcement already being collected? • New data collection? • Will you need to collect extra data that is not already being collected? Please specify. As with the wage subsidies, SBCS, and COVID-19 Income Relief Payment (CIRP), detailed data will be collected by the implementation agency (IR) on the uptake of the scheme. This will capture and allow government to evaluate outputs of the scheme. Information systems at IR are capable of this data collection. Evaluation of outcomes will be imperfect, given the radical uncertainty that surrounds any resurgence event and the absence of any suitable counterfactual. In line with the objectives of the scheme and analysis that lead to its inception, we expect to minimise the erosion of firm balance sheets during a resurgence event, and ultimately prevent some insolvencies amongst viable firms that would otherwise take place. While we can assess balance sheet resilience quantitatively, much of this evaluation will be through engagement with business. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? • How will the arrangements be reviewed? How often will this happen and by whom will it be done? If there are no plans for review, state so and explain why. • What sort of results (that may become apparent from the monitoring or feedback) might prompt an earlier review of this legislation? • What opportunities will stakeholders have to raise concerns? A review of the system will depend on whether it is activated. Subject to that, the operation of the scheme will be reviewed regularly based on user feedback and system metrics. Monitoring of uptake and engagement will be undertaken in the event that the payment is activated as part of the broader monitoring of the economic situation. If required, a review of any policy settings would be co-led by Treasury and Inland Revenue. Page 25 of 64 Page 26 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 1 Coversheet: Increasing main benefit abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 and consequential adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit Advising agencies Ministry of Social Development and Inland Revenue Decision sought Agreement to increase main benefit abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 and consequentially adjust the Minimum Family Tax Credit for 2020/21 and 2021/22. Note that on 30 November 2020, Cabinet agreed to adjust the Minimum Family Tax Credit for 2020/21 \[CAB-20-MIN-0490 refers\]. However, a Regulatory Impact Assessment could not be undertaken due to time constraints. Under Cabinet’s regulatory impact analysis requirements, this document is: -the Supplementary Analysis Report for the adjustment to the Minimum Family Tax Credit for 2020/21; and -the Regulatory Impact Assessment for the abatement threshold increases and the adjustment to the Minimum Family Tax Credit for 2021/22. Proposing Ministers Minister for Social Development and Employment Minister of Revenue Summary: Problem a nd Proposed Approac h Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? The current abatement thresholds provide limited work incentives for beneficiaries The amount that beneficiaries can earn before their benefit reduces has declined substantially over time as benefit abatement thresholds have not been increased in line with wage growth. This has reduced financial incentives to enter the labour market and to work part-time for people receiving benefits. For example, a person receiving Jobseeker Support in 1997 could work around 11.4 hours on minimum wage before their benefit abated; in 2019, this has reduced to around 4.5 hours on minimum wage. There are trade-offs in making consequential adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit Under current policy, the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC) thresholds are adjusted annually to account for changes to relevant settings, such as changes to benefit rates, abatement thresholds and the minimum wage. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 2. Page 27 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 2 The MFTC threshold for 2020/21 was not adjusted to reflect the $25 benefit rate increase made on 1 April 2020 in response to COVID-19 due to time constraints at the time. This has resulted in the current MFTC threshold being misaligned with the current benefit rate. Increasing main benefit abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 has flow-on implications for the MFTC threshold in 2021/22 and subsequent tax years. To maintain financial incentives provided by the MFTC for families with children to enter work, the MFTC threshold for 2021/22 requires adjustments alongside abatement threshold increases under current policy. However, given the proposed increases to the abatement thresholds are significant, the adjustment required for the MFTC to align would be much higher than previous adjustments. This may exacerbate known issues with the MFTC, mainly reducing financial incentive for sole parents to work more than the minimum hours required. It may also increase the cost of options in the upcoming review of Working for Families. Summary of Preferred Option or Conclusion (if no preferred option) How will the agency’s preferred approach work to bring about the desired change? Why is this the preferred option? Why is it feasible? Is the preferred approach likely to be reflected in the Cabinet paper? Abatement threshold increases will improve financial work incentives Increasing benefit abatement thresholds to $160 and $250 per week increases the number of hours a beneficiary can work before their benefit begins to reduce. This will improve the financial incentives to enter the labour market and work part-time for people receiving benefits. Part-time work can provide a pathway to full-time work by providing opportunities to connect with the labour market, get work experience and become familiar with the demands that can come with employment. There are different agency views on making adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit Under current policy, changes to benefit settings would lead to an adjustment of the MFTC threshold to ensure the financial work incentives provided by the MFTC are maintained. However, given the extent of the recent and proposed benefit changes, full adjustment of the MFTC incurs significant fiscal costs. Additionally, a significant increase to the MFTC threshold may increase the cost of options as part of the upcoming review of Working for Families (WFF). 2020/21 MFTC threshold adjustment Retrospectively adjusting the 2020/21 MFTC threshold to reflect the increases to main benefits that came into effect on 1 April 2020 means the work incentives provided by the MFTC will be maintained for the 2020/21 tax year. This ensures that low-income families with children (both sole parents and two parent families) are better off in work and receiving the MFTC than working and receiving the benefit. Note that on 30 November 2020, Cabinet agreed to retrospectively increase the 2020/21 MFTC threshold to $29,432 from 1 April 2020 to reflect the increases to main benefits that came into effect on 1 April 2020 \[CAB-20-MIN-0490 refers\]. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) Page 28 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 3 2021/22 MFTC threshold adjustment Inland Revenue (IR), Ministry of Social Development (MSD) and the Treasury have differing views on the most appropriate options relating to the alignment of the MFTC threshold: • MSD prefers the partial prospective alignment option. This is the proposed option in the Cabinet paper. MSD considers that a partial prospective alignment maintains the work incentives MFTC provides to the majority of MFTC recipients (ie, sole parents), but at a significantly lower fiscal cost than full alignment. MSD notes that fully aligning the MFTC threshold may exacerbate existing MFTC issues such as high Effective Marginal Tax Rates (EMTRs) 1 . MSD considers partially aligning the MFTC threshold would increase the cost of options as part of the upcoming WFF review, particularly if there is a desire to avoid people being financially disadvantaged by future changes. However, these effects will be less than under full alignment. • IR prefers the full prospective alignment option. Although the fiscal cost of full alignment is greater than under other options, IR considers it necessary to maintain the work incentives provided by the MFTC, ensuring low-income families with children (both sole parents and two parent families) are better off in work and receiving the MFTC than working and receiving the benefit. IR does not consider the potential effects of aligning the MFTC threshold on any future WFF review to be a significant enough issue to warrant reducing the work incentives currently provided by the MFTC. • In advice to Ministers, the Treasury recommended the no prospective alignment option due to the tight fiscal environment. The Treasury also did not consider that the policy decision \[to align the MFTC threshold with benefit rates\] meets the threshold to be progressed as a Budget pre-commitment. While the Treasury acknowledged that it was likely to introduce greater complexity for clients, the Treasury did not agree that these adverse effects were sufficient to justify funding the initiative ahead of the Budget process given the tight fiscal environment. Section B: Summary Impacts : Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? Monetised and non-monetised benefits Beneficiaries working part-time and non-beneficiary recipients of the Accommodation Supplement gain from abatement threshold increases The main people to gain are beneficiaries working part-time and non-beneficiary recipients of the Accommodation Supplement (these are low to middle-income working families). MSD estimates that around 82,900 individuals and families will gain an average of $18 per 1 Effective Marginal Tax Rate shows how a dollar increase in gross income translates to an increase in income in hand (after taxation and the reduction of income-tested assistance). 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) Page 29 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 4 week in extra income support payments as a result of increasing benefit abatement thresholds. Non-monetised benefits include: • Improved financial incentives to enter the labour market and work part-time for people receiving benefits • A modest reduction in the number of children in poverty (it is estimated that the proposed increases to the abatement thresholds will reduce child poverty by around 6,000 (+/- 3,000) on the AHC50 fixed line measure 2 and 2,000 (+/- 3,000) on the BHC50 measure 3 in 2021/22), and • Broader improvements in health and wellbeing where eligible people are engaged in work (provided the work is safe, stable and financially beneficial). MFTC recipients and newly eligible recipients will gain from the adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit Retrospective change – increasing the 2020/21 MFTC threshold to reflect the $25 benefit rate increase on 1 April 2020 Approximately 3,200 families receiving the MFTC in the 2020/21 tax year would gain an additional $32 for each week they received the MFTC. The maximum MFTC increase a family could receive would be $1,664 ($32 x 52 weeks). However, it is estimated that the average MFTC increase for the year would be approximately $1,280 per family. Approximately 400 additional families would become newly eligible for the MFTC in the 2020/2021 tax year as a result of the threshold increase. Because newly eligible families will have incomes above the current threshold, the average increase for these families will be less than $32 a week. A full retrospective increase will also maintain financial incentives for families to move off benefit and into work for the remainder of the 2020/21 tax year. It also addresses the potential equity issue whereby some families who remained off benefit and in work following the benefit rate increase on 1 April 2020 are financially disadvantaged relative to those who are on benefit. Prospective change – partially increasing the 2021/22 MFTC threshold Approximately 4,000 families are expected to receive the MFTC in the 2021/22 tax year. Of these, around 400 families would be newly eligible to the MFTC. Families would gain an additional $22 for each week they receive the MFTC. The maximum MFTC increase a family could receive in the 2021/22 tax year would be $1,144 ($22 x 52 weeks). However, because not all families will receive the MFTC for ever week of the tax year, the average MFTC increase is estimated to be less than $1,144. 2 AHC50 measures the number of children in households with incomes much lower than a typical 2018 household, after they pay for housing costs, and is measured by the threshold line set at 50 per cent of the median income in 2017/18, after housing costs are removed. 3 BHC50 is a moving-line income measure, with the poverty threshold taken the year the data is gathered (low income, before housing costs – moving-line measure). BHC50 measures the number of children in households with much lower incomes than a typical household, and is measured by the threshold line set at 50 per cent of the median household income in the year measured. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Page 30 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 5 A partial increase of the MFTC threshold ensures that sole parents, who make up around 90 percent of the MFTC recipients, continue to be financially better off working and receiving the MFTC than working and receiving a benefit. Where do the costs fall? Monetised and non-monetised costs; for example to local government or regulated parties Abatement threshold increases are primarily a cost to the Government The cost to the Government of increasing benefit abatement thresholds is $387.496 million in income support payments and $6.4 million in operating costs over the forecast period. There is an additional cost of $80,000 for 12 months for providing a Transitional Assistance Payment (TAP) to people who may be financially disadvantaged as a result of the abatement threshold increases on 1 April 2021. Non-monetised costs include a small reduction in financial incentives to work full-time for some beneficiaries. Adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit are primarily a cost to the Government Retrospective change – increasing the 2020/21 MFTC threshold to reflect the $25 benefit rate increase on 1 April 2020 The cost to the Government of increasing the 2020/21 MFTC threshold is $4.6 million for the 2020/21 tax year and $24.1 million for the forecast period. Prospective change – partially increasing the 2021/22 MFTC threshold The cost to the Government of partially increasing the 2021/22 MFTC threshold is $17 million over the forecast period, assuming the retrospective increase is agreed to. The financial work incentives provided by the MFTC would be reduced for two-parent families (approximately 10 percent of MFTC recipients) as they would theoretically be better off working and receiving a main benefit than working and receiving the MFTC. There may be a small net fiscal cost to the Government from two-parent families moving onto a benefit. This net fiscal cost has not been calculated due to time constraints. The behavioural impacts are uncertain. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts? How significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? Abatement threshold increases may financially disadvantage a small number of people but a Transitional Assistance Payment can be provided Increasing benefit abatement thresholds will mean that a small number of people will be financially disadvantaged due to complex interactions in the income support system. TAP, a temporary non-taxable payment, is proposed to be available for up to 12 months for the small number of people who may be financially disadvantaged on 1 April 2021 as a result of the abatement threshold increases. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Page 31 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 6 Retrospective and prospective adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit each have unintended impacts A retrospective increase (paid in lump sum for the portion of the year for which payments have already been made) may lead to debts being created for some people as the MFTC is chargeable income for some types of financial assistance paid under the Social Security Act 2018 (such as Temporary Additional Support). It is also assessable income for Public Housing purposes, for assessing eligibility and calculating the rate of Income Related Rent. While this does lead to debts for some clients, these debts are usually less than the value of the lump-sum payment (so clients are still better off overall) and it reflects the appropriate consideration of these payments as income for these families. The prospective partial increase means that the MFTC would not be fully aligned with its policy intent and some two-parent families may be better off working and receiving a main benefit than working and receiving the MFTC. However, few couples are likely to qualify for a benefit if one person is working 30 hours a week as this is considered working full-time under the Social Security Act 2018 4 . Section C: Evidence certainty and quality ass urance Agency rating of evidence certainty? How confident are you of the evidence base? MSD is confident that increasing benefit abatement thresholds will directly increase incomes for beneficiaries working part-time and low to middle-income working families receiving the Accommodation Supplement. Holding all else equal, MSD is also confident that these increases are likely to modestly reduce child poverty. The evidence base on financial incentives to work (for both abatement threshold increase and MFTC) indicates that financial incentives are only one of many factors that influence people’s decisions on whether to work and how much to work and they are not usually the most important factor. However, empirical evidence suggests small but statistically significant impacts on labour market participation and intensity from changes in financial incentives to work, with larger impacts for some groups compared to others. 5 The modelling of the increases to benefit abatement thresholds and the MFTC assumes no behavioural impacts, i.e. no increases in labour market participation or hours worked, as these impacts are likely to be modest and are difficult to quantify. While increasing financial incentives to work part-time, the changes also reduce financial incentives to work full-time for some. Again, this impact has not been quantified. There is reasonably strong evidence that suitable work has broader positive impacts on wellbeing 6 , 4 This is due to the ’30-hour rule’, where a person (or couple) are not eligible for Jobseeker Support if they are working full-time (defined as 30 hours a week). 5 Kostøl, A, & Mogstad, M.

To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: The reviewing agencies were: - Ministry of Social Development - Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewers at Inland Revenue and Ministry of Social Development have reviewed the Increasing main benefit abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 and consequential adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit RIA and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it partially meets the quality criteria of the Regulatory Impact Analysis framework. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: It partially meets the quality criteria for the following reasons: • There has been no analysis of the behavioural impacts. This is understandable given the timeframes and difficulties undertaking this analysis. However, the abatement thresholds and the MFTC are intended to encourage people to engage in work. Ideally, RIA would include an estimate of how many people will move into work as a result of the changes. The team notes the employment impacts will be monitored following implementation. • There is minimal discussion of alternative options to the abatement threshold increases, such as the staged increases committed to by the Government as part of Budget 2019. However, the Treasury RIA team advised MSD that a full RIA for the abatement threshold increases was not required because the increases were a manifesto commitment. • In terms of the MFTC, the status quo is based on a long-established policy of full alignment of the MFTC with benefit changes. There are now differing views on the appropriateness of this automatic linkage when there are significant increases in benefit entitlements and the case for change does not adequately consider the impact on the identified group of people who would be relatively worse off if the MFTC is not increased. Moreover, the analysis relies on certain assumptions about the fiscal cost, which could benefit from further explanation, such as the degree of behavioural response that could lead individuals to shift from paid employment with MFTC to paid employment with welfare support. The behavioural responses are uncertain. The team notes the employment impacts will be monitored following implementation. • We note that the options have administrative implications but there is little discussion of the impacts, for example from backdating MFTC payments.

The team recommends MSD and IR monitor the behavioural outcomes of the changes, especially the employment outcomes. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Page 34 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 9 Impact Statement: Increasing main benefit abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 and consequential adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit Section 1: Ge neral informati on 1.1 Purpose Ministry of Social Development (MSD) and Inland Revenue (IR) are solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice have been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to be taken by Cabinet in relation to increasing the abatement thresholds and consequential adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC). 1.2 Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Limitations and constraints on the analysis in this document include: • The Labour Party committed to increasing the thresholds to $160 and $250 per week from 1 April 2021 in its 2020 manifesto commitment. Therefore, other options have been ruled out, such as increasing the thresholds by a different amount, or changes to the abatement rates. (It should be noted that abatement rate changes would also have similar trade-offs that apply, and it would be harder to communicate the changes, which means it would be harder to influence people’s behaviour in the direction intended). • Other options that have been ruled out due to time constraints include extending a part-time abatement regime to Jobseeker Support on the grounds of a health condition, injury or disability to more closely match their work obligations. • • The modelling results for abatement threshold increases are scaled according to the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update 2020 recipient and expenditure forecasts. • The estimates of the impact of the newly eligible for abatement threshold increases are created based off existing work done in the Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI). However, there is high uncertainty around these numbers. • Impacts of abatement threshold increases on Special Needs Grants and recoverable assistance have not been modelled. It is expected that the number of these could modestly decrease, but there is a considerable amount of uncertainty. • Behavioural impacts (ie, increases in labour market participation or hours worked) have not been modelled as there are various factors that influence a person’s work choices and they are difficult to quantify. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 s 9(2)(f)(iv) Page 35 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 10 • Analysis in this document has been carried out under tight time constraints. • No consultation (beyond other Government agencies) has taken place as the proposed increases to the abatement thresholds is a Manifesto commitment and the Government’s consideration of the proposed changes in this RIA is Budget Sensitive. 1.3 Responsible Managers: Income Support Policy Welfare System and Income Support Policy Ministry of Social Development 3 December 2020 Carolyn Elliott Families and Individuals Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 3 December 2020 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) Page 36 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 11 Section 2: Problem defi nition and objectives 2.1 What is the current state within which action is proposed? The welfare system is structured to assist those most in need and encourage paid work where possible New Zealand’s welfare system is designed to target people who are unable to fully support themselves through paid work. Almost all income support in New Zealand is targeted on the basis of family income (and family assets), with the family defined as the nuclear family (i.e. adults and any dependent children). Income and asset tests are determined by a combination of the abatement settings of payments (how fast they are reduced) and the rates of the benefit payments. Generally, the full rate of a payment will be available to people earning up to a certain amount (known as the abatement threshold). Above this amount, payments reduce (abate) as people’s incomes increase. The welfare overhaul involves a range of changes including changes to abatement thresholds and Working for Families tax credits The Welfare Expert Advisory Group (WEAG), in its report Whakamana Tāngata, proposed a comprehensive package of substantial changes to income support, while broadly maintaining the existing structure of income support. The WEAG package emphasised improving income adequacy and simplifying and rationalising the purpose of particular payments. The WEAG recommended that abatement thresholds for main benefits be increased to $150 and $250 per week. In 2019, Cabinet agreed to overhaul the welfare system to achieve its vision for a system that ensures people have an adequate income and standard of living, are treated with respect, can live in dignity, and are able to participate meaningfully in their communities \[CAB-19-MIN-0578 refers\]. On 6 November 2019, Cabinet endorsed a high-level short, medium, and long-term work programme to achieve this vision, but did not detail when work would be progressed. As part of the welfare overhaul work programme, the Government also agreed to a review of Working for Families (WFF) tax credits, including the MFTC. COVID-19 has caused significant economic disruption in New Zealand COVID-19 has caused major economic disruption in New Zealand and globally. With great uncertainty in the economy and with extended border closures, unemployment is forecast to rise, peaking at 7.8 percent in the March 2022 quarter. As a result of the weaker economic outlook, beneficiary numbers are forecast to increase. In October 2020, 369,860 people were receiving a main benefit, at 11.8 percent of the estimated New Zealand working-age population. This is 69,623 more than October 2019. Of the 369,860 receiving a main benefit, 203,371 were Jobseeker Support recipients (6.5 percent of the working-age population), which is 61,241 more than October 2019. The number of people on a benefit is expected to peak in May 2021 at around 443,000, with another peak later in January 2022 reaching around 453,800. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Page 37 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 12 The economic impacts of COVID-19 are expected to disproportionally impact Māori, Pacific people, disabled people (including people with health conditions) and sole parents, who are more likely to be employed in areas affected by job losses and have additional barriers to accessing employment. COVID-19 will certainly increase poverty and hardship rates, although it is too soon to estimate the size of these impacts. The sudden loss of all employment income, or reduced employment income, can tip many families into financial hardship, especially if they have limited cash or near-cash assets to maintain existing commitments (e.g. rent, mortgage and consumer debt). Government’s response to COVID-19 As part of the Government’s response to COVID-19, on 1 April 2020, main benefit rates increased by $25 per week. The Winter Energy Payment (WEP), which is paid from 1 May to 1 October each year, was doubled for the 2020 winter period. Along with work to minimise hardship for families, the Government has introduced a range of initiatives aimed at boosting employment for those who have lost jobs due to COVID- 19. Labour Party’s 2020 manifesto commitment The Labour Party’s 2020 manifesto committed to: • increase abatement thresholds to $160 and $250 per week from 1 April 2021; • progressively increase the abatement threshold year on year in line with minimum wage increases; and • continue with the welfare overhaul work and to implement WEAG’s recommendations to improve the welfare system. 2.2 What regulatory system(s) are already in place? Benefit abatement thresholds allow people to work some hours while on benefit New Zealand’s welfare system is designed to assist people who are unable to fully support themselves through paid work. Assistance is targeted through the eligibility criteria 7 and the benefit abatement regime, which gradually reduces payments that people receive as their other income increases. Generally, the full rate of payment will be available to people earning up to a certain amount; this is the abatement threshold. Above this amount, payments abate as people’s other income increases, but payment can abate in different ways and at different rates based on the type of benefit payment. The abatement rules, along with the benefit rate, determine the benefit cut-out point, which is the amount of income at which a benefit is reduced to zero. The abatement threshold allows people to work for a small number of hours without having their benefit payment affected and is seen as a way to encourage labour market entry. It is also intended to recognise that there are additional costs associated with work, such as transport costs. 7 Social assistance payments are typically means-tested, and eligibility is based on family rather than individual income. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Page 38 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 13 Currently there are two main abatement regimes within the welfare system, which seek to align the financial incentives to work with the level of labour force engagement expected of the individual: • a part-time regime has two abatement thresholds, with a relatively low abatement rate of 30 percent applied at the first threshold, and an abatement rate of 70 percent applied at the second threshold. This is designed to incentivise part-time work and applies to people receiving Sole Parent Support (SPS) and Supported Living Payment (SLP), as well as to those under 65 receiving the Veteran’s Pension (VP). The assumption is that part-time work is often the best option for recipients of these payments. • a full-time regime has a relatively high abatement rate of 70% which is designed to incentivise full-time work. This mainly applies to people on Jobseeker Support (JS)- related benefits, as well as Non-Qualifying Partners (NQP) of New Zealand Superannuation (NZS) and VP recipients. The assumption is that people receiving these benefits are able to undertake full-time work where it is available. The current abatement thresholds and rates are set out below: Abatement rate at different thresholds Current amount beneficiaries can earn per week before their benefit begins to abate JS (abatement rate of 70%) $90 NZS/VP with non-qualifying partner (abatement rate of 70%) $115 SPS, SLP and VP (under 65) – Threshold One (abatement rate of 30%) $115 SPS, SLP and VP (under 65) – Threshold Two (abatement rate of 70%) $215 Under the current settings, a JS recipient would have their benefit reduce by 70 cents for every dollar earned over $90. For a SPS recipient, their benefit would reduce by 30 cents for every dollar earned over $115, and by 70 cents for every dollar earned over $215. The Minimum Family Tax Credit incentivises families with children to move off benefit and into greater amounts of work The MFTC is one of the WFF tax credits. The MFTC aims to incentivise families with children (in particular, sole parents) to move off benefit and into greater amounts of paid work 8 by ensuring people who move from working and receiving a main benefit into working and receiving the MFTC are not financially worse off from doing so. This is done by “topping-up” families’ earned income to a prescribed level (the MFTC threshold) that means they are financially better off by working a greater amount and receiving the MFTC than working and receiving a benefit. This effectively creates a guaranteed income for families, above what they would receive if they were on a benefit. Around 90 percent of MFTC recipients are sole parent families. 8 Families with children qualify for the MFTC when they work 20 hours of more per week for sole parents, and 30 hours or more for couples. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Page 39 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 14 The MFTC abates at 100 percent for every dollar earned over the MFTC threshold. This means that for every dollar a family earns over the prescribed amount, their MFTC entitlement reduces by one dollar. The MFTC threshold, as at 30 November 2020, is $27,768 per year (after tax). This is $534 per week. Approximately 3,800 families were paid nearly $12 million in the 2020/21 tax year. The average MFTC payment amount was $3,100 per family. IR forecasts that there will be a decrease to approximately 3,200 families in the 2021/22 tax year. 9 As part of the introduction of WFF, on 26 April 2004, Cabinet agreed to increase the MFTC on 1 April each year by an amount sufficient to ensure that couples do not suffer a reduction in income when moving off benefit into 30 hours of paid work a week, from 1 April 2006 onwards \[CAB Min (04) 13/4 refers\]. Consequently, the MFTC threshold has been increased each year since 2006 to reflect the latest changes to relevant settings (such as benefit rates, the minimum wage and abatement thresholds). The MFTC threshold is set by calculating the total income a two-parent family could receive if they were working less than 30 hours and receiving an abated main benefit (the couple rate for Jobseeker Support) and the Winter Energy Payment. This amount is then increased by $1 and rounded up to the next multiple of $52 (as expressed for the weeks in the year). Sole parents face the same MFTC threshold as two-parent families. As the sole parent benefit is lower than the couple rate of Jobseeker Support, this means that sole parents gain significantly more than two-parent families by moving onto the MFTC. Roles of government agencies The Ministry of Social Development administers and provides information on financial assistance, employment and housing. MSD’s role includes paying financial assistance, providing support for getting people into and maintaining employment and housing. Inland Revenue administers New Zealand’s tax system, collecting Crown revenue, as well as collecting and distributing social support programme payments, such as WFF tax credits. 9 Some reasons for the decrease in tax year 2021 could be due to the impacts of Covid-19 on employment, or the increase in main benefit payments and temporary doubling of the Winter Energy Payment from 1 April 2020. The latter changes have made the financial incentives to stay on benefit higher. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Page 40 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 15 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? Abatement thresholds have become out of line with their original settings and offer little financial incentive to enter the labour market or work part-time Abatement thresholds are increased through one-off changes, rather than being adjusted annually. On 1 April 2020, the abatement thresholds were adjusted through funding secured through Budget 2019. This funding committed to progressively increase the abatement thresholds for main benefits over four years (until 2023, as set out in the below table) in line with minimum wage increases \[CAB-19-MIN-0174.36 refers\]. The adjustment aimed to ensure that the number of hours a beneficiary could work on minimum wage before abatement began would not reduce any further. Abatement threshold for: Prior to April 2020 1 April 2020 1 April 2021 1 April 2022 1 April 2023 Jobseeker Support $80 $90 $95 $100 $105 NZS/VP non-qualifying partner $100 $115 $120 $125 $130 SPS and SLP – Threshold One $100 $115 $120 $125 $130 SPS and SLP – Threshold Two $200 $215 $220 $225 $230 However, prior to the April 2020 adjustment, the last adjustment to main benefit abatement settings occurred in September 2010, when changes were made for recipients of (what was then known as) Domestic Purposes Benefit, Invalid’s Benefit, Widow’s Benefit as well as for VP (under 65), and NZS and VP with non-qualifying partners. For the full-time abatement regime for JS, the threshold had remained at $80 since it was last adjusted in 1996. This has meant that the amount that people could earn before their benefit abated has declined in real terms over time as wages have increased, particularly for JS recipients. For example, a person receiving JS in 1997 could work approximately 11.4 hours on minimum wage ($7.00 per hour) before their benefit abated. In 2019, a person receiving JS could only work for approximately 4.5 hours on minimum wage ($17.70 per hour) before their benefit abated. The current settings, despite the adjustments made in April 2020 and subsequent increases set through till 2023, have moved out of line with the original abatement settings and now offer little financial incentive for people to engage in paid work while receiving a main benefit. The MFTC was not adjusted following COVID-19 related benefit increases On 1 April 2020, as part of the previous Government’s response to COVID-19, main benefit rates were increased by $25 per week. The Winter Energy Payment was also temporarily doubled for the 2020 winter period. Under normal circumstances, a consequential increase in the MFTC threshold would likely have been made at the same time. However, the urgent pace at which these benefit changes occurred meant that no decision to change the MFTC threshold was made. This has resulted in the current MFTC threshold being misaligned with the current benefit rate. Under current policy, the MFTC threshold should be increased to account for the increase in benefit rates. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Page 41 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 16 Proposed increases to the abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 will also require an increase to the MFTC threshold under current policy Increasing the abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 (as per the Labour Party’s 2020 manifesto commitment) has flow-on implications for the MFTC threshold. Under current policy, a consequential increase to the 2021/22 MFTC threshold would be made to reflect the changes to the abatement thresholds. If the MFTC threshold does not maintain alignment with the benefit abatement thresholds, this will be inconsistent with the policy intent of the MFTC, that is, to provide a financial incentive to work a greater amount and move off benefit and on to the MFTC. The greater the misalignment of the MFTC threshold and benefits, and the longer the misalignment continues, the greater the impact on the incentives for low income families with children to leave the benefit and work a greater amount and receive the MFTC. There is also a potential equity issue in that not fully aligning the MFTC threshold financially disadvantages those families who remain off benefit (relative to those who are on benefit). If benefit settings are intended to reflect a minimum level of income for beneficiaries, then implicitly, the guaranteed minimum income provided to working and off-benefit families (via the MFTC) should be at least the same. The MFTC provides little to no incentive for sole parents to work more than 20 hours a week while receiving the MFTC The proposed increases to the abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 are significant, which would require the 2021/22 MFTC threshold adjustment to be much greater than its previous adjustments. This may further exacerbate known issues with the MFTC, mainly that the MFTC provides little to no financial incentive for sole parents to work more than the minimum required hours (20 hours a week) while receiving the MFTC. This is because income earned over the MFTC threshold would reduce the MFTC payment dollar for dollar. This is known as a 100 percent effective marginal tax rate (EMTR); high EMTRs indicate low financial incentives to work. A significant adjustment to the MFTC threshold would further reward working the minimum number of hours required for the MFTC at the expense of working more than this. This is because the adjustment would mean the income range over which the MFTC is available would be extended, resulting in a larger range of hours worked with a 100 percent EMTR and further reduction in incentives to work greater hours for sole parents on low/minimum wage. For example: • Fully adjusting the MFTC increases the gain that sole parents receive by moving from working and receiving the benefit to working and receiving the MFTC to around $125 a week; but reduces the gain from increasing work hours from 20 to 40 hours a week to around $20 a week. 10 • Partially adjusting the MFTC increases the gain that sole parents receive by moving from working and receiving the benefit to working and receiving the MFTC 10 This calculation is for a sole-parent family with two children (aged 3 and 5) earning the minimum wage ($20 per hour) when working, living in Auckland, paying lower quartile rent and receiving the Accommodation Supplement, Temporary Additional Support and relevant tax credits. It does not take into account childcare costs. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Page 42 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 17 to around $85 a week; but reduces the gain from increasing work hours from 20 to 40 hours a week to around $60 a week. 11 While working 20 hours a week may be desirable for many sole parents due to their caregiving responsibilities and financial incentives being just one of the reasons for labour supply decisions, disincentivising sole parents from working more than 20 hours per week (or taking up higher wage work) may impact on their longer-term labour market trajectories and lifetime earnings. It is important to note that there is also robust evidence to show that the gap between “in work” income and “out of work” income is a stronger driver of behaviour than the incentive to increase work by an additional hour. A significant adjustment in the MFTC would result in a larger gap between “in work” income and “out of work” income (at 20 hours for sole parents and 30 hours for couples) and would potentially provide a stronger financial incentive to go from not working to working the minimum number of hours for the MFTC than partial or no adjustment options. There is an upcoming review of Working for Families, which includes the MFTC A review of WFF is planned for 2021, This means that any significant adjustments to the current MFTC threshold would likely increase the cost of options for reform. This is largely due to: • the significant gain that sole parents receive by moving from working and receiving a benefit to working and receiving the MFTC – currently around $60 a week (for no extra hours of work) • the likely need to ensure that options for reform do not financially disadvantage low-income working sole parents, as this would be likely to be seen as contrary to the Government’s vision for the welfare system, particularly given its focus on improving income adequacy and reducing child poverty. any significant adjustment to the MFTC threshold would increase the gain that sole parents currently receive by moving onto the MFTC 11 As above. 12 Earning minimum wage and therefore, eligible for the maximum amount of the MFTC. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) Page 43 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 18 2.4 What do stakeholders think about the problem? No explicit consultation on these changes beyond Government agencies has taken place No consultation (beyond other Government agencies) has taken place as the proposed increases to the abatement thresholds is a Manifesto commitment and the Government’s consideration of the proposed changes in this RIA is Budget Sensitive. MSD, IR and the Treasury’s views on the adjustments to the MFTC thresholds are set out in Section 5.1. However, the Welfare Expert Advisory Group informed our analysis The proposed approach for abatement threshold changes has been informed by the findings of the WEAG, which in turn was informed by the views of stakeholders and those who took part in the engagement process. The WEAG conducted wide consultation with a variety of groups across New Zealand. This included face to face meetings with more than 1,300 individuals and organisations (such as people receiving welfare payments, employers, service providers, advocates, and community workers), 1,348 written submissions, and additional submissions through online engagement. In February 2019, the WEAG published its report Whakamana Tāngata, which noted that the income support system needs to encourage the outcomes of good and appropriate work by ensuring people are financially better off in paid work. One element of making work pay is ensuring that abatement settings are reasonable, especially at the point when people are entering work. The WEAG recommended that the abatement thresholds for main benefits be increased to $150 and $250 per week. The WEAG also recommended substantial changes to WFF and other tax credits to improve the adequacy of incomes and returns from paid work for families with children. This included a recommendation to replace the MFTC, In-Work Tax Credit and Independent Earner Tax Credit with a new Earned Income Tax Credit. 2.5 What are the objectives sought in relation to the identified problem? Three primary objectives to consider are: • Improve income adequacy for beneficiaries and low-income people • Improve financial incentives to work • Pay welfare support at a sustainable cost to government These objectives should be considered within the overarching government commitment to overhaul the welfare system, in line with the WEAG’s recommendations. Improving income adequacy for beneficiaries and low-income people Any changes proposed in this RIA should seek to improve income adequacy for low-income people. While the recent changes to the welfare system (including the Families Package, the $25 increase to main benefits on 1 April 2020 and the indexation of main benefits to average wage) will help to improve living standards of low-income people, income 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Page 44 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 19 adequacy issues are likely to remain for many low-income people. The changes proposed in this RIA should ensure people can receive increased incomes through undertaking paid employment, and keep more of their earnings. Improving financial incentives to work Improving financial incentives to work is one component of encouraging people who are able to work to seek employment, alongside other interventions such as active labour market policies. For the majority of people, paid work is a key means of achieving improved wellbeing. For this reason, most income support systems typically aim to ensure that people are financially incentivised to work where this is a possibility. However, financial incentives are only one of many factors that influence people’s decisions on whether to work and how much to work and they are not usually the most important factor. Additionally, different amounts of work may be appropriate for different people given their circumstances. While the changes proposed in this RIA seek to improve incentives to enter the labour market and to work part-time, the changes also slightly reduce the incentives to work full- time. Paying welfare at a cost that is sustainable to government The Government is required to act and pursue its policy objectives in accordance with the principles of responsible fiscal management as set out in the Public Finance Act 1989, such as managing fiscal risks facing the government, having regard for the impact on present and future generations, and ensuring the Crown’s resources are managed effectively and efficiently. Any changes proposed in this RIA must be at a sustainable cost to government, particularly given the current tight fiscal environment following the range of initiatives implemented by the Government in response to COVID-19. There are significant trade-offs between these three objectives There are significant trade-offs between these three objectives. It is generally possible to achieve two of the three objectives for any given policy change, but not all three. These three objectives are all important, and any policy will need to balance the trade-offs between these objectives. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Page 45 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 20 Section 3: Opti on ide ntificati on 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? There are two options for abatement threshold increases Option One – Increase the abatement thresholds to $160 and $250 per week on 1 April 2021 This option proposes to increase abatement thresholds to $160 and $250 per week from 1 April 2020, as specified in the Labour Party Manifesto 2020. The proposed increases are set out below: Abatement threshold for: 1 April 2021 Jobseeker Support $160 NZS/VP with non-qualifying partner $160 SPS and SLP – Threshold One $160 SPS and SLP – Threshold Two $250 Under this option, beneficiaries will be able to work up to eight hours on minimum wage (based on minimum wage increasing to $20 per hour on 1 April 2021) before their benefit begins to abate. For recipients of SPS, SLP and VP (under 65), they can work up to 12.5 hours before their benefit begins to abate at the higher rate (Threshold Two). This would have a fiscal cost to the Government of $387.496 million in income support payments and $6.4 million in operating costs over the forecast period. Option Two – Status quo This option proposes not to increase abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021, other than the adjustments that have been set to occur for 2021, 2022 and 2023 through funding secured through Budget 2019. This means for the next three years, the abatement thresholds would be adjusted as follows: Abatement threshold for: 1 April 2021 1 April 2022 1 April 2023 Jobseeker Support $95 $100 $105 NZS/VP with non-qualifying partner $120 $125 $130 SPS and SLP – Threshold One $120 $125 $130 SPS and SLP – Threshold Two $220 $225 $230 Under this option, the number of hours beneficiaries can currently work up to before their benefit begins to abate (around 4.5 hours on minimum wage) will be maintained (not reduce any further) over the next three years. There are two options for retrospectively adjusting the Minimum Family Tax Credit threshold There are two options to consider for retrospective adjustment to the 2020/21 MFTC threshold: • Option One (status quo) – full retrospective alignment of the 2020/21 MFTC threshold. This is the status quo, as under current policy, the MFTC threshold 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Page 46 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 21 would be adjusted in line with changes to benefit rates and abatement thresholds. • Option Two – no retrospective alignment of the 2020/21 MFTC threshold. Retrospective adjustment Detail Fiscal cost Number of families affected Average gain for affected families Option One – full alignment (status quo) This would increase the threshold to $29,432. $24.1 million over the forecast period. Around 3,200 families receiving the MFTC in the 2020/21 tax year would be affected. Around 400 additional families would become newly eligible. Additional gain of $32 for each week they receive the MFTC. It is estimated that the average MFTC increase would be $1,280 per family per year. 13 Option Two – no alignment This would maintain the threshold at $27,768. No additional cost. Around 3,200 families receiving the MFTC in the 2020/21 tax year would continue to receive the same amount of MFTC as currently. Some families may be better off working and receiving an abated benefit than staying on the MFTC. There are three options for prospectively adjusting the Minimum Family Tax Credit threshold There are three options to consider for prospective adjustment to the 2021/22 MFTC threshold: • Option One (status quo) – full alignment of the 2021/22 MFTC threshold to reflect abatement threshold increases. This is the status quo, as under current policy, the MFTC threshold would be adjusted in line with changes to benefit rates and abatement threshold. • Option Two – partial alignment of the 2021/22 MFTC threshold. • Option Three – no adjustment to the MFTC threshold. 13 The maximum MFTC increase a family could receive would be $1,664 ($32 x 52 weeks). Because newly eligible families will have incomes above the current threshold, the average increase for these families will be less than $32 dollars a week 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Page 47 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 22 Prospective adjustment Detail Fiscal cost \*\* Number of families affected \*\* Average gain for affected families \*\* Option One – full alignment (status quo) This would increase the threshold to $32,604. $51 million over the forecast period. Around 4,900 families expected to be receiving MFTC in the 2021/22 tax year. Of these, around 1,300 families would be newly eligible for the MFTC. Additional gain $61 for each week they receive the MFTC. The maximum possible increase for the year would be $3,172 per family 14 . Option Two – partial alignment This would increase the threshold to $30,576. $17 million over the forecast period. Around 4,000 families expected to be receiving the MFTC in the 2021/22 tax year. Of these, around 400 families would be newly eligible for the MFTC. Additional gain of $22 for each week they receive the MFTC. The maximum possible increase for the year would be $1,144 per family 15 . Two-parent families (10% of the MFTC recipients) would be better off receiving an abated benefit and working than staying on the MFTC. Option Three – no alignment This would maintain the threshold at $29,432 (assuming retrospective change goes ahead). There may be some working families, who move off the MFTC and on to a benefit (or stay on benefit rather than move onto the MFTC). This would mean reduced MFTC (and In-work Tax Credit) costs, but an increase in benefit costs. These costs have not been quantified and are likely to be small. Around 3,600 families receiving the MFTC in the 2020/21 tax year would continue to receive the same amount of MFTC as in 2020/21. Couples (and some sole-parent families) would be better off working and receiving an abated benefit than staying on the MFTC. \*\* Note that this table assumes the full retrospective alignment for the 2020/21 MFTC threshold, which was agreed by Cabinet on 30 November 2020, has been implemented \[CAB-20-MIN-0490 refers\]. 14 It is difficult to estimate the number of weeks a family would receive the MFTC on average for a future tax year. The gain would be less for families who do not receive the MFTC for the full year. 15 As above 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Page 48 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 23 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? Full assessment of impacts was not completed for abatement threshold increases As the Labour Party has committed to increasing the abatement thresholds as per Option One, MSD has not undertaken a full assessment of the likely impacts of the options in this RIA. Criteria for evaluating options for adjusting the Minimum Family Tax Credit Both the retrospective and prospective alignment options have been evaluated against the following criteria: • Work incentives – the option should ensure the MFTC continues to fulfil its policy objective to financially incentivise low-income families with children to move from working and receiving a benefit to working and receiving the MFTC. • Equity – the option should not financially disadvantage those families receiving the MFTC (ie, in full-time work and off benefit) compared with families who are on benefit. • Future reform – the option should not significantly limit choices for future reform of the MFTC and WFF scheme generally. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? As the Labour Party has committed to increasing the abatement thresholds as per Option One, MSD has not considered any other options for change, such as increasing the abatement thresholds by different amounts, or changing the abatement rate. Note that changing the abatement rate may be more difficult to influence people’s decision to work as it can be harder for people to understand how the changes in the abatement rates affect their payments. Other options ruled out include possible abatement setting changes for clients on Jobseeker Support on the ground of a health condition, injury or disability (JS-HCD). JS- HCD is available for people assessed as being temporarily unable to work, or able to work only part-time. Therefore, JS-HCD recipients have either part-time or deferred work obligations. However, JS-HCD recipients face the same high abatement rate of 70 percent as other JS clients, aimed at incentivising full-time work, which means current settings may not adequately support JS-HCD recipients to engage in part-time work. Changing the abatement settings for JS-HCD recipients to better support part-time work was ruled out due to time constraints. Further work is required to design and implement any changes in this space to ensure positive outcomes for JS-HCD recipients. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 s 9(2)(f)(iv) Page 49 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 24 Section 4: Impact Analysis Marginal impact: How does each of the options identified in section 3.1 compare with taking no action under each of the criteria set out in section 3.2?

Option One is the preferred option for abatement threshold increases The proposed option for abatement threshold increase is Option One as it means the thresholds will better align with the original abatement settings (as well as WEAG’s recommendation), which enabled beneficiaries to work for longer hours before abatement occurred. This option will allow working beneficiaries to keep a greater proportion of their earnings before their benefit is affected, thereby improving income adequacy and financial incentives to work part-time while on a benefit. This option may reduce the financial incentive for beneficiaries working part time to move into full time work. However, better incentivising beneficiaries to enter the labour market and maintain work, even if part-time work, is important. This is particularly so for those already disadvantaged in the labour market prior to COVID-19, such as sole parents and people with health conditions, injury or disability, for whom suitable work may only be part- time work. Paid work can not only lift incomes and living standards, it can also enable people to experience better self-assessed health, life satisfaction and social connectedness. Part- time work can also provide a pathway to full-time work by providing opportunities to connect with the labour market, gain work experience and become familiar with the demands that can come with employment. Also, given the economic impacts of COVID-19 and many people facing reduced hours, this option ensures that those on low incomes with reduced hours can access financial assistance while still being attached to their job. No consultation (beyond other Government agencies) has taken place as this change is a Manifesto commitment (and the Government’s consideration of it is Budget Sensitive). Option One is the preferred option by IR for restrospectively adjusting the Minimum Family Tax Credit Option One is the preferred option by IR, and is the proposed option in the Cabinet paper. MSD does not have a preferred option. Note that Cabinet agreed to adjust the 2020/21 MFTC threshold as per Option One on 30 November 2020 \[CAB-20-MIN-0490\]. This option means the financial incentive provided by the MFTC for families with children to move off benefit and into greater amounts of work would be maintained for the remainder of the 2020/21 tax year. While the increase cannot incentivise families with children to move off benefit for the period of the 2020/21 tax year that has already passed (April to December 2020), it addresses the potential equity issues, whereby those families who remained off benefit and in work during April to December 2020 are financially disadvantaged relative to those who were on benefit. MSD and IR have different preferred options for prospectively adjusting the Minimum Family Tax Credit Option Two is the preferred option by MSD, and is the proposed option in the Cabinet paper. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Page 53 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 28 This option ensures that around 90% of MFTC recipients (ie, sole parents) would remain better off working and receiving the MFTC than working and receiving a benefit. While a partial increase would extend the income range over which the MFTC is available, resulting in reduced financial incentives to work greater hours for sole parents on low-incomes, the impact would be smaller than Option One. MSD considers fully aligning the MFTC threshold would increase the cost and complexity of any future WFF review particularly if there is a desire to avoid people being financially disadvantaged. However, these effects will be less under Option One than Option Two. IR’s preferred option is Option One. While the fiscal cost of full alignment are greater than under other options, this option maintains the work incentives provided by the MFTC by ensuring low-income families with children (both sole parents and two-parent families) are better off working and receiving the MFTC than working and receiving a benefit. IR does not consider the potential effects of aligning the MFTC threshold on any future WFF review to be a significant enough issue to warrant removing the work incentives currently provided by the MFTC. IR considers that there is a potential equity issue if the MFTC threshold is not fully aligned. Less than full alignment potentially disadvantages those families who remain in work and off benefit, relative to those in work and receiving a benefit. If benefit settings are intended to reflect a minimum level of income for beneficiaries, then implicitly, the guaranteed minimum income provided to working and off-benefit families (via the MFTC) should be at least the same. In advice to Ministers, the Treasury recommended the no prospective alignment option due to the tight fiscal environment. The Treasury also did not consider that the policy decision \[to align the MFTC threshold with benefit rates\] meets the threshold to be progressed as a Budget pre-commitment. While the Treasury acknowledged that it was likely to introduce greater complexity for clients, the Treasury did not agree that these adverse effects were sufficient to justify funding the initiative ahead of the Budget process given the tight fiscal environment. 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg, ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg, compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value where appropriate, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non-monetised impacts Evidence certainty (High, medium or low) Abatement threshold increases Additional costs of proposed approach compared to taking no action Monetised cost to Crown Increase in Benefit or Related Expenses from increasing $387.496 million over five years.

Better incentivising beneficiaries to engage in work through abatement threshold increases could also lead to positive impact on broader wellbeing, as being in suitable work is good for people’s health and wellbeing (provided the work is safe, stable, suits people’s circumstances and financially beneficial). The expected benefits described in section 5.2 will depend on the interaction between different assistance types, the extent to which people undertake further work and the subsequent impact on their earned incomes. Also, there is a risk that the gains will be lost over time if abatement thresholds do not increase in future years. Total Monetised Benefit No costings of the total monetised benefits. N/A Non-monetised benefits Improves financial incentive to work and receive the MFTC and improves income adequacy for low- income individuals and families. Moderate impact. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Page 61 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 36 Section 6: Impleme nta tion a nd operati on 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? The Manifesto commitment specified an implementation date of 1 April 2021 for abatement threshold increases. Legislative vehicle Changes to abatement thresholds require an Order in Council and regulation amendment. Abatement thresholds for main benefits and New Zealand Superannuation Non-Qualifying Partner are set out in Schedule 2 of the Social Security Act 2018. An Order in Council under section 452(2)(c) of the Social Security Act 2018 is required to make the abatement threshold increases for main benefits and NZS for April 2021. Abatement thresholds for Veteran’s Pension Non-Qualifying Partner and Veteran’s Pension (under 65) are set out separately in regulation 42A of the Veterans’ Support Regulations 2014, which will also require amendment. Changes to the MFTC threshold can be made by an Order in Council as set out in sections ME 1(4) and MF 7(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007. However, an Order in Council is required by 1 December for changes to apply from 1 April the following year. Therefore, adjustments to the 2020/21 and 2021/22 MFTC thresholds would need to be made via amendments to the Income Tax 2007. Communication A communications plan will be developed to ensure the changes are communicated to staff and the public in advance of implementation. Transitional arrangements A Transitional Assistance Payment (TAP), which is a temporary non-taxable payment, could be considered for the small number of people (around 79 people) who may be financially disadvantaged by the proposed abatement threshold increases on 1 April 2021. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? Minimal implementation risks with the abatement threshold increases Implementation risks for abatement thresholds are minimal. The changes will use existing administrative structures and will not require any new service design. There is a potential for public confusion around the proposed increases, as this proposal overrides the four-year adjustments to the abatement thresholds secured through Budget 2019. A communications plan will be developed to ensure sufficient information is provided to both staff and the public through various platforms, including MSD’s website. Some implementation risks with the adjustments to Minimum Family Tax Credit A partial increase to the 2021/22 MFTC threshold may cause confusion with some people as to which option they would be better off under. Some two-parent families may be better off working and receiving benefit than working and receiving the MFTC, but for one reason 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Page 62 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 37 or another remain on the MFTC and receive less than what they may be entitled to. Material will be developed to ensure sufficient information about the MFTC adjustments are available to both staff and the public through various platforms, including IR’s website. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Page 63 of 64 Full Impact Statement Template | 38 Section 7: Moni toring, evaluati on a nd revie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Behavioural changes arising from abatement threshold increases can be monitored using administrative data MSD will be able to use administrative data to monitor the trends in declared income before and after changes to abatement thresholds, including the trends for different subgroups (eg, Māori, Pacific people, sole parents, people with a health condition or disability). An expected trend following the abatement threshold changes would be an increase in the level of income that clients declare to MSD, as a result of clients taking up extra work in response to the changes. There may also be a signalling effect (ie, changed behaviour) ahead of the changes. Behavioural changes arising from adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit can be monitored using administrative data The effects of the MFTC threshold alignments can be monitored using data IR currently collects as part of administering the MFTC. This includes the number of MFTC recipients, the nature of those families, the amount of MFTC payments made, and MFTC recipient movement between the MFTC and the benefit. This administrative data will show what effect the MFTC alignment changes have on the up take of the credit, and the actual fiscal cost to the Government of the chosen settings. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? As part of the Welfare Overhaul work programme, MSD is working on developing a measure of a client’s total income, and regularly reporting on this measure. Progression of this work will allow for reporting on this measure past 2021. The measure will allow MSD to analyse the longer term impact of this policy on client outcomes. In December 2020, officials intend to provide advice to joint Ministers on a potential scope for a work programme to review WFF, which includes the MFTC. The WFF review is part of the broader welfare overhaul work programme and is expected to take at least 12 months. Any changes to WFF through legislative amendment would take even longer to implement. It is noted that, subject to any change in Government policy on the alignment of the MFTC threshold to future changes to benefit rates or abatement settings, further reviews of the MFTC threshold will be required annually. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 s 9(2)(f)(iv) Page 64 of 64
Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 1 Coversheet: Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report Advising agencies The Treasury, Inland Revenue Decision sought Note the analysis in this report. Proposing Ministers Minister of Finance, Minister of Revenue Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? Summarise in one or two sentences COVID-19 related public health restrictions at Alert Level 2 or above can create short and severe economic shocks. Cumulatively, they stress firm balance sheets and risk delivering unequitable outcomes. The effects of these shocks on firm revenue, coupled with uncertainty of the nature of Government support in the event of a virus resurgence, risks higher unemployment and firm failure as firms are disincentivised from or unable to employ people or invest. Summary of Preferred Option or Conclusion (if no preferred option) How will the agency’s preferred approach work to bring about the desired change? Why is this the preferred option? Why is it feasible? Is the preferred approach likely to be reflected in the Cabinet paper? Summarise in one or two sentences The recommended approach was to introduce and pre-announce a new one-off Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) available to all firms in the event of an increase from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2, 3, or 4. The recommended sub-options were: - To make the RSP available to all firms that experience a drop in revenue of 30% or more over a 14-day period as a result of higher Alert Level restrictions; and - To pay the lesser of: o $1500 plus $400 per full-time employee (FTE) (up to a cap of 50); or, o Two times the experienced drop in revenue over the 14-day period. These options were preferred because they: - allow businesses to better plan ahead; - meant the RSP would be readily deployable by Inland Revenue in the event it is needed (following the passing of legislation and building the system); - are fiscally sustainable; - cushion the economic blow of higher Alert Levels to firms, limiting scarring effects; Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 2 - support the transition up Alert Levels, boosting social licence for public health regulations; - encourage the shift to a more COVID-19 resilient economy; - ensure that some low revenue firms do not gain disproportionately from the RSP, in excess of their needs to meet fixed costs and transition costs; and - target vulnerable but viable firms. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? Monetised and non-monetised benefits The RSP will support the national effort to eliminate COVID-19, for the benefit of all New Zealanders. The RSP provides additional financial support to firms to allow them to continue to meet fixed costs and cover costs associated with an escalation of Alert Levels, and quickly continue operations as soon as Alert Level restrictions allow. In turn, this benefits individuals employed by those firms. Whilst the Payment is available to all businesses, SMEs are the main financial beneficiaries. This recognises that the vast majority of businesses in New Zealand employ fewer than 50 people, and that smaller firms are less resilient to economic shocks than larger businesses. However, it is important to recognise that while larger firms are more resilient on average, larger firms can need support too. Not allowing large firms to access this form of support would disadvantage firms just on the cut-off, such as firms with 51 employees. This could make it harder for these firms to survive and may incentivise them to get rid of staff in order to become eligible, which we do not want to encourage. For this reason, the RSP will be available to firms of all sizes. Where do the costs fall? Monetised and non-monetised costs; for example to local government or regulated parties The fiscal costs fall to the Crown, however Treasury analysis suggests the long-term fiscal, economic and social impacts of no action would likely be greater. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts? How significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? Compressed timelines create policy development, delivery, and communications risks, which could lead to: - payments being more widely available than is efficient, or being paid to unviable firms, at unnecessary fiscal cost; - damaging the social capital that is critical for the success of the COVID-19 public health strategy; and - business confusion around the access to the scheme, meaning firms may lose out on support they are entitled to. The main mitigations we have undertaken include: - to agree, via Joint Ministers and Cabinet, detailed design rules in order to enable Inland Revenue to build the scheme at pace with as much certainty as possible; Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 3 - a series of measures to boost the integrity of the scheme and minimise gaming risks; - taking a co-ordinated cross-Government approach to communications; - engaging with external business stakeholders to inform the design of the scheme and promote its availability, ensuring the widest audiences are reached. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? How confident are you of the evidence base? Evidence drawn on to inform the design of the RSP include: Regular, detailed qualitative engagement with the business community and monitoring of the effectiveness of existing supports Evidence was consistent from a diverse range of groups that: - greater certainty about the nature of government support in the event of a resurgence was critical, which led the decision to announce the support would be available in advance of any escalation of Alert Levels; - firm balance sheets in the most affected sectors were increasingly stressed; and - additional debt products were less appropriate. Evaluation of the uptake of the Small Business Cashflow Scheme (SBCS) also evidenced the waning appetite for debt. The Payment was therefore designed as a grant. Real-time transaction data, which showed the impacts of Alert Level on revenue - Xero data on revenue drops experienced by firms month-to-month throughout 2020 informed our understanding of Alert Level impacts. 1 - This, alongside information on uptake of the various wage subsidies, allowed us to estimate the number of firms facing significant revenue drops at different Alert Levels and led to the 30% revenue drop test. Survey data on firms’ cost structures and cash reserves - The Annual Enterprise Survey (AES) 2 provided insight into the fixed, variable, and wage costs usually faced by firms of varying size, allowing us to understand the scale of need when normal revenue streams are disrupted. - This gave quantitative support to insights gathered through stakeholder engagement about the difficulty in meeting fixed costs under higher Alert Level restrictions. - Better 4 Business (B4B) 3 research into firms’ cash reserves also echoed messages from stakeholders concerning balance sheet stress and eroded financial resilience. This evidence supported the case for grant-based support. Modelling and analysis of the macro and microeconomic impacts of Alert Levels on the economy. 1 The data provided was anonymised and aggregated to prevent the identification of businesses that are customers of Xero 2 Carried out by Stats NZ, the AES measures the financial performance and position of New Zealand businesses. 3 B4B is part of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. It carries out research on business health. The latest research is available here: https://www.betterforbusiness.govt.nz/resources-2/ Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 4 - The Treasury prepared estimates of economic activity under different Alert Levels for each industry at regular intervals during 2020, updating the analysis as new data became available. - These estimates were initially assumption-driven, based on macroeconomic data, and were updated as new data (including high frequency indicators and information on the uptake of the Government’s financial support) enabled re-examination of previous assumptions. - The Treasury also commissioned modelling of the impacts of border closure and Alert Level settings on sectors and regions of the economy, which was conclusive in demonstrating impacts across all sectors and particularly acute effects on tourism and hospitality firms. This analysis is not yet published.

Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 5 Supplementary Analysis: Resurgence Support Payment Section 1: General information 1.1 Purpose The Treasury and Inland Revenue are solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing: • stakeholders to be consulted on a government exposure draft of planned legislation (amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994) • final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 6 1.2 Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis a) What issues are in or out of scope? e.g., Ministers may already have ruled out certain issues. b) What are the limitations on the range of options considered and the criteria used to assess options? The RSP was recommended following direction from the Minister of Finance to deploy a new economic response initiative that was limited in scope to support the transition of viable firms to new economic settings; be flexible to support firms in higher Alert Level settings, be fiscally sustainable; and readily deployable. This limited the options to forms of support that could reach affected businesses quickly, and therefore risk issuing payments to firms who may not always need it. However, the criteria used to assess options indicated that in order to mitigate potential economic scarring effects, and with tight application criteria built in, thi s was a worthwhile trade-off. c) What limitations exist in relation to the evidence of the problem? d) What is the quality of data used for impact analysis? e) What limitations may there have been on consultation and testing? The Treasury engaged with a diverse range of business groups throughout 2020, including on the specific design parameters of a new Payment in the run up to preparing the Cabinet Paper. Those consulted on the RSP design included Business New Zealand, the Council of Trade Unions, the Auckland Chamber of Commerce, the Corporate Taxpayers Group, the Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, and Māori and Pacific business leaders. In addition to the pace with which consultation was undertaken, a limitation of this evidence continues to be the significant uncertainty around global events and changing, potentially unpredictable domestic conditions. Notwithstanding this uncertainty (which is detailed in the Treasury’s Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update and Half-Year Economic Update publications), the Treasury’s assessment of the impacts of Alert Level restrictions on economic activity and the related risks to aggregate firm solvency over potential series of virus outbreaks led to the conclusion that there was a gap in the support available. This assessment was informed by data from sources including the aforementioned AES, B2B surveys, Xero, and other modelling. The Treasury judges the quality of this data to be both high and comprehensive. f) What are the limitations on the assumptions underpinning the impact analysis? We assume that patterns of revenue impact experienced by firms are broadly consistent with those seen in periods of elevated Alert Levels throughout 2020. As such, we assume that the take up of the Payment would be broadly in line with that of other forms of COVID- 19 financial support tools to date, including the Wage Subsidy (WSS) and SBCS. Whilst the design of the Payment reflects the greater information available than when the pandemic first began, the uncertainty related to the nature of any future COVID-19 outbreak means the impacts may be different each time. Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 7 1.3 Responsible Manager (signature and date): Jean Le Roux Transitions, Regions and Economic Development Growth, Productivity and Services Directorate The Treasury 28 January 2021 s 9(2)(a) Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 8 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the current state within which action is proposed? Set out the current state, e.g., Nature of the market; Industry structure; Social context; Environmental state. The Treasury’s Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update provided the context in which the advice on the RSP was developed. The subsequent Half-Year Economic Update was published on 17 December 2020. Both documents underline that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause widespread economic and social disruption around the world, and the effectiveness and timing of the distribution of vaccines were still unclear at the time of writing. Both reports present a central scenario wherein New Zealand’s border restrictions ease from 1 July 2021 and will lift from 1 January 2022, alongside alternative scenarios attempting to benchmark possible downside scenarios. In the meantime, New Zealanders should be prepared for the potential that whilst most of the economy will operate normally the majority of the time, Alert Levels may temporarily escalate. 2.2 What regulatory system(s) are already in place? • What are the key features of the regulatory system(s), including any existing regulation or government interventions/programmes? What are its objectives? The below diagram summarises the economic support landscape as of January 2021, including with the addition of the RSP, at different Alert Levels. The suite of interventions support the Government’s first overarching objective to keep New Zealanders safe from COVID-19, including by protecting jobs and livelihoods, and strengthening the economy. It does so by ensuring a package of financial support is in place for businesses and individuals in the event of Alert Level escalations following future resurgences of COVID- 19 in the community, with the aim of limiting the economic and social impacts if outbreaks occur. It also seeks to reduce the risk of resurgences by supporting workers to stay home when sick. These goals are complementary, as protecting New Zealanders from the virus will also support economic activity resuming quickly after any outbreaks. Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 9 • Why is Government regulation preferable to private arrangements in this area? Public health restrictions attempt to provide protection from COVD-19; firmly an intervention that should and could only be undertaken by government. However, the economic costs of the public health restrictions (such as Alert Level changes), land upon individuals and businesses. It is appropriate for government to share some of these costs, consistent with the provision of public goods. The Treasury’s latest estimates that the negative impacts to GDP from Alert Level restrictions (relative to pre-pandemic levels) are: • -25% to -30% at Alert Level 4 • -15% to -20% at Alert Level 3 • -6% to -10% at Alert Level 2 • -3% to -5% at Alert Level 1. These are significant impacts with distributional consequences and scarring effects that require interventions at a scale only the Government can provide via broad-based support. • Has the overall fitness-for-purpose of the system as a whole been assessed? When and with what result? What interdependencies or connections are there to other existing issues or on-going work? Part of the rationale for the introduction of a new RSP at Alert Level 2 was to fill a gap in the support available to businesses as the cumulative impacts of higher public health restrictions added additional stress to balance sheets. In designing the intervention, officials attempted to achieve consistency between the RSP, WSS and the SBCS, where sensible, so as to reduce business confusion. This is reflected in a number of the settings proposed above for the RSP, including many of the settings relating to business declarations and business eligibility. There are other settings that are not in alignment. Some are based on policy grounds, such as the differing revenue drop thresholds under the RSP and WSS reflecting the schemes’ different purposes at different Alert Levels. Others are based on the fact that there will be different agencies implementing the schemes, with different system capabilities and different approaches to achieving necessary scheme integrity. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? • How is the situation expected to develop if no further action is taken, and why is this a problem? (This is the basis for comparing options against each other). • What is the nature, scope and scale of the loss or harm being experienced, or the opportunity for improvement? How important is this to the achievement (or not) of the overall system objectives? • What is the underlying cause of the problem? Why cannot individuals or firms be expected to sort it out themselves under existing arrangements? • How robust is the evidence supporting this assessment? Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 10 The estimated negative impacts from Alert Level restrictions (relative to pre-pandemic levels) described in box 2.2 are significant, with distributional consequences and scarring effects that require interventions at a scale only the Government can provide through broad- based support. We know that Alert Level restrictions have an uneven impact across industries. Industries that find it costly to adapt operations for delivery under Alert Level settings, given the general necessity of in-person, on-site service provision, are under significant pressure. “Essential Services” definitions were used to form a view of which firms were able to operate at the higher Alert Levels. This assessment leveraged off work that was being undertaken by MBIE during the early stages of the COVID response to assess demand for Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) across essential industries, as well as work that was done between Treasury and MBIE on assessing uptake of the WSS. On top of this, firms suffer from the wider demand-side shocks due to reduced tourism activity, the decline in people movement, and economic conditions. Aggregate demand impacts from border closure particularly reduce demand for tourism-related industries such as accommodation, recreational activities etc. Statistics NZ Tourism Satellite Account information was used to inform a view on which industries were most impacted and the relative importance of international vs domestic tourism. The Treasury also commissioned modelling of the impacts of border closure and Alert Level settings on sectors and regions of the economy, which was conclusive in demonstrating impacts across all sectors and particularly acute effects on tourism and hospitality firms. 2.4 What do stakeholders think about the problem? • Who are the stakeholders? What is the nature of their interest? • Which stakeholders share the Agency’s view of the problem and its causes? • Which stakeholders do not share the Agency’s view in this regard and why? The Treasury engaged with Business New Zealand, the Council of Trade Unions, the Auckland Chamber of Commerce, and Pacific, Māori and Iwi business leaders in developing the RSP. Inland Revenue also engaged with the Corporate Taxpayers Group and the Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand. Their interest in the Payment was on behalf of business owners and employees throughout New Zealand. The engagement followed several months of conversations between the Treasury and business stakeholders on the impacts of higher Alert Levels and border settings on different sectors. There was extremely strong consensus from across the spectrum that providing greater certainty on the nature of Government support in the event higher Alert Levels were in place would be critical for businesses to plan and right-size smoothly. The RSP responded to this consistent message. Stakeholders were broadly supportive of the approach to create greater certainty on the landscape of government support, and particularly welcoming of measures that would address non-wage costs in addition to the costs covered by the WSS. There was strong feedback that the integrity of the schemes will be critical, with both Māori and Pacific business leaders raising concerns about possible gaming of support available. It was suggested that the communications approach to the package should be accompanied with clear guidance to maximise accessibility of the schemes, and partnerships with trusted community channels would aid access to the schemes and be critical in helping SMEs – which would likely be most vulnerable – prepare now for future outbreaks. Officials are using this feedback to inform the communications strategy. Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 11 2.5 What are the objectives sought in relation to the identified problem? • Objectives must be clear and not pre-justify a particular solution. They should be specified broadly enough to allow consideration of all relevant alternative solutions. • Where there are multiple policy objectives it should be clear how trade-offs between competing objectives are going to be made and the weightings given to objectives – not just those in direct conflict. • For further guidance, see 2.3 of the Guidance Note on Best Practice Analysis https://treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018-03/ia-bestprac-guidance-note.pdf The purpose of the RSP is to provide support for businesses’ to meet fixed costs and costs when transitioning from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2 or above, in a fiscally sustainable way. The objectives, which formed the criteria against which different options were assessed, are as follows: a) Support firms to maintain viability and employment levels across escalations in public health restrictions; b) Support firms to pay fixed costs (such as rent) if they are struggling to do so as a result of escalated Alert Levels; c) Share the cost associated with escalated Alert Levels between Government, firms and across economic sectors; and d) Encourage the shift to a COVID-19 resilient economy. This required the following scheme attributes, which informed the selection of options (see section 3): - Resilience to different public health scenarios - Providing business certainty, so firms can better plan ahead - Complementarity with existing schemes; and - Fiscal sustainability. Trade-offs In order to support firms to maintain viability and employment levels (objective (a)), there will necessarily be payments made to some firms who would survive anyway, and others that may not have been viable in the medium term (see objective (d)). However, from a fairness perspective, there is a case to equally share the cost of the exogenous shock provided by the pandemic (c). The critical weighting here is in favour of mitigating scarring economic effects for the long-term benefit of all New Zealanders , and designing a scheme that is resilient / can pay out quickly (see box 3.1). The Payment was therefore designed to be available to all firms but with design features built in to target the most affected and those with the fewest resources to respond to the restricted market settings created by higher Alert Levels. Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 12 Section 3: Option identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? • List and describe the key features of the options. Set out how each would address the problem or opportunity, and deliver the objectives identified. • How has consultation affected these options? • Are the options mutually exclusive, or do they or some of them work in combination? • Have non-regulatory options been considered? If not, why not? • What relevant experience from other countries has been considered? The first-order options were as follows: A. Front-loaded WSS-based scheme Lump sum worth 2 weeks of the wage subsidy paid for every change in AL to firms meeting a 40% revenue drop test, with a labour market attachment requirement: Assessment: maintains employment but does not address other costs associated with Alert Level escalation; 40% threshold aligned with WSS but likely too high at Alert Level 2; fiscally expensive. B. Amended WSS-based scheme As above, but restricting payments to escalations in ALs only, and allowing only one payment every four weeks. Assessment: potentially less frequent payments may do more to encourage transition, but challenges of option A remain. C. Lump-sum AL2+ grant \[this was the recommended and agreed approach\] Adapted form of options A&B that is: 1. Less generous per FTE, with a per-firm and per-FTE component to reflect fixed costs; 2. Subject to a less onerous revenue drop test, to reflect impact of AL2 on businesses; 3. Paid every time there is an escalation from AL1 to AL2 or above; and 4. Without a labour market attachment condition, but firms would declare they are viable. Assessment: responds to business feedback that more support was needed for fixed costs (e.g. rent); less generous, thereby better facilitating transition and potentially more equitably sharing the cost between Government and the private sector. D. Ongoing AL2+ grant As (C), but paid on an ongoing basis for every week a region or nation is at AL2 or above Assessment: benefits of Option C but less likely to facilitate transition, fiscally expensive. E. Time-limited AL2+ grant As (D), but with a fixed number of weeks that a firm can claim for over the life of the scheme. Assessment similar to (D); greater cushioning provided for firms than (C) but more expensive. The Treasury also considered grants directly aimed at hospitality firms and others directly identified in public health regulations as needing to make adaptations in order to meet social Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 13 distancing and hygiene requirements. This was ruled out due to the considerable boundary issues involved in categorising businesses by strict sectors. Option C was recommended in light of its strengths in delivering the overall objectives described in box 2.5 above. The sub-options that were consequently considered, which are largely mutually exclusive, are as follows: The public health settings that would trigger the scheme’s activation Based on the above objectives, we recommended that any new grant scheme should be available to businesses based on an escalation to AL2 or higher. This ties the duration of any payments to the time at which many businesses will continue to face substantial cost from public health restrictions. In the event that such an escalation is in one region, the case for only starting the scheme in that region was considered. Regional targeting would pose operational challenges – for example, firms that are registered in a different place to their economic activity, or subject to spillovers from restrictions in a neighbouring region. Those challenges mean that regional targeting will come with hard boundary cases, and would create operational difficulties for IR, though it is technically feasible. As an alternative, there was an option for Ministers to choose to turn the scheme on nationally or by region in the given circumstance. Given that this could undermine business certainty on the support received, which was a significant part of the policy aim informed by consultation, it was concluded that a commitment to provide the RSP when a region or the country was at AL2 or above would be subject to final Cabinet approval at the time of an escalation event. Whether to make the support time-limited, or an ongoing grant at certain Alert Levels The key strategic choice was between supporting firms to adapt to the new restrictions through a one-off or time limited payment, or maintaining as many existing firms or jobs as possible by providing ongoing, certain, support for the remainder of the pandemic. The former approach was judged to best support the objectives, in light of the greater fiscal sustainability associated with one-off payments; likelihood of supporting fewer non-viable firms; and potential to incentivise a transition to new market conditions. The conditions under which firms would be eligible Whilst all means of delivering targeted sector or viable firm support are imperfect, on balance, we recommended taking a similar approach to the Wage Subsidy Scheme and relied on a revenue-drop test. This is because: - It identifies those firms and sectors most affected by AL2 restrictions, whether that is due to the direct impact of public health restrictions or supply chain spill-overs; and - It is well understood by businesses as a common means of determining eligibility for COVID-19 support measures. The alternative identified was to specifically target firms that are subject to specific public health requirements by virtue of providing food and drink for on-premises consumption (hospitality). Treasury’s judgement, having consulted with delivery partners, is that doing so would be exceptionally challenging to define, audit, or operationalise; would create very difficult boundary issues for businesses to navigate and understand; and would create very high levels of customer contact and confusion. The means of calculating the grant value A grant to firms should be fiscally sustainable and ideally account for the fixed costs that firms face which scale relatively slowly with firm size and are hard to adjust quickly (such as Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 14 rent and utilities), and variable costs that can adjust more quickly (such as wages and the transition costs associated with Alert Level changes). In order to achieve this, we recommended that a grant value has a fixed and variable component using FTE 4 employees as a measure of firm size and variable costs. Grant = base value per firm + ( FTE payment \* FTE) To ensure that some low revenue firms do not gain disproportionately from the RSP, we also recommended a design mechanism whereby the amount of payment is capped at two times the fortnightly drop in revenue that the applicant has signalled in its application. This approach means the amount a firm receives will be the lower of the formula amount ($1,500 plus $400 per FTE) or two times the fortnightly drop in revenue. The Treasury estimated this would save a total of $30-50m in fiscal costs. We also explored alternative ways of setting a grant relative to a firm’s size (for example, on the basis of a firm’s revenue or balance sheet), but doing so poses substantial operational challenges and would be more complex for businesses. Whether to restrict the grant to SMEs. Larger firms have stronger balance sheets and access to credit and cash buffers, and the value of the payment will be much less material to their business decisions. However, the fiscal impact of providing the RSP to all firms without a cap on FTE was estimated to be relatively low (given that the base value was a substantial proportion of the cost, and there are very few large firms in New Zealand). On balance, it was preferred to cap the amount of the RSP to firms at the equivalent of a payment to firms with 50 FTE, similar to the original design of the Wage Subsidy, which has the benefits of equal treatment in approach to supporting all businesses. This was also supported by feedback gathered in consultation with stakeholders across the business community, who provided advice that the support would have strongest effect for SMEs. Have non-regulatory options been considered? If not, why not? What relevant experience from other countries has been considered? The Treasury explored whether demand-led schemes could be viable to support objectives including (a) and (d) above. It examined the UK’s ‘Eat Out to Help Out’ scheme, which subsidised meals out. It was concluded that the scheme would run counter to the public health goals at higher Alert Levels to subsidise and therefore incentivise eating out. The IMF’s Policies for the Recovery published in October 2020 was also considered. The publication recommended fiscal strategies including “cash or in-kind transfers to support transition and target those in need, in the event of partial opening”, which supported the case for the approach taken to designing the RSP. In addition, the Treasury engaged with officials in Australia to share ideas on building support schemes which targeted vulnerable but viable firms. 4 FTEs are determined in the same way as for the Wage Subsidy and SBCS: a full time worker is one who regularly works 20 or more hours a week. A part time worker is one who regularly works fewer than 20 hours a week. A part time worker is calculated as 0.6 of a full time worker. The total from classifying all employees is rounded up to the nearest FTE. Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 15 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? • Comment on relationships between the criteria, for example where meeting one criterion can only be achieved at the expense of another (trade-offs) Note: sections 3.2 and 3.3 from the original template are combined as the answers are strongly related. The desired impacts are directly related to the objectives of the RSP: a) Support firms to maintain viability and employment levels across escalations in public health restrictions; b) Support firms to pay fixed costs if they are struggling to do so as a result of escalated Alert Levels; c) Share the cost associated with escalated Alert Levels between Government, firms and across economic sectors; and d) Encourage the shift to a COVID-19 resilient economy. It was considered that grant-based support was more likely to support businesses to maintain viability and employment levels than debt-based alternatives, whilst being fiscally sustainable (given the quantum of funding set aside to respond to resurgence events if needed). Whilst debt based support may help firms manage immediate cash flow issues, it can become restrictive and delay investment in transition as they divert cash from growth activities to financing costs. Furthermore, firms are likely to be more risk averse than the Crown, which pools risk and has a large balance sheet, a long time horizon, and a public interest perspective. An additional part of the rationale for the RSP in delivering the above objectives relates to the impacts on social license for the public health response. Whilst the available evidence demonstrated a broadly high level of compliance with the public health restrictions during the outbreaks in 2020 (for example, traffic flows were much lower as a result of AL3 in Auckland), there was some evidence that the high degree of social capital that supported compliance with the longer national lockdown waned. In addition, at the time of designing the Payment, there was emerging evidence that compliance with restrictions overseas was waning, especially in cases where the economic support was judged to be insufficiently generous to incentivise people to self-isolate rather than work. It was concluded that economic response measures can play a key role in maintaining ongoing social license for public health restrictions, both in compensating individuals for their compliance with restrictions, minimising the impact on jobs and economic wellbeing, and reinforcing social solidarity. Whilst this is a difficult impact to measure and accurately attribute to economic support, the counterfactual would be a significant risk to the health and wellbeing of all New Zealanders.

The recommended approach was to introduce and pre-announce a new one-off Resurgence Support Payment available to all firms in the event of an increase from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2, 3, or 4. The recommended sub-options were: - To make the Payment available to all firms that experience a drop in revenue of 30% or more over a 14-day period as a result of higher Alert Level restrictions; and - To pay the lesser of: o $1500 plus $400 per full-time employee (FTE) (up to a cap of 50), or, o Two times the experienced drop in revenue. These options were preferred because they: - allow businesses to better plan ahead; - meant the RSP would be readily deployable by Inland Revenue in the event it is needed (following the passing of legislation and building the system); - are fiscally sustainable; - cushion the economic blow of higher Alert Levels to firms, limiting scarring effects; - support the transition up Alert Levels, boosting social licence for public health regulations; - encourage the shift to a more COVID-19 resilient economy; - ensure that some low revenue firms do not gain disproportionately from the RSP, in excess of their needs to meet fixed costs and transition costs; and - target vulnerable but viable firms. This approach was informed through consultation with Business New Zealand, the Council of Trade Unions, the Auckland Chamber of Commerce, and Pacific, Māori and Iwi business leaders in developing the RSP. Inland Revenue also engaged with the Corporate Taxpayers Group and the Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand. The engagement on the specific design aspects of the RSP followed several months’ of conversations between the Treasury and these stakeholders on the impacts of higher Alert Levels and border settings on different sectors. There was extremely strong consensus from across the spectrum that providing greater certainty on the nature of Government support in the event higher Alert Levels were in place would be critical for businesses to plan and right-size smoothly. The RSP responded to this consistent message. Stakeholders were broadly supportive of the approach to create greater certainty on the landscape of government support, and particularly welcoming of measures that would address non-wage costs in addition to the costs covered by the Wage Subsidy Scheme. There was strong feedback that the integrity of the schemes will be critical, with both Māori and Pacific business leaders raising concerns about possible gaming of support available. It was suggested that the communications approach to the package should be accompanied with clear guidance to maximise accessibility of the schemes, and partnerships with trusted community channels would aid access to the schemes and be critical in helping SMEs – which would likely be most vulnerable – prepare now for future outbreaks. This feedback has fed into the policy design and operational implementation of the Payment.

However, the analysis sighted in this report indicates that the scarring effects attached to the risks of not cushioning the blow could be significant, with distributional consequences. We therefore judge that the provision of the RSP has potential to support the social license and capital needed to maintain a robust public health response, for the benefit of all New Zealanders. Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 21 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? • When will the arrangements come into effect? Does this allow sufficient preparation time for regulated parties? • How could the preferred option be given effect? E.g., − legislative vehicle − communications − transitional arrangements. The RSP will be given effect through amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994, scheduled to be introduced in February 2021. The RSP was announced on 15 December 2020 and information on eligibility is available on a range of government websites. Cabinet has agreed retrospective payments will be possible in the event there is a resurgence prior to the application opening date, and subject to the legislation being passed. In addition, engagement with key business groups including those representing Māori and Pasifika businesses will be pursued in order to ensure a maximum number of firms are aware of the support available. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the ongoing operation and enforcement of the RSP. Have the responsible parties confirmed, or identified any concerns with their ability to implement it in a manner consistent with the Government’s ‘Expectations for regulatory stewardship by government agencies’? See https://treasury.govt.nz/information-and- services/regulation/regulatory-stewardship/good-regulatory-practice Inland Revenue has not identified any concerns with its ability to implement the new arrangements. How will other agencies with a substantive interest in the relevant regulatory system or stakeholders be involved in the implementation and/or operation? Design decisions have been delegated by Cabinet to relevant Joint Ministers, including the Minister of Finance, Minister of Revenue, and Minister for Small Business. Interdependencies with complementary support programmes such as the Wage Subsidy are regularly under review by the Treasury, IR and MSD. Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 22 6.2 What are the implementation risks? • What issues concerning implementation have been raised through consultation and how will these be addressed? • What are the underlying assumptions or uncertainties, for example about stakeholder motivations and capabilities? • How will risks be mitigated? Compressed timelines create delivery and communications risks, which could lead to: - payments reaching the wrong businesses at an unnecessary fiscal cost; - damaging the social capital that is critical for the success of the COVID-19 public health strategy; - business confusion around the access to the scheme, meaning firms may lose out on support they are entitled to. The main mitigations we have undertaken include: - to agree, via Joint Ministers and Cabinet, detailed design rules in order to enable Inland Revenue to build the scheme at pace with as much certainty as possible; - a series of measures to boost the integrity of the scheme and minimise gaming risks; - taking a co-ordinated cross-Government approach to communications; - engaging with external business stakeholders to inform the design of the scheme and promote its availability, ensuring the widest audiences are reached; and - re-use of components developed for the SBCS as a way to meet challenging system delivery timeframes. Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 23 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? • How will you know whether the impacts anticipated actually materialise? • System-level monitoring and evaluation • Are there already monitoring and evaluation provisions in place for the system as a whole (ie, the broader legislation within which this arrangement sits)? If so, what are they? • Are data on system-level impacts already being collected? • Are data on implementation and operational issues, including enforcement already being collected? • New data collection? • Will you need to collect extra data that is not already being collected? Please specify. As with the wage subsidies, SBCS, and COVID-19 Income Relief Payment (CIRP), detailed data will be collected by the implementation agency (IR) on the uptake of the scheme. This will capture and allow government to evaluate outputs of the scheme. Information systems at IR are capable of this data collection. Evaluation of outcomes will be imperfect, given the radical uncertainty that surrounds any resurgence event and the absence of any suitable counterfactual. In line with the objectives of the scheme and analysis that lead to its inception, we expect to minimise the erosion of firm balance sheets during a resurgence event, and ultimately prevent some insolvencies amongst viable firms that would otherwise take place. While we can assess balance sheet resilience quantitatively, much of this evaluation will be through engagement with business. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? • How will the arrangements be reviewed? How often will this happen and by whom will it be done? If there are no plans for review, state so and explain why. • What sort of results (that may become apparent from the monitoring or feedback) might prompt an earlier review of this legislation? • What opportunities will stakeholders have to raise concerns? A review of the system will depend on whether it is activated. Subject to that, the operation of the scheme will be reviewed regularly based on user feedback and system metrics. Monitoring of uptake and engagement will be undertaken in the event that the payment is activated as part of the broader monitoring of the economic situation. If required, a review of any policy settings would be co-led by Treasury and Inland Revenue.
Impact Summary Template | 1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Impact Summary: Tax pooling to purchase backdated tax Section 1: General informati on Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Impact Summary, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The key constraints on the below analysis is data. As the proposed change would benefit a demographic who currently cannot use backdated tax, it is difficult to fully scope who would use it in these circumstances if they could. There is also a behavioural element to the change that is also difficult to objectively measure. Relatedly, this has limited the scope of consultation and understanding of the scale of impacts as it is difficult to perfectly identify individuals who would specifically benefit from this change. Evidence of the scale of the issue is largely case-specific and/or anecdotal and we recognise that a number of the parties who have raised it, such as tax poolers, have a vested interest in the change. In considering the issue, officials primarily considered the status quo as an alternative. Comparing the options, it became apparent that, irrespective of scale, allowing the use of tax pooling to satisfy liabilities that arise from voluntary disclosures for more than income tax and Resident Withholding Tax (RWT) is the right policy outcome. This is because it increases simplicity, coherence and integrity within the tax system In light of the above constraints, the below analysis has assumed that a voluntary disclosure would be more likely to be made if tax pooling were available more widely to satisfy any tax debt and mitigate Use of Money Interest (UOMI). In addition to the existing tax types covered (income tax and RWT), this means that the tax types covered by this extension are tax paid or payable under the pay as you earn (PAYE) rules, employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) rules, retirement savings schemes contributions tax (RSCT) rules, non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rules, goods and services tax (GST) or fringe benefits tax (FBT).

This is because, as identified in the Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis section, there is no data to support the current scale of the problem or the impact of the proposed changes if they were enacted. However, the Impact Summary sets out the rationale for why the status quo is an issue and why a regulatory change is preferred, and identifies the main risks and uncertainties. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-07-29 15:29:14 Impact Summary Template | 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Section 2: Problem defi nition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? Tax pooling was introduced to assist with uncertainties relating to provisional tax (income tax). It allows provisional tax payments from numerous taxpayers to be grouped into the account of a registered intermediary. By pooling these payments, a taxpayer can offset an underpayment against amounts within the same pool allowing them to reduce their exposure to use of money interest (UOMI). The coverage of tax pooling was later extended to include historical periods and other tax types, but only in a situation of reassessment of a prior assessment or an increase of a prior obligation. This necessitates that an original assessment has been issued for that tax period or an obligation to pay tax has been quantified because a relevant tax return has already been filed. Taxpayers who have filed and who subsequently wish to make a voluntary disclosure are able to use tax pooling to satisfy the increased tax debt. However, where there is no existing assessment or quantified obligation the taxpayer would be unable to use tax pooling to satisfy a liability arising from the same voluntary disclosure. There is a limited exception to this rule as certain voluntary disclosures for income tax and resident withholding tax (RWT) may use tax pooling, subject to a Commissioner’s discretion measured against specific legislative criteria. There are several circumstances where a taxpayer may have unintentionally not filed a tax return for a particular tax type and tax period. For example, a small business may be unaware that an employee benefit they provide is subject to fringe benefit tax and so do not provide a return. Where these omissions have been made in good faith, it is disproportionally punitive to not allow taxpayers to use the benefits of tax pooling in these situations should they want to do so. Allowing the use of tax pooling to satisfy liabilities arising from a voluntary disclosure would therefore encourage voluntary disclosure in these instances. It would result in more consistent outcomes across tax types. Such a change is in line with tax principles and offers the best policy outcome. Extending the exception to other tax types would take a legislative change to expand existing provisions. These other tax types are tax paid or payable under the PAYE rules, ESCT rules, RSCT rules, NRWT rules, GST or FBT. This change will not impact existing settings for income tax and RWT, 2.2 Who is affected and how? The demographic whose behaviour would be most impacted by this change are taxpayers who have not filed a return due to an error or oversight (other than for income tax or RWT) and who could or would like to use tax pooling in order to meet the liability. They would be more likely to make a voluntary disclosure under this change than take a risk on the error not being found through audit. This would improve the accuracy of returns and the rate of tax collected. As errors cannot be predicted, equally those who benefit from this change will likely vary considerably between tax years. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-07-29 15:29:14 Impact Summary Template | 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] The types of business most likely to benefit will be smaller businesses. That is to say, those with employees but not large enough to employ or permanently engage tax advisors. Although not prohibited, larger businesses should be more informed and sophisticated taxpayers and are therefore considerably less likely to meet the requirements of this change. 2.3 What are the objectives sought in relation to the identified problem? The primary objective of this change is to improve the rate of voluntary disclosures and thereby increase the accuracy of tax returns and tax collected. This is linked to a secondary consideration of improving fairness within the tax system by not being overly punitive on errors related to different tax types. The other key objective of this work is to protect and enhance the integrity of the tax system. These objectives are similar in their focus and they have been given equal weighting with regard to considering this proposal. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-07-29 15:29:14 Impact Summary Template | 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Section 3: Opti ons ide ntificati on 3.1 What options have been considered? There are concerns that the current rules could be disincentivising voluntary disclosures where the disclosure does not relate to a tax type that can currently use tax pooling to satisfy the liability. Instead, taxpayers may be choosing to risk the error not being caught in an audit rather than disclose it and face the additional cost of UOMI. Two key options were considered in addressing this issue: • Status quo • Enabling the use of tax pooling to purchase backdated tax to satisfy a liability arising from a voluntary disclosure for tax types other than income tax and RWT where a return has not previously been returned. Other options were considered but were not progressed due to limitations such as not being able to fully address the identified issue of inconsistent treatment between tax types or of reducing system integrity. These options were to reduce penalties associated with liabilities arising from voluntary disclosures or increasing education and compliance activities to reduce errors. Similarly, initial thought was given to the removal of tax pooling as an option however this was not progressed. Tax pooling emerged in response to the inherent inaccuracy that is a feature of the provisional tax regime so its cessation would remove flexibility and increase the punitive aspect of the regime. This is inconsistent with intended policy outcomes. These options were considered in light of the degree to which they address the issues of incentivising voluntary disclosure, fairness, enhancing the integrity of the tax system and associated administrative and compliance costs. Under the status quo, where a taxpayer finds they have made an error – for example, not realising an employee benefit is subject to Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) and therefore not providing a return – they are obliged to make a voluntary disclosure to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue so their tax liability can be adjusted to account for the FBT liability. As this represents an underpayment, the FBT would attract UOMI and thereby increase the amount the taxpayer is obliged to pay to Inland Revenue. The taxpayer is not able to use tax pooling to reduce their exposure to UOMI in this instance. Where the error relates to RWT or income tax and a voluntary disclosure is made, the taxpayer is able to purchase backdated tax from a tax pool. Purchasing backdated tax reduces the amount of UOMI they are subject to as purchased funds are credited from the day they are added to the pool rather than the day they are purchased. Alternatively, a taxpayer may choose to not make a voluntary declaration in the hope that the error is not discovered through audit and their tax liability therefore does not increase. Under the proposal to enable the use of tax pooling to satisfy tax liabilities arising from voluntary disclosures where the taxpayer has not previously filed a return, the taxpayer would be able to use tax pooling, and thereby mitigate their exposure to UOMI, for voluntary declarations related to tax types other than RWT and income tax. This is expected to increase the number and amounts of voluntary disclosures. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-07-29 15:29:14 Impact Summary Template | 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] We recognise that there is a risk that this proposal could be seen as encouraging non- filing of returns. The option to alter the status quo therefore includes measures to ensure the integrity of the tax system is not undermined through the wilful non-filing of returns. These measures are the requirement for the taxpayer to make the disclosure before Inland Revenue has engaged with them (or their agent) regarding that tax type, and for the disclosure to have been made in a reasonable timeframe of the error being discovered. A penalty is also proposed where the Commissioner is satisfied that the debt has arisen through the taxpayer choosing not to comply with their tax obligations This option would require legislative change to both the Income Tax Act 2007 and Tax Administration Act 1994 to enable taxpayers to use tax pooling for a voluntary disclosure where the taxpayer has not previously filed an original return. (i.e., the voluntary disclosure is not for a reassessment or amending a prior obligation). The Income Tax Act change is to allow for the use of tax pooling to satisfy a tax liability that has arisen from a voluntary disclosure where there is no original return. The Tax Administration Act change is to enable the use of shortfall penalties where the Commissioner is satisfied that the debt has arisen through the taxpayer choosing not to comply with their tax obligations. Such changes would represent the expansion of existing provisions rather than the creation of new ones. Further options to achieve the intended outcome of increasing voluntary disclosures were considered and ruled out. Primary amongst these was consideration of reducing the penalties and interest that could be applied for liabilities arising from voluntary disclosure. This was ultimately rejected as there are integrity concerns to providing additional ‘discounts’ or exceptions to existing interest and penalty rules related to voluntary disclosures. These concerns include the risk of incentivising intentional omissions followed by disclosures in order to achieve a reduced tax liability. As the underpinning penalty framework is considered sound, focus has been placed on reducing inconsistent outcomes between tax types which are the subject of voluntary disclosures. Similarly, an approach focussed on education and enforcement was considered. Although important, such an approach would only go so far in reducing instances of voluntary disclosures as it is not possible to mitigate all potential for error or misunderstanding. Ensuring that taxpayers are supported to do the right thing when such an error is discovered is one of the reasons that voluntary disclosures are a feature of the tax system. Accepting this, an approach solely focused on education and enforcement would not address the identified issue of inconsistent outcomes between tax types which are the subject of voluntary disclosures. 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The proposed approach is to enable taxpayers to use tax pooling for a voluntary disclosure where the taxpayer has not previously filed an original return, as it will support an increase in voluntary disclosures. It will do so by ensuring that voluntary disclosures are treated equally with regard to their ability to utilise tax pooling to mitigate UOMI and thereby achieve greater consistency of outcomes across tax types. Overall, it will improve simplicity and consistency within the tax system compared to the status quo whilst upholding system integrity. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-07-29 15:29:14 Impact Summary Template | 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Section 4: Impa ct Analysis (Propose d approa ch) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action The Crown Improved compliance would reduce the UOMI the department collects. Low – as the outcome is linked to behavioural changes it is hard to measure but, as the demographic is small, these changes are also anticipated to be small. Inland Revenue More voluntary disclosures, potentially an increase in the need to verify these disclosures meet the criteria, and processing of penalties where they are found to not meet criteria. These represent an increase in administrative costs. Low – this proposal represents an extension of existing settings and so changes should be straight-forward and small. Similarly, the demographic incentivised to make voluntary disclosures under this change is small, meaning the increase in contacts with Inland Revenue should be equally small. Total Monetised Cost As noted, as costs and benefits are intrinsically linked to behavioural change it is difficult to put a value on them. Overall, the costs are likely to be low. Low Non-monetised costs Low Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Taxpayers Assuming full compliance irrespective of the change, this proposal would reduce costs to the taxpayers by mitigating UOMI. Low – tax pooling enables the mitigation of UOMI, but the tax liability would not be impacted by this change. Due to links with behavioural changes, this is hard to measure. Taxpayers Voluntary disclosures are incentivised therefore it is easier and less punitive to do the right thing. Medium – although as a behavioural factor this is difficult to fully gauge. Tax poolers By increasing the potential number of taxpayers able to use tax pooling, this would increase the income of tax poolers. Low - as a small demographic increase, the income increase would also be small. The Crown Improved compliance rates will increase the amount of tax collected. Low – as the outcome is linked to behavioural changes it is hard to 2r4hxlcklw 2021-07-29 15:29:14 Impact Summary Template | 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] measure but, as the demographic is small, these changes are also anticipated to be small. The Crown Penalties from voluntary disclosures that have not met the necessary criteria to use tax pooling in these instances would increase the amounts collected by the Inland Revenue and therefore the Crown. Low - as a small demographic of an already small demographic increase, the income increase would be equally small. Total Monetised Benefit As noted, as costs and benefits are intrinsically linked to behavioural change it is difficult to put a value on them. Overall, the costs are likely to be low. Non-monetised benefits Medium 2r4hxlcklw 2021-07-29 15:29:14 Impact Summary Template | 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? Inherent in this change is that, by increasing voluntary disclosures that are influenced by the ability to use tax pooling, the use of tax pooling is also likely to increase. This is not inherently either negative or positive, however it may be worth noting that the funds available via tax pooling are finite (i.e., funds that can be purchased are only available up to the total amount that has been deposited with the pool). Increasing the ability to use tax pooling could mean that tax pool funds are not always able to meet demand. Section 5: Stak ehol der views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? This is a discrete issue and, as noted above, due to the nature of those likely to benefit from it, it is difficult to effectively target consultation. In addition to internal stakeholders within Inland Revenue, entities consulted were: • Tax pooling intermediaries; • PricewaterhouseCoopers; • Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand; and • Corporate Taxpayers Group. Stakeholders were supportive of the problem analysis and the proposed approach. Although several of the entities listed above are tax poolers, that support for the change was universal amongst those consulted. This supports the view that the proposed option is a positive change that will benefit taxpayers and the wider tax system. Overall, all are satisfied that the proposed change will realise the intended benefits and is adequately balanced against the risk of exploitation and potential fiscal impacts. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-07-29 15:29:14 Impact Summary Template | 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Section 6: Impl eme nta tion a nd operati on 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? A legislative change is required to give effect to this change. Once legislated, a number of focussed system changes would be required. These involve the extension of existing settings, and implementation risks are therefore minimal. Inland Revenue would be responsible for the ongoing operation and enforcement of changes. The option is proposed to come into effect from 1 April 2022. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-07-29 15:29:14 Impact Summary Template | 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Section 7: Moni toring, evaluati on a nd revie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? The primary indication of whether the intended outcome is achieved is if we see an increase in voluntary disclosures related to these tax types. Data is available around those who use tax pooling to satisfy tax liabilities arising from voluntary disclosures currently and so uptake can be monitored. Given who is intended to benefit from this change (i.e. individuals who make an error in good faith), there should not be ‘regulars’ who use this legislation. Inland Revenue collects data on who is making voluntary disclosures and what they entail and so would be able to review if patterns of repeat non-filing followed by disclosure emerge. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? There is no specific plan to review this legislation. However, Inland Revenue is in regular and ongoing engagement with the wider tax advisory community and it is likely that members will be a proactive and effective source of feedback on the operation of the change. Additionally, in light of the monitoring outlined above, the changes will be reviewed where voluntary disclosures under the new legislation increase significantly, a number of taxpayers are found to use the legislation repeatedly or, conversely, where the legislation does not appear to be used at all. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-07-29 15:29:14
Full Impact Statement Template | 1 Coversheet: Increasing main benefit abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 and consequential adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit Advising agencies Ministry of Social Development and Inland Revenue Decision sought Agreement to increase main benefit abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 and consequentially adjust the Minimum Family Tax Credit for 2020/21 and 2021/22. Note that on 30 November 2020, Cabinet agreed to adjust the Minimum Family Tax Credit for 2020/21 \[CAB-20-MIN-0490 refers\]. However, a Regulatory Impact Assessment could not be undertaken due to time constraints. Under Cabinet’s regulatory impact analysis requirements, this document is: - the Supplementary Analysis Report for the adjustment to the Minimum Family Tax Credit for 2020/21; and - the Regulatory Impact Assessment for the abatement threshold increases and the adjustment to the Minimum Family Tax Credit for 2021/22. Proposing Ministers Minister for Social Development and Employment Minister of Revenue Summary: Problem a nd Proposed Approac h Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? The current abatement thresholds provide limited work incentives for beneficiaries The amount that beneficiaries can earn before their benefit reduces has declined substantially over time as benefit abatement thresholds have not been increased in line with wage growth. This has reduced financial incentives to enter the labour market and to work part-time for people receiving benefits. For example, a person receiving Jobseeker Support in 1997 could work around 11.4 hours on minimum wage before their benefit abated; in 2019, this has reduced to around 4.5 hours on minimum wage. There are trade-offs in making consequential adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit Under current policy, the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC) thresholds are adjusted annually to account for changes to relevant settings, such as changes to benefit rates, abatement thresholds and the minimum wage. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Full Impact Statement Template | 2 The MFTC threshold for 2020/21 was not adjusted to reflect the $25 benefit rate increase made on 1 April 2020 in response to COVID-19 due to time constraints at the time. This has resulted in the current MFTC threshold being misaligned with the current benefit rate. Increasing main benefit abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 has flow-on implications for the MFTC threshold in 2021/22 and subsequent tax years. To maintain financial incentives provided by the MFTC for families with children to enter work, the MFTC threshold for 2021/22 requires adjustments alongside abatement threshold increases under current policy. However, given the proposed increases to the abatement thresholds are significant, the adjustment required for the MFTC to align would be much higher than previous adjustments. This may exacerbate known issues with the MFTC, mainly reducing financial incentive for sole parents to work more than the minimum hours required. It may also increase the cost of options in the upcoming review of Working for Families. Summary of Preferred Option or Conclusion (if no preferred option) How will the agency’s preferred approach work to bring about the desired change? Why is this the preferred option? Why is it feasible? Is the preferred approach likely to be reflected in the Cabinet paper? Abatement threshold increases will improve financial work incentives Increasing benefit abatement thresholds to $160 and $250 per week increases the number of hours a beneficiary can work before their benefit begins to reduce. This will improve the financial incentives to enter the labour market and work part-time for people receiving benefits. Part-time work can provide a pathway to full-time work by providing opportunities to connect with the labour market, get work experience and become familiar with the demands that can come with employment. There are different agency views on making adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit Under current policy, changes to benefit settings would lead to an adjustment of the MFTC threshold to ensure the financial work incentives provided by the MFTC are maintained. However, given the extent of the recent and proposed benefit changes, full adjustment of the MFTC incurs significant fiscal costs. Additionally, a significant increase to the MFTC threshold may increase the cost of options as part of the upcoming review of Working for Families (WFF). 2020/21 MFTC threshold adjustment Retrospectively adjusting the 2020/21 MFTC threshold to reflect the increases to main benefits that came into effect on 1 April 2020 means the work incentives provided by the MFTC will be maintained for the 2020/21 tax year. This ensures that low-income families with children (both sole parents and two parent families) are better off in work and receiving the MFTC than working and receiving the benefit. Note that on 30 November 2020, Cabinet agreed to retrospectively increase the 2020/21 MFTC threshold to $29,432 from 1 April 2020 to reflect the increases to main benefits that came into effect on 1 April 2020 \[CAB-20-MIN-0490 refers\]. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) Full Impact Statement Template | 3 2021/22 MFTC threshold adjustment Inland Revenue (IR), Ministry of Social Development (MSD) and the Treasury have differing views on the most appropriate options relating to the alignment of the MFTC threshold: • MSD prefers the partial prospective alignment option. This is the proposed option in the Cabinet paper. MSD considers that a partial prospective alignment maintains the work incentives MFTC provides to the majority of MFTC recipients (ie, sole parents), but at a significantly lower fiscal cost than full alignment. MSD notes that fully aligning the MFTC threshold may exacerbate existing MFTC issues such as high Effective Marginal Tax Rates (EMTRs) 1 . MSD considers partially aligning the MFTC threshold would increase the cost of options as part of the upcoming WFF review, particularly if there is a desire to avoid people being financially disadvantaged by future changes. However, these effects will be less than under full alignment. • IR prefers the full prospective alignment option. Although the fiscal cost of full alignment is greater than under other options, IR considers it necessary to maintain the work incentives provided by the MFTC, ensuring low-income families with children (both sole parents and two parent families) are better off in work and receiving the MFTC than working and receiving the benefit. IR does not consider the potential effects of aligning the MFTC threshold on any future WFF review to be a significant enough issue to warrant reducing the work incentives currently provided by the MFTC. • In advice to Ministers, the Treasury recommended the no prospective alignment option due to the tight fiscal environment. The Treasury also did not consider that the policy decision \[to align the MFTC threshold with benefit rates\] meets the threshold to be progressed as a Budget pre-commitment. While the Treasury acknowledged that it was likely to introduce greater complexity for clients, the Treasury did not agree that these adverse effects were sufficient to justify funding the initiative ahead of the Budget process given the tight fiscal environment. Section B: Summary Impacts : Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? Monetised and non-monetised benefits Beneficiaries working part-time and non-beneficiary recipients of the Accommodation Supplement gain from abatement threshold increases The main people to gain are beneficiaries working part-time and non-beneficiary recipients of the Accommodation Supplement (these are low to middle-income working families). MSD estimates that around 82,900 individuals and families will gain an average of $18 per 1 Effective Marginal Tax Rate shows how a dollar increase in gross income translates to an increase in income in hand (after taxation and the reduction of income-tested assistance). 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) Full Impact Statement Template | 4 week in extra income support payments as a result of increasing benefit abatement thresholds. Non-monetised benefits include: • Improved financial incentives to enter the labour market and work part-time for people receiving benefits • A modest reduction in the number of children in poverty (it is estimated that the proposed increases to the abatement thresholds will reduce child poverty by around 6,000 (+/- 3,000) on the AHC50 fixed line measure 2 and 2,000 (+/- 3,000) on the BHC50 measure 3 in 2021/22), and • Broader improvements in health and wellbeing where eligible people are engaged in work (provided the work is safe, stable and financially beneficial). MFTC recipients and newly eligible recipients will gain from the adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit Retrospective change – increasing the 2020/21 MFTC threshold to reflect the $25 benefit rate increase on 1 April 2020 Approximately 3,200 families receiving the MFTC in the 2020/21 tax year would gain an additional $32 for each week they received the MFTC. The maximum MFTC increase a family could receive would be $1,664 ($32 x 52 weeks). However, it is estimated that the average MFTC increase for the year would be approximately $1,280 per family. Approximately 400 additional families would become newly eligible for the MFTC in the 2020/2021 tax year as a result of the threshold increase. Because newly eligible families will have incomes above the current threshold, the average increase for these families will be less than $32 a week. A full retrospective increase will also maintain financial incentives for families to move off benefit and into work for the remainder of the 2020/21 tax year. It also addresses the potential equity issue whereby some families who remained off benefit and in work following the benefit rate increase on 1 April 2020 are financially disadvantaged relative to those who are on benefit. Prospective change – partially increasing the 2021/22 MFTC threshold Approximately 4,000 families are expected to receive the MFTC in the 2021/22 tax year. Of these, around 400 families would be newly eligible to the MFTC. Families would gain an additional $22 for each week they receive the MFTC. The maximum MFTC increase a family could receive in the 2021/22 tax year would be $1,144 ($22 x 52 weeks). However, because not all families will receive the MFTC for ever week of the tax year, the average MFTC increase is estimated to be less than $1,144. 2 AHC50 measures the number of children in households with incomes much lower than a typical 2018 household, after they pay for housing costs, and is measured by the threshold line set at 50 per cent of the median income in 2017/18, after housing costs are removed. 3 BHC50 is a moving-line income measure, with the poverty threshold taken the year the data is gathered (low income, before housing costs – moving-line measure). BHC50 measures the number of children in households with much lower incomes than a typical household, and is measured by the threshold line set at 50 per cent of the median household income in the year measured. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Full Impact Statement Template | 5 A partial increase of the MFTC threshold ensures that sole parents, who make up around 90 percent of the MFTC recipients, continue to be financially better off working and receiving the MFTC than working and receiving a benefit. Where do the costs fall? Monetised and non-monetised costs; for example to local government or regulated parties Abatement threshold increases are primarily a cost to the Government The cost to the Government of increasing benefit abatement thresholds is $387.496 million in income support payments and $6.4 million in operating costs over the forecast period. There is an additional cost of $80,000 for 12 months for providing a Transitional Assistance Payment (TAP) to people who may be financially disadvantaged as a result of the abatement threshold increases on 1 April 2021. Non-monetised costs include a small reduction in financial incentives to work full-time for some beneficiaries. Adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit are primarily a cost to the Government Retrospective change – increasing the 2020/21 MFTC threshold to reflect the $25 benefit rate increase on 1 April 2020 The cost to the Government of increasing the 2020/21 MFTC threshold is $4.6 million for the 2020/21 tax year and $24.1 million for the forecast period. Prospective change – partially increasing the 2021/22 MFTC threshold The cost to the Government of partially increasing the 2021/22 MFTC threshold is $17 million over the forecast period, assuming the retrospective increase is agreed to. The financial work incentives provided by the MFTC would be reduced for two-parent families (approximately 10 percent of MFTC recipients) as they would theoretically be better off working and receiving a main benefit than working and receiving the MFTC. There may be a small net fiscal cost to the Government from two-parent families moving onto a benefit. This net fiscal cost has not been calculated due to time constraints. The behavioural impacts are uncertain. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts? How significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? Abatement threshold increases may financially disadvantage a small number of people but a Transitional Assistance Payment can be provided Increasing benefit abatement thresholds will mean that a small number of people will be financially disadvantaged due to complex interactions in the income support system. TAP, a temporary non-taxable payment, is proposed to be available for up to 12 months for the small number of people who may be financially disadvantaged on 1 April 2021 as a result of the abatement threshold increases. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Full Impact Statement Template | 6 Retrospective and prospective adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit each have unintended impacts A retrospective increase (paid in lump sum for the portion of the year for which payments have already been made) may lead to debts being created for some people as the MFTC is chargeable income for some types of financial assistance paid under the Social Security Act 2018 (such as Temporary Additional Support). It is also assessable income for Public Housing purposes, for assessing eligibility and calculating the rate of Income Related Rent. While this does lead to debts for some clients, these debts are usually less than the value of the lump-sum payment (so clients are still better off overall) and it reflects the appropriate consideration of these payments as income for these families. The prospective partial increase means that the MFTC would not be fully aligned with its policy intent and some two-parent families may be better off working and receiving a main benefit than working and receiving the MFTC. However, few couples are likely to qualify for a benefit if one person is working 30 hours a week as this is considered working full-time under the Social Security Act 2018 4 . Section C: Evidence certainty and quality ass urance Agency rating of evidence certainty? How confident are you of the evidence base? MSD is confident that increasing benefit abatement thresholds will directly increase incomes for beneficiaries working part-time and low to middle-income working families receiving the Accommodation Supplement. Holding all else equal, MSD is also confident that these increases are likely to modestly reduce child poverty. The evidence base on financial incentives to work (for both abatement threshold increase and MFTC) indicates that financial incentives are only one of many factors that influence people’s decisions on whether to work and how much to work and they are not usually the most important factor. However, empirical evidence suggests small but statistically significant impacts on labour market participation and intensity from changes in financial incentives to work, with larger impacts for some groups compared to others. 5 The modelling of the increases to benefit abatement thresholds and the MFTC assumes no behavioural impacts, i.e. no increases in labour market participation or hours worked, as these impacts are likely to be modest and are difficult to quantify. While increasing financial incentives to work part-time, the changes also reduce financial incentives to work full-time for some. Again, this impact has not been quantified. There is reasonably strong evidence that suitable work has broader positive impacts on wellbeing 6 , 4 This is due to the ’30-hour rule’, where a person (or couple) are not eligible for Jobseeker Support if they are working full-time (defined as 30 hours a week). 5 Kostøl, A, & Mogstad, M.

To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: The reviewing agencies were: - Ministry of Social Development - Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewers at Inland Revenue and Ministry of Social Development have reviewed the Increasing main benefit abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 and consequential adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit RIA and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it partially meets the quality criteria of the Regulatory Impact Analysis framework. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: It partially meets the quality criteria for the following reasons: • There has been no analysis of the behavioural impacts. This is understandable given the timeframes and difficulties undertaking this analysis. However, the abatement thresholds and the MFTC are intended to encourage people to engage in work. Ideally, RIA would include an estimate of how many people will move into work as a result of the changes. The team notes the employment impacts will be monitored following implementation. • There is minimal discussion of alternative options to the abatement threshold increases, such as the staged increases committed to by the Government as part of Budget 2019. However, the Treasury RIA team advised MSD that a full RIA for the abatement threshold increases was not required because the increases were a manifesto commitment. • In terms of the MFTC, the status quo is based on a long-established policy of full alignment of the MFTC with benefit changes. There are now differing views on the appropriateness of this automatic linkage when there are significant increases in benefit entitlements and the case for change does not adequately consider the impact on the identified group of people who would be relatively worse off if the MFTC is not increased. Moreover, the analysis relies on certain assumptions about the fiscal cost, which could benefit from further explanation, such as the degree of behavioural response that could lead individuals to shift from paid employment with MFTC to paid employment with welfare support. The behavioural responses are uncertain. The team notes the employment impacts will be monitored following implementation. • We note that the options have administrative implications but there is little discussion of the impacts, for example from backdating MFTC payments.

This analysis and advice have been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to be taken by Cabinet in relation to increasing the abatement thresholds and consequential adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC). 1.2 Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Limitations and constraints on the analysis in this document include: • The Labour Party committed to increasing the thresholds to $160 and $250 per week from 1 April 2021 in its 2020 manifesto commitment. Therefore, other options have been ruled out, such as increasing the thresholds by a different amount, or changes to the abatement rates. (It should be noted that abatement rate changes would also have similar trade-offs that apply, and it would be harder to communicate the changes, which means it would be harder to influence people’s behaviour in the direction intended). • Other options that have been ruled out due to time constraints include extending a part-time abatement regime to Jobseeker Support on the grounds of a health condition, injury or disability to more closely match their work obligations. • • The modelling results for abatement threshold increases are scaled according to the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update 2020 recipient and expenditure forecasts. • The estimates of the impact of the newly eligible for abatement threshold increases are created based off existing work done in the Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI). However, there is high uncertainty around these numbers. • Impacts of abatement threshold increases on Special Needs Grants and recoverable assistance have not been modelled. It is expected that the number of these could modestly decrease, but there is a considerable amount of uncertainty. • Behavioural impacts (ie, increases in labour market participation or hours worked) have not been modelled as there are various factors that influence a person’s work choices and they are difficult to quantify. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 s 9(2)(f)(iv) Full Impact Statement Template | 10 • Analysis in this document has been carried out under tight time constraints. • No consultation (beyond other Government agencies) has taken place as the proposed increases to the abatement thresholds is a Manifesto commitment and the Government’s consideration of the proposed changes in this RIA is Budget Sensitive. 1.3 Responsible Managers: Income Support Policy Welfare System and Income Support Policy Ministry of Social Development 3 December 2020 Carolyn Elliott Families and Individuals Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 3 December 2020 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) Full Impact Statement Template | 11 Section 2: Problem defi nition and objectives 2.1 What is the current state within which action is proposed? The welfare system is structured to assist those most in need and encourage paid work where possible New Zealand’s welfare system is designed to target people who are unable to fully support themselves through paid work. Almost all income support in New Zealand is targeted on the basis of family income (and family assets), with the family defined as the nuclear family (i.e. adults and any dependent children). Income and asset tests are determined by a combination of the abatement settings of payments (how fast they are reduced) and the rates of the benefit payments. Generally, the full rate of a payment will be available to people earning up to a certain amount (known as the abatement threshold). Above this amount, payments reduce (abate) as people’s incomes increase. The welfare overhaul involves a range of changes including changes to abatement thresholds and Working for Families tax credits The Welfare Expert Advisory Group (WEAG), in its report Whakamana Tāngata, proposed a comprehensive package of substantial changes to income support, while broadly maintaining the existing structure of income support. The WEAG package emphasised improving income adequacy and simplifying and rationalising the purpose of particular payments. The WEAG recommended that abatement thresholds for main benefits be increased to $150 and $250 per week. In 2019, Cabinet agreed to overhaul the welfare system to achieve its vision for a system that ensures people have an adequate income and standard of living, are treated with respect, can live in dignity, and are able to participate meaningfully in their communities \[CAB-19-MIN-0578 refers\]. On 6 November 2019, Cabinet endorsed a high-level short, medium, and long-term work programme to achieve this vision, but did not detail when work would be progressed. As part of the welfare overhaul work programme, the Government also agreed to a review of Working for Families (WFF) tax credits, including the MFTC. COVID-19 has caused significant economic disruption in New Zealand COVID-19 has caused major economic disruption in New Zealand and globally. With great uncertainty in the economy and with extended border closures, unemployment is forecast to rise, peaking at 7.8 percent in the March 2022 quarter. As a result of the weaker economic outlook, beneficiary numbers are forecast to increase. In October 2020, 369,860 people were receiving a main benefit, at 11.8 percent of the estimated New Zealand working-age population. This is 69,623 more than October 2019. Of the 369,860 receiving a main benefit, 203,371 were Jobseeker Support recipients (6.5 percent of the working-age population), which is 61,241 more than October 2019. The number of people on a benefit is expected to peak in May 2021 at around 443,000, with another peak later in January 2022 reaching around 453,800. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Full Impact Statement Template | 12 The economic impacts of COVID-19 are expected to disproportionally impact Māori, Pacific people, disabled people (including people with health conditions) and sole parents, who are more likely to be employed in areas affected by job losses and have additional barriers to accessing employment. COVID-19 will certainly increase poverty and hardship rates, although it is too soon to estimate the size of these impacts. The sudden loss of all employment income, or reduced employment income, can tip many families into financial hardship, especially if they have limited cash or near-cash assets to maintain existing commitments (e.g. rent, mortgage and consumer debt). Government’s response to COVID-19 As part of the Government’s response to COVID-19, on 1 April 2020, main benefit rates increased by $25 per week. The Winter Energy Payment (WEP), which is paid from 1 May to 1 October each year, was doubled for the 2020 winter period. Along with work to minimise hardship for families, the Government has introduced a range of initiatives aimed at boosting employment for those who have lost jobs due to COVID- 19. Labour Party’s 2020 manifesto commitment The Labour Party’s 2020 manifesto committed to: • increase abatement thresholds to $160 and $250 per week from 1 April 2021; • progressively increase the abatement threshold year on year in line with minimum wage increases; and • continue with the welfare overhaul work and to implement WEAG’s recommendations to improve the welfare system. 2.2 What regulatory system(s) are already in place? Benefit abatement thresholds allow people to work some hours while on benefit New Zealand’s welfare system is designed to assist people who are unable to fully support themselves through paid work. Assistance is targeted through the eligibility criteria 7 and the benefit abatement regime, which gradually reduces payments that people receive as their other income increases. Generally, the full rate of payment will be available to people earning up to a certain amount; this is the abatement threshold. Above this amount, payments abate as people’s other income increases, but payment can abate in different ways and at different rates based on the type of benefit payment. The abatement rules, along with the benefit rate, determine the benefit cut-out point, which is the amount of income at which a benefit is reduced to zero. The abatement threshold allows people to work for a small number of hours without having their benefit payment affected and is seen as a way to encourage labour market entry. It is also intended to recognise that there are additional costs associated with work, such as transport costs. 7 Social assistance payments are typically means-tested, and eligibility is based on family rather than individual income. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Full Impact Statement Template | 13 Currently there are two main abatement regimes within the welfare system, which seek to align the financial incentives to work with the level of labour force engagement expected of the individual: • a part-time regime has two abatement thresholds, with a relatively low abatement rate of 30 percent applied at the first threshold, and an abatement rate of 70 percent applied at the second threshold. This is designed to incentivise part-time work and applies to people receiving Sole Parent Support (SPS) and Supported Living Payment (SLP), as well as to those under 65 receiving the Veteran’s Pension (VP). The assumption is that part-time work is often the best option for recipients of these payments. • a full-time regime has a relatively high abatement rate of 70% which is designed to incentivise full-time work. This mainly applies to people on Jobseeker Support (JS)- related benefits, as well as Non-Qualifying Partners (NQP) of New Zealand Superannuation (NZS) and VP recipients. The assumption is that people receiving these benefits are able to undertake full-time work where it is available. The current abatement thresholds and rates are set out below: Abatement rate at different thresholds Current amount beneficiaries can earn per week before their benefit begins to abate JS (abatement rate of 70%) $90 NZS/VP with non-qualifying partner (abatement rate of 70%) $115 SPS, SLP and VP (under 65) – Threshold One (abatement rate of 30%) $115 SPS, SLP and VP (under 65) – Threshold Two (abatement rate of 70%) $215 Under the current settings, a JS recipient would have their benefit reduce by 70 cents for every dollar earned over $90. For a SPS recipient, their benefit would reduce by 30 cents for every dollar earned over $115, and by 70 cents for every dollar earned over $215. The Minimum Family Tax Credit incentivises families with children to move off benefit and into greater amounts of work The MFTC is one of the WFF tax credits. The MFTC aims to incentivise families with children (in particular, sole parents) to move off benefit and into greater amounts of paid work 8 by ensuring people who move from working and receiving a main benefit into working and receiving the MFTC are not financially worse off from doing so. This is done by “topping-up” families’ earned income to a prescribed level (the MFTC threshold) that means they are financially better off by working a greater amount and receiving the MFTC than working and receiving a benefit. This effectively creates a guaranteed income for families, above what they would receive if they were on a benefit. Around 90 percent of MFTC recipients are sole parent families. 8 Families with children qualify for the MFTC when they work 20 hours of more per week for sole parents, and 30 hours or more for couples. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Full Impact Statement Template | 14 The MFTC abates at 100 percent for every dollar earned over the MFTC threshold. This means that for every dollar a family earns over the prescribed amount, their MFTC entitlement reduces by one dollar. The MFTC threshold, as at 30 November 2020, is $27,768 per year (after tax). This is $534 per week. Approximately 3,800 families were paid nearly $12 million in the 2020/21 tax year. The average MFTC payment amount was $3,100 per family. IR forecasts that there will be a decrease to approximately 3,200 families in the 2021/22 tax year. 9 As part of the introduction of WFF, on 26 April 2004, Cabinet agreed to increase the MFTC on 1 April each year by an amount sufficient to ensure that couples do not suffer a reduction in income when moving off benefit into 30 hours of paid work a week, from 1 April 2006 onwards \[CAB Min (04) 13/4 refers\]. Consequently, the MFTC threshold has been increased each year since 2006 to reflect the latest changes to relevant settings (such as benefit rates, the minimum wage and abatement thresholds). The MFTC threshold is set by calculating the total income a two-parent family could receive if they were working less than 30 hours and receiving an abated main benefit (the couple rate for Jobseeker Support) and the Winter Energy Payment. This amount is then increased by $1 and rounded up to the next multiple of $52 (as expressed for the weeks in the year). Sole parents face the same MFTC threshold as two-parent families. As the sole parent benefit is lower than the couple rate of Jobseeker Support, this means that sole parents gain significantly more than two-parent families by moving onto the MFTC. Roles of government agencies The Ministry of Social Development administers and provides information on financial assistance, employment and housing. MSD’s role includes paying financial assistance, providing support for getting people into and maintaining employment and housing. Inland Revenue administers New Zealand’s tax system, collecting Crown revenue, as well as collecting and distributing social support programme payments, such as WFF tax credits. 9 Some reasons for the decrease in tax year 2021 could be due to the impacts of Covid-19 on employment, or the increase in main benefit payments and temporary doubling of the Winter Energy Payment from 1 April 2020. The latter changes have made the financial incentives to stay on benefit higher. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Full Impact Statement Template | 15 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? Abatement thresholds have become out of line with their original settings and offer little financial incentive to enter the labour market or work part-time Abatement thresholds are increased through one-off changes, rather than being adjusted annually. On 1 April 2020, the abatement thresholds were adjusted through funding secured through Budget 2019. This funding committed to progressively increase the abatement thresholds for main benefits over four years (until 2023, as set out in the below table) in line with minimum wage increases \[CAB-19-MIN-0174.36 refers\]. The adjustment aimed to ensure that the number of hours a beneficiary could work on minimum wage before abatement began would not reduce any further. Abatement threshold for: Prior to April 2020 1 April 2020 1 April 2021 1 April 2022 1 April 2023 Jobseeker Support $80 $90 $95 $100 $105 NZS/VP non-qualifying partner $100 $115 $120 $125 $130 SPS and SLP – Threshold One $100 $115 $120 $125 $130 SPS and SLP – Threshold Two $200 $215 $220 $225 $230 However, prior to the April 2020 adjustment, the last adjustment to main benefit abatement settings occurred in September 2010, when changes were made for recipients of (what was then known as) Domestic Purposes Benefit, Invalid’s Benefit, Widow’s Benefit as well as for VP (under 65), and NZS and VP with non-qualifying partners. For the full-time abatement regime for JS, the threshold had remained at $80 since it was last adjusted in 1996. This has meant that the amount that people could earn before their benefit abated has declined in real terms over time as wages have increased, particularly for JS recipients. For example, a person receiving JS in 1997 could work approximately 11.4 hours on minimum wage ($7.00 per hour) before their benefit abated. In 2019, a person receiving JS could only work for approximately 4.5 hours on minimum wage ($17.70 per hour) before their benefit abated. The current settings, despite the adjustments made in April 2020 and subsequent increases set through till 2023, have moved out of line with the original abatement settings and now offer little financial incentive for people to engage in paid work while receiving a main benefit. The MFTC was not adjusted following COVID-19 related benefit increases On 1 April 2020, as part of the previous Government’s response to COVID-19, main benefit rates were increased by $25 per week. The Winter Energy Payment was also temporarily doubled for the 2020 winter period. Under normal circumstances, a consequential increase in the MFTC threshold would likely have been made at the same time. However, the urgent pace at which these benefit changes occurred meant that no decision to change the MFTC threshold was made. This has resulted in the current MFTC threshold being misaligned with the current benefit rate. Under current policy, the MFTC threshold should be increased to account for the increase in benefit rates. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Full Impact Statement Template | 16 Proposed increases to the abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 will also require an increase to the MFTC threshold under current policy Increasing the abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 (as per the Labour Party’s 2020 manifesto commitment) has flow-on implications for the MFTC threshold. Under current policy, a consequential increase to the 2021/22 MFTC threshold would be made to reflect the changes to the abatement thresholds. If the MFTC threshold does not maintain alignment with the benefit abatement thresholds, this will be inconsistent with the policy intent of the MFTC, that is, to provide a financial incentive to work a greater amount and move off benefit and on to the MFTC. The greater the misalignment of the MFTC threshold and benefits, and the longer the misalignment continues, the greater the impact on the incentives for low income families with children to leave the benefit and work a greater amount and receive the MFTC. There is also a potential equity issue in that not fully aligning the MFTC threshold financially disadvantages those families who remain off benefit (relative to those who are on benefit). If benefit settings are intended to reflect a minimum level of income for beneficiaries, then implicitly, the guaranteed minimum income provided to working and off-benefit families (via the MFTC) should be at least the same. The MFTC provides little to no incentive for sole parents to work more than 20 hours a week while receiving the MFTC The proposed increases to the abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 are significant, which would require the 2021/22 MFTC threshold adjustment to be much greater than its previous adjustments. This may further exacerbate known issues with the MFTC, mainly that the MFTC provides little to no financial incentive for sole parents to work more than the minimum required hours (20 hours a week) while receiving the MFTC. This is because income earned over the MFTC threshold would reduce the MFTC payment dollar for dollar. This is known as a 100 percent effective marginal tax rate (EMTR); high EMTRs indicate low financial incentives to work. A significant adjustment to the MFTC threshold would further reward working the minimum number of hours required for the MFTC at the expense of working more than this. This is because the adjustment would mean the income range over which the MFTC is available would be extended, resulting in a larger range of hours worked with a 100 percent EMTR and further reduction in incentives to work greater hours for sole parents on low/minimum wage. For example: • Fully adjusting the MFTC increases the gain that sole parents receive by moving from working and receiving the benefit to working and receiving the MFTC to around $125 a week; but reduces the gain from increasing work hours from 20 to 40 hours a week to around $20 a week. 10 • Partially adjusting the MFTC increases the gain that sole parents receive by moving from working and receiving the benefit to working and receiving the MFTC 10 This calculation is for a sole-parent family with two children (aged 3 and 5) earning the minimum wage ($20 per hour) when working, living in Auckland, paying lower quartile rent and receiving the Accommodation Supplement, Temporary Additional Support and relevant tax credits. It does not take into account childcare costs. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Full Impact Statement Template | 17 to around $85 a week; but reduces the gain from increasing work hours from 20 to 40 hours a week to around $60 a week. 11 While working 20 hours a week may be desirable for many sole parents due to their caregiving responsibilities and financial incentives being just one of the reasons for labour supply decisions, disincentivising sole parents from working more than 20 hours per week (or taking up higher wage work) may impact on their longer-term labour market trajectories and lifetime earnings. It is important to note that there is also robust evidence to show that the gap between “in work” income and “out of work” income is a stronger driver of behaviour than the incentive to increase work by an additional hour. A significant adjustment in the MFTC would result in a larger gap between “in work” income and “out of work” income (at 20 hours for sole parents and 30 hours for couples) and would potentially provide a stronger financial incentive to go from not working to working the minimum number of hours for the MFTC than partial or no adjustment options. There is an upcoming review of Working for Families, which includes the MFTC A review of WFF is planned for 2021, This means that any significant adjustments to the current MFTC threshold would likely increase the cost of options for reform. This is largely due to: • the significant gain that sole parents receive by moving from working and receiving a benefit to working and receiving the MFTC – currently around $60 a week (for no extra hours of work) • the likely need to ensure that options for reform do not financially disadvantage low-income working sole parents, as this would be likely to be seen as contrary to the Government’s vision for the welfare system, particularly given its focus on improving income adequacy and reducing child poverty. any significant adjustment to the MFTC threshold would increase the gain that sole parents currently receive by moving onto the MFTC 11 As above. 12 Earning minimum wage and therefore, eligible for the maximum amount of the MFTC. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) Full Impact Statement Template | 18 2.4 What do stakeholders think about the problem? No explicit consultation on these changes beyond Government agencies has taken place No consultation (beyond other Government agencies) has taken place as the proposed increases to the abatement thresholds is a Manifesto commitment and the Government’s consideration of the proposed changes in this RIA is Budget Sensitive. MSD, IR and the Treasury’s views on the adjustments to the MFTC thresholds are set out in Section 5.1. However, the Welfare Expert Advisory Group informed our analysis The proposed approach for abatement threshold changes has been informed by the findings of the WEAG, which in turn was informed by the views of stakeholders and those who took part in the engagement process. The WEAG conducted wide consultation with a variety of groups across New Zealand. This included face to face meetings with more than 1,300 individuals and organisations (such as people receiving welfare payments, employers, service providers, advocates, and community workers), 1,348 written submissions, and additional submissions through online engagement. In February 2019, the WEAG published its report Whakamana Tāngata, which noted that the income support system needs to encourage the outcomes of good and appropriate work by ensuring people are financially better off in paid work. One element of making work pay is ensuring that abatement settings are reasonable, especially at the point when people are entering work. The WEAG recommended that the abatement thresholds for main benefits be increased to $150 and $250 per week. The WEAG also recommended substantial changes to WFF and other tax credits to improve the adequacy of incomes and returns from paid work for families with children. This included a recommendation to replace the MFTC, In-Work Tax Credit and Independent Earner Tax Credit with a new Earned Income Tax Credit. 2.5 What are the objectives sought in relation to the identified problem? Three primary objectives to consider are: • Improve income adequacy for beneficiaries and low-income people • Improve financial incentives to work • Pay welfare support at a sustainable cost to government These objectives should be considered within the overarching government commitment to overhaul the welfare system, in line with the WEAG’s recommendations. Improving income adequacy for beneficiaries and low-income people Any changes proposed in this RIA should seek to improve income adequacy for low-income people. While the recent changes to the welfare system (including the Families Package, the $25 increase to main benefits on 1 April 2020 and the indexation of main benefits to average wage) will help to improve living standards of low-income people, income 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Full Impact Statement Template | 19 adequacy issues are likely to remain for many low-income people. The changes proposed in this RIA should ensure people can receive increased incomes through undertaking paid employment, and keep more of their earnings. Improving financial incentives to work Improving financial incentives to work is one component of encouraging people who are able to work to seek employment, alongside other interventions such as active labour market policies. For the majority of people, paid work is a key means of achieving improved wellbeing. For this reason, most income support systems typically aim to ensure that people are financially incentivised to work where this is a possibility. However, financial incentives are only one of many factors that influence people’s decisions on whether to work and how much to work and they are not usually the most important factor. Additionally, different amounts of work may be appropriate for different people given their circumstances. While the changes proposed in this RIA seek to improve incentives to enter the labour market and to work part-time, the changes also slightly reduce the incentives to work full- time. Paying welfare at a cost that is sustainable to government The Government is required to act and pursue its policy objectives in accordance with the principles of responsible fiscal management as set out in the Public Finance Act 1989, such as managing fiscal risks facing the government, having regard for the impact on present and future generations, and ensuring the Crown’s resources are managed effectively and efficiently. Any changes proposed in this RIA must be at a sustainable cost to government, particularly given the current tight fiscal environment following the range of initiatives implemented by the Government in response to COVID-19. There are significant trade-offs between these three objectives There are significant trade-offs between these three objectives. It is generally possible to achieve two of the three objectives for any given policy change, but not all three. These three objectives are all important, and any policy will need to balance the trade-offs between these objectives. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Full Impact Statement Template | 20 Section 3: Opti on ide ntificati on 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? There are two options for abatement threshold increases Option One – Increase the abatement thresholds to $160 and $250 per week on 1 April 2021 This option proposes to increase abatement thresholds to $160 and $250 per week from 1 April 2020, as specified in the Labour Party Manifesto 2020. The proposed increases are set out below: Abatement threshold for: 1 April 2021 Jobseeker Support $160 NZS/VP with non-qualifying partner $160 SPS and SLP – Threshold One $160 SPS and SLP – Threshold Two $250 Under this option, beneficiaries will be able to work up to eight hours on minimum wage (based on minimum wage increasing to $20 per hour on 1 April 2021) before their benefit begins to abate. For recipients of SPS, SLP and VP (under 65), they can work up to 12.5 hours before their benefit begins to abate at the higher rate (Threshold Two). This would have a fiscal cost to the Government of $387.496 million in income support payments and $6.4 million in operating costs over the forecast period. Option Two – Status quo This option proposes not to increase abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021, other than the adjustments that have been set to occur for 2021, 2022 and 2023 through funding secured through Budget 2019. This means for the next three years, the abatement thresholds would be adjusted as follows: Abatement threshold for: 1 April 2021 1 April 2022 1 April 2023 Jobseeker Support $95 $100 $105 NZS/VP with non-qualifying partner $120 $125 $130 SPS and SLP – Threshold One $120 $125 $130 SPS and SLP – Threshold Two $220 $225 $230 Under this option, the number of hours beneficiaries can currently work up to before their benefit begins to abate (around 4.5 hours on minimum wage) will be maintained (not reduce any further) over the next three years. There are two options for retrospectively adjusting the Minimum Family Tax Credit threshold There are two options to consider for retrospective adjustment to the 2020/21 MFTC threshold: • Option One (status quo) – full retrospective alignment of the 2020/21 MFTC threshold. This is the status quo, as under current policy, the MFTC threshold 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Full Impact Statement Template | 21 would be adjusted in line with changes to benefit rates and abatement thresholds. • Option Two – no retrospective alignment of the 2020/21 MFTC threshold. Retrospective adjustment Detail Fiscal cost Number of families affected Average gain for affected families Option One – full alignment (status quo) This would increase the threshold to $29,432. $24.1 million over the forecast period. Around 3,200 families receiving the MFTC in the 2020/21 tax year would be affected. Around 400 additional families would become newly eligible. Additional gain of $32 for each week they receive the MFTC. It is estimated that the average MFTC increase would be $1,280 per family per year. 13 Option Two – no alignment This would maintain the threshold at $27,768. No additional cost. Around 3,200 families receiving the MFTC in the 2020/21 tax year would continue to receive the same amount of MFTC as currently. Some families may be better off working and receiving an abated benefit than staying on the MFTC. There are three options for prospectively adjusting the Minimum Family Tax Credit threshold There are three options to consider for prospective adjustment to the 2021/22 MFTC threshold: • Option One (status quo) – full alignment of the 2021/22 MFTC threshold to reflect abatement threshold increases. This is the status quo, as under current policy, the MFTC threshold would be adjusted in line with changes to benefit rates and abatement threshold. • Option Two – partial alignment of the 2021/22 MFTC threshold. • Option Three – no adjustment to the MFTC threshold. 13 The maximum MFTC increase a family could receive would be $1,664 ($32 x 52 weeks). Because newly eligible families will have incomes above the current threshold, the average increase for these families will be less than $32 dollars a week 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Full Impact Statement Template | 22 Prospective adjustment Detail Fiscal cost \*\* Number of families affected \*\* Average gain for affected families \*\* Option One – full alignment (status quo) This would increase the threshold to $32,604. $51 million over the forecast period. Around 4,900 families expected to be receiving MFTC in the 2021/22 tax year. Of these, around 1,300 families would be newly eligible for the MFTC. Additional gain $61 for each week they receive the MFTC. The maximum possible increase for the year would be $3,172 per family 14 . Option Two – partial alignment This would increase the threshold to $30,576. $17 million over the forecast period. Around 4,000 families expected to be receiving the MFTC in the 2021/22 tax year. Of these, around 400 families would be newly eligible for the MFTC. Additional gain of $22 for each week they receive the MFTC. The maximum possible increase for the year would be $1,144 per family 15 . Two-parent families (10% of the MFTC recipients) would be better off receiving an abated benefit and working than staying on the MFTC. Option Three – no alignment This would maintain the threshold at $29,432 (assuming retrospective change goes ahead). There may be some working families, who move off the MFTC and on to a benefit (or stay on benefit rather than move onto the MFTC). This would mean reduced MFTC (and In-work Tax Credit) costs, but an increase in benefit costs. These costs have not been quantified and are likely to be small. Around 3,600 families receiving the MFTC in the 2020/21 tax year would continue to receive the same amount of MFTC as in 2020/21. Couples (and some sole-parent families) would be better off working and receiving an abated benefit than staying on the MFTC. \*\* Note that this table assumes the full retrospective alignment for the 2020/21 MFTC threshold, which was agreed by Cabinet on 30 November 2020, has been implemented \[CAB-20-MIN-0490 refers\]. 14 It is difficult to estimate the number of weeks a family would receive the MFTC on average for a future tax year. The gain would be less for families who do not receive the MFTC for the full year. 15 As above 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Full Impact Statement Template | 23 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? Full assessment of impacts was not completed for abatement threshold increases As the Labour Party has committed to increasing the abatement thresholds as per Option One, MSD has not undertaken a full assessment of the likely impacts of the options in this RIA. Criteria for evaluating options for adjusting the Minimum Family Tax Credit Both the retrospective and prospective alignment options have been evaluated against the following criteria: • Work incentives – the option should ensure the MFTC continues to fulfil its policy objective to financially incentivise low-income families with children to move from working and receiving a benefit to working and receiving the MFTC. • Equity – the option should not financially disadvantage those families receiving the MFTC (ie, in full-time work and off benefit) compared with families who are on benefit. • Future reform – the option should not significantly limit choices for future reform of the MFTC and WFF scheme generally. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? As the Labour Party has committed to increasing the abatement thresholds as per Option One, MSD has not considered any other options for change, such as increasing the abatement thresholds by different amounts, or changing the abatement rate. Note that changing the abatement rate may be more difficult to influence people’s decision to work as it can be harder for people to understand how the changes in the abatement rates affect their payments. Other options ruled out include possible abatement setting changes for clients on Jobseeker Support on the ground of a health condition, injury or disability (JS-HCD). JS- HCD is available for people assessed as being temporarily unable to work, or able to work only part-time. Therefore, JS-HCD recipients have either part-time or deferred work obligations. However, JS-HCD recipients face the same high abatement rate of 70 percent as other JS clients, aimed at incentivising full-time work, which means current settings may not adequately support JS-HCD recipients to engage in part-time work. Changing the abatement settings for JS-HCD recipients to better support part-time work was ruled out due to time constraints. Further work is required to design and implement any changes in this space to ensure positive outcomes for JS-HCD recipients. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 s 9(2)(f)(iv) Full Impact Statement Template | 24 Section 4: Impact Analysis Marginal impact: How does each of the options identified in section 3.1 compare with taking no action under each of the criteria set out in section 3.2?

Option One is the preferred option for abatement threshold increases The proposed option for abatement threshold increase is Option One as it means the thresholds will better align with the original abatement settings (as well as WEAG’s recommendation), which enabled beneficiaries to work for longer hours before abatement occurred. This option will allow working beneficiaries to keep a greater proportion of their earnings before their benefit is affected, thereby improving income adequacy and financial incentives to work part-time while on a benefit. This option may reduce the financial incentive for beneficiaries working part time to move into full time work. However, better incentivising beneficiaries to enter the labour market and maintain work, even if part-time work, is important. This is particularly so for those already disadvantaged in the labour market prior to COVID-19, such as sole parents and people with health conditions, injury or disability, for whom suitable work may only be part- time work. Paid work can not only lift incomes and living standards, it can also enable people to experience better self-assessed health, life satisfaction and social connectedness. Part- time work can also provide a pathway to full-time work by providing opportunities to connect with the labour market, gain work experience and become familiar with the demands that can come with employment. Also, given the economic impacts of COVID-19 and many people facing reduced hours, this option ensures that those on low incomes with reduced hours can access financial assistance while still being attached to their job. No consultation (beyond other Government agencies) has taken place as this change is a Manifesto commitment (and the Government’s consideration of it is Budget Sensitive). Option One is the preferred option by IR for restrospectively adjusting the Minimum Family Tax Credit Option One is the preferred option by IR, and is the proposed option in the Cabinet paper. MSD does not have a preferred option. Note that Cabinet agreed to adjust the 2020/21 MFTC threshold as per Option One on 30 November 2020 \[CAB-20-MIN-0490\]. This option means the financial incentive provided by the MFTC for families with children to move off benefit and into greater amounts of work would be maintained for the remainder of the 2020/21 tax year. While the increase cannot incentivise families with children to move off benefit for the period of the 2020/21 tax year that has already passed (April to December 2020), it addresses the potential equity issues, whereby those families who remained off benefit and in work during April to December 2020 are financially disadvantaged relative to those who were on benefit. MSD and IR have different preferred options for prospectively adjusting the Minimum Family Tax Credit Option Two is the preferred option by MSD, and is the proposed option in the Cabinet paper. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Full Impact Statement Template | 28 This option ensures that around 90% of MFTC recipients (ie, sole parents) would remain better off working and receiving the MFTC than working and receiving a benefit. While a partial increase would extend the income range over which the MFTC is available, resulting in reduced financial incentives to work greater hours for sole parents on low-incomes, the impact would be smaller than Option One. MSD considers fully aligning the MFTC threshold would increase the cost and complexity of any future WFF review particularly if there is a desire to avoid people being financially disadvantaged. However, these effects will be less under Option One than Option Two. IR’s preferred option is Option One. While the fiscal cost of full alignment are greater than under other options, this option maintains the work incentives provided by the MFTC by ensuring low-income families with children (both sole parents and two-parent families) are better off working and receiving the MFTC than working and receiving a benefit. IR does not consider the potential effects of aligning the MFTC threshold on any future WFF review to be a significant enough issue to warrant removing the work incentives currently provided by the MFTC. IR considers that there is a potential equity issue if the MFTC threshold is not fully aligned. Less than full alignment potentially disadvantages those families who remain in work and off benefit, relative to those in work and receiving a benefit. If benefit settings are intended to reflect a minimum level of income for beneficiaries, then implicitly, the guaranteed minimum income provided to working and off-benefit families (via the MFTC) should be at least the same. In advice to Ministers, the Treasury recommended the no prospective alignment option due to the tight fiscal environment. The Treasury also did not consider that the policy decision \[to align the MFTC threshold with benefit rates\] meets the threshold to be progressed as a Budget pre-commitment. While the Treasury acknowledged that it was likely to introduce greater complexity for clients, the Treasury did not agree that these adverse effects were sufficient to justify funding the initiative ahead of the Budget process given the tight fiscal environment. 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg, ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg, compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value where appropriate, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non-monetised impacts Evidence certainty (High, medium or low) Abatement threshold increases Additional costs of proposed approach compared to taking no action Monetised cost to Crown Increase in Benefit or Related Expenses from increasing $387.496 million over five years.

Better incentivising beneficiaries to engage in work through abatement threshold increases could also lead to positive impact on broader wellbeing, as being in suitable work is good for people’s health and wellbeing (provided the work is safe, stable, suits people’s circumstances and financially beneficial). The expected benefits described in section 5.2 will depend on the interaction between different assistance types, the extent to which people undertake further work and the subsequent impact on their earned incomes. Also, there is a risk that the gains will be lost over time if abatement thresholds do not increase in future years. Total Monetised Benefit No costings of the total monetised benefits.

The Manifesto commitment specified an implementation date of 1 April 2021 for abatement threshold increases. Legislative vehicle Changes to abatement thresholds require an Order in Council and regulation amendment. Abatement thresholds for main benefits and New Zealand Superannuation Non-Qualifying Partner are set out in Schedule 2 of the Social Security Act 2018. An Order in Council under section 452(2)(c) of the Social Security Act 2018 is required to make the abatement threshold increases for main benefits and NZS for April 2021. Abatement thresholds for Veteran’s Pension Non-Qualifying Partner and Veteran’s Pension (under 65) are set out separately in regulation 42A of the Veterans’ Support Regulations 2014, which will also require amendment. Changes to the MFTC threshold can be made by an Order in Council as set out in sections ME 1(4) and MF 7(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007. However, an Order in Council is required by 1 December for changes to apply from 1 April the following year. Therefore, adjustments to the 2020/21 and 2021/22 MFTC thresholds would need to be made via amendments to the Income Tax 2007. Communication A communications plan will be developed to ensure the changes are communicated to staff and the public in advance of implementation. Transitional arrangements A Transitional Assistance Payment (TAP), which is a temporary non-taxable payment, could be considered for the small number of people (around 79 people) who may be financially disadvantaged by the proposed abatement threshold increases on 1 April 2021. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? Minimal implementation risks with the abatement threshold increases Implementation risks for abatement thresholds are minimal. The changes will use existing administrative structures and will not require any new service design. There is a potential for public confusion around the proposed increases, as this proposal overrides the four-year adjustments to the abatement thresholds secured through Budget 2019. A communications plan will be developed to ensure sufficient information is provided to both staff and the public through various platforms, including MSD’s website. Some implementation risks with the adjustments to Minimum Family Tax Credit A partial increase to the 2021/22 MFTC threshold may cause confusion with some people as to which option they would be better off under. Some two-parent families may be better off working and receiving benefit than working and receiving the MFTC, but for one reason 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Full Impact Statement Template | 37 or another remain on the MFTC and receive less than what they may be entitled to. Material will be developed to ensure sufficient information about the MFTC adjustments are available to both staff and the public through various platforms, including IR’s website. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 Full Impact Statement Template | 38 Section 7: Moni toring, evaluati on a nd revie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Behavioural changes arising from abatement threshold increases can be monitored using administrative data MSD will be able to use administrative data to monitor the trends in declared income before and after changes to abatement thresholds, including the trends for different subgroups (eg, Māori, Pacific people, sole parents, people with a health condition or disability). An expected trend following the abatement threshold changes would be an increase in the level of income that clients declare to MSD, as a result of clients taking up extra work in response to the changes. There may also be a signalling effect (ie, changed behaviour) ahead of the changes. Behavioural changes arising from adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit can be monitored using administrative data The effects of the MFTC threshold alignments can be monitored using data IR currently collects as part of administering the MFTC. This includes the number of MFTC recipients, the nature of those families, the amount of MFTC payments made, and MFTC recipient movement between the MFTC and the benefit. This administrative data will show what effect the MFTC alignment changes have on the up take of the credit, and the actual fiscal cost to the Government of the chosen settings. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? As part of the Welfare Overhaul work programme, MSD is working on developing a measure of a client’s total income, and regularly reporting on this measure. Progression of this work will allow for reporting on this measure past 2021. The measure will allow MSD to analyse the longer term impact of this policy on client outcomes. In December 2020, officials intend to provide advice to joint Ministers on a potential scope for a work programme to review WFF, which includes the MFTC. The WFF review is part of the broader welfare overhaul work programme and is expected to take at least 12 months. Any changes to WFF through legislative amendment would take even longer to implement. It is noted that, subject to any change in Government policy on the alignment of the MFTC threshold to future changes to benefit rates or abatement settings, further reviews of the MFTC threshold will be required annually. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-12 08:10:03 s 9(2)(f)(iv)
Regulatory Impact Statement | 1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Regulatory Impact Statement: Limiting interest deductibility on residential investment property Coversheet Purpose of Document Decision sought: Agree to limit interest deductions for resident investment property Advising agencies: Inland Revenue Proposing Ministers: Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue Minister of Housing Date finalised: 8 September 2021 Problem Definition The key policy problem is housing affordability. The cost of buying a house is placing significant financial stress on households. House prices are high by international standards and rates of home ownership have been declining. There are also concerns about the affordability of rents and maintaining an adequate supply of new housing stock. Executive Summary Problem definition One of the Government’s objectives for housing is to support more sustainable house prices, including by dampening investor demand for existing housing stock. This is in response to the decline of housing affordability for first-home buyers. To the extent that housing affordability concerns are due to excess demand and some of this demand is from investors, then reducing demand from investors may result in less upward pressure on house prices. Possible options While the tax system is not the primary driver of housing affordability, features of the tax system exacerbate the issue. In particular, investment in housing is tax-preferred as compared to investments that do not earn large gains. The policy question is therefore whether limiting interest deductions are an efficient and effective way of addressing these concerns and, if so, how interest limitation rules should best be designed. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Four options have been identified in addition to the status quo: 1. Option 1: Deny interest deductions for residential investment property. 2. Option 2: Deny interest deductions for residential investment property, but with an exemption for new builds. 3. Option 3: Deny interest deductions for residential investment property, but with an exemption for new builds and allow interest deductions where the property is taxable on sale (at the time of sale). 4. Option 4: Deny interest deductions for residential investment property, but allow interest deductions where the property is taxable on sale (at the time of sale). This assessment focuses on possible changes to the tax system to address housing affordability. We acknowledge that non-tax measures have been recently implemented or are being considered but analysis of such options will not form part of this assessment. Inland Revenue’s preferred option Inland Revenue has advised against any of these options to deny or limit interest deductions and prefers the status quo to all options. It considers that additional taxes on rental housing are unlikely to be an effective way of boosting overall housing affordability. While they will put downward pressure on house prices, they will put upward pressure on rents and may reduce the supply of new housing developments in the longer-term. The benefit of increased housing affordability for first-home buyers is outweighed by negative impacts on rents and housing supply, high compliance and administration costs for an estimated 250,000 taxpayers, and the erosion of the coherence of the tax system. However, Cabinet has effectively decided not to proceed with the status quo, Option 1, or Option 4. Cabinet has agreed in-principle to proceed with the interest limitation policy with an exemption for new builds and has communicated this decision to the public. Of the remaining options, Inland Revenue recommends Option 3 over Option 2, which aligns with the preferred option in the Cabinet paper. The potential impact of Option 3 Option 3 is likely to produce the least impact on increasing the affordability of housing for first-home buyers, but it will also have the lowest impact on decreasing the affordability for renters. As Option 3 has the smallest impact on rents, it will minimise the negative impact of the proposal on those less likely to own their home relative to the general population, such as low-income households, young people, Māori, and Pacific peoples. Out of the four options, Option 3 will also have the smallest effect on the supply of new housing in New Zealand. While Options 2 and 3 may increase the price of housing to the detriment of owner-occupiers relative to Options 1 and 4, those building properties will be further incentivised to build new housing stock. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Option 3 is preferable to Option 2 given it would not tax investors beyond their economic income where the property is taxable on sale, thereby reducing over-taxation. This is a strong fairness argument and, on balance, outweighs the slightly reduced impact on housing affordability compared to Option 2. Views from consultation with stakeholders and general public Treasury In general, the Treasury supports limiting interest deductions for residential property primarily because it addresses the Government’s demand-side housing objective of moderating prices. In addition, in the absence of a comprehensive capital gains tax, the Treasury also supports it as a means of taxing more economic income from residential property investment. The Treasury is of the view that there should be no new build exemption, and that if there is one it should be as short as possible. While the Treasury does not support a new build exemption, it supports allowing interest deductions to offset any tax paid by investors on the sale of their properties. In summary, the Treasury prefers Option 4. Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry of Housing and Urban Development In general, Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) opposes limiting interest deductions for residential property, because of the negative impacts this could have on new housing supply if a new build exemption is not long enough, and because of the negative impacts it is likely to have on rents, rental churn, the provision of emergency, transitional and public housing, and the feasibility of purpose-built rentals. A long new build exemption (i.e. at least 20 years) is crucial to ensure that the new supply of houses is not reduced. HUD fundamentally disagrees with the Treasury’s assumption that the length of the exemption would only impact the price of residential property, and that it would not have any material impact on supply. Housing supply is already somewhat responsive to changes in demand, particularly in certain urban areas (i.e. Auckland). Regulatory changes, such as the National Policy Statement on Urban Development (NPS- UD), will also increase the responsiveness of supply to demand. In the absence of a new build exemption, or one which is too short, there is a significant risk that current rates of supply will drop and the extra supply being enabled by these regulatory changes will not be delivered. Views of the general public While there were a broad range of submissions to the Government’s discussion document, both for and against the proposal to limit interest deductions and its various design 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] elements, most submitters opposed the general proposal. 1 The public considered that a range of exclusions to the proposal ought to be included, generally arguing that removing interest deductibility from various types of housing would not further the Government’s objectives. There was support for the new build exemption. Most submissions received on the new build exemption concerned its length and application. Some submitters favoured an exemption that applies to all owners of a new build for a period of time, ranging from a shorter exemption (for example, 10 years) to one that applies in perpetuity. Others preferred an exemption that only applies to initial owners of a new build, with a range of views on how long it should apply for. The submissions that commented on the treatment of interest expenditure when residential investment property is sold considered that the interest should be fully deductible if the property is taxable on sale. Submitters were largely concerned about increased administration and compliance costs; in particular, increased time and cost for tax agents. Other submitters were against additional information requirements as self-assessment and existing record-keeping rules would already require taxpayers to retain relevant information. A range of other submissions were made on the discussion document – further detail on submissions can be found in the report “Interest limitation on residential investment property – key policy issues” (IR2021/325; T2021/1935 refers). Limitations and Constraints on Analysis The analysis is limited by a number of decisions made by Cabinet 2 prior to public consultation, including the following key in-principle decisions (full list of decisions can be found below at paragraph 14): 1. deductions for interest incurred on or after 1 October 2021 will be denied in full for interest on loans relating to residential property acquired on or after the 27 March 2021; 2. residential properties acquired before 27 March 2021 will be subject to phasing of interest denial at 25 percent per year over four years; and 3. exempt property from the denial proposal that is located in New Zealand, and purchased on or after 27 March 2021 and within 12 months of receiving its code compliance certificate. Officials were not directed to consult on whether to proceed with the overall interest limitation policy. They were only directed to consult on the design of the policy (such as 1 Submissions closed on 12 July 2021 and 484 submissions were received. The majority of the submissions were from private landlords, although some were from tax advisors, property investors’ representative groups, real estate agents, iwi groups, property developers, and engineers. 2 Cabinet Minute CAB-21-MIN-0045 (Amended) (8 March 2021). 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] the design of a new build exemption and whether interest deductions should be denied or merely deferred where the property is taxable on sale). Analysis has not been done on the impacts of the overall interest limitation policy in conjunction with non-tax measures that have recently been implemented or which are being considered. This analysis has been prepared under time constraints. While a discussion document was produced concerning the general proposal, there has been very limited engagement on final design decisions and their overall coherence. The impacts of each option are uncertain and depend on judgements about how much and how quickly housing supply responds to economic signals such as price. Responsible Manager Chris Gillion Policy Lead Policy & Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue 8 September 2021 Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue and The Treasury Panel Assessment & Comment: The Quality Assurance Panel with representatives from Inland Revenue and the Treasury has reviewed the Limiting interest deductibility on residential investment property regulatory impact statement (RIS) prepared by Inland Revenue and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the RIS partially meets the quality assurance criteria. Assessing the impact of each option depends on judgements about how much and how quickly housing supply responds to economic signals such as price. Further, the timeframe for policy development has been constrained. Given this, the panel considers that the information in the RIS is as complete as could reasonably be expected and identifies the main judgements, risks and uncertainties within the policy. However, the RIS does not analyse the impacts of the interest limitation policy in conjunction with other measures that have been recently implemented or are being considered. Further, while public consultation was carried out on the design of the proposal to limit interest deductibility, the public have not specifically been consulted on the problem definition and the broader range of 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] options (although where stakeholders provided general comments on the proposal and suggested alternatives through the public consultation process, these comments have been incorporated into the RIS). Consequently, the panel cannot be confident that the full range of impacts have been identified or that the preferred options are the best options to address the problem and achieve the desired objectives. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Section 1: Diagnosi ng the policy problem W h a t i s t h e c o n t e x t b e h i n d t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m a n d h o w i s t h e st a t u s q u o e x p e c t e d t o d e v e l o p? 1. Affordable housing is an important factor in determining people’s wellbeing, particularly for low-income families where housing costs represent a higher proportion of total income. Renters generally live in poorer-quality housing that is more likely to be cold, damp, have mould, and need major repairs. 3 Home ownership in and of itself has long-term impacts on living standards and the distribution of wealth; New Zealand homeowners are typically 14 times wealthier than non- homeowners. 4 Furthermore, unaffordable housing disproportionately affects certain population groups such as low-income people, young people, Māori, and Pacific peoples. 2. Housing affordability for owner-occupiers: Housing costs compared to income are high in New Zealand compared to other OECD countries. 5 Nationally, house prices have been rising at a rate faster than wages over the past five years. 6 This trend has accelerated over the past year. House prices have increased 19.8 percent year-on-year to October 2020, with the median price at that time being $725,000. 7 Auckland’s median house sale price for October was over $1 million for the first time. Homeownership rates are significantly lower now than they were at their peak in the 1990s and, as at the 2018 Census, were at their lowest since the 1950s. 8 However, home ownership rates have remained relatively stable over the last 5 years, which may reflect first-home buyers taking advantage of KiwiSaver deposits and low mortgage interest rates to enter the market. The decline in the proportion of households living in owner-occupied homes since the 1990s has not occurred uniformly across the population. For example, the decline has been faster for Māori and Pacific peoples. For Māori, the proportion of people living in an owner-occupied home declined across most of the 20th and early 21st century. From 1991, it has fallen from 57.4 percent to 47.2 percent by 2018. For Pacific people, it fell from 50.8 3 Stats NZ, Housing in Aotearoa: 2020, pp 77, 78, 80, 89. https://www.stats.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Reports/ Housing-inAotearoa-2020/Download-data/housing-in-aotearoa-2020.pdf. 4 Stats NZ, Housing in Aotearoa: 2020, pp 47. https://www.stats.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Reports/Housing- inAotearoa-2020/Download-data/housing-in-aotearoa-2020.pdf. 5 OECD Better Life Index (2020). http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/housing/. 6 Stats NZ, Housing in Aotearoa: 2020, pp 48, Figure 35. https://www.stats.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Reports/ Housing-in-Aotearoa-2020/Download-data/housing-in-aotearoa-2020.pdf. 7 REINZ Monthly Report October, pp 6.

Housing investors have consistently accounted for over one-third of property purchase transactions over the past decade, with investors making almost 40 percent of purchases in September 2020. Investor bidding is likely to exacerbate price escalation and hinder the ability of owner-occupiers to purchase houses. At the same time, investors supply rental housing and a good supply of rental housing is an important part of a healthy housing market. 4. Housing affordability for renters: Housing costs tend to be a greater burden for renters than owner-occupiers. 11 In 2019, approximately one third of households were renters. 12 A greater proportion of lower-income households were renters, including nearly half of all households in the lowest income decile. 13 In 2020, 45 percent of renters spent 30 percent or more of their income on housing costs compared to 25 percent for owner-occupiers. 14 This high ratio of rents to incomes has been steady nationally for more than a decade. 15 However, rents have grown much faster than incomes for some groups, including renters in major centres (such as Auckland and Wellington). 16 Several factors explain increasing rent prices including the cost of supplying rentals and increased incomes. 5. The drivers of unaffordability – supply issues: Various restrictions impede the ability to increase housing supply in the short term. These include regulatory barriers (e.g. zoning and height restrictions), increasing costs of building, and a lack of long- term infrastructure planning. Contributing to the lack of planning is local councils’ limited access to financial capital. As a result of these supply-side restrictions, increases in housing supply has not kept up with increases in demand over the last 40 years. 9 Stats NZ, Housing in Aotearoa: 2020, Figure 16. https://www.stats.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Reports/Housing- in-Aotearoa-2020/Download-data/housing-in-aotearoa-2020.pdf. 10 Stats NZ, data from 1916-2018 Censuses. https://www.stats.govt.nz/news/homeownership-rate-lowest-in- almost-70-years. 11 Stats NZ, Housing in Aotearoa: 2020, Figure 33. https://www.stats.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Reports/Housing- in-Aotearoa-2020/Download-data/housing-in-aotearoa-2020.pdf. 12 Stats NZ, Housing in Aotearoa: 2020, p 36. https://www.stats.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Reports/Housing-in- Aotearoa-2020/Download-data/housing-in-aotearoa-2020.pdf. 13 Stats NZ, Housing in Aotearoa: 2020, p 46. https://www.stats.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Reports/Housing-in- Aotearoa-2020/Download-data/housing-in-aotearoa-2020.pdf. 14 Stats NZ, Housing in Aotearoa: 2020. https://www.stats.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Reports/Housing-in- Aotearoa-2020/Download-data/housing-in-aotearoa-2020.pdf. 15 Stats NZ, Housing in Aotearoa: 2020, p 46. https://www.stats.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Reports/Housing-in- Aotearoa-2020/Download-data/housing-in-aotearoa-2020.pdf. 16 Stats NZ, Housing in Aotearoa: 2020, Figure 34. https://www.stats.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Reports/Housing- in-Aotearoa-2020/Download-data/housing-in-aotearoa-2020.pdf. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 6. The drivers of unaffordability – demand issues: Demand side factors are also putting upward pressure on prices. Falling interest rates have resulted in an increase in house prices, creating capital gains for existing property owners but worsening the position of prospective first-home buyers. The removal of loan-to-value ratio (LVR) restrictions by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand in response to COVID-19 allowed highly-leveraged investors to re-enter the market thereby exacerbating price pressures. However, these have since been reinstated. High population growth has also increased demand for housing over recent decades. While tax settings are not the primary driver of housing affordability, current tax settings incentivise investment in housing. In the context of constrained supply, lightly taxing housing relative to other forms of income will lead to higher property prices than would otherwise be expected. W h a t i s t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m o r o p p o r t u n i t y? 7. The key policy problem is housing affordability. The cost of buying a house is placing significant financial stress on households and having perverse effects on equity, including intergenerational equity. House prices compared to income in New Zealand are high by international standards and have increased further over recent years. Rates of homeownership have declined significantly since the 1990s and a government objective is to increase the number of owner-occupiers. As noted above, this impacts people’s living standards. The Government is also looking at a package of supply-side measures to address housing affordability in the long term. However, these measures will take some time to have an impact. 8. To the extent that affordability concerns are due to excess demand and some of this demand is from investors, then reducing demand from investors may result in less upward pressure on house prices. While the tax system is not the primary driver of housing affordability, features of the tax system exacerbate the issue. Investment in housing is tax-preferred compared to investments that do not earn large gains. 17 This creates an incentive to invest in housing over other asset classes and puts further upward pressure on property prices. The policy question is whether limiting interest deductions is an efficient and effective way of addressing these concerns and, if so, how interest limitation rules should best be designed. W h a t o b j e c t i v e s a r e s o u g h t i n r e l a t i o n t o t he p o l i c y p r o b l e m ? 9. As noted on 8 March 2021 (CAB-21-MIN-0045 Amended refers), Cabinet’s policy objectives for the housing market are to: a. Ensure every New Zealander has a safe, warm, dry, and affordable home to call their own – whether they are renters or owners. 17 Though some housing investments will not necessarily be tax preferred, such as where the bright-line test applies. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] b. Support more sustainable house prices, including by dampening investor demand for existing housing stock, which would improve affordability for first- home buyers. c. Create a housing and urban land market that credibly responds to population growth and changing housing preferences, that is competitive and affordable for renters and homeowners, and is well-planned and well-regulated. 10. The intervention identified in this Regulatory Impact Statement seeks to primarily address the Government’s demand-side housing objectives as set out in the second bullet point above: to support more sustainable house prices, including by dampening investor demand for existing housing stock, which would improve affordability for first-home buyers. However, the rules will also impact the other objectives for the housing market. One interaction between these three objectives is that more supply will support affordable housing for all New Zealanders, including first-home buyers, in the long-term. Section 2: Deci ding upon a n option to a ddres s the policy proble m W h a t c r i t e r i a w i l l b e u s e d to c o m p a r e o p t i o n s to t h e s t a t u s q u o ? 11. The likely impacts of the proposals will be assessed against a set of criteria to evaluate the impact of the proposals on the Government’s demand-side objectives (above at paragraph 9). Those criteria are broadly whether the proposal: a. improves housing affordability for first-home buyers; b. maintains the rate of development of new housing stock; and c. improves housing affordability in the rental market. 12. The options will also be evaluated against the traditional tax policy criteria of efficiency, equity, integrity, fiscal impact, compliance and administration costs, and coherence. These are described below. a. Efficiency and growth: Taxes should be, to the extent possible, efficient and minimise (as much as possible) impediments to economic growth. That is, the tax system should avoid unnecessarily distorting the use of resources (e.g. causing biases toward one form of investment versus another) and imposing heavy costs on individuals and firms. b. Equity and fairness: The tax system should promote fairness. The burden of taxes differs across individuals and businesses depending on which bases and rates are adopted. Assessment of both vertical equity (the relative position of those on different income levels or in different circumstances) and horizontal equity (the consistent treatment of those at similar income levels, or similar circumstances) is important. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] c. Revenue integrity: The tax system should be sustainable over time and minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and arbitrage. d. Fiscal impact: Tax reforms need to be affordable given fiscal constraints, and the tax system must raise sufficient revenue to support the Government’s fiscal strategy. e. Compliance and administration cost: The tax system should be as simple and low cost as possible for taxpayers to comply with and for the Inland Revenue Department to administer. f. Coherence: Individual reform options should make sense in the context of the entire tax system. While a particular measure may seem sensible when viewed in isolation, implementing the proposal may not be desirable given the tax system as a whole. W h a t s c o p e w i l l o p t i o n s b e c o n s i d e r e d w i t h i n ? Decisions by Cabinet 13. Cabinet made the following in-principle decisions prior to public consultation. 18 Interest denial generally 14. Interest deductions will be denied in full against the income from residential property investment for loans relating to residential property acquired on or after 27 March 2021. 15. Interest deductions will be denied for interest incurred on or after 1 October 2021. 16. Officials were directed to consult with stakeholders on the design details of the interest limitation proposal before seeking final decisions from Cabinet. Property acquired before 27 March 2021 17. Residential properties acquired before 27 March 2021 will be subject to phasing of interest denial at 25 percent per year over four years. 18. Further borrowing against residential property drawn down after 27 March 2021 will be subject to full denial if it relates to residential properties acquired before 27 March 2021 (or treated as though they were acquired before 27 March 2021). 18 CAB-21-MIN-0045 Amended (8 March 2021). Most decisions are in-principle. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Property acquired on or after 27 March 2021 19. Residential properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021 as a result of an offer made before the end of the day of announcement will be subject to phasing of interest denial at 25 percent per year over four years. New build exemption 20. Property located in New Zealand, and purchased on or after the 27 March 2021 and within 12 months of receiving its code compliance certificate (new builds) will be exempt from the proposal. 21. Officials were directed to consult on this exemption, including the following situations where the exemption would apply: a. Only to initial (or early) purchasers of a qualifying new build who purchase a property within 12 months of receiving its code compliance certificate. b. For a fixed period of ten years to both the first purchaser and subsequent purchasers of a qualifying new build. c. For a fixed period of 20 years to both the first purchaser and subsequent purchasers of a qualifying new build. 22. Officials were directed to consult on whether the above rule should be bolstered by also including a “first-occupied” test or another test, such as one based on when consent was granted to ensure that taxpayers do not have incentives to delay seeking code compliance certificates and eligibility for an exemption is objectively verifiable. Deductions for property developers and other persons subject to tax on sale 23. Property developers will be allowed to continue deducting their interest expenses as incurred. 24. Officials were directed to consult on whether interest deductions should be denied or merely deferred if the taxpayer is not a property developer but is taxed on the disposal of their property under the bright-line test or another land sale rule. Limitations on consultation 25. As is evident from the decisions above, Officials were not directed to consult on whether to proceed with the overall interest limitation policy. They were only directed to consult on the design of the policy (such as the design of a new build exemption and whether interest deductions should be denied or merely deferred where the property taxable on sale). 26. Analysis has not been done on the impacts of the overall interest limitation policy in conjunction with non-tax measures that have been recently implemented or are being considered. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 27. This analysis has been prepared under time constraints. While a discussion document was produced concerning the general proposal, there has been very limited engagement on final design decisions and their overall coherence. Experience from other countries 28. The United Kingdom have implemented a similar proposal, which restricts deductions from property income for finance costs for residential properties. The denial was gradually rolled out over 4 years in 25 percent increments and, as of April 2020, is fully phased in. 29. The main distinction between the UK and the proposal described in the Cabinet decisions above is that interest denial in the United Kingdom was accompanied by a 20 percent tax credit for denied deductions. For landlords on the standard income tax rate of 20 percent (i.e. those with income between £12,501 and £50,000), the interest is effectively fully deductible. For landlords on higher income tax rates (either 40 percent or 45 percent), their deductions are denied but they will obtain benefit of the tax credit, so effectively those landlords will get to deduct a portion of their interest expenditure. 30. One in five individual landlords are expected to pay more tax as a result of the measure (i.e. those on higher income tax rates). Given that only a small proportion of the housing market is affected by these changes, the UK government did not expect them to have a large effect on rent levels or house prices. Alternative options ruled out 31. A capital gains tax was considered in the wider context of housing affordability during the Tax Working Group process and the 2020 New Zealand General Election but was ruled out. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] W h a t o p t i o n s a r e b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d? 32. Four options have been identified in addition to the status quo (allowing deductions for interest expenditure for all types of residential investment property): a. Option 1: Deny interest deductions for residential investment property. b. Option 2: Deny interest deductions for residential investment property, but with an exemption for new builds. c. Option 3: Deny interest deductions for residential investment property, but with an exemption for new builds and allow interest deductions where the property is taxable on sale (at the time of sale). d. Option 4: Deny interest deductions for residential investment property, but allow interest deductions where the property is taxable on sale (at the time of sale). 33. In-principle decisions have already been made by Cabinet to implement the policy to deny deductions and to include an exemption for new builds. These decisions have been publicly announced. However, this regulatory impact assessment will analyse all options. 34. This assessment focuses on possible changes to the tax system to address housing affordability. We acknowledge that non-tax measures have been recently implemented or are being considered but analysis of such options will not form part of this assessment. Option 1 – deny interest deductions for residential investment property 35. Option 1 would deny deductions for interest expenditure incurred in deriving income from rental property. In general, the proposals will apply to interest on debt used to purchase or operate residential investment property, which is primarily residential property rented to tenants. 36. A range of residential investment property would be excluded from the proposal, including: a. land held by property developers; b. land outside New Zealand; c. employee accommodation; d. farmland; e. care facilities (for example, hospitals, convalescent homes, nursing homes, and hospices); f. commercial accommodation (for example, hotels and motels); and g. retirement villages and rest homes. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 15 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 37. Consultation: Stakeholder support is low for this option. Most submitters to the Government’s discussion document opposed the general proposal to limit interest deductions. Further, they consider that a range of exclusions to the proposal ought to be included (such as a new build exemption) generally arguing that removing interest deductibility from various types of housing would not further the Government’s objectives. Variations to the proposal were put forward by submitters, including only denying 50 percent of deductions, and changes to the proposal’s application date. 38. A range of submissions were made to exempt (to varying extents) specific types of housing, including private student accommodation, properties with multiple dwellings on a single title, purpose-built rentals, dual purpose buildings, and short-stay accommodation. Submissions on the proposal to exempt Māori communal housing (such as papakāinga housing) were mostly in favour. 39. Submitters generally favoured some form of exclusion for widely-held companies. This included support for an exclusion for a company that is, or is owned by, a Māori authority (given that such a company would generally not be widely-held as the shares are often held by a small number of trustees for the benefit of a wider group). 40. Submitters were mixed as to whether Kāinga Ora and its subsidiaries should be excluded from the rules. The majority of submitters wanted an exclusion for public or community housing. Some wanted an exclusion to apply on a property basis (as opposed to an entity basis), while others wanted an exemption for registered community housing providers or council-controlled organisations that provide community housing. Some submitters wanted exclusions for certain types of Māori entities (for example, Māori authorities or mandated iwi organisations). 41. Submitters were supportive of the exemption for property developers. There were mixed views as to the range of activities and persons who would qualify for the property development exemption. 42. Of submitters who commented on the administration of the proposal, their main concern was increased compliance costs. Some submitters agreed there may be some need for taxpayers to provide additional information to Inland Revenue. Other submitters were against additional information requirements because self- assessment and existing record-keeping rules already require taxpayers to retain relevant information. 43. Improves housing affordability for first-home buyers: Limiting interest deductibility could potentially help meet some of the Government’s housing market objectives. Denying interest deductions for residential investment property would increase the tax cost of investment property compared to the status quo. All else being equal, this would put downward pressure on demand and therefore on property prices. Further, some investors may choose to sell their residential investment properties given the lower return on those properties. These effects would benefit first-home buyers. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 16 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 44. Residential property is tax-favoured relative to more fully taxed investments such as interest income. This is because gains are generally not taxed and owner-occupiers are not taxed on their imputed rental income. 45. Owner-occupiers generally have a larger tax benefit relative to residential property investors. This is because ring-fencing rental losses has generally removed the tax advantages that investors could obtain above the tax advantages received by owner- occupiers. 46. This result arises as owner-occupiers face an effective income tax rate of 0 percent because they are not taxed on their gains or imputed rental income. Ring-fencing rental losses means that investors cannot use rental losses against other income. This means the effective income tax rate on their property portfolio cannot fall below 0 percent and may be greater than 0 percent. 47. Although owner-occupiers have significant tax benefits from investing in their own housing, interest disallowance will have no tax cost for them since they cannot deduct any housing interest now or under the proposed policy. First-home buyers would indirectly benefit from the policy due to house prices being lower than they otherwise would. Existing owner-occupiers may benefit due to the cost of purchasing replacement housing being lower (such as buying a larger house to live in), but may be disadvantaged by the price of their own current house falling or not rising as quickly as it otherwise would. 48. If limiting interest deductibility reduces the price that leveraged investors are willing to pay for new houses, this can reduce the incentive for developers to build and sell new houses. This can in turn reduce the supply of housing in the longer run which will tend to push up rents and offset any fall in the price of houses. The degree to which this would occur is uncertain. 49. Maintains the rate of development of new housing stock: Any negative impacts on prices reduces the incentive to build new houses. Therefore, we expect that the rate of development of new housing stock may be negatively impacted. 50. Improves housing affordability for renters: In the immediate term, property investors are constrained in their ability to increase rents in response to the interest denial policy. This is because rents can only be increased once every 12 months. After that period: a. In the short run, it is unlikely that landlords will be able to pass on any significant share of the additional tax costs, but this may not hold in specific circumstances where tenants have limited choice. b. In the medium and long run, rents may rise in line with any impact on the supply of new build housing. The reduction of interest deductions may lead to fewer investors purchasing property as rental accommodation and tend to reduce new house building and housing supply in the long run. This decrease of rental accommodation being added to the rental market may lead to increased rent. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 17 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 51. To the extent that proposals place upward pressure on rents, this appears more likely to disproportionately impact low-income households, younger people, Māori, and Pacific peoples, who are less likely to own their home relative to the general population. In addition, as around 43 percent of children are living in rental accommodation, upward pressure on rents could have negative impacts on child wellbeing and child poverty. Increases in rents may also lead to an increase in spending on the accommodation supplement and temporary additional support, although it is difficult to quantify this impact at this stage. 52. Efficiency and growth: The deductibility of interest is a key consideration for debt- funded investors. The denial of such deductions will impact the profitability of their investments and cause investors to underinvest in housing relative to other investments where interest continues to be fully deductible (and if the property is also taxed under the bright-line, then the investment may be overtaxed). It could also lead to the inefficient and premature sale of property (though this may be mitigated by the bright-line test, depending on when the property was acquired). 53. Denying interest deductibility will encourage equity-funded investment over debt- funded investment in housing. This is because equity investors will be unaffected by the measure and can still access the tax preferences from housing. 54. Equity and fairness: Restricting mortgage interest deductions may be considered unfair (violates horizontal equity) as it disallows a deduction that is available for almost all other investments. However, it may be considered fair by some as it partially addresses the under-taxation of residential property investors relative to other fully taxed investments. There can be some cases where if an interest deduction is not allowed, an investor may be overtaxed. This would be the case where the disallowed interest deductions exceed the non-taxable gain. 55. The tax rate on investment in residential property would likely increase under Option 1 and be broadly progressive given that a greater proportion of income from renting residential investment properties tends to be earned by people on higher incomes. 56. If the proposal is applied to existing investment properties, then some investors may unexpectedly end up with negative cash flow. These investors may be forced to sell their property and potentially make losses. 57. Revenue integrity: The rules to implement this option may create opportunities for tax avoidance. Denying interest deductions will require taxpayers to distinguish between interest on debt obtained to generate rental income from interest on debt obtained to generate other business income. Both debts may be secured against residential property but distinguishing the interest deductions that are incurred for each income-generating purpose may be difficult. 58. Fiscal impact: The expected revenue gain from this option is $1.81 billion over the forecast period (2021/22 to 2024/25). This estimate is based on a number of assumptions, including the following: 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] a. Information from income tax returns for the 2019-20 income year are projected forward using Treasury's Budget 2021 forecasts. b. Rising house prices will increase the nominal borrowing (and consequently the interest expenditure) of a portion of taxpayers. c. Where the denial of interest expenditure results in an increase of the taxable income of the taxpayer, the additional income is taxed at the taxpayer's marginal rate. d. Denial of interest deductions is phased in over time and is not fully denied until the 2025/26 income year. e. Calculations are based on information from a subset of taxpayers and is scaled to provide population estimates. 59. Compliance and administration cost: Limiting interest deductions will come with high compliance costs for a large number of residential property owners. An estimated 250,000 taxpayers are likely to be affected by changes to interest deductibility. Of those, some may not have tax agents and only have one residential property. It may be particularly difficult for some taxpayers to determine whether their lending relates to residential property or to other business purposes. Further, taxpayers will be required to determine the deductions available for interest expenditure at each stage of the four-year phase out period. 60. Limiting interest deductions would involve increased administration costs for Inland Revenue over an extended period while different rules (based on the acquisition date and nature of properties) continue to be in place. These administration costs would arise from managing an increased number of customer contacts and supporting the integrity of the rules. This means a mixture of providing people with information to increase awareness and making sure that Inland Revenue uses its full range of interventions to support customers in meeting their obligations right from the start through to follow-up action, where there is clear evidence of deliberate non- compliance. This will involve: a. ongoing proactive marketing and targeted education campaigns, followed by one-on-one interventions such as community compliance visits and integrity checks; b. developing appropriate tools to assist customers to determine eligibility; c. improving Inland Revenue’s data and analytical capability; and d. taking audit action to address deliberate non-compliance. 61. Coherence: Limiting interest deductions will decrease the coherence of the tax system. A principle underlying the tax system is that generally only the amount of income after deducting any associated costs is taxable. This policy would create an exception to that general rule. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 19 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Option 2 – deny interest deductions for residential investment property, but with an exemption for new builds 62. Option 2 is similar to Option 1, except that there is an exclusion for interest expenditure incurred in deriving income from property that qualifies as a new build. The discussion document consulted on two design features of the proposed new build exemption: a. who is eligible for the exemption (for example, whether to only allow interest deductions for the initial purchasers of those new builds or allow interest deductions on new builds to be claimed for a fixed period (with both initial and subsequent purchasers being allowed to claim interest deductions during that period)); and b. the length of the exemption (for example, 10 years, 20 years, or in perpetuity from when the code compliance certificate was issued). 63. Consultation: Submitters to the Government’s discussion document generally considered that if the proposal went ahead, that a generous new build exemption ought to be provided. However, general critique focussed on how the exemption could increase the price of new builds (therefore negatively impacting owner- occupiers) and undermine the interest limitation policy. 64. Submitters were largely in favour of the exemption applying to both initial owners and subsequent purchasers as this will likely increase the resale value of the property (providing a greater incentive for the initial investor to purchase a new build). However, many submitters did not think the exemption should be passed on to a subsequent purchaser, either because it was unfair to advantage someone who had not invested in a "new" new build, or because it would drive up the price of new builds and price owner-occupiers out of the new build market. 65. The most popular option was for a fixed period to apply to both the initial owners and subsequent purchasers of a new build. The option of an in-perpetuity exemption for initial owners, plus a fixed period for subsequent purchasers, was also popular. 66. Improves housing affordability for first-home buyers: This option would improve housing affordability for first-home buyers (given the increased tax cost of investment in existing builds), but to a lesser extent to than Option 1. 67. The new build exemption will increase the return for a debt-funded investor in a newly built residential property, relative to the return from that investor purchasing an existing residential property. This means that a new debt-funded investor will be willing to pay less for an existing property compared to a comparable new build. 68. The shift in demand towards new builds could, unchecked, lead to an increase in the price of new builds relative to existing homes. However, the shift in investor demand to new builds will reduce the impact that removing the deductibility of interest has on moderating house price growth. This is because the new build exemption will lead investors to value new builds closer to how they were valued prior to the tax change. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 20 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] A longer new build exemption would further reduce the impact that the policy has on moderating house price growth. 69. The new build exemption will not just affect demand for new builds. In response to debt-funded investors moving into the new build market, owner-occupiers and equity- funded investors will purchase fewer new builds and more existing homes. That means that the length of the new build exemption modifies the impact that interest limitation has on the demand for, and growth in prices of, both new and existing homes. 70. If new and existing homes on the market are very closely substitutable, then we would expect that buyer substitution is likely to mean that Option 2 would be much less effective than Option 1 in putting downward pressure on the price of existing houses and might in the end have little effect in reducing these prices. However, Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry of Housing and Urban Development and Inland Revenue do not consider that this is likely to be the case. The characteristics (in particular, the location, typology, and quality) of new builds as compared with existing housing are sufficiently different that the relative pricing between new builds and existing housing will diverge more than they do currently. This could allow a price reduction for purchasers of existing housing while maintaining a supply benefit from the continued provision of new builds. 71. The impact of Option 2 on housing affordability for first-home buyers is also heavily dependent on the length of the new build exemption. Inland Revenue considers that a longer exemption is likely to result in less downward pressure on house prices. However, Inland Revenue considers that in the long run housing affordability is unlikely to be promoted by measures which reduce the supply of housing. Given that Inland Revenue considers that a shorter exemption will reduce the supply of housing (see analysis below), Inland Revenue supports a longer new build exemption. 72. Maintains the rate of development of new housing stock: The impacts of the new build exemption on the Government’s objectives, including the rate of development of new housing stock, are uncertain. 73. The extent of land use regulation impacts how much demand changes (including those caused by tax changes) affect the supply of land for a particular use (such as for residential property) and the price of land. The more restrictive land use regulations are (restricting the ability to use land for residential purposes), the more a tax change that increases demand for residential property development will impact the price and the less it will impact on supply. 74. Inland Revenue has recommended a longer new build exemption to minimise impacts on supply. Putting aside the question of the competitive nature or otherwise at the periphery of the city, clearly within a city land can be put to alternative uses, in terms of residential or commercial land, typology of housing (e.g. terraced or standalone), and size of houses. The number of landowners make it difficult to argue that within city limits there is insufficient competition between land owners for tax to influence choices. Therefore, tax changes (including the extent of a new build exemption) will likely influence decisions, and thereby influence total housing supply. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 21 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 75. Improves housing affordability for renters: Inland Revenue’s view is that interest limitation will increase rents and that in the long run, affordability for renters will not be promoted by taxing the provision of rental properties by landlords more heavily. However, the effect of this option on rents will be less significant compared to Option 1. 76. Efficiency and growth: As for Option 1, the deductibility of interest is a key consideration for debt-funded investors. Allowing interest deductions for new builds will likely cause debt-funded investors to focus investment on new builds when they may not have otherwise done so. This may lead to less efficient decision making. This will have an impact on relative prices (described above). Again, equity-funded investors will not be directly affected by the proposals. 77. Equity and fairness: As described above, the proposal to limit interest deductions may erode horizontal equity in relation to other types of investment, which generally are entitled to deductions for all expenditure incurred in deriving income from that investment. However, to a lesser extent than Option 1. 78. This option may be seen as unfair for debt-funded investors who acquired residential property prior to 27 March 2021. While these investors are able to claim interest deductions under the four-year phase out period, the deductibility of interest is a major consideration for investors and will impact the profitability of past investments. 79. Revenue integrity: As described for Option 1, Option 2 is expected to negatively impact the integrity of the tax system. The method for determining what deductions should be denied to what categories of persons is a complex task given the range of structuring that could occur. 80. Fiscal impact: Denying interest deductions under Option 2 will also raise revenue, but to a lesser extent than Option 1. The expected revenue gain from this option is $1.22 billion over the forecast period (2021/22 to 2024/25). In addition to the assumptions provided above under Option 1, this option includes the following assumptions: a. The new build exemption would be for 20 years and be available for all purchasers of the relevant property. b. The forecast value of new residential builds is derived from Treasury’s Budget 2021 forecasts. c. The behavioural change induced by the new build exemption increases the proportion of new builds being bought for use as rental property from 35 percent to 75 percent. 19 19 Census data indicates that 35% of households are not living in owner-occupied housing. We have assumed that a similar proportion of new builds are currently being bought by investors. Behavioural assumptions incorporated in the new build exemption costing see this increase to 75%. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 22 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] d. Interest expenditure is calculated using the repayment profile generated from a 25-year loan. 20 e. The tax impact of the new build exemption is calculated using a marginal tax rate of 24.55 percent. 21 81. Compliance and administration cost: In addition to the extensive compliance and administration costs described for Option 1, this option would also require current and prospective residential property investors to consider the following: a. Whether a property they are seeking to purchase is a new build or an existing build. This may require taxpayers to obtain a code compliance certificate from the relevant territorial authority. b. Whether their current lending relates to a new build or an existing build. This would include a more complex tracing exercise than Option 1 where lending relates to both new builds and existing builds. This may also lead to various financing and debt reorganisations that may have not otherwise been necessary. i. For existing properties, taxpayers will have to apply the interest phase-out rules to each payment (in respect of residential land purchased before 27 March 2021). ii. For residential property purchased on or after 27 March 2021, or for land where a code compliance certificate (CCC) for a new build is issued on or after this date, they will need to determine whether any of the exemptions from the application of the new rules apply (for example, the development and new build exemptions). 82. Owners of new builds and property developers will need to maintain records and sufficient evidence to establish that they qualify for the new build or development exemption, and in particular to support their approach to tracing through their lending. 83. Coherence: Option 2, as an overall proposal, is less coherent than Option 1. This option creates artificial boundaries based on when the property was built, which will make the taxation of residential investment property more difficult to navigate and administer. Option 2 will also undermine the coherence of the broader tax system given it will create a carve out to the general principle that expenditure incurred in business is deductible. 20 In the absence of information on the average loan term for new residential property mortgages, a 25-year term was selected. 21 24.55% is the average marginal tax rate of those Inland Revenue could identify as owners of residential rental properties with interest expenditure. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Option 3 - deny interest deductions for residential investment property, but with an exemption for new builds and allow interest deductions where the property is taxable on sale (at the time of sale) 84. Option 3 is similar to Option 2 in that interest deductions will be generally denied for residential investment property (excluding new builds), however, this option would allow interest deductions for a property that is sold and subject to tax (including property sold within the relevant bright-line period). The rationale for allowing interest deductions on a taxable sale is to target the policy to where taxes are low relative to actual income (because the gain is untaxed). 85. Consultation: The discussion document consulted on the following options where a property that is sold is subject to tax: a. Permanently denying all interest deductions subject to the interest limitation rule. b. Allowing interest deductions when a property is subject to tax on sale (for example, because the sale is subject to the bright-line rule). c. Allowing all interest deductions on sale, except to the extent there is an untaxed increase in value of the property. 86. Submissions that commented on this design issue generally considered that interest should be fully deductible when the sale of a property is subject to tax. Many also considered that at least some interest should be deductible when capital account (non-taxable) property is sold. A small number of submitters thought that there should be no deduction for deferred interest on sale in order to maximise the impact of the policy on the housing market. 87. Design of Option 3: This assessment analyses the design of Option 3 where the proposal allows interest deductions when a property is subject to tax on sale – for example, because it is caught by the bright-line rule (see paragraph 85.b). 88. Improves housing affordability for first-home buyers: This option would still improve housing affordability for first-home buyers but to a slightly lesser extent than both Options 1 and 2. Officials advised that the impact of this design issue (whether to fully deny or just defer deductions) will be significantly smaller than the impact of the length of the new build exemption. However, even if interest deductions are deferred rather than permanently denied, investors will be worse off compared to the status quo. 89. Maintains the rate of development of new housing stock: The impact of this option on the rate of new housing supply is likely to be similar to that of Option 2. Option 3 will further reduce the effect of the overall policy on house prices and should produce less of a disincentive to build new supply (compared to Options 1 and 2). However, the impact of Option 3 on new housing supply is likely be small relative to the potential impact of Option 2. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 90. Improves housing affordability for renters: Affordability for renters in the long run will not be promoted by taxing the provision of accommodation by landlords more heavily under the general proposal. However, Option 3 would have the smallest negative impact on long-term housing supply, and therefore will have the least tendency to increase rents. 91. Efficiency and growth: Again, for debt-funded investors interest deductibility is a key consideration. The deferral of interest deductions for investors in property who are taxable on sale will likely mitigate some efficiency concerns because interest deductions to those properties will be available at some point. However, there would still be a preference to invest in new builds, given that interest would be deductible in the year it was incurred. 92. Equity and fairness: This option may erode horizontal equity in relation to other types of investment, which generally are entitled to deductions for all expenditure incurred in deriving income from that investment in the year it was incurred. However, horizontal equity would be eroded to a lesser extent under Option 3 than under Options 1 and 2. 93. Where a sale of a property is taxable, all of the income from owning the property has been taxed, so all deductions should be allowed. The deferral of the deduction (until the time of sale) is appropriate because it may not be clear whether the sale is taxable until the year of sale (especially where the bright-line rule applies). This then aligns those deductions with the taxation of the gain, which removes a timing advantage (as the gain accrues over the entire holding period). 94. Revenue integrity: This option is expected to negatively impact the integrity of the tax system, given the complexity involved and the opportunities for avoidance and arbitrage. The methods for determining what deductions should be denied to what categories of persons is a complex task given the large range of structuring that could occur. 95. Fiscal impact: Denying interest deductions under Option 3 will also raise revenue, but to a lesser extent than Options 1 and 2. The expected revenue gain from this option is $1.12 billion over the forecast period (2021/22 to 2024/25). In addition to the assumptions for Options 1 and 2 above, this option includes the following assumptions: a. Interest deductions will be allowed when a property is subject to tax on sale (for example, because it is caught by the bright-line rule). b. Disallowed interest deductions accumulate through time. c. Eight percent of properties are sold each year (CoreLogic data), of which 40 percent are subject to tax on sale. It has been assumed that for those properties, 80 percent of the interest expenditure will be deductible (as that amount is below the capital gain). 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 25 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] d. The total interest deductions allowed for properties taxable on sale has been reduced to take into account the impact of the new build exemption and avoid over-estimating the fiscal impact. e. The tax effect of allowing interest deductions for properties within the taxable- on-sale exemption under Option 3 is calculated using a 24.55 percent tax rate. 22 96. Compliance and administration cost: In addition to the compliance and administration costs described for Options 1 and 2, Option 3 will also require taxpayers to retain comprehensive records of interest expenditure incurred over the period of ownership of the property for a longer period than otherwise required to by law. Investors who know that the sale will be taxable will keep all records to ensure they can claim their interest deductions. For investors who are not expecting to be taxable on sale, best practice may be to maintain comprehensive records throughout the period of ownership (should the sale be taxable and they can then claim interest deductions). 97. Coherence: Option 3 will decrease the coherence of the tax system as a whole, but to a lesser extent than Options 1 and 2. As described above, the interest limitation policy will undermine the coherence of the tax system given it will create a carve out to the general principle that expenditure incurred in business is deductible. However, Option 3 erodes the coherence of the tax system to a lesser extent as it allows the deduction of some of those business expenses consistently with that general principle. Further, Option 3 reflects another general principle of the tax system to only tax a person to the extent of their income. Option 4 – deny interest deductions for residential investment property, but allow interest deductions where the property is taxable on sale (at the time of sale) 98. Option 4 is a combination of Options 1 and 3. Option 4 would deny interest deductions for residential investment property but allow interest deductions where the property is taxable on sale (at the time of sale). 99. The analysis for Option 4 largely follows the analysis for Option 1 but modified to take into account the impact of allowing deductions on a taxable sale. Option 4 would improve housing affordability for first-home buyers better than Options 2 and 3, but to a slightly lesser extent than Option 1. With no new build exemption under Option 4, the rate of development of new housing stock may be negatively impacted, which may cause rents to increase in the medium and long run (similar impact as Option 1). 100. Option 4 would likely have similar but slightly better outcomes to Option 1 in relation to efficiency and growth, equity and fairness, and coherence. Option 4 would be fairer to those that are taxable on sale, because if an interest deduction is not allowed, an investor may be overtaxed where the disallowed interest deduction exceeds the non- 22 24.55% is the average marginal tax rate of those Inland Revenue could identify as owners of residential rental properties with interest expenditure. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 26 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] taxable gain. However, the fiscal impact of Option 4 would likely be slightly worse than for Option 1. Key stakeholder view: Treasury 101. In general, the Treasury supports limiting interest deductions for residential property primarily because it addresses the Government’s demand-side housing objective of moderating prices. In addition, in the absence of a comprehensive capital gains tax, the Treasury also supports limiting interest deductibility for residential property as a means of taxing more economic income from residential property investment. 102. The Treasury recognises the need to balance the Government's objective of moderating house prices and supporting a high level of housing supply and affordable rents. The Treasury’s assessment of the evidence is that this policy is likely to have only limited impact on either housing supply or rents, and will have more impact on land prices. This is because urban land markets are relatively uncompetitive and therefore construction activity does not fully respond to the typical economic signals of house prices alone. 103. New build exemption: Consequently, the Treasury is of the view that there should be no new build exemption, and that if there is one it should be as short as possible (consistent with Options 1 and 4). 104. This is because the Treasury’s judgement is that a longer exemption for new builds will reduce the impact of the measure on overall demand for housing and therefore house price inflation, while it will not have any material impact on housing supply given the uncompetitiveness of urban land markets. This lower impact on price inflation will be true of all homes, not just the new homes to which the exemption applies. While, for a very short time, there may be a spike in the demand for new builds as highly leveraged investors look to purchase more to take advantage of the exemption, in most locations demand and prices for new builds and existing houses will swiftly equalise as other buyers (such as prospective owners) would be displaced and instead purchase existing properties. 105. The Treasury acknowledges that there may be a small, short-run reduction in construction activity from a shorter exemption, but this would occur primarily in locations where land supply is plentiful. 106. Furthermore, the Treasury considers that a new build exemption could distort the type of property that people live in. If so, this will be welfare-reducing. For example, some owner-occupiers who would have preferred a new build will be pushed into the existing home market by investors purchasing new builds in order to access the exemption. Some renters who, for affordability reasons, might have preferred to live in an older house, will instead move into the new build market. A longer new build exemption will lead to a greater distortion in the market, and a greater welfare loss. 107. Allowing interest deductions to offset tax when property sold: While the Treasury does not support a new build exemption, it supports allowing interest deductions to offset any tax paid by investors on the sale of their properties (as 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] outlined in Options 3 and 4). Allowing a deduction for interest payments when the property is taxable on sale will avoid the double taxation of the economic income from residential investment property. The Treasury agrees that these deductions should be limited so that they can only be used to offset tax on the gains on the sale of property, which would reduce the integrity risks that could arise if taxpayers could offset deductions against their other income. 108. In summary, the Treasury supports Option 4. Key stakeholder view: Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry of Housing and Urban Development 109. Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) does not support limiting interest deductions for residential property investors. While limiting interest deductions may help support the Government’s objective of supporting more sustainable house prices, including by dampening investor demand for existing stock, reducing investor demand for property could have a significantly negative impact on supply, and is likely to also have a number of unintended negative impacts including: a. Increased rents and rental churn – While the ability for landlords to pass their increased tax costs onto their tenants is constrained in the immediate term, in the short term we would expect there to be some upward pressure on rents, particularly where renters’ choices are constrained. Increased tax costs may also lead to landlords selling investment properties, displacing tenants who will need to incur costs associated with finding new rental accommodation. To minimise the negative impacts of the interest limitation rules on renters, HUD considers that interest deductions for properties already owned prior to 27 March 2021 should not be limited. If interest is to be limited, then the phase-out period for already owned investment properties should be longer and last for at least 10 years. b. Reduced feasibility of purpose-built rentals in New Zealand – Purpose-built rental (PBR, also known as build to rent) is a developing sector in New Zealand and stakeholders have raised concerns that limiting interest deductions will significantly reduce the feasibility of PBR. While the development and new build exemptions will apply to new PBR developments, the eventual expiration of the new build exemption will affect the valuation of the developments and make it less likely that they will be built. PBR could be an important way to help New Zealand’s housing needs. If supported through the right settings, large scale PBR has the potential to deliver 6,500-7,000 units over the next 10 years. Owing to differences in typology of large-scale PBR and traditional build-to-sell developments, this would likely lead to extra new supply overall than if regulatory settings do not support PBR. PBR also provides a number of other benefits including high quality properties, economies of scale in terms of maintenance and upkeep, longer and more flexible lease periods, shared spaces facilitating community and social good, and housing in suitable locations close to public transport and employment. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 28 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] To reduce the impact of the interest limitation rules on PBR, HUD considers it necessary to exclude PBR from the scope of the interest limitation rules. c. Reduced supply of emergency, transitional and public housing – While registered community housing providers (CHPs) will often be charities or covered by a separate income tax exemption, and Kāinga Ora (which is not tax exempt) will be excluded from the interest limitation rules, the interest limitation rules may still lead to a reduction in the supply of public housing. Both CHPs and the Government lease properties from private landlords for use as emergency, transitional and public housing. These private landlords will be affected by the interest limitation rules and will have a higher tax cost in relation to leasing their properties for use as public housing. This higher tax cost could lead to a reduction in the number of properties made available for use as public housing, or an increased cost to CHPs and the Government in procuring these properties. Some council housing may also be provided through council-controlled organisations (CCOs) which are not exempt from income tax, and so will face an increased tax cost from the interest limitation rules. Māori entities that are not registered charities or CHPs may also provide some social housing. These entities providing social housing will also face increased tax costs from the rules. To minimise the impact of the interest limitation rules on the provision of emergency, transitional and public housing, HUD considers it would be necessary to exclude all properties used for these purposes from the scope of the rules, regardless of the underlying ownership of the properties. 110. The design of the interest limitation rules may be able to minimise these negative unintended consequences, however, this may reduce the impact of the rules on house prices. Furthermore, designing the rules to minimise unintended consequences is likely to increase the complexity of the rules, making them harder for Inland Revenue to enforce and for tax agents and taxpayers to comply with. 111. New build exemption – HUD considers that a long new build exemption (i.e. at least 20 years) is necessary to minimise the impact of the interest limitation rules on the supply of new housing. Long-run housing affordability is not supported by measures that reduce the supply of new housing and there is a significant risk that supply will reduce if the exemption period is too short. 112. Housing supply is already somewhat responsive to changes in the price of housing and the National Policy Statement on Urban Development (NPS-UD) and related work will increase this responsiveness. Denying interest deductions would therefore significantly reduce the supply of housing in the medium to long term and create a risk that the extra housing being enabled by the NPS-UD and related work would not be supplied. A long new build exemption would alleviate much of this impact. HUD therefore recommends that the new build exemption should last for at least 20 years from the date of CCC, so as to minimise the impact that denying interest deductions has on the supply of new housing. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] H o w d o t h e o p t i o n s c o m p a r e t o t h e s t a t u s q u o / c o u n t e r f a c t u a l ?

Inland Revenue considers retaining the status quo to be the most desirable option. While the status quo does not improve housing affordability for first-home buyers, on balance Inland Revenue considers that the detriment produced from all four options is too great. For all four options, the compliance and administration costs for an expected 250,000 taxpayers, the decrease in housing affordability for renters, and the erosion of the coherence of the tax system outweigh the relative increase in housing affordability for first-home buyers. Limiting interest deductibility will be complex and raise fairness concerns for existing residential property investors. 114. Cabinet has, however, already (effectively) decided not to proceed with the status quo, Option 1, or Option 4. Cabinet has agreed in-principle to proceed with the interest limitation policy with an exemption for new builds, and has communicated this decision to the public. Therefore, this analysis further focuses on the option (out of remaining Options 2 and 3) that best addresses the problem and meets the policy objectives. 115. Option 3 is likely the best option relative to all options (other than the status quo). Compared to Option 2 (and Options 1 and 4), Option 3 is likely to produce the least impact on increasing the affordability of housing for first-home buyers, but it will also have the lowest impact on decreasing the affordability for renters. The marginal cost of Option 3 over Option 2 regarding price, is outweighed by the marginal benefits of rental affordability and greater fairness and coherence of the tax system. Given Option 3 has the least impact on rents, this option will minimise the impact of the proposal on those less likely to own their home relative to the general population (low-income households, younger people, Māori, and Pacific peoples). 116. Out of the four options, Option 3 will also have the smallest effect on the supply of new housing in New Zealand. While Options 2 and 3 may increase the price of housing to the detriment of owner-occupiers relative to Options 1 and 4, those building new properties will be further incentivised to build new housing stock. 117. Option 3 is preferable to Option 2 given it would not tax investors beyond their economic income where the house is taxable on sale, thereby reducing over- taxation. This is a strong fairness argument, and on balance outweighs the slightly reduced impact on housing affordability compared to Option 2. Further, Option 3 Example key for qualitative judgements: ++ much better than doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual + better than doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual 0 about the same as doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual - worse than doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual - - much worse than doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 31 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] reduces the coherence of the tax system to a lesser extent overall – as it allows interest deductions in support of the general principles that expenditure incurred in business is deductible and a person should only be taxed to the extent of their income. 118. Options 2 and 3 include a new build exemption. Two details of such an exemption can be modified – the period of the new build exemption and whether it applies to only initial purchasers or to all acquirers within the period of the exemption. While there is debate and uncertainty as to the impact of a new build exemption on prices, housing supply and rents, Inland Revenue considers that a longer new build exemption (20 years) and allowing all acquirers within that period to be eligible to the exemption is preferred as it will minimise impacts on supply. Inland Revenue understands that a longer exemption is likely to mean less downward pressure on house prices. However, Inland Revenue considers that in the long run affordability is unlikely to be promoted by measures which reduce the supply of housing and for this reason supports a more generous exemption. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 32 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] W h a t a r e t h e m a r g i n a l c o s t s a n d b e n e f i t s o f Op t i o n 3? Affected groups Comment Impact Evidence Certainty Additional costs of option 3 compared to taking no action Regulated groups – residential property investors Denying interest deductions for residential investment property under Option 3 would increase the tax cost of investment property compared to the status quo. All else being equal, this would put downward pressure on demand and therefore on property prices. The impact of Option 3 on property prices would be very difficult to determine. For the marginal investor, Option 3 could be the ‘tipping point,’ so they would forgo the purchase or sell their existing investment property, as other alternative investments become relatively more attractive. However, if the reduced return is still expected to be the highest yielding investment (adjusted for risk) then it is rational for them to purchase or retain the property. Option 3 includes a new build exemption, and therefore residential property investors could retain current tax settings through investing only in new builds. Option 3 would also assist in some fairness concerns that arise for those who have invested or are intending to invest in existing property. The additional tax paid by investors is expected to be $1.12 billion over the forecast period (2021/22 to 2024/25). The compliance and administration costs on residential property investors will be burdensome and be an extra cost (in addition to the tax cost). Complying with the policy would be particularly difficult for investors without tax agents or who are relatively unsophisticated. Given the policy is a shift from the fundamental tax policy principle that interest expenditure for business purposes is generally deductible, boundary issues would arise that investors would be required to navigate. Low Regulators – Inland Revenue Option 3 is complex and will impose additional compliance costs on Inland Revenue. Implementation and ongoing administration demands will require Inland Revenue to undertake proactive marketing and targeted education campaigns, develop appropriate tools to assist customers to determine eligibility, improve Inland Revenue’s data and analytical capability, and take audit action to address deliberate non-compliance. The expected administration costs arising from Option 3 is estimated to be $19.38 million over the forecast period (2021/22 to 2024/5). While a significant proportion of administration costs will be incurred within the next four years, Inland Revenue will have ongoing administration costs. Medium Other interested party – Renters Option 3 may put upward pressure on rents through decreasing rental supply in the long term. This means renters may be negatively impacted by the proposals. Depending on how prices react to a new build exemption under Option 3, this may lead to differences in rent for new builds compared to existing builds. The overall change in demand (which influences the rental price), will depend on the extent to which people alter behaviour in response to the price change. This could be in the form of a transition to home-ownership (for the higher-income Low 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 33 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Increased rents may impact tenants’ living standards as it may mean that housing costs are high compared to their incomes or they are forced to live in premises that are not suitable for the number of occupants and limit their level of privacy and personal space. It may also cause crowding. Overall, this would reduce their financial and social capitals. To the extent that Option 3 places upward pressure on rents, this appears more likely to disproportionately impact low-income households, young people, Māori, and Pacific peoples, who are less likely to own their home relative to the general population. In addition, as around 43 percent of children are living in rental accommodation, upward pressure on rents could have negative impacts on child wellbeing and child poverty. Some renters may take advantage of lower house prices to become owner-occupiers. This would give them the opportunity to increase their financial and social capitals. The status quo would not provide any additional negative impacts that Option 3 may impose. renters), a move down the housing spectrum (e.g. a younger person may move back in with their parents), or an increase in household occupancy rates to spread the rental costs over more people. Other interested party – current owner-occupiers Owner-occupiers are not currently able to deduct interest expenditure from their income, therefore Option 3 will have no direct cost. However, given Option 3 is expected to (somewhat) impact house prices, the sale price that an owner- occupier could achieve if Option 3 is implemented may be lower than the sale price they could have achieved if the status quo was retained. The impact of Option 3 on property prices would be very difficult to determine. Low Other interested party – macro- financial stability (including banks) To the extent that Option 3 succeeds in reducing demand from residential property investors, this reduction in aggregate demand for residential property at the margin may reduce price pressures, all else being equal. If there was a large price impact, this may have a negative impact at the margins for banks. The impact for banks is unquantifiable but is unlikely to be significant. Low Other interested party – wider government To the extent that Option 3 results in increased pressure on rents, it may also lead to an increase in spending on the accommodation supplement and temporary additional support. It is difficult to quantify the impact of Option 3 on wider government at this stage. Low Total monetised costs We do not have confidence in the ability to provide a total monetised cost. The expected revenue from this option (and therefore Low 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 34 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] expected cost to residential property investors) is expected to be $1.12 billion over the forecast period (2021/22 to 2024/25). Non-monetised costs We do not have confidence in the ability to provide a total non-monetised cost. Low Low Additional benefits of the preferred option compared to taking no action Other interested party – first-home buyers At the margin, reduced competition from residential property investors in the market may reduce pressure on prices and make it somewhat easier for prospective first-home buyers to purchase a property. This would improve their financial capital and social capital (as indicated above). It is very difficult to quantity the impact that Option 3 will have on house prices. It would depend on both the market conditions and the behaviour of market participants. Low Regulators – wider government Increased revenue would be collected from the denial of interest deductions to residential property investors.

On 23 March 2021, the Government announced its in-principle decision to deny deductions for interest expenditure on residential properties from 1 October 2021. While final policy decisions will only be released close to 1 October, the broad policy proposal has been consulted on in detail, both with the public and with advisors in the tax community. 121. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the implementation and ongoing administration of the interest limitation rules. The in-principle decisions and timeline provided by Cabinet have meant that this proposal to limit interest deductions has been progressed without comprehensive consideration of how the policy will be implemented. 122. Limiting interest deductions will involve increased administration costs for Inland Revenue over an extended period of time (especially while different rules apply during the phase-in period). This includes managing an increased number of customer contacts and supporting the integrity of the new rules. Inland Revenue will also undertake enforcement action where there is clear evidence of deliberate non- compliance. 123. Inland Revenue’s initial focus will be on communication and education. It will provide information to increase awareness and support customers in meeting their obligations right from the start. This will include producing a relevant Tax Information Bulletin item, updating guidance on Inland Revenue’s website, undertaking ongoing proactive marketing and targeted education campaigns, and developing appropriate tools to assist customers to determine eligibility. Any implementation or operational requirements for specific policy decisions that have not yet been made at time of writing may need to be addressed in the future. Inland Revenue expects that relatively minor alterations to systems and operations will be needed.

Monitoring: To assist work on compliance with property transactions, Inland Revenue already includes property-related information in its Data Intelligence Platform (DIP). The DIP brings together data from different sources to provide an end-to-end view of property transactions throughout New Zealand. The DIP is being used to identify suspected cases of property non-compliance and is a searchable record of customers’ past property transitions and will be further developed and enhanced to aide interest limitation compliance work. Further, Inland Revenue will report annually to Ministers on the effect of increased administration funding on taxpayers’ compliance with the interest limitation rules. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49 Regulatory Impact Statement | 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 125. Given the many competing influences on housing affordability, officials do not expect to be able to monitor the impact of this policy on the housing market, house prices, or rents. 126. Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is responsible for the monitoring of New Zealand’s housing and urban development system. As part of this role HUD collects and analyses data and research on New Zealand’s housing and urban development system, including measures of housing and rental affordability. 127. Monitoring the precise impact of the interest deductibility rules on the housing and urban development system is likely to prove difficult owing to the many varied factors impacting upon the housing system. In particular, the introduction of the interest limitation rules at a similar time as the reinstatement of the Reserve Bank’s loan to value ratio restrictions and proposed introduction of debt-to-income ratio restrictions (as well as possible interest rate rises) will make it difficult to specifically attribute any housing market impacts to the interest limitation rules. 128. Review: Inland Revenue regularly reviews tax settings on an ongoing basis and provides advice and updates to the Government accordingly. Policy officials maintain strong communication channels with stakeholders in the tax advisory community, including through the generic tax policy process, and these stakeholders will be able to correspond with officials about the operation of the new rules at any time. If problems emerge, they will be dealt with either operationally, or by way of legislative amendment if agreed by Parliament. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-21 11:04:49
\[SENSITIVE\] Regulatory Impact Statement: April 2022 Working for Families changes Coversheet Purpose of Document Decision sought: Analysis produced for the purpose of informing: final Cabinet decisions Advising agencies: Inland Revenue, Ministry of Social Development, The Treasury, The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet Proposing Ministers: The Minister for Child Poverty Reduction and the Minister for Social Development and Employment Date finalised: 28/10/2021 Problem Definition The Government is reviewing the Working for Families scheme in response to recommendations from the Welfare Expert Advisory Group (WEAG). Phase one of the review has considered a redistributive package of changes through Budget 2022 to provide further support to low-income families and contribute toward the Government’s child poverty reduction targets. Executive Summary Overview of proposals discussed Options for phase one of the WFF review The proposed options for phase one of the Working for Families (WFF) review are discussed in this Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS). These consist of modest-cost options for Budget 2022 that increase and redistribute support to low-income families alongside an anticipated adjustment of family tax credit (FTC) and Best Start tax credit (BSTC) rates in April 2022 in line with CPI inflation. These options are intended to contribute towards the Government’s child poverty reduction targets and the objectives of the WFF review. Related changes outside of the WFF review A proposed remedial adjustment to how Consumer Price Index (CPI) increases are calculated will proceed under the counterfactual and is discussed in this RIS for context and completeness. Increases to Orphan’s Benefit (OB), Unsupported Child’s Benefit (UCB) and Foster Care Allowance (FCA) payment rates as a consequence to a proposed increase in FTC rates are also discussed in this RIS. Income Support Ministers have agreed to these consequential increases. The costs associated with the annual minimum family tax credit (MFTC) threshold change are noted in this RIS for context but the change is not analysed as it has previously been agreed to by Cabinet \[CAB-21-MIN-0116\]. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 \[SENSITIVE\] Background to the WFF review In 2018, the Government established the Welfare Expert Advisory Group (WEAG) to advise them on the future of New Zealand’s social security system, including the WFF scheme. The WEAG recommended fundamental changes to the design and targeting of WFF as well as significant increases to main benefits and the FTC. Following the WEAG’s report, Whakamana Tāngata: Restoring Dignity to Social Security in New Zealand, the Minister for Child Poverty Reduction requested a broader review of WFF. The WFF review is part of the broader Welfare Overhaul work programme. Ministers have agreed the original objectives for WFF \[Cabinet minute (04) 13/4 refers\] remain important. These were to: • make work pay by supporting families with dependent children, so that they are rewarded for their work effort • ensure income adequacy, with a focus on low and middle-income families with dependent children to address issues of poverty, especially child poverty • achieve a social assistance system that supports people into work, by making sure that people get the assistance they are entitled to, when they should, and with delivery that supports them into, and to remain in, employment. Ministers have also agreed the following objectives for the review of WFF: • Objective 1: target support more to lower-income families rather than more universal support • Objective 2: focus on low-income working families, while maintaining support for beneficiary families • Objective 3: help make work pay and assist with the costs for people in work. These objectives cannot all be met at the same time, and Ministers will need to consider the relative balance between the objectives throughout the review. There are two phases to the review: • Phase one will consider modest-cost options for Budget 2022 that increase and redistribute support to low-income families alongside the planned CPI adjustment in April 2022 • Phase two will consider more fundamental changes to WFF payments, with a particular focus on in-work support, and changes to improve administration, operations and client experience. Phase one is the subject of this RIS and canvasses the following options: • Increases to the FTC • Increases to the WFF abatement rate CPI adjustment Under the status quo, FTC and BSTC rates are increased by a corresponding amount once cumulative increases to CPI (since the rates were last increased) reach 5%. This policy is forecast to trigger increases in FTC and BSTC rates for 1 April 2022. All options considered in phase one of the review would be implemented in April 2022, coinciding with the CPI indexation increases to the FTC and BSTC rates. Therefore, the impacts of these options have been modelled both including and excluding the impact of 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 s 9(2)(f)(iv) \[SENSITIVE\] counterfactual indexation to demonstrate what customers will experiences and the real value of the options themselves respectively. CPI remedial A remedial amendment to the way in which CPI increases are calculated for the purposes of indexation is proposed and would apply from 1 January 2021. This remedial would remove the exclusion of increases in the prices of cigarettes and other tobacco products from the calculation of increases in the CPI for the purposes of indexing FTC and BSTC rates and returns the calculation of indexation to increases in CPI all groups. Cabinet only intended the exclusion of cigarettes and other tobacco products for the purposes of indexing social assistance to last until the end of the 2020 calendar year so the impact of this remedial is included in the counterfactual for the purpose of analysing the options for phase one of the WFF review. Modelling the impact of CPI indexation The impacts of each option were modelled using the Treasury’s micro-simulation model (TAWA). 1 Modelling the options was required to inform advice to Ministers before the September 2021 quarter update for CPI was released. 2 Therefore, in advice provided to Ministers all outputs were calculated using a counterfactual based upon the CPI increases forecast in the 2021 Budget Economic and Fiscal Update (BEFU). Thus, all outputs were subject to change. An updated costing for Ministers’ chosen option is used in the Cabinet paper, based on a counterfactual that was calculated using the actual CPI increase for the September 2021 quarter. This updated costing is included below. However, all other outputs in this RIS match those originally provided to Ministers. We note that the actual CPI increase for the September 2021 quarter was materially higher than forecast, which will flow through to the distributional impacts of the policy agreed. FTC rates and WFF abatement rate changes Initially, agencies provided advice to Income Support Minsters on a range of options for changes to the FTC which varied by cost and the approach to abatement. Based on this advice, Ministers chose a set of parameters which were used to develop a final set of four options for them to decide between. These final options are summarised in the following table. Note that, unless otherwise stated, all outputs do not include the impact of CPI indexation. • Options A1 - A3 relate to a $5 FTC increase • Option B relates to a $7.50 FTC increase 1 These TAWA modelling results use data from the IDI, which was provided by Stats NZ under conditions designed to give effect to the security and confidentiality provisions of the Statistics Act 1975. The results are the work of the author, not Stats NZ or individual data suppliers. 2 An increase in FTC & BSTC rates is triggered once cumulative increases to the CPI since the last adjustment of FTC and BSTC rates reaches 5%. Once the 5% threshold has been reached, FTC and BSTC rates will be scheduled to increase from 1 April of the upcoming year. The percentage they are increased by is based on the cumulative actual increase in CPI up until the end of the September quarter after the 5% threshold was reached. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 \[SENSITIVE\] FTC rate and abatement rate options FTC increase per child Abatement rate Annual cost Children lifted from poverty 3 Gains and losses for households Rate change Total with CPI (eldest & subs. child) BHC50 4 AHC50 5 Winners Average gain Losers Average losses A1 ($5 FTC, 25% abmt) $5 $11.71 and $10.42 25% (No change) $158m 5,000 (± 4,000) 9,000 (± 6,000) 316,000 $10 S 6 S A2 ($5 FTC, 26% abmt) $5 $11.71 and $10.42 26% $111m 5,000 (± 4,000) 9,000 (± 6,000) 287,000 $8 26,000 -$1 A3 ($5 FTC, 27% abmt) $5 $11.71 and $10.42 27% $68m 5,000 (± 3,000) 8,000 (± 6,000) 223,000 $8 89,000 -$6 B ($7.50, 28% abmt) $7.50 $14.21 and $12.92 28% $103m 7,000 (± 5,000) 10,000 (± 6,000) 223,000 $12 89,000 -$8 Options A2, A3 and B explore changes to the WFF abatement rate. The WFF abatement rate applies to a family’s in-work tax credit (IWTC) (or CTC 7 ) and FTC entitlements once their annual income surpasses the WFF abatement threshold. The abatement rate determines the rate at which a family’s WFF entitlement is reduced once their income crosses the threshold, i.e. how many cents in each dollar earnt over the threshold a family will lose from their entitlement. Currently, the WFF abatement rate is 25% (25c in each dollar) and the abatement threshold is $42,700. Abatement rate increases reduce the fiscal cost of an FTC rate increase and target support more towards lower-income families. Abatement rate increases meet the WFF review’s objective to “target support more to lower-income families rather than more universal support”. Updated impacts of the final option agreed by Ministers Ministers have chosen to progress option A3 (a weekly increase in FTC rates of $5 and an abatement rate of 27%). The following are the updated modelled outputs of option A3 using a counterfactual calculated with the updated CPI figure. Note that, unless otherwise stated, all outputs for this option do not include the impact of the FTC and BSTC rates increase due to CPI indexation. 3 Note there is significant statistical uncertainty in the child poverty reduction estimates. 4 The percentage of children living in households with less than 50 percent of the median equivalised disposable household income before housing costs are deducted. 5 The percentage of children living in households with less than 50 percent of the median equivalised disposable household income after housing costs are deducted (for the 2017/18 base financial year). 6 S = suppressed due to Statistics NZ confidentiality rules. 7 The Child Tax Credit (CTC) was ‘grandparented’ once it was replaced by the In-Work Tax Credit.

By convention, any FTC increase is passed on to these payments – this is because caregivers are not able to receive the FTC, and the FTC makes a partial contribution towards the costs of raising children. 8 Note there is significant statistical uncertainty in the child poverty reduction estimates. 9 The percentage of children living in households with less than 50 percent of the median equivalised disposable household income before housing costs are deducted. 10 The percentage of children living in households with less than 50 percent of the median equivalised disposable household income after housing costs are deducted (for the 2017/18 base financial year). 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 \[SENSITIVE\] Limitations and Constraints on Analysis The options presented in phase one have been limited by: • The scope of the review and the specific parameters set by Ministers for phase one options • The modest fiscal envelope of the review • The tight timeframes required to make system changes before April 2022 • No public or stakeholder consultation • The desire to minimise design constraints on phase two • Data uncertainty Phase one parameters The proposed changes were prepared within the final parameters set by Ministers, following earlier advice. These parameters were that the options: • have modest increases to the rate of FTC • cost around $50 - $100 million per year • retain a single abatement threshold at the current level of $42,700 • reduce child poverty • minimise the number of losing families, particularly for those with incomes below $100,000 per year. The fiscal envelope There is limited funding available for Budget 2022 due to the tight fiscal environment and prior Government expenditure on support to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ministers originally agreed that any changes to WFF should be broadly within the existing fiscal envelope. Officials provided advice in August 2021 where modelling demonstrated that the level of redistribution required to make income adequacy-focused options fiscally neutral resulted in many of the lowest-income working families being financially disadvantaged. It is also difficult to reduce the costs of WFF increases without high abatement rates which can result in very high effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs), countering the objective of making work pay. To avoid financially disadvantaging low-income working families and creating very high EMTRs, officials provided advice on changes to the FTC to coincide with the scheduled CPI indexation round. Following this advice, Income Support Ministers decided that phase one options would include modest FTC increases costing up to $100m per year. Modelling suggests that medium-cost redistributive options can reduce child poverty.. In addition, when the proposed changes are combined with the scheduled CPI increases, the estimated numbers of recipients who would be worse off are reduced. However, the modest fiscal envelope for phase one still limits the ability of options to reduce child poverty without increases to abatement rates (which result in much higher EMTRs). Tight timeframes Policy development has been constrained by the tight timeframes required to make system changes in time for an April 2022 implementation. To avoid confusion and reduce administrative complexity, all system changes are made prior to January each year to ensure the changes can be incorporated into the annual “rollover” process which calculates WFF entitlements for the coming tax year and issues notices of entitlement to customers. To meet this deadline, Inland Revenue requires Cabinet decisions on policy settings by the end of November 2021. This significantly limits opportunities for analysis 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 \[SENSITIVE\] and consultation, meaning that more substantial, structural changes could not be considered in phase one. No consultation on phase one Ministers have agreed to defer public engagement with the WFF review until April/May 2022. This aligns with the longer development timeframe for the more substantial options canvassed in phase two. The options canvassed in phase one cannot be submitted for consultation as they are budget sensitive. Impact on phase two Options for phase one of the review also need to be considered within the context of the broader review. Options which do not unnecessarily limit the scope for phase two, which will consider more fundamental changes to WFF, are preferred. Data uncertainty These options have been modelled by Treasury’s Tax and Welfare Analysis (TAWA) model. Treasury warns that there are significant uncertainties when estimating future poverty metrics due to the underlying data and economic forecasts. When Inland Revenue modelled the same outputs for quality assurance the following differences appeared. This comparison is based on TAWA outputs using unequivalised family taxable income, and Inland Revenue administrative data. Option Losers (N) Winner (N) average loss per week $ average win per week $ Cost $m A1 N/A 30,000 N/A -1 -2 A2 13,000 15,000 0 -1 -8 A3 18,000 9,000 0 -1 -10 B -1,000 28,000 -2 -1 14 These differences most likely reflect the fact that, unlike Inland Revenue modelling, TAWA modelling assumes full take up and does not take relationship changes into account, leading to an overestimation of the impact of changes on the population. TAWA modelling does not take into account any behavioural changes that may result from the policy changes, such as changes in employment. The MFTC threshold changes were forecast by Inland Revenue’s forecasting team according to their usual annual process, based on the data available. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 s 9(2)(f)(iv) \[SENSITIVE\] Responsible Managers Maraina Hak Policy Lead, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue 28/10/2021 Polly Vowles Manager, Income Support Policy Ministry of Social Development 28/10/2021 Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Panel Assessment & Comment: The Quality Assurance reviewers at Inland Revenue have reviewed Regulatory Impact Statement: April 2022 Working for Families changes and consider that the information and analysis summarised in it partially meets the quality assurance criteria of the Regulatory Impact Statement framework This RIS has been prepared in a constrained timeframe.

Government commitment to improving child poverty In 2018, the Government passed the Child Poverty Reduction Act whose purpose is to help achieve a significant and sustained reduction in child poverty in New Zealand by provisions that: • encourage a focus by government and society on child poverty reduction • facilitate political accountability against published targets • require transparent reporting on levels of child poverty. This Act bound the Government to set: • long-term targets for reducing, over a long-term period (10 financial years), child poverty • intermediate targets that support, over an intermediate period (three financial years), current long-term targets. In line with these requirements, the Government has so far set one set of long-term, 10-year targets and two sets of intermediate, three-year targets to lower the rate of child poverty. These targets, measured against the AHC50 11 and BHC50 12 poverty thresholds, are outlined in the following table. 13 Poverty measure Unit Baseline year (2018) Current rate First three- year target Second three-year target Ten-year target 2017/18 2019/20 2020/2021 2023/2024 2027/28 AHC50 Child poverty rate 22.8% 18.4% 18.8% 15% 10% Number of children in poverty 253,800 210,500 218,000 174,000 ~120,000 BHC50 Child poverty rate 16.5% 13.8% 10.5% 10% 5% Number of children in poverty 183,400 157,800 122,000 116,000 ~60,000 11 The percentage of children living in households with less than 50 percent of the median equivalised disposable household income after housing costs are deducted (for the 2017/18 base financial year). 12 The percentage of children living in households with less than 50 percent of the median equivalised disposable household income before housing costs are deducted. 13 Government has also set targets measured against material hardship but the AHC50 and BHC50 measures are the only ones that will be used in this document for the sake of simplicity and consistency with the modelling of outputs by TAWA. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 \[SENSITIVE\] The Government has a series of mechanisms at its disposal with which it could reduce child poverty to meet its targets and improve income adequacy for low- and middle-income families generally. Examples of these are the minimum wage, rent controls, benefit rates and the WFF scheme. These tools do not necessarily target the same population groups. The introduction of the Families Package in 2018, along with significant recent increases to the minimum wage and benefit rates, have helped the Government towards achieving its targets. The following table outlines child poverty rates since the introduction of the Child Poverty Reduction Act in 2018. Poverty measure Year Rate Annual change in rate Number Annual change in number Total number of children Percent Level sampling error Percentage points Sampling error on the change (000s) Level sampling error (000s) Sampling error on the change (000s) AHC50 2018 22.8 1.9 0.4 2.8 253.8 21.6 6.3 31.0 1,113.3 2019 18.3 1.1 -4.5 2.4 207.7 12.9 -46.1 27.4 1,132.8 2020 18.4 1.3 0.1 1.8 210.5 15.2 2.8 20.0 1,144.2 BHC50 2018 16.5 1.1 2.3 1.6 183.4 12.2 27.1 17.4 1,113.3 2019 13.5 0.9 -2.9 1.7 153.2 10.1 -30.1 19.6 1,132.8 2020 13.8 1.2 0.3 1.5 157.8 13.5 4.5 16.7 1,144.2 The Government recognises the current WFF review as an important opportunity to further reduce child poverty rates. The WFF scheme The WFF scheme has two primary objectives: • to support income adequacy and reduce child poverty • to improve financial incentives for low-income earners to participate in the labour market. It must achieve these objectives at a sustainable cost to government. The scheme was introduced between 2004 and 2007 and has undergone multiple changes under successive governments. Increases to the FTC rates are a particularly useful way to address child poverty and income adequacy as the credit’s eligibility requirements make it well targeted to low- and middle- income families with children, regardless of their work status. Background to the WFF review In 2018, the Government established the WEAG to advise on the future of New Zealand’s social security system, including the WFF scheme. The WEAG recommended fundamental 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 \[SENSITIVE\] changes to the design and targeting of WFF, and significant increases to main benefits and the FTC. Following the WEAG’s report Whakamana Tāngata: Restoring Dignity to Social Security in New Zealand, the Minister for Child Poverty Reduction requested a broader review of WFF. The WFF review is part of the broader Welfare Overhaul work programme. Scope of the WFF review The WFF review will explore whether policy settings can be adapted to better address the scheme’s objectives. Ministers have set the scope of the review to: • Working for Families settings • The Accommodation Supplement • Options for supporting disabled people in work, The impacts of related workstreams, progressing in parallel to the review, will also be considered. Income Support Ministers have agreed the review should focus on: • low-income working families, while maintaining support for beneficiary families • options that target support more to lower-income families rather than more universal support • the principle of making work pay and assisting with the costs for people in work. These objectives have been noted by Cabinet. Cabinet has indicated that the review will be the primary vehicle for achieving the second, three-year child poverty targets. However, making significant improvements via phase one will be challenging given the tight fiscal environment. Review phases Following advice in August 2021, which covered initial options in line with Minister’s objectives for the review, officials have split advice on the review into two phases. These are: • phase one, which will consider modest-cost options for Budget 2022 that increase and redistribute support to low-income families alongside the planned CPI adjustment of FTC and BSTC rates in April 2022 • phase two, which will consider more fundamental changes to WFF payments, with a particular focus on in-work support, and changes to improve administration, operations and client experience. Phase one is the subject of this RIS and includes the following options • increases to the FTC to support income adequacy • WFF abatement rate changes to target assistance more tightly to lower-income families. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) \[SENSITIVE\] The counterfactual In the absence of government changes, the number of children living in poverty is expected to slightly increase. 14 Although benefit and some WFF rates are indexed to inflation (wage growth and the CPI respectively), these maintain the real value of payments over time; i.e., these indexation adjustments lower the likelihood that child poverty rates would increase, rather than actively reduce them. Developments in the wider economy could influence child poverty rates, positively or negatively. However, the only way to ensure that poverty rates reduce is by making changes targeted to achieve this end. The WFF review is a key opportunity to do so. Option to pass on increase to other caregivers (Oranga Tamariki comment) There is also the option to extend the FTC increase to the rates of the OB, UCB and FCA. Increases to the FTC have been applied to the rates of OB, UCB, and FCA in 2005, 2007, and 2018, as caregivers receiving these payments cannot receive the FTC in respect of the same child, and the FTC makes a partial contribution towards the costs of raising children. 14 According to TAWA forecasts. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 \[SENSITIVE\] W h a t i s t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m o r o p p o r t u n i t y? The problem The central issue which phase one of the WFF review seeks to address is the persistence of child poverty and income inadequacy for low- and middle-income families in New Zealand. Although poverty and income inadequacy exist for individuals without children, the scope of this review is limited to families with children. In the year ended June 2020, 207,700 children, 18.4% of the children in New Zealand, were living in AHC50 poverty. 15 This means these children were growing up in families whose annual household equivalised disposable income (HEDI 16 ), after deducting housing costs (AHC), was less than 50% of the median HEDI in New Zealand. 17 If housing costs are not deducted, 157,800 children, 13.8% of children in New Zealand, were living in BHC50 poverty. 18 19 In the same year, 165,400 households, 9% of all households in New Zealand, reported that the adequacy of their income was “not enough” to support their needs. A further 432,600 (24%) reported that their income was “only just enough” to support their needs. 20 Part of the government’s role (as emphasised by the Child Poverty Reduction Act 2018) is to alleviate issues of poverty and income adequacy in society. It does so through various means, but most explicitly by targeting financial transfers to affected groups of the population via the welfare system and the WFF scheme. The fact that poverty, particularly child poverty, and income inadequacy persist demonstrates that these tools have not solved the problem. Although the Government has not committed to eliminating these issues, it has set targets to significantly reduce the number of children in poverty. The stakeholders The primary stakeholders in this issue are the families and children living in poverty or with inadequate income. They have a significant, personal interest in this issue as living in poverty or without income adequacy has the potential to restrict or negatively influence all aspects of their lives. Restricted access to material goods or restricted capacity for social participation can have significant flow on effects to other areas of life such as physical and mental health, educational outcomes and thus work opportunities. In many ways, wider society is also a stakeholder in this issue. The consequences of poverty lead to greater public expenditure, particularly on healthcare and the justice system, as well 15 According to Stats NZ.. 16 HEDI is household total income, net of tax, adjusted to allow comparison of income adequacy between households with different composition. This involves an equivalisation factor that accounts for the number and age of household occupants and economies of scale. TAWA and official child poverty metrics use OECD equivalisation, where HEDI = DI/(1+0.5\*(N\_GTE14-1) + 0.3\*N\_LT14). It is essentially a per-person, disposable income where the first person 14 or older counts as 1 person, subsequent people 14 or older count as 0.5 and each child under 14 years counts as 0.3. 17 According to Stats NZ. 18 According to Stats NZ. 19 Note that the AHC50 poverty measure is fixed-line (the median HEDI is calculated using the 2017/18 base financial year then adjusted for CPI inflation up to the financial year in which poverty is being measured), whereas the BHC50 poverty measure is moving-line (the median HEDI is calculated using the financial year in which poverty is being measured). 20 According to Stats NZ. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 \[SENSITIVE\] as the loss of potential tax revenue. Although increased expenditure on welfare may appear to negatively impact the taxpayer, reductions in poverty rates will lead to savings in other areas. Disproportionally affected groups Māori, Pacific people, people with disabilities and women are overrepresented in low-income earners and evidence indicates these groups are likely to be among the hardest hit by COVID-19 economic impacts. Māori and Pacific women in particular are over-represented in low-wage employment as well as casual, temporary and other forms of insecure employment. COVID-19 has only exacerbated the situation for these groups, who are also more likely to be in industries impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. Women with caring responsibilities, especially sole parents, are also exposed to the adverse effects of economic recessions that can lock in long-term unemployment and poverty (including in-work poverty) and lead to increased rates of child poverty. Changes to the FTC considered in this RIS provide increases to families with the lowest incomes. They are therefore likely to disproportionately benefit Māori, Pacific people and women. Another key consideration is the impact of any solutions specifically on children. Contributing to child poverty reduction is one of the main objectives of the WFF scheme. Better targeting of WFF aims to increase the income adequacy of families in which the most vulnerable children live, and greater work incentives help to provide pathways for families out of poverty. This may include increased opportunities for their children as they move into education and work. Research indicates people who come onto benefits before the age of 20 are more likely to stay on benefit longer. Option to pass on FTC increase to other caregivers population - (Oranga Tamariki comment) There are around 15,000 families caring for around 24,000 children supported by the OB, UCB, and FCA. Around half of caregivers outside of the State care system (6,000 families) are earning less than $43,000. Targeting the problem The eligibility criteria of the WFF tax credits are designed to target support to low- and middle-income families through income thresholds at which entitlements begin to abate. Out of these, the FTC best targets families experiencing poverty and income inadequacy as it is not linked to work or benefit status. The changes to the FTC rate and abatement rate that are considered in this RIS are redistributive options within the WFF scheme. Ministers have indicated that changes to WFF should be a primary lever to help meet child poverty reduction targets. The options are aimed at more effectively targeting WFF payments to support lower income families and to reduce child poverty. An increase in the base FTC rate is most closely aligned to the WFF review’s objective of supporting low income working families, while a change to the abatement rate is more closely aligned to the objective of targeting financial assistance rather than providing more universal support. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 \[SENSITIVE\] W h a t o b j e c t i v e s ar e s o u g h t i n r e l a t i o n t o t he p o l i c y p r o b l e m ? The three primary objectives to be considered for any policy changes to WFF are to: 1. Improve income adequacy for beneficiaries and low-income people 2. Improve financial incentives to work 3. Pay welfare support at a sustainable cost to government These objectives must be considered when evaluating any proposed changes to WFF along with any more specific objectives that are being sought in relation to a particular proposal or set of proposals. 1. Improving income adequacy for beneficiaries and low-income people While recent changes to the welfare system (including the Families Package, the $25 increase to main benefits on 1 April 2020 and the indexation of main benefits to average wage) will help to improve the living standards of low-income people, income adequacy and child poverty issues remain. Any changes to the WFF should have a net positive impact on these issues, particularly as these credits are an important tool with which to meet the Government’s child poverty targets. 2. Improving financial incentives to work Improving financial incentives to work will encourage people who are able to work to seek employment. For most people, paid work is a key means of achieving improved wellbeing. However, financial incentives are only one (and not necessarily the most important) of many factors that influence people’s decisions on whether, or how much, to work. 3. Paying welfare support at a cost that is sustainable to government The Government is required to act and pursue its policy objectives in accordance with the principles of responsible fiscal management as set out in the Public Finance Act 1989, such as managing fiscal risks facing the government, having regard for the impact on present and future generations and ensuring the Crown’s resources are managed effectively and efficiently. Any changes proposed in this RIS must be at a sustainable cost to government, particularly given the current tight fiscal environment following the range of initiatives implemented by the Government in response to COVID-19. The iron triangle These three objectives make up the “iron triangle” of trade-offs inherent to income support. It is generally possible to achieve two of the three objectives for any given policy change, but not all three. The current WFF review Income Support Ministers have agreed, and Cabinet has noted, that the current review of WFF should focus on: • income support for low-income working families, while maintaining support for beneficiary families • targeting support more to lower-income families rather than more universal support • considering the principle of making work pay and assisting with the costs for people in work. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 \[SENSITIVE\] Ministers also agreed, following initial advice, that options for phase one must be modest- cost. Ultimately, Ministers narrowed the fiscal envelope of the final options analysed in this RIS to between $50 -100m. Although these review objectives maintain the original objectives, their focus on targeting and the modest fiscal envelope indicate that objective 3 (to pay welfare support at a sustainable cost to government) is a priority. As phase one’s scope is limited to options which improve income adequacy and child poverty, objective 1 (to improve income adequacy for beneficiaries and low-income people) must also be a priority. Therefore, options have been designed to fulfil objectives 1 and 3, even if that comes at the expense of objective 2 (to improve financial incentives to work). 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 \[SENSITIVE\] Section 2: Deciding upon an option to addres s the policy proble m W h a t s c o p e w i l l o p t i o n s b e c o n s i d e r e d w i t h i n ? Options were presented in two stages: initial and final. Subsequent to the confirmation of the WFF review objectives in April 2021 and the setting of the second set of three-year child poverty targets in June 2021, the scope for initial options was defined as modest-cost options for Budget 2022 that increase and redistribute support to low-income families. After analysing initial advice, Ministers narrowed the scope for final options. The following table summarises the factors considered by Ministers in initial advice and their decisions on the scope for final options. These are discussed in more detail below. Scale of package Approach to abatement Link to criteria Fiscal cost Impacts on child poverty Impacts on work incentives Impacts on future reform Options canvassed in initial advice A range of options for an FTC increase were presented to Ministers ranging from a $5 to $15 per child increase. The options were broadly grouped into low cost ($50-$200m p.a.), and high cost ($200-$400m p.a.). The larger increases to the FTC had greater impacts on child poverty. There were three broad sets of approaches to abatement explored: - Modest two-tier structure - Sharper two-tier structure - One-tier abatement structure Constraints from Ministers for final advice As a result of initial advice, Ministers agreed the following constraints around the scale of the package: - Modest increases to the rates of FTC - Cost around $50 - $100 million per year - reduce child poverty As a result of initial advice, Ministers agreed the following constraints on the approach to abatement: - retain a single abatement threshold at the current level of $42,700 - minimise the number of losing families, particularly for those with incomes below $100,000 per year. Initial advice on options for phase one An initial, broader series of options for phase one was presented to Ministers in the 17 September Working for Families Review: update and options for Budget 2022 report. These options included: • a redistributive package focused on changes to the FTC • and concurrently 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 \[SENSITIVE\] The redistributive package Options for the redistributive package included $5, $7.50, $10 and $15 FTC rate increases combined with a series of abatement rate and threshold options that included the possibility of introducing a second tier of abatement threshold. The details of these options and their outputs (modelled by TAWA) are outlined in the table below. Option FTC increase Children lifted from poverty Two tier abatement approach Single tier abatement approach FTC increase above CPI FTC increase with CPI (eldest & subs. child) BHC50 21 AHC50 22 Second abatement threshold Second abatement rate Abatement threshold Abatement rate Lowest cost ($60- 90m) $5 $11.71 and $10.42 5,000 7,000- 8,000 A $60,000 29% C $42,700 27% $65,000 31% $45,200 29% B $75,000 33% $75,000 35% Lower cost ($130- 170m $7.50 $14.21 and $12.92 7,000- 8,000 11,000 - 12,000 A $60,000 29% C $42,700 27% $65,000 31% $45,200 29% B $75,000 33% $75,000 35% Higher cost ($200- 240m) $10 $16.71 and $15.42 11,000- 13,000 15,000- 16,000 A $60,000 29% C $42,700 27% $65,000 31% $45,200 29% B $75,000 33% $75,000 35% High cost ($360- 400m) $15 $21.71 and $20.42 16,000- 17,000 22,000- 23,000 A $60,000 29% C $42,700 27% $65,000 31% $45,200 29% B $75,000 33% $75,000 35% Ministers were advised that: • The single-tier options redistribute funding from a much broader range of middle- higher income families and have a more modest impact on EMTRs. • The two-tier options redistribute funding from a smaller group of comparatively higher income families, and a significant increase in EMTRs is concentrated within this group. • Some of the impacts on work incentives created by the options in this paper could potentially be mitigated by further changes progressed as part of phase two of the review. However, such options may turn out to be limited if fiscal, operational, or other constraints arise in the intervening period, and some of the more expensive options in this paper may limit ‘headroom’ for further WFF reform. 21 The percentage of children living in households with less than 50 percent of the median equivalised disposable household income before housing costs are deducted. 22 The percentage of children living in households with less than 50 percent of the median equivalised disposable household income after housing costs are deducted (for the 2017/18 base financial year). 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 s 9(2)(f)(iv) \[SENSITIVE\] Options that increase the FTC rate by $10 or $15 and most of the $7.50 increase options have the greatest impact on child poverty but are also relatively higher cost. Ultimately, Ministers ruled these out. Options that change the existing WFF abatement threshold or which introduce a second WFF abatement threshold are more significant structural changes that could pre-empt the work that will take place in phase two. They often resulted in high increases to EMTRs and a significant number of losers. These options were also ruled out by Ministers. Most of the options that were progressed in the Working for Families Review: further advice on options for Budget 2022 (A2, A3 and B) were chosen for their lower fiscal cost, minimal impact on EMTRs and relative simplicity. Although option A1 was outside of the fiscal envelope Ministers outlined for options in this stage of advice, it was included to allow for comparison with an option that did not tighten targeting. Concurrent options The following options were presented to Ministers as part of initial advice alongside the redistributive package. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 s 9(2)(f)(iv) \[SENSITIVE\] Subsequent advice to Ministers on final options for phase one Following the first round of advice, Ministers requested further advice on Budget 2022 options which: • have modest increases to the rate of FTC • cost around $50 - $100 million per year • retain a single abatement threshold at the current level of $42,700 • reduce child poverty • minimise the number of losing families, particularly for those with incomes below $100,000 per year. This commissioning, combined with timing considerations, has limited options to minor increases to the FTC rate and changes to the WFF abatement rate. Phase one will also include the annually required MFTC threshold increase to reflect 2022 increases in benefit rates. The options canvassed for phase one of the review are Budget sensitive, meaning that no stakeholder engagement has taken place (other than with other government agencies). No in-depth review of international literature has taken place in relation to the options in this RIS. This is due to timing constraints and that the options considered consist of simple changes to rates within the existing WFF regime, rather than substantive policy changes. Non regulatory options have not been considered because financial transfers from government need appropriation, which requires legislative authority. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 s 9(2)(f)(iv) \[SENSITIVE\] W h a t c r i t e r i a w i l l b e u s e d t o c o m p a r e f i n a l o p t i o n s to t h e c o u n t e r f a c t u a l? Fiscal cost Ministers prefer options of $100m or less, in line with the modest fiscal envelope available for phase one of the review. This limits the impact of options on the criteria of child poverty and work incentives. Impacts on child poverty These will be measured using fixed line AHC50 23 and BHC50. 24 Options which have greater reductions in the number of children in AHC50 and BHC50 poverty are preferred. Options should not be so tightly targeted that they push more children into poverty or deepen the poverty of those already under the line. Impacts on work incentives The impact of these proposals on financial incentives to work are considered. These will be measured using EMTRs, which are incentives to earn an additional dollar, and participation tax rates (PTRs) which are incentives to enter employment. Ministers have indicated they prefer options that will not significantly increase already high EMTRs. Impacts on future reform Changes should not be so substantial that they limit the scope of options available for Ministers to consider through phase two of the review. Weighting The fiscal cost and child poverty impact criteria will be given the highest weighting as they are prioritised in this phase of the review. Incentives to work will be addressed in phase two of the review. 23 The percentage of children living in households with less than 50 percent of the median equivalised disposable household income after housing costs are deducted (for the 2017/18 base financial year). 24 The percentage of children living in households with less than 50 percent of the median equivalised disposable household income before housing costs are deducted. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 \[SENSITIVE\] W h a t o p t i o n s a r e b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d? The counterfactual Currently, the FTC rates are $113 p/w ($5,878 p/a) per eldest child and $91 p/w ($4,745 p/w) for each additional child. For every dollar of income a family earns above $42,700, they will lose 25c of their annual FTC entitlement. Under the status quo, FTC and BSTC rates are increased by a corresponding amount once cumulative increases to CPI (since the rates were last increased) reach 5%. This is forecast to trigger increases in FTC and BSTC rates for the income year starting 1 April 2022. All options considered in phase one of the review would be effective from 1 April 2022, coinciding with the CPI indexation increases to the FTC and BSTC rates. Therefore, the impact of these options has been modelled both including and excluding the impact of counterfactual indexation to demonstrate what customers will experience and the real value of the options themselves respectively. Because modelling took place ahead of time, officials do not know the final rate of CPI inflation up to April 2022. Therefore, all outputs relating to counterfactual indexation were calculated using the CPI increases forecast in the 2021 BEFU. Thus, all outputs that include the impact of (forecast) counterfactual indexation are subject to change. CPI measure – remedial amendment A CPI remedial amendment, updating the CPI measure used in the FTC and BSTC CPI indexation provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007, will be required. Legislation currently requires FTC and BSTC rates to be increased in line with cumulative increases to all groups of the CPI excluding tobacco and cigarette products (CPIX). However, Cabinet only intended the exclusion of tobacco to last the duration of the 10% annual increases to tobacco excise taxes, the last of which took place in 2020 (CAB-16-MIN-0189). Therefore, the remedial amendment would return FTC and BSTC indexation to CPI (all groups) from quarter 1 of 2021. Although increases measured by CPI (all groups) are slightly different than under CPIX, the remedial amendment is not expected to materially change the fiscal impact of the FTC and BSTC indexation increases. This remedial is considered part of the counterfactual for analysis of the options in phase one of the WFF review. Annual MFTC adjustment The purpose of the MFTC is to ensure that families who are in-work and off-benefit are financially better off than they would be on a benefit. This is done by “topping-up” families’ earned income to a prescribed level (the MFTC threshold) that is higher than what their income could be when on a benefit. This intends to incentivise sole parent families with children to move off-benefit and into greater amounts of paid work. If the MFTC threshold is not adjusted in line with benefit changes, the policy objective would not be met. Therefore, the MFTC threshold should be adjusted to reflect increases to main benefit rates (which are indexed to wage growth) that will take place under the status quo. In April 2021, Cabinet agreed to an April 2022 increase in the MFTC threshold to reflect increases in main benefits \[Cab-21-Min-0116\]. Forecast changes to the MFTC threshold are summarised in the table below. Changes to the FTC rate or WFF abatement rate will not impact the MFTC threshold. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 \[SENSITIVE\] Tax year 1 April 2022 1 April 2023 1 April 2024 1 April 2025 MFTC threshold $32,864 $33,280 $33,644 $34,112 Adjustments to the MFTC threshold are not being considered as part of phase one of the WFF review and are therefore not analysed further. Options A and B The following make up the final options that were presented to Income Support Ministers for phase one of the WFF review: • A1: $5 FTC increase and no abatement change • A2: $5 FTC increase and 26% abatement rate • A3: $5 FTC increase and 27% abatement rate • B: $7.50 FTC increase, 28% abatement rate Each of these options is mutually exclusive but all would take place on top of the indexation changes anticipated in the counterfactual. The impacts of these options are outlined below. All outputs, except the settings (produced by Inland Revenue), have been produced using Treasury’s TAWA model.

As TAWA modelling assumes full take up, results will overestimate the number of families impacted. Some numbers may seem not to correspond due to rounding. 25 The percentage of children living in households with less than 50 percent of the median equivalised disposable household income after housing costs are deducted (for the 2017/18 base financial year). 26 The percentage of children living in households with less than 50 percent of the median equivalised disposable household income before housing costs are deducted. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 \[SENSITIVE\] Scenario Population (,000) with income below the AHC50 poverty threshold Difference (,000) from counterfactual Families 27 Children 28 Families Children CF 323 160 - - A1 320 151 -4 -9 A2 320 151 -4 -9 A3 320 152 -3 -8 B 319 150 -4 -10 Scenario Population (,000) with income below the BHC50 poverty threshold Difference (,000) from counterfactual Families 29 Children 30 Families Children CF 183 92 - - A1 181 87 -3 -5 A2 181 87 -3 -5 A3 181 87 -3 -5 B 179 84 -4 -7 Option B, with its greater weekly increase of $7.50, has the greatest positive impact on child poverty measured by either threshold. When measuring against AHC50, option A3, which combines the smaller increase of $5 with a 2% abatement rate increase, has the smallest positive impact on child poverty. When measuring against BHC50 options A1-3 appear to have the same impact. Fiscal impact The following table breaks down the annual fiscal impact of each option by source. Although the FTC is the only payment rate which would change, the interlinked abatement and eligibility settings of social assistance payments mean these increases have flow-on effects to the accommodation supplement (AS), the IWTC and the IETC. Option Total ($m) AS ($m) FTC ($m) IWTC ($m) IETC ($m) A1 $158 -$3 $143 $20 -$1 A2 $111 -$3 $115 -$1 $0 A3 $68 -$3 $90 -$20 $1 B $103 -$5 $136 -$29 $1 Option A1 has the greatest fiscal cost as, although it consists of the smaller $5 increase, it offsets none of the extra cost with increased targeting (abatement). This means expenditure will be spread higher up the income scale. Option A3 has the smallest cost as it offsets the costs of its payment rate increase with a 2% abatement rate increase, more tightly targeting expenditure. Although option B has the highest payment rate increase of $7.50, the fiscal cost of this is partially offset by the largest abatement rate increase of 3%. 27 Out of the 2,691,000 families in New Zealand. 28 Out of the 1,155,000 children in New Zealand. 29 Out of the 2,691,000 families in New Zealand. 30 Out of the 1,155,000 children in New Zealand. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 \[SENSITIVE\] Winners and losers The following table summarises the average gains and losses and the total winners and losers seen under each option.

The following graphs are divided by their exclusion or inclusion of the impacts of counterfactual indexation and by their income measure in the following order: • Exclusion of counterfactual, by taxable income • Exclusion of counterfactual, by HEDI 31 • Inclusion of counterfactual, by taxable income • Inclusion of counterfactual, by HEDI Graphs excluding the impacts of counterfactual indexation will demonstrate the real value of each option versus doing nothing. Graphs including these impacts will demonstrate what customers will experience if one of these options is introduced alongside indexation in April 2022. Graphs using taxable income band demonstrate the actual income available to families who are experiencing the gains or losses. Graphs using household equivalised disposable income (HEDI) adjust income for household size. This removes anomalies seen in taxable income graphs where greater average gains appear to be received by higher income bands when this is merely a result of larger families receiving greater entitlements to meet their greater needs. 31 HEDI refers to Household Equivalised Disposable Income which is household total income, net of tax, adjusted to allow comparison of income adequacy between households with different composition. This involves an equivalisation factor that accounts for the number and age of household occupants and economies of scale. TAWA and official child poverty metrics use OECD equivalisation, where HEDI = DI/(1+0.5\*(N\_GTE14-1) + 0.3\*N\_LT14). It is essentially a per-person, disposable income where the first person 14 or older counts as 1 person, subsequent people 14 or older count as 0.5 and each child under 14 years counts as 0.3. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 \[SENSITIVE\] Impacts excluding counterfactual indexation, by taxable income Options are in order from A1 on the left to B on the right. A1 is the only option without losers as it is the only option that does not increase targeting through abatement rate increases. However, A1’s greatest weekly increases appear to be in the highest income bands. This may be because families who are receiving the FTC with higher incomes have multiple children, and therefore they would receive the $5 increase per child per week. Option B creates the greatest weekly gains, albeit with the greatest losses. However, the gains are targeted to benefit low-income families, with increases averaging from $11 to $15 p/w in the $0-60k income bands while losses only occur for families earning $60k or more a year. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 \[SENSITIVE\] Impacts excluding counterfactual indexation, by HEDI Measuring by HEDI demonstrates that, despite what the previous graph might imply, option A1 provides the greatest gains ($10 to $11 p/w) to families with the greatest need. However, it still spreads expenditure higher up the income bands than other options as it is not combined with an abatement rate increase. This makes it less effectively targeted than the other options as a smaller proportion of its (much larger) fiscal cost is concentrated towards lifting children out of poverty. However, this less targeted expenditure will still be beneficial to other low- and medium-income families as it will improve their income adequacy. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 \[SENSITIVE\] Impacts including counterfactual indexation, by taxable income When options are combined with counterfactual indexation very few customers experience losses. Similar to the results in the previous graphs, option B produces the largest weekly increases (from $20 to $27 p/w) for families in the bottom income bands ($0-60k) while options A2 and A3 produce lower increases ($18 to $22 p/w for the same bands). Although option B still produces some losers in the >$60k income bands, on average customers in these bands experience increases of $3 to $15. When combined with indexation, option A1 produces average gains of around $20 p/w spread reasonably evenly across income bands. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 Regulatory Impact Statement | 29 \[SENSITIVE\] Impacts including counterfactual indexation, by HEDI As was also demonstrated by the previous HEDI graph, most of the expenditure for each option will be concentrated in families with the greatest need. Although A1 (when combined with indexation) appeared to provide a total average gain of $20 when measured by family taxable income, when measured by HEDI, the first four deciles see average gains of $22 to $25 p/w with $6 to $17 gains in the upper deciles. The targeting of option B also appears tighter when measured by HEDI, with average gains of $23 to $29 pw in the first three deciles and $4 to $16 in the higher deciles. However, this graph does raise concern that option B creates losers in the low- to middle-income deciles of 3, 4 and 5. Work incentive impacts The impact each option would have on a family’s total income has been modelled to assess how the changes affect EMTRs 32 and PTRs 33 at different hours of work for different family types. The three example families are a sole parent, a couple with one earner and a couple with two earners.

The assumptions around rental costs follow the approach used by the WEAG; they assumed the families used were based in Manurewa, South Auckland (Accommodation Supplement Area 1), and that the families were paying rent in the lower quartile. As at September 2021, lower quartile rent for Manurewa is $500 per week. 35 All data in the following table is taken from TAWA excluding PTR’s which are taken from Inland Revenue internal data. 36 Assumes that the primary earner works a fixed amount at 40 hours at $20 per hour, and the second earner earns $20 per hour. 37 Status quo refers to 1 April 2022, post-CPI indexation. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 Regulatory Impact Statement | 31 \[SENSITIVE\] A2 ($5 FTC, 26%) Income gain from work at 0-10 hours $150.22 $134.22 $96.30 10 to 20 hours $99.77 $18.80 $62.07 20 to 40 hours $36.82 $32.73 $102.60 Income change from CF 20 $9.10 $8.84 $5.29 40 $9.10 $7.97 $1.29 Change to EMTRs and/or PTRs This option would minimally increase EMTRs by 1% beyond 40.95 hours of work once $66,956 of net income is exceeded.

This option would increase EMTRs by 1% between 2.25 hours and 56.44 hours of work once $67,157 of net income is exceeded.

This option would increase EMTRs by 3% between 2.25 hours and 53.55 hours of work once $67,366 of net income is exceeded. This option would increase PTRs by around 3% for the second earner entering the workforce. This table demonstrates that the options have minimal or no impacts on work incentives due to the minor nature of their increases to the abatement rate. Option A1 will have no impact on work incentives and options A2, A3 and B will not impact the work incentives for a single earner family working full time on minimum wage. However, options A2, A3 and B will impact families with higher wages and secondary earners in low-income households. They will have a minor (1-3%) impact on the EMTRs of single earner families who cross the abatement threshold (i.e. who earn above minimum wage). They will also impact the participation tax rate of secondary earners who already have very low work incentives, although this impact will also be limited to a 1-3% increase. Overall, the increase in EMTRs is minimal and therefore unlikely to materially impact financial incentives to work. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 Regulatory Impact Statement | 33 \[SENSITIVE\] Cumulative impact of changes However, consideration should be given to the accumulation of abatement rate changes over time. For example, as part of the Families Package changes in 2018, the WFF abatement rate increased from 22.5% to its current 25% setting. When WFF was first introduced (between 2004 and 2007), the abatement rate was 20%. These changes, particularly when considered with the Ministers’ preferred option, represent a significant increase in abatement rate in a relatively short period. Distributional impacts These options are targeted towards low-income families (beneficiary or otherwise) receiving the FTC. Modelling has taken place for their impact on families in different income bands (all positive for those earning <$60k annually 38 ) and children in poverty (all positive) but not for other specific groups such as Māori, women, or those with disabilities. It is likely that there will be a disproportionate impact on Māori when any changes are made within the tax and transfer system because they are over-represented in the benefit system. As at November 2018, Māori made up 15% of the New Zealand population, but 36% of benefit recipients (Welfare Expert Advisory Group 2018 Welfare System: statistics). The impact of the options on other groups may be proportionate to their representation in the target group of low-income families. Inland Revenue cannot model these impacts as it does not collect data on gender, ethnicity, or disability. Time constraints have further limited the ability to access and analyse relevant data that may be held by external sources. Option to pass on FTC increase to other caregivers – distributional impacts (Oranga Tamariki comment) Passing on the FTC increase to the rates of the OB, UCB and FCA would also impact children and Māori - There are around 24,000 children being cared for by around 15,000 caregivers, both inside and outside of the State care system. Over half of children living with caregivers are Māori, and a significant proportion of their caregivers are also Māori. Stakeholder support No stakeholder feedback is available for these options as they are budget sensitive. Previous feedback from the WEAG supports increases to the FTC with a preference for universalism over tight targeting which indicates that they would not be in favour of options which increase abatement rates (options A2, A3 and B). Option to pass on an increase in FTC to other caregiver payments There is also an option to pass on any increases to the FTC to rates of OB, UCB and FCA. There are around 24,000 tamariki being cared for by around 15,000 caregivers, both inside and outside of the State care system. Caregivers who received OB, UCB and FCA do not qualify for FTC for the same child. However, increases to FTC rates have resulted in commensurate increases to the base rates for OB, UCB and FCA in 2005, 2007 and 2018. Most recently OB, UCB and FCA rates were increased in July 2020 by $25 per week, in line with increases to main benefits, to support caregivers against the impacts of COVID-19 and support placement stability. 38 This reflects the impact of the options alone, without including the impact of counterfactual indexation. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 Regulatory Impact Statement | 34 \[SENSITIVE\] Currently rates of OB, UCB and FCA are between $89 and $152 higher than the eldest child rate of FTC. This reflects the higher levels of support provided to caregivers who are caring for children when their parents are unable to, and reflects that caregivers receiving OB, UCB and FCA do not have access to some of the same supplementary assistance as other families, such as the dependent child rate of Accommodation Supplement. The costs associated with passing on the FTC rate increase to other caregiver payments are summarised in the table below.

The narrow scope for final options means all are essentially minor variations on the same changes (an increase in FTC rates and the WFF abatement rate). Consequentially, the differences between options are relatively minor. The minor nature of these differences increases the impact of the statistical uncertainty involved in modelling. This is particularly true of the child poverty impacts. Option B lifts the greatest number of children from poverty: 10,000 when measured against AHC50 which is 1,000 more than the next best option (A1). At an annual cost of $103m, option B also roughly meets the modest fiscal budget set for phase one due to its 3% abatement rate increase, which effectively targets the greatest support to those most in need. However, although option B best fits Ministers’ commissioning and most of their objectives, it has several drawbacks. Compared to the counterfactual, it makes losers of some medium- income families, and of all the options, it has the largest negative impact on EMTRs and PTRs which are already very high. It may also limit the range of options available under phase two of the review due to its 3% increase of the WFF abatement rate. Options A2 and A3 face the same issues to lesser degrees, but with lower child poverty impacts. Option A1 increases support without changing abatement settings. This would lift 9,000 children from AHC50 poverty without creating losers or reducing incentives to work. However, option A1 has the largest annual fiscal cost of $158m and therefore falls outside the fiscal cost parameters set by Ministers. The high fiscal cost may also potentially limit the range of options available under phase two of the review 2r4hxlcklw 2021-11-16 17:10:40 Regulatory Impact Statement | 38 \[SENSITIVE\] W h a t a r e t h e m a r g i n a l c o s t s a n d b e n e f i t s o f t h e o p t i o n?

Inland Revenue will be responsible for the implementation of the proposed changes, and as part of its business-as-usual function. MSD will be responsible for implementing the proposed changes for those who receive their WFF payments from MSD. The new FTC rates and/or WFF abatement thresholds will be used to calculate recipients’ entitlements from 1 April 2022 and will be reflected in the notices of entitlement that Inland Revenue sends to recipients from February as part of the annual ‘rollover’ process H o w w i l l t h e n e w a r r a n g e m e n t s b e mo n i t o red, ev a l u a ted, a n d re v i e wed? The effects of the proposed changes can be monitored using data Inland Revenue currently collects as part of administering WFF. This data includes the number of WFF recipients, the makeup of those families, the amount and type of payments made, and end of year assessment data on under and overpayments. This administrative data provides descriptive information about WFF recipients, and the actual fiscal cost to the Government of the chosen settings.

It received its first reading on 25 June 2020, second reading on 11 March 2021, and the third reading on 23 March 2021 (under urgency). This was followed by Royal assent on 30 March 2021. Page 4 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Land Extending the bright-line test (Sections CB 6A, CZ 39, EL 20, FB 3A, FM 18, FO 10, FO 17, GB 52, GB 53, and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 54C, 54D and 54E of the Tax Administration Act 1994) The bright-line test has been extended from 5 years to 10 years. Background Housing unaffordability is caused by a number of supply and demand-side factors. The extension to the bright-line test is part of the Government’s response to reduce investor demand for property. Decreasing the tax advantage that property investors can receive will reduce the amount investors are prepared to pay for a given house and the number of houses they will buy. The measure is intended to support first home buyers and help lift New Zealand’s home ownership rates. Key features Extended bright-line test (new section CB 6A) The bright-line test, which taxes gains from residential property acquired and sold within a specified timeframe, has been extended from 5 years to 10 years. Income arising under the bright-line test is taxed at a person’s marginal income tax rate. The other policy settings for the bright-line test remain the same, except for the changes to the main home exclusion in section CB 16A and the business premises exclusion in the definition of “residential land”, as outlined further in this special report. Therefore, the following features of the 5-year bright-line test will continue:  The rules that determine when the property is acquired and disposed of, and when the bright-line period is counted from.  The definition of “residential land” covered by the bright-line test includes land that has a dwelling on it, land where the owner has an arrangement to build a dwelling on it, and bare land that may be used for erecting a dwelling under the relevant operative district plan. “Residential land” does not include farmland or land used predominantly as business premises (subject to changes to ensure property used to provide short-stay accommodation is treated as residential land and not excluded as business premises – see below).  The current exclusions and other forms of relief will continue to apply – that is: – the main home will continue to be excluded (subject to changes to ensure the exclusion only applies for the periods the property was used as a main home – see below), Page 5 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 – transfers upon death, and any subsequent disposal by the beneficiary will continue to be exempt, – transfers under a relationship property agreement will continue to be treated as a disposal at cost, so the transferor will not be taxed under the bright-line test on any gain, and – those who receive land under a relationship property agreement will continue to take on the bright-line start date (the date from which the bright-line period is counted) of the transferor.  The main home exclusion is available to properties held in trust. However, people cannot use the main home exclusion for multiple properties held through trusts.  The main home exclusion cannot be used if it has already been used twice in the two year period preceding the date of sale, and also cannot be used by a person, or group of persons, who has a regular pattern of buying and selling their main home.  Residential land withholding tax will apply to taxable bright-line sales by anyone who is an “offshore RLWT person” (defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) – in short, a vendor who is living or established outside New Zealand.  Specific anti-avoidance rules remain, to counter companies and trusts being used to circumvent the bright-line test.  Vendors will continue to be allowed deductions for property subject to the bright-line test according to ordinary tax rules (subject to amended deductions as a result of changes to the main home exclusion – see below).  Losses arising from a sale under the bright-line test will remain ring-fenced so they may only be used to offset taxable gains from other land sales. Application date The extended bright-line test applies if a person has acquired an estate or interest in the land on or after 27 March. Detailed analysis When an estate or interest in land is acquired In a typical land purchase, the purchaser will first acquire an interest in the land when a binding contract to purchase the land is formed (even if some conditions – like getting finance or a building report – still need to be met). There is further discussion of when land is acquired in QB 17/02. 1 1 Available at https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/questions-we-ve-been-asked/2017/qb-1702-income-tax-date- of-acquisition-of-land-and-start-date-for-2 -year-bright-line-test Page 6 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 While the date a person acquires property determines whether the 5-year or 10-year bright- line applies, it should be noted that the 5 or 10-year period is then typically counted from the date the land is transferred to the purchaser (generally the settlement date). Irrevocable offer carve-out The 10-year bright-line test does not apply to property acquired on or after 27 March as a result of an offer made by the purchaser on or before 23 March 2021, provided the offer could not be revoked before 27 March 2021. An irrevocable offer is one that cannot be withdrawn before a certain time. For example, it is common as part of the tender process to sign a tender document that states the person cannot withdraw their offer until 5 working days after the tender has closed. Table 1 outlines some scenarios and whether the 5-year or 10-year bright-line applies. Table 1: Extended bright-line test application date examples Example What bright-line test applies? The following scenarios deal with revocable offers Purchaser offers on 21 March 2021, seller accepts on 24 March. Sale and purchase agreement (ASAP) signed 24 March. 5-year test applies. As above, but the seller accepts the offer and signs the ASAP on 27 March. Extended 10-year test applies. Purchaser offers on 18 March 2021, seller verbally accepts on 24 March, but does not sign ASAP until 27 March. Extended 10-year test applies (for property transactions a verbal contract is not binding, and the purchaser does not have an equitable interest in the property at that point). Purchaser offers on 19 March 2021, seller counter-offers on 24 March, purchaser accepts on 25 March. 5-year test applies. As above, but the purchaser accepts the counter-offer on 27 March. Extended 10-year test applies. The following scenarios deal with irrevocable offers Purchaser submits offer as part of tender process that closes on 22 March 2021. The tender document states that the offer cannot be withdrawn until 28 March. Seller accepts offer on 27 March and ASAP is signed. 5-year test applies. Although the purchaser acquires the land on 27 March and therefore is prima facie subject to the extended test, the carve-out for offers made on or before 23 March applies. Page 7 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Example What bright-line test applies? Purchaser submits an offer as part of a tender process that closes on 16 March 2021. The offer cannot be withdrawn until 22 March. Purchaser does not withdraw the offer, seller accepts on 27 March and ASAP is signed. Extended test applies. The carve-out does not apply because the purchaser was able to revoke their offer before 27 March. The following scenarios deal with conditional offers 2 Purchaser submits an offer subject to a building report on 18 March 2021. The vendor accepts the offer and the ASAP is signed on 24 March. On 2 April, the purchaser informs the vendor that the condition is satisfied and the agreement goes unconditional. 5-year test applies. The purchaser acquired the land when the binding agreement (subject to conditions) was entered into on 24 March, not on 2 April when the conditions were satisfied. As above, except the purchaser and seller agree on a reduced price on 2 April, each signing the change in the agreement. 5-year test applies. The binding agreement was entered into on 24 March, which is before 27 March. Nominees Where a sale and purchase agreement has been entered into before 27 March but the purchaser is “and/or nominee”, then that person must have been nominated before 27 March to remain subject to the 5-year bright-line test, otherwise they will be subject to the 10-year test. This is because the nominee does not obtain an “estate or interest” in the land until they have been nominated as purchaser. Example 1: Trust nominated as purchaser Melissa’s offer on a property is signed and accepted on 26 March 2021. She lists the purchaser as herself “and/or nominee”. She intends for the property to be owned by her family trust, which is yet to be set up. She sets up the family trust and nominates the trustees as the purchaser on 1 April. Because the nomination is made on 1 April (after 26 March) the property is subject to the 10-year bright-line test. 2 The date of acquisition (when the person first acquired an estate or interest in the land) is relevant for determining which bright-line test will apply (the 5-year or the 10-year test). As noted on page 4, in a typical land purchase, the acquisition date is generally when there is a binding agreement between the purchaser and the seller. This includes when the vendor accepts an offer with standard conditions to be satisfied (such as obtaining finance or a building report), not a later date when those conditions are satisfied or settlement occurs. Page 8 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Example 2: Additional purchaser added as nominee James’s offer on a property is signed and accepted on 26 March 2021. He lists the purchaser as himself “and/or nominee”. He intends to purchase the property with his brother Will, but Will wasn’t available to sign the agreement when he put the offer in. James nominates Will as the other owner of the property on 28 March 2021. Because Will is nominated after 26 March 2021, he will be subject to the 10-year bright-line test for his share of the property. James will be subject to the 5-year test for his share. The 5-year bright-line test (section CZ 39) The 5-year bright-line test continues to apply in limited circumstances to residential land acquired on or after:  29 March 2018 but before 27 March 2021,  27 March 2021 as a result of an offer made by the purchaser on or before 23 March 2021, if the offer could not be revoked before 27 March 2021. The income charging provision for the 5-year bright-line test has been shifted from section CB 6A to section CZ 39. The main home exclusion that applies for the purposes of the 5-year test has been shifted from section CB 16A to section CZ 40. Residential land withholding tax (S ection RL 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) and sections 54C–54E of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA)) Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) applies to sales of residential land made by an “offshore RLWT person” if the sale occurs within five years. This is provided for in section RL 1 of the ITA and section 54C of the TAA. With the extension of the bright-line test from five years to ten years, sections RL 1 and 54C have been updated so that RLWT also applies to sales of residential land made within ten years of acquisition (where the 10-year bright-line test is relevant). Section RL 1(2)(a) has been amended to include references to new sections CZ 39 and CZ 40, so that a five-year test is still relevant for properties acquired before the application date of the 10-year test. Section 54E of the TAA provides that the Commissioner is able to issue an RLWT exemption certificate in limited circumstances – including where a seller is in the business of developing land, dividing land into lots, or erecting buildings; and where the property was the seller’s main home. RLWT exemption certificates will continue to be available where a property is used as a main home: Page 9 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021  For properties acquired before 27 March 2021 (or subject to the irrevocable offer carve-out), this is where it was the owner’s main home for more than 50 percent of the bright-line period (new section CZ 40).  For properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021 (excluding where the irrevocable offer carve-out applies), this is where it is used as the owner’s main home for the whole bright-line period, including days within the 12-month buffer that are counted as main home days (provided for in new section CB 16A). Section 54E of the TAA has been amended to refer to both section CB 16A and new section CZ 40 of the ITA (that is, both versions of the main home exclusion). Where RLWT has been withheld, section 54D of the TAA and section RL 6 of the ITA permit a taxpayer to file a form for their land transactions to obtain a refund if too much RLWT has been paid relative to their overall income tax liability for their land transactions. Section 54D has been amended to refer to both CB 16A and new CZ 40. Amendments to the main home exclusion (Sections CB 6A, CB 16A, CZ 40, DB 23C and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) The “main home exclusion” from the bright-line test has been amended so that it no longer applies on an all or nothing basis, but rather applies only for the period the property is actually used as the owner’s main home. A 12-month buffer applies to allow the property to not be used as a main home for up to 12 months without tax implications. Background A person’s main home is not taxed under the bright-line test. Prior to this amendment, a property was either fully in or fully out of the main home exclusion. For example, a person could qualify for the main home exclusion where the property was rented out for some of the time it is owned, provided it was used as the owner’s main home for more than 50 percent of the bright-line period. This all-or-nothing approach made sense in the context of a shorter bright-line period. However, it is not appropriate with a longer bright-line test as much more income could be involved. For example, without any changes to the way the main home exclusion works, a person would not have to pay tax under the bright-line test for a property that was rented out for four years if it was used as the taxpayer’s main home for five years. Key features  The main home exclusion has been amended so that it no longer applies on an all or nothing basis. Instead, it only applies for the period(s) the property is actually used as the taxpayer’s main home. To be within the exclusion, there is still a requirement that the property has been used predominantly (on a floor area basis) as the taxpayer’s main home. Page 10 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021  The legislation provides that a property is excluded from the bright-line test if it is the owner’s main home for the full bright-line period. Days when the property is not used as the main home will be treated as main home days if: – the non-main home days are in a period of non-main home days of 365 days or less (the counted period), and – the counted period is immediately before or after a period where the property is the person’s main home. The effect of this is that there is a 12-month buffer, within which a change of use of a property to or from being the taxpayer’s main home does not need to be accounted for. In other words, the main home exclusion still applies if the property was not used as a main home for periods up to 12 months at a time. If the period that the property was not used as a main home exceeds 12-months, the main home exclusion does not apply.  If the full main home exclusion in new section CB 16A does not apply, the amount the person derives from selling the property is income under section CB 6A. However, if the property has been used as the main home for some of the time it was owned, the legislation provides that the taxpayer is required to pay tax only for periods where the property was not used as their main home, or not counted as their main home. Periods of 12-months or less that are within the buffer discussed above, where the property is not used as a main home, are counted as main home days for the purposes of the calculation. The legislation provides for this as follows: – New section CB 6A(6) provides that if the person has excluded days (that is, main home days) in the bright-line period, the amount of income the person derives from disposing of the land is reduced by reference to the formula in section CB 6A(7). – New section CB 6A(7) provides that the person’s income is reduced by the amount calculated by subtracting the value attributable to the period the property was used as a main home or counted as a main home (that is, the proportion of days the property was used/counted as a main home multiplied by the sale price) from the sale price. This ensures that the taxpayer only has income attributable to the days the property was not their main home (or counted as their main home). – New section DB 23C reduces the deduction the taxpayer can claim for the cost of the property (which includes the acquisition cost and any capital improvements). The deduction is reduced in proportion to the time the property was used (or counted as) as the main home. This ensures the proportion of the cost of the property that is deductible reflects the extent to which the property was not used as the main home (as this is the period in respect of which the gain is taxed). Application date The amended main home exclusion applies to property subject to the 10-year bright-line test, that is, property acquired on or after 27 March 2021. However, it does not apply to Page 11 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 property acquired on or after 27 March 2021 as a result of an offer made by the purchaser on or before 23 March 2021, provided the offer could not be revoked before 27 March 2021. The existing main home exclusion continues to apply for such properties, as well as properties acquired before 27 March 2021. Detailed analysis Main home exclusion (new section CB 16A) The main home exclusion has been amended so that it no longer applies on an all-or- nothing basis in relation to residential land acquired on or after 27 March 2021 (subject to the carve-out for irrevocable offers). The existing main home exclusion continues to apply to properties acquired before 27 March (or after that date but subject to the irrevocable offer carve-out). This has been shifted to new section CZ 40. Table 2 outlines the previous law and the new law. Table 2: Previous law and new law Previous law New law CB 16A: Section CB 6A does not apply to a person who disposes of residential land if, for most of the period \[the bright-line period\], 3 the land has been used predominantly for a dwelling that was the main home for the person... New section CB 16A: Section CB 6A does not apply to a person who disposes of residential land if, for all of the days \[in the bright-line period\], the land has been used predominantly for a dwelling that was the main home for the person... Section YA 1 definition of main home: means, for a person, the one dwelling – (a) That is mainly used as a residence by the person.... Section YA 1 definition of main home: means, for a person, the one dwelling – (a) That is used as a residence by the person... Example 3: Main home exclusion William purchased a property in 2023. He lived in it for five years and rented it for four years before selling it in 2032. William would qualify for the main home exclusion if the current settings for the exclusion were not changed because for most of the bright-line period (that is, more than 50 percent) the house was used as William’s main home. As a result, previous section CB 6A would not apply and William would have no tax to pay (though other aspects of the land sale rules, including the intention test, may still apply). Under the change, the main home exclusion does not apply as it was not William’s main home for the full bright-line period. Instead, William is subject to section CB 6A, but his income is 3 The bright-line period typically starts on the day the property is transferred to the owner and ends on the day the property is sold (when the sale and purchase agreement is entered into – not when the sale is settled). Page 12 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 reduced to reflect the period for which the property was used as his main home (see quantification section below). Example 4: Main home exclusion Erica purchased a property in 2022. She lived in it with a flatmate until she sold it in 2027. Under both the previous and current law, the main home exclusion would apply. This is because for all of the bright-line period the property was used predominantly as Erica’s main home. The “predominantly” test looks at whether, on a floor area basis, the property was used at least 50 percent as the person’s main home. 12-month buffer (new section CB 16A(6)) Despite the requirement that the property must be used as the person’s main home for “all of the days” in the bright-line period, a 12-month buffer applies under which any period of up to 12 months that the property is not used as the person’s main home is counted as a main home period, provided the period is immediately before or after a period during which the property was used as their main home. Therefore, the property will still qualify as the person’s main home if it was vacant or rented out for a period of less than 12 months before or after main home use. This is intended to provide leeway for moving in or out of a property (for example, there may be vacant periods between settlement and moving in, or between moving out and sale). It also covers periods of up to 12 months where the taxpayer is not using the property as their main home (for example, if they rented the property out while overseas and it was no longer their main home for that period). If a period of non-main home use exceeds 12 months, the entire period for which the property was not used as a main home is subject to tax. If the main home exclusion does not apply to take the property completely outside the bright-line test (that is, because there was a non-main home period that exceeded 12 months), any non-main home period exceeding 12 months will need to be taken into account in working out a taxpayer’s income. See quantification section below. Example 5: 12-month buffer does not apply Catherine purchased her home in 2023. She lived in it until she went on her OE from 2025 to 2027. When she returned, she lived in her home again until she sold it in 2030. The 12-month buffer does not apply here as the single period that the property was not used as Catherine’s main home (2025 to 2027) exceeds 12 months. As a result, the main home exclusion does not apply and Catherine must calculate her income under section CB 6A(6) (see quantification section below). Page 13 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Example 6: 12-month buffer applies Gerald purchased his home in January 2022. He did not move in until six months later as he was overseas. He sold the property in 2026. The 12-month buffer applies as the period Gerald was overseas and not using the property as his main home was less than 12 months, and it was immediately followed by a period where Gerald used the property as his main home. Therefore, the main home exclusion applies despite Gerald not actually using the property as his main home for a 6-month period. Example 7: 12-month buffer applies Deb and Greg are retired and live in Dunedin. They acquired the property in March 2022 and sold it in January 2031. Every year they go to Brisbane for 3 months over winter. While they are in Brisbane, they stay in an apartment that they own. Deb and Greg’s Dunedin property is likely to be their main home – as they typically live there, it is likely the home with which they have the greatest connection. When someone has two homes, the particular facts and circumstances need to be considered to determine which one they have the greatest connection with. This would include considering factors such as the extent to which they live in each property, and their family, social, employment and other ties to each of the locations. Regardless, in Deb and Greg’s situation, if the Dunedin property was not considered their main home when they are in Brisbane, the 12-month buffer would apply for the periods they are in Brisbane (as each period is less than 12 months). Therefore, either way the main home exclusion applies and Deb and Greg do not need to pay any tax on the sale. Quantification (new section CB 6A(6)) New section CB 6A(6) applies if a person has used their property as their main home for some but not all of the time it is held. Under section CB 6A(6), the person’s income from the disposal of the property is reduced by the excluded adjustment amount that is the amount calculated under subsection (7): 퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼 푓푓푓푓 퐼퐼퐼퐼 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 퐼퐼푑푑푑푑푑푑 −퐼퐼푒푒퐼퐼푑푑 푒푒푑푑퐼퐼푑푑 푑푑푑푑푎푎푒푒푑푑 푎푎퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼 푎푎 푑푑퐼퐼퐼퐼푒푒퐼퐼푎푎 This formula only needs to be used if the property is used as the person’s main home for some of the time it is owned. If the property is never used as the person’s main home, the person’s income from disposal is simply the amount they derive from disposing of the property. They are not required to apply the formula as it does not impact them. Quantification formula (CB 6A(7) to (11)) The formula for the excluded adjustment amount in section CB 6A(7) is: 퐴퐴푑푑푎푎푒푒푑푑푎푎퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼푎푎 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 푇푇퐼퐼푎푎푑푑푑푑 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 ×푈푈퐼퐼푑푑푑푑푎푎푒푒푑푑푎푎퐼퐼푑푑 푑푑퐼퐼퐼퐼푒푒퐼퐼 푎푎 Page 14 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Adjustment days is the total number of days during the bright-line period where the property was used as a main home. It also includes days that are counted as main home days because the 12-month buffer applies. Total days is the total number of days in the bright-line period. Unadjusted amount is the amount of income the person derived from disposing of the property. The effect of this formula is to evenly apportion the sale proceeds from the property over the period it is held. The amount attributable to the period the property was not used as the taxpayer’s main home then becomes income for tax purposes. There is no option to pay tax based on the actual valuations of the property at the start and end of the period the property was not the taxpayer’s main home. The following examples illustrate how the formula works: Example 8: Apportionment following change of use Everly bought a property for $1 million. It was transferred to her on 13 March 2030. She sold the property on 31 December 2037 for $1.8 million. She lived in the property and it was her main home from 13 March 2030 until 28 June 2035. Everly then rented it out until 31 December 2037. Her income is calculated as follows: Excluded adjustment amount in subsection (7): 1,934 2,851 ×$1.8 million = $1,221,045.25 Under subsection (6): $1.8 million − $1,221,045.25= $578,954.75 Therefore $578,954.75 is Everly’s gross income from the sale. A portion of the acquisition cost needs to be deducted to determine the net amount of income from the sale that is subject to tax (see below). Example 9: Apportionment and the 12-month buffer Shanti bought a property for $700,000. It was transferred to her on 20 May 2025. She lived in it from then until 2027, when she went overseas for nine months. While Shanti was overseas, the property was not her main home. When she returned, she lived in the property until 22 March 2029. Tenants moved in a few weeks later and Shanti rented the property out until 9 November 2033 when she sold it for $1 million. The days in the 9-month period when Shanti went overseas are counted as “main home” days, even though the full main home exclusion does not apply to her because she exceeded the 12- month buffer period when she no longer used the property as her main home (from the day after she moved out (23 March 2029) until the date she sold the property – 9 November 2033). The total number of days between 20 May 2025 and 9 November 2033 (inclusive) is 3,096. Her main home days total 1,403 (between 20 May 2025 and 22 March 2029, inclusive). For the purposes of the formula, total days is 3,096 and adjustment days is 1,403. The unadjusted amount (the amount derived on the sale) is $1 million. Page 15 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Shanti’s bright-line income is calculated as follows: Excluded adjustment amount: 1,403 3,096 ×$1 million=$453,165.37 Gross income from the sale per CB 6A(6): $1 million−$453,165.37=$546,834.63 Shanti’s gross income from the sale is $546,834.63. A portion of Shanti’s acquisition cost needs to be deducted to determine the net amount of income subject to tax (see below). Cost of some residential land reduced (DB 23C) A person can claim a deduction under section DB 23 for the cost of property subject to the bright-line test. Where new section CB 6A(6) applies, new section DB 23C reduces the deduction that can be claimed under section DB 23 as follows: 퐸퐸푒푒퐼퐼푑푑푒푒푑푑퐼퐼푑푑 푑푑푑푑푎푎푒푒푑푑 푎푎퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼 푎푎 푑푑퐼퐼퐼퐼푒푒퐼퐼푎푎= 퐴퐴푑푑푎푎푒푒푑푑푎푎퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼푎푎 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 푎푎퐼퐼푎푎푑푑푑푑 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 ×퐼퐼퐼퐼푑푑푎푎 Adjustment days and total days have the same meaning as in CB 6A. Cost means the cost of the residential land. Example 8 continued: Cost of residential land reduced Continuing with Example 6 (Everly), Everly bought the residential land for $1 million, and it was transferred to her on 13 March 2030. Her total days is 2,851 and her adjustment days is 1,934. Using the formula in section DB 23C(2), Everly’s excluded adjustment amount is: 1,934 2,851 ×$1 million = $678,358.47 Under DB 23C(1), Everly’s deduction for the cost of revenue account property under section DB 23 will be: $1 million−$678,358.47=$321,641.53 Combined impact of sections CB 6A and DB 23C The Income Tax Act 2007 operates on a gross basis and the structure of income charging and deduction provisions in different subparts does not allow for the provision of one single mathematical formula. However, it is possible to mathematically simplify the formula as follows: (푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 퐼퐼푑푑푑푑푑푑 푑푑푓푓푑푑퐼퐼퐼퐼 −퐼퐼퐼퐼푑푑푎푎 퐼퐼푓푓 푎푎ℎ퐼퐼 푑푑푓푓퐼퐼푑푑퐼퐼푓푓푎푎푑푑) × 푎푎퐼퐼푎푎푑푑푑푑 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 −푑푑푑푑푎푎푒푒푑푑 푎푎퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼퐼 푎푎 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 푎푎퐼퐼푎푎푑푑푑푑 푑푑푑푑푑푑푑푑 Page 16 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Example 8 continued: Combined effect of CB 6A and DB 23C Continuing with Example 6 (Everly), Everly’s income under section CB 6A is $578,954.75 and her deduction for the cost of revenue account property under section DB 23 (and DB 23C) is $321,641.53. Her net income from the sale is therefore: $578,954.75 −$321,641.53=$257,313.22 Everly would therefore pay tax at her marginal rate on $257,313.22. Alternatively, using the mathematically simplified formula from above and the original information from Example 6: ($1,800,000−$1,000,000) × 2,851−1,934 2,851 =$800,000 × 917 2,851 =$257,313.22 Treatment of short-stay accommodation (Section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) The “business premises exclusion” from the definition of “residential land” has been amended to ensure that residential property used to provide short-stay accommodation, where the accommodation is provided in a dwelling that is not the owner’s main home, is subject to the bright-line test. The amendment also ensures short-stay accommodation is subject to the residential rental deduction ring-fencing rules in subpart EL of the Act. Background The bright-line test and residential rental deduction ring-fencing rules apply to “residential land” as defined in section YA 1. The previous definition of “residential land” had a carve out for land used predominately as business premises. Because there was no qualification to this carve out, residential property used to provide short-stay accommodation via predominantly digital platforms as part of the sharing economy was potentially able to qualify for the business premises exclusion and therefore be out of scope of the bright-line test and residential rental deduction ring-fencing rules. This was not intended. Key features Bright-line changes (paragraph (b) of the definition of “residential land”) The definition of “residential land” has been amended to include land with a dwelling on it if it is used predominantly for a business of supplying accommodation and the dwelling is not the main home of the owner. Page 17 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 This is intended to ensure the bright-line test applies to short-stay accommodation properties (including a property that is rented out as part of the sharing economy on digital platforms, or a bach that is sometimes rented out when the owner does not use it) unless it is an accommodation facility that is also the owner’s main home and they rent out rooms for short-stay accommodation such as a bed and breakfast. This ensures that the treatment is the same between a person who rents out a property on a long-term basis (that is, has tenants) and a person who rents out a property on a short-term basis – that is, both are subject to the bright-line test. The carve-out for bed and breakfast type properties that are the owner’s main home ensure they are treated the same as a homeowner who rents spare rooms to flatmates – that is, neither are subject to the bright-line test. This is necessary because in a bed and breakfast situation the property may not be used predominantly as the owner’s main home. Residential rental deduction ring-fencing (paragraph (b) of the definition of “residential land”) The amendment to the definition of “residential land” discussed above also ensures that residential properties used to provide short-stay accommodation are subject to the residential rental deduction ring-fencing rules. Hotels, motels and other commercial accommodation Hotels, motels and other similar commercial accommodation are not “residential land” and are therefore not subject to the bright-line test or the residential rental deduction ring- fencing rules. This is because they are specifically excluded from the definition of “dwelling” in the Income Tax Act. Page 18 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Feasibility expenditure (S ections CH 13, DB 66 and DB 67 of the Income Tax Act 2007) The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021 contains changes codifying when businesses can deduct expenditure over five years related to completing, creating or acquiring property (business assets) that is later abandoned. Immediate deductions are also available for such expenditure that in total is $10,000 or less in an income year. Together, the changes are intended to set out the circumstances when expenditure can be deducted for property that but for abandonment would have been depreciable property or revenue account property. The rules complement the current tax depreciation rules in situations when property is abandoned and not completed. Deductions for expenditure in relation to abandoned property are clawed back as taxable income if the property is subsequently completed, created or acquired. This effectively puts a taxpayer in the position that they would have been in if they had never abandoned the property. Taxpayers may be able to obtain certainty on the tax treatment of feasibility expenditure (including for abandoned and completed property) incurred in particular arrangements by applying for a ruling from Inland Revenue’s Tax Counsel Office. Background From a policy perspective, the economic value of business expenditure that is expected to decline in value should be either immediately deductible or, when it provides an enduring benefit, deductible over time if that benefit declines over time. When the tax system does not provide for that treatment, an economic distortion is created. An example of this distortion arises with feasibility expenditure incurred by taxpayers to determine the practicability of a proposal to acquire or create property that will decline in value over time. The Income Tax Act 2007 generally denies immediate deductions for expenditure when it has a connection with property that has the potential to yield future economic benefits beyond the current income year. If the expenditure is required to be capitalised and the property is not completed, the expenditure is not recognised for tax depreciation purposes and is unable to be deducted for tax purposes, resulting in what is referred to as “black hole” expenditure. This creates an incentive for businesses to complete capital projects that would otherwise be abandoned. The non-deductibility of this expenditure effectively raises the cost of risky investments in new property (where the chance of a viable outcome is uncertain) and therefore can act as a barrier to businesses committing resources to developing new property – which is important to innovation and driving productivity improvements. Page 19 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 The new rules are intended to sit alongside the Income Tax Act’s rules for tax depreciation and Inland Revenue’s interpretation statement IS 17/01 4 for businesses that regularly incur feasibility expenditure. The amendments respond to private sector concerns following the 2016 decision by the Supreme Court in Trustpower Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue, 5 which limited the deductibility of expenditure incurred on property that is subsequently abandoned. The rules reduce tax barriers for businesses seeking to invest in new property, by providing greater deductibility of expenditure where it relates to property that is abandoned. The amendments do not give tax deductions for expenditure related to property that is not expected to decline in value, such as land, goodwill and shares. While property that is not expected to decline in value sometimes does, it would only be appropriate to provide deductions for this expenditure if the tax system taxed gains in property that appreciated. The amendments do not alter the rules that exist for:  tax depreciation (although the rules do allow immediate deductions in some circumstances if the expenditure is less than $10,000 – this is explained in more detail below)  company administration costs  costs incurred in the course of abandoning property  research and development  resource consents  unsuccessful software projects  patents  plant variety rights. The amendments also do not affect the application and effect of the general permission test relating to deductions. This is explained in more detail below under ‘Detailed analysis’. Key features Section DB 66 allows taxpayers to deduct expenditure incurred in relation to making progress towards completing, creating or acquiring property if:  the property would be: o depreciable property, including depreciable intangible property, or o revenue account property 4 Interpretation statement IS17/01: Deductibility of feasibility expenditure. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 3 (April 2017) available at https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/tib/volume-29---2017/download-tib-vol29-no3 5 SC 74/2015 \[2016\] NZSC 91. Page 20 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021  progress on the property is abandoned with the outcome that the property is not completed, created or acquired, and  no deduction for the expenditure is allowed under any other provision in the Act. The deduction does not apply to expenditure on certain items, such as land, shares and goodwill. Deductions meeting the conditions above can be spread in equal proportions over a five- year period starting in the income year the property was abandoned (section DB 66(2)). However, there is no entitlement to any remaining portions of the deduction if the abandoned property is completed, created or acquired within the five-year spreading period. Section DB 67 allows an immediate deduction in the income year for expenditure incurred in relation to making progress towards completing, creating or acquiring property if the total expenditure incurred in an income year that could be subject to this provision is $10,000 or less and:  the expenditure is related to depreciable property or revenue account property, and  no deduction for the expenditure is allowed under any other provision in the Act. As is the case with section DB 66, new section DB 67 does not allow a deduction for certain items, such as land, shares or goodwill. Given that section DB 67 allows immediate deductions if the expenditure is less than $10,000 (even if the property has not been abandoned), this rule will in some circumstances override the general depreciation rules. This is explained in more detail below under ‘Detailed analysis’. The expenditure under both sections must be incurred in relation to making progress towards completing, creating or acquiring the property. The amount of the available deduction is equal to the expenditure the taxpayer incurs related to making progress towards completing, creating, or acquiring property. For abandoned property that is later completed, created or acquired, new section CH 13 claws back the deductions allowed under section DB 66 by treating the amount deducted as income. The property may then be subject to the tax depreciation rules in subpart EE, or the revenue account property rules in section DB 23. New sections DB 66 and DB 67 override the limitation for expenditure of a capital nature. Application date The amendments apply to qualifying expenditure incurred in the 2020−21 and later income years. Page 21 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Detailed analysis Spread deduction rule for feasibility expenditure New section DB 66 is directed at expenditure incurred by taxpayers in relation to making progress towards completing, creating or acquiring property that is subsequently abandoned. The term “property” is defined by reference to property that if completed would be depreciable property, including certain types of intangible property, and/or revenue account property. Progress will, generally, be considered to be abandoned when a decision has been made that no further progress will be undertaken to complete, create or acquire the property. For larger projects, such a decision will likely be documented by the taxpayer. However, for small businesses a decision to not proceed with the property may be reflected in that no further money has been applied to completing, creating or acquiring the property. The available deduction is equal to the expenditure the taxpayer has incurred in relation to the abandoned property, which is not otherwise deductible under any other provisions of the Act. The intention is to permit a broad range of expenditures to be deducted, including direct costs that would ordinarily be co nsidered to be the “cost” of depreciable or revenue account property, and expenses that have an indirect relationship with the property, such as administration or general overhead costs. A deduction is not available for expenditure on acquiring property such as land, shares and goodwill in the course of developing another asset that is abandoned. This is because expenditure on such items is not typically associated with feasibility type activity but could potentially otherwise fall within the broad wording of the feasibility rules. Deductions for the expenditure are spread in equal proportions (one-fifth) over a five-year period, starting in the year of abandonment. However, as discussed below, there is no entitlement to any remaining portions of the deduction if the abandoned property is subsequently completed, created or acquired before the five-year spreading period has expired. Example 10: When the new sections apply – wind studies Company A, an electricity generator, is exploring the practicability of establishing a new wind farm. It incurs expenditure in the 2020–21 income year associated with measuring wind frequency and speeds (anemology) relevant to the local geography. At the end of the 2021–22 income year, the studies regarding the site are inconclusive as to reliability of wind supply and the project is abandoned. Tax impact The anemology expenditure relates to the possibility of expanding the capital structure of the business and, as such, is capital expenditure. Regardless of whether or not this expenditure would have been included in the cost of the property for depreciation purposes had the property been completed, created or acquired, it will be deductible under section DB 66 to the extent that it does not relate to land or other property that is not depreciable property or Page 22 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 revenue account property. This is because the expenditure was incurred after section DB 66 came into effect and made progress towards creating or completing property that, if it were created or completed, would have been depreciable property (wind turbines). The relevant expenditure will be deductible in equal parts over five years. Example 11: When the new sections apply – nanotechnology study Company B, a water management company, is working on ways to meet demand in times of low-aquifer inflows and drought, to prevent water restrictions. It is exploring the viability of desalination. The company carries out a number of studies on the practicability of building and operating a desalination plant, and researches how water from the plant could be connected to the wider network. Work on the project is abandoned after an assessment determines it is uneconomic, in terms of energy needs and water output, for the plant to meet forecast demand. The project is shelved pending future advances in desalination nanotechnology. Tax impact Under section DB 66, the collective desalination study expenditure will be deductible as the expenditure was incurred in relation to making progress towards creating property that, if it were completed, would have been depreciable property (water treatment plant and reservoir). The expenditure will be deductible in equal parts over five years. Example 12: When the new sections apply – design property rights Company C, an aeronautics company, has plans to redesign the cockpit and airframe canopy for a model of small single propeller aircraft. The redesign is intended to improve flight performance and pilot visibility for such purposes as aerial crop dusting. The company incurs expenditure in costing the project and scoping initial airframe designs. The multi-year project is shelved when a competing overseas company brings a comparable (and cheaper) improved aircraft to the market. Tax impact The design expenditure would be deductible under section DB 66 except to the extent the expenditure is deductible under another provision (for example, if some of the design expenditure resulted in depreciable intangible property). Example 13: When the new rules will not apply – acquisition of shares Company D is seeking to diversify the range of products it provides to commercial clients. It initially considers either directly acquiring the products or acquiring the shares in another firm that is offering comparable products. However, a decision is made to explore acquiring the shares in the firm in order to retain the firm’s existing staff, management and the client list built up by the firm. Company D subsequently incurs legal and other consulting expenditure in undertaking a due diligence of the firm. However, Company D’s bid to acquire the firm is unsuccessful. Page 23 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Tax impact The expenditure connected with Company D acquiring the shares in the firm is not deductible under section DB 66 as it relates to the acquisition of shares (which are specifically excluded from the scope of section DB 66 as excepted financial arrangements). Example 14: When the deduction starts The finance team at Company E is considering the expenditure debited in its work in progress account after balance date for the 2020–21 income year. The expenditure includes a study directed at improving the energy efficiency of the company’s plant. The finance team decides not to make any further progress on the energy efficiency work due to cash flow constraints. The abandoned work related to a potential refit of the company’s premises for lighting and heating. Had the work been completed, the completed property would have been depreciable property (fitout). No further amounts had been spent on the project after balance date and the decision is made in 2021–22 income year to abandon the project. Tax impact The expenditure would be deductible under section DB 66 given its relationship with depreciable property. A deduction of one-fifth of the expenditure can be made in the 2022 income tax return, being when a decision was made to make no further progress on the property, with the remaining deductions spread evenly over the next four years. Application of general permission The new rules override the capital limitation, but not the general permission requirements. The general permission requires that the expenditure must have a connection to an existing business or income-earning process of the taxpayer in order to be deductible under the rules. In situations where the expenditure is incurred before any decision is made to enter into the business or income-earning activity, the expenditure will have been incurred too soon and will not be deductible. Similarly, where a business already exists, feasibility expenditure incurred in relation to a new business will still need to have sufficient nexus to the existing business. However, feasibility expenditure that is recurrent and incurred as part of the ordinary income-earning process of a business is likely to be deductible under the new provisions (if not already deductible under existing law in line with the principles in Inland Revenue interpretation statement IS 17/01: Income tax – Deductibility of feasibility expenditure). The correct time for considering whether the expenditure satisfies the general permission is when the expenditure is incurred, not when the relevant property is abandoned. Example 15: Expenditure does not satisfy the general permission After being made redundant from her job as an architect, Willow decides to investigate starting her own architecture business. She spends $3,000 on market research, a consultant to put together a business plan, brochures and contacts former clients to compile a client database. Page 24 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Tax impact The expenditure incurred by Willow is not deductible under section DB 66 because it does not satisfy the general permission. The expenditure is merely preliminary to establishing a business or income-earning activity. At the time of incurring the expenditure, a business had not yet commenced. Example 16: Expenditure does not satisfy the general permission Company F, an operator of a coal mine, is considering becoming involved in a project to construct an aluminium smelter to which it can supply coal. Company F forms a consortium with two other companies and conducts a feasibility study to determine the construction and operating costs and to assess the environmental consequences of building and operating an aluminium smelter. The company also undertakes its own feasibility study of the project and engages various consultants to advise on matters such as industrial relations, finance, environmental issues and negotiating a joint venture agreement. However, the development does not proceed because the other two consortium participants withdraw from the project. Tax impact The feasibility expenditure incurred by Company F is not deductible under section DB 66 because it does not satisfy the general permission. No nexus exists between Company F’s existing business and the smelter feasibility expenditure. The latter was incurred in creating a new business structure. Apportionment Expenditure will be deductible under the rules only to the extent that it is connected with making progress towards depreciable or revenue account property. Where an amount of expenditure relates to a mixture of, for example, depreciable and non-depreciable property, then only a portion of the expenditure will qualify for a deduction under the rules. The legislation does not specify a particular approach or methodology for how expenditure needs to be apportioned in these circumstances. This provides some flexibility to taxpayers in how they approach the apportionment exercise. Any fair and reasonable method of apportionment may be used. Whether an apportionment is fair and reasonable will depend on the relevant facts and circumstances related to the expenditure. It is not necessary that the apportionment method applied be the most accurate, but it must reflect what an objective person would consider to be fair and reasonable in the circumstances. The method should reflect the contribution of the expenditure towards the relevant item of property. A method that could be considered fair and reasonable in some instances may be one based on estimates by qualified professionals of the values of respective in-scope and out-of-scope property at the time the property was abandoned. There may equally be other methods that can be applied that will provide a fair and reasonable apportionment. Page 25 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Records that taxpayers would be expected to hold in support of their chosen apportionment method would include (but are not necessarily limited to) the following:  Any records detailing what their plan was, in terms of what property they were looking to complete, create or acquire.  Details of categories of expenditures that can be directly attributed to depreciable property, revenue account property, or property that is excluded from the scope of section DB 66.  Categories of expenditures that relate to both depreciable property/revenue account property and property that is excluded from the scope of section DB 66. The Inland Revenue interpretation statement IS 17/01: Income tax – Deductibility of feasibility expenditure notes that expenditure that is not directed towards a specific project or which is so preliminary as to not be tangibly progressing or materially advancing such a project will be on revenue account and therefore immediately deductible if the business regularly carries out feasibility studies. This being the case, it is expected that, by the time that tangible progress has been made on a specific capital project, the taxpayer will likely have a better understanding of the share of remaining costs between depreciable property and revenue account property, and property that is specifically excluded. Example 17: Deduction needs to be apportioned Company G, a manufacturer of various cleaning products, is seeking to acquire the intellectual property for an outdoor cleaning product produced by a competitor that is going out of business, along with any remaining stock of that product. After engaging a law firm to provide legal advice on the transaction, Company G makes an offer of $10 million for the intellectual property, including brand rights and the formulation or “recipe” for the product, and an additional $5 million for the remaining trading stock. However, Company G’s offer is rejected as the manufacturer of the product receives a higher offer from a different competitor. Company G paid $33,000 for the legal fees. Tax impact A deduction for the legal fees is not available under section DB 62 (deduction for legal expenses) because the total amount of the expenditure on legal fees in the income year exceeds $10,000. Company G considers that a fair and reasonable allocation approach would result in a deduction of $11,000 (33 percent of the $33,000 it paid on legal fees related to the transaction) under section DB 66. This apportionment method is fair and reasonable in the circumstances because a third of the value of the transaction, had it been successful, would have been in relation to revenue account property. A deduction is not allowed under section DB 66 to the extent that the expenditure relates to acquiring property that is not depreciable or revenue account property, such as intellectual property that is not fixed life intangible property. An alternative apportionment methodology could be chosen by Company G if it was also fair and reasonable. Page 26 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Example 18: Company unsure whether it would have bought shares or underlying business assets Company H is considering purchasing either the shares in a competitor company or the underlying business assets of the company, 40% of the value of which comprises depreciable property and revenue account property. Company H incurs due diligence expenditure totalling $55,000 before committing to a decision as to whether to buy the shares or the underlying assets. Based on the information gathered from the due diligence exercise, Company H determines that the respective prices the vendor is asking for the shares and for just the business assets are both too high, and so decides during the 2020–21 income year not to proceed with either option. Tax impact As Company H does not know whether it would have purchased the shares or the assets at the time it incurred the due diligence expenditure, a fair and reasonable apportionment method could involve 50% of the expenditure potentially within scope of section DB 66. This proportion is further reduced by 40% to reflect the proportion of assets within scope of the rules (that is, depreciable and revenue account property) to those outside the scope of the rules. As a result, Company H claims $11,000 ($55,000 × 50% × 40%) of expenditure under section DB 66 over a five-year period, commencing in the 2020–21 income year. An alternative apportionment methodology could be chosen by Company H if it was also fair and reasonable. Partial abandonment It is possible that a capital project may produce a number of distinct items of property that together achieve the overall objective of the project. In the process of developing the overall project, it is possible that some smaller items of property may be considered and abandoned even though the project as a whole is completed. Guidance on how to identify the relevant property can be found in Interpretation Statement IS 12/03: Deductibility of Repairs and Maintenance – General Principles. If the costs that were incurred in exploring the viability of the abandoned property cannot be capitalised to the cost of depreciable or revenue account property resulting from the project and are otherwise not deductible, a deduction for the expenditure relating to the abandoned option may be available under section DB 66. As discussed above under ‘Apportionment’, any deduction would be limited to the extent the expenditure relates to depreciable property or revenue account property, had it been completed. Page 27 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Example 19: Partial abandonment Company I needs to add a line to its network to transport power from Point A to Point F. The company incurs expenditure in investigating three different potential routes for the power line (A to B to F; A to C to D to F; A to E to F). The expenditure includes resource consent costs and legal fees of more than $10,000 for negotiations with landowners to acquire access rights to the land on the alternative routes via points B, C, D and E. As a result of its investigations, Company I decides to proceed with a route from A to E to F and the two alternative routes (from A to B to F and from A to C to D to F) are abandoned. Tax impact Company I cannot take a deduction under section DB 66 for the resource consent costs. This is because a deduction for the resource consent costs is already available under section DB 19. Whether or not a deduction can be taken under section DB 66 for the legal fees relating to negotiations with landowners will depend on whether the access rights would have been fixed life intangible property and therefore depreciable property. If the access rights would have been fixed life intangible property if acquired and no deduction is otherwise available, Company I is entitled to a deduction under section DB 66 for the legal fees. Otherwise, a deduction is not allowed. Immediate deduction for feasibility expenditure Section DB 67 works in a similar way to section DB 66, with modifications to reflect that section DB 67 is a compliance cost saving measure. That is, feasibility expenditure can be immediately deducted by the taxpayer if the total expenditure incurred is $10,000 or less in an income year. There is no requirement that the property be abandoned. However, like the requirements of section DB 66, the expenditure must satisfy the general permission provisions and not be deductible elsewhere under the Act. Section DB 67 is not a replacement for tax depreciation for low-value assets. This means that a person who acquires an item of depreciable property must apply the depreciation rules from the year the property is actually acquired. A deduction for the cost of the property is not available under section DB 67 in this situation. If the person had incurred expenditure in merely looking into purchasing the property, or started to make or construct the property but did not complete it within the income year so that it could then be depreciated, then a deduction for the expenditure would be available under section DB 67. In this situation, if the property is completed (resulting in an item of depreciable property), then any expenditure relating to the property that has previously been deducted under section DB 67 is excluded from the cost of the completed property for tax depreciation purposes. Page 28 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Example 20: When the deduction cannot be immediately claimed – depreciable property Retailer J acquires a secondhand vehicle to assist with deliveries. The vehicle and associated expenditure incurred during the income year totals $8,000. Tax impact The cost of the vehicle is not deductible under section DB 67 as the cost of the vehicle is deductible under the tax depreciation rules. Only one deduction is allowed for the relevant expenditure Once a deduction is claimed under section DB 66 or section DB 67, no further income tax deduction is available for this expenditure. This is a function of the income tax rules, which do not allow more than one deduction for the same item of expenditure. However, if expenditure has been effectively denied by the application of the clawback in section CH 13 (discussed below), it is intended that the expenditure may be subsequently deductible if it otherwise satisfies the requirements to be part of the cost of depreciable or revenue account property. Clawback of deductions The feasibility expenditure rules include an integrity measure (referred to as the “clawback”) that applies where previously abandoned property is subsequently created, acquired or completed. The clawback is directed at situations where taxpayers may be incentivised to prematurely abandon work on property. For example, property may be partially abandoned to take advantage of the five-year deduction if this would accelerate the deductions that would have been allowed had the property been completed and depreciated. A further example is where the deductions under the feasibility rules would be greater than would otherwise be available under the tax depreciation rules if the property was completed. The clawback applies in the income year that the abandoned property is completed, created or acquired. This also applies in the situation where the taxpayer subsequently acquires property that is similar to the abandoned property. The effect of this measure is to put taxpayers into a similar tax position to where they would have been had they never abandoned the property. The clawback in new section CH 13 deems an amount of income equivalent to the deductions previously taken under section DB 66 in relation to the property. The requirement to include as income amounts that were previously deducted does not apply to expenditure that has been immediately deducted under the $10,000 de minimis rule. To minimise compliance costs and provide greater certainty to taxpayers, a seven-year time limit applies to the clawback. The seven-year time limit aligns with the general business record retention requirements in the Tax Administration Act 1994, starting in the year Page 29 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 immediately following the income year for which the fifth and final deduction was taken under the rules. This means that the deductions are not clawed back if abandoned property is subsequently created or completed more than seven years after the income year to which the last deduction relates, or if the property or similar property is acquired more than seven years after that income year. Example 21: Previous deduction clawed back Company K, an electricity generator, regularly undertakes studies to determine the practicability of different power generating options. Following the initial study process many of the options will be shelved. However, some of these options may be reconsidered in the future and result in the creation of electricity generation assets. One of these studies involves the creation of a wind farm in Gusty Hills, with work on the project abandoned in Year 1. Prior to abandonment, $10 million was expended on various fees. The $10 million incurred by Company K is deductible over a five-year period, starting in the year the project is abandoned. This results in equal deductions to Company K of $2 million in Years 1 to 5. In Year 7 Company K decides to reinstate the wind farm project in Gusty Hills, with the property being completed in Year 9 using the information from the previous studies. Tax impact The clawback provision is triggered in the year that the relevant property is subsequently created, acquired or completed, being Year 9. In this case, the property was completed within seven years from the final year of deduction (that is, Year 5) under section DB 66. This means that Company K is required to return clawback income of $10 million in its Year 9 tax return. However, some of this expenditure may be deductible if it forms part of the cost base of depreciable property. Example 22: Previous deduction not clawed back – example 11 continued A decade after Company B’s decision not to proceed with a desalination plant, population growth in the region and the need for greater water infrastructure has led Company B to restart its earlier work on nanotechnology. Development of the plant and reservoir begins and seven years later it is operational and connected to the wider water supply network. Tax impact The earlier deduction taken for the previous study is not clawed back as the property is completed more than seven years after the end of the income year in which the final deduction was taken under section DB 66. Abandoned property subsequently created, acquired or completed In order to apply the clawback, taxpayers need to identify and monitor whether any property subsequently arises from the expenditure that has been deducted under section DB 66. Page 30 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 In many situations a taxpayer will simultaneously abandon work on multiple items that, if completed, acquired or created, would have been depreciable or revenue account property. This may be due to the abandonment of all or part of a project being undertaken by the taxpayer. In determining whether the clawback applies, the rules require an analysis of each separate piece of property that is subsequently created, completed or acquired. In other words, the relevant assessment is not in relation to the wider project, but to individual items of depreciable or revenue account property for which a deduction was allowed under section DB 66. This will require an understanding of what property the expenditure relates to, which is an exercise that is likely to have been undertaken as part of the process of claiming a deduction under section DB 66 (for instance, in claiming a deduction there needs to be an apportionment between depreciable/revenue account property and other property). It is possible that expenditure could relate to multiple potential items of depreciable or revenue account property, of which only some is subsequently created, acquired or completed. In this case, it will be necessary to make an apportionment of this expenditure on a fair and reasonable basis for the purpose of applying the clawback. Example 23: Restart of hotel development Company L is constructing a hotel on the Auckland waterfront as part of a larger development that includes residential apartments and retail space. Progress on the project stopped and was put on hold indefinitely in 2021 because overseas tourists stopped coming into the country. However, work on the hotel resumes in 2023 (but not the rest of the development) as international travel picks up again, with completion of the hotel in 2025. The design of the hotel is modified from its original design and includes a gym and larger swimming pool. However, the hotel is located on the same site and serves the same purpose (hotel accommodation) as was originally planned. The previously abandoned property was simply finished off (with some adjustments) when the project restarted. Tax impact Although there are some differences between the completed hotel and the original construction plans for it, the property is based on the original design, performs the same function and is in the same location and as such is considered to be the completion of the abandoned property. Section CH 13 will apply to claw back any expenditure that was deducted under section DB 66 in relation to the hotel after it was abandoned. However, it will not be necessary to claw back any expenditure to the extent it relates to part of the project that has not been completed (the residential apartments and retail space). Similar property A feature of the clawback is that it also applies to property acquired that is “similar” to the property that was abandoned. The need for the rules to apply where similar property is acquired is to protect against the clawback being ineffectual if the acquired property has even a slight modification or difference to the abandoned property. Page 31 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 It is important to note that the “similar property” requirement only attaches to property that is acquired by a taxpayer, rather than property that is created or completed by the taxpayer. This is because taxpayers will have greater opportunity to acquire property that is similar to (but not the same as) the original property that was abandoned. However, this is not expected to hold true for property that is created or completed by a taxpayer. In this case, the created or completed property is likely to be a continuation of the property that was abandoned. The term “similar property” is not defined in the legislation. Acquired property is likely to be similar to abandoned property where it has a resemblance in appearance, character, function, purpose or quantity to the property that was abandoned. In determining the appearance, character, function, purpose or quantity of the property, regard may be had to any project and design plans relating to the abandoned property, which may include details of the assets required to be acquired for the project and their respective specifications. Example 24: Acquisition of non-similar property In order to expand its vegetable handling operations, Company M seeks to develop a new facility that will include an additional potato washing facility. After considering a number of options, Company M decides on a preferred option of a flatbed potato washer and incurs engineering and design costs for integrating the new machine into the existing processes and facilities. Due to a new form of fungal disease that reduces potato crops, Company M decides to abandon the project and does not acquire the potato washing plant. Company M claims a deduction under section DB 66 for the engineering and design costs. Two years later, new fungus resistant potato varieties have been planted resulting in increased crop yields. As a result, Company M decides to acquire a new potato washing plant. However, instead of acquiring a flat bed washer, it acquires a barrel washer, which is able to wash more potatoes and is able to clean a wider range of vegetables. The original engineering and design work relating to the flat bed washer cannot be used for the barrel washer due to differing specifications. Tax impact The barrel washer and flatbed washer have similar functions in that they both wash potatoes. However, the specifications between the two different washers are significantly different. This is reflected in that the barrel washer can clean a larger quantity of potatoes and can also clean other types of vegetables, as well as the engineering and design work for the flatbed washer not being able to be directly applied to the acquired barrel washer. Accordingly, the barrel washer is not similar to the flat bed washer and the clawback does not apply to the engineering and design expenditure deducted under section DB 66. No further deductions once clawback is triggered In some situations, abandoned property may be reinstated and completed before the five- year spreading period has ended, resulting in the clawback being triggered before all the deductions available under section DB 66 have been claimed. In this situation, all the previously claimed deductions are clawed back as taxable income. There is no entitlement to the remaining deductions under s DB 66 once the relevant property is completed, created or acquired. As noted above, clawed back expenditure may be deductible under the Page 32 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 depreciation or revenue account property rules, subject to meeting the relevant deductibility criteria. Example 25: Interaction between deduction provision in section DB 66 and clawback Company N is undertaking a capital project that, if completed, will result in depreciable property. Work on the project is abandoned in Year 1 but is subsequently resumed and then completed in Year 3. The clawback in section CH 13 applies to the expenditure deducted in Years 1 to 2, meaning that Company N is required to return the deduction portions for Years 1 to 2 as taxable income in Year 3. Company N has no entitlement to the remaining deduction portions for Years 3 to 5. Page 33 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Purchase price allocation This special report explains the new purchase price allocation rules in sections GC 20 and GC 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act), inserted by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act. The rules reinforce and extend existing provisions requiring parties to a sale of business assets with different tax treatments to adopt the same allocation of the total purchase price to the various classes of assets for tax purposes. Background Sales of business assets are often subject to more than one tax treatment. These sales are sometimes referred to as ‘mixed supplies’. For example, a sale of commercial property will normally include depreciable buildings and fitout, and land held on capital account (non- taxable/non-deductible). The vendor and purchaser will agree a total price for the transaction, but may or may not allocate the price between the different assets. For tax purposes, however, the parties are usually required to make an allocation, to determine the vendor’s tax liability and the purchaser’s basis for deductions. This is referred to as a ‘purchase price allocation’. Allocations must reflect market values for the various assets, but market value is a range rather than a single figure. Current law requires a purchaser of trading stock in a mixed supply to treat the trading stock as acquired for the same value as the vendor treats it as sold for (section EB 24(3) of the Act). Trading stock for the purposes of section EB 24 is broadly defined, to include livestock, land held on revenue account, and timber. Section DP 10(1) reinforces this rule for timber. However, these rules do not contain a mechanism for the vendor’s allocation to be communicated to the purchaser, if the allocation is not stated in an agreement. Also, there is no explicit consistency requirement for depreciable property or financial arrangements. As a result, under prior law there were many cases where the vendor and the purchaser in mixed supplies ascribed different market values to the same assets often with the effect that their aggregate reported income was lower than if they had applied consistent valuations. Page 34 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Example 26 Shark Attack Commercial Limited (Shark) is a commercial property owner with a number of buildings in the Auckland CBD. It wishes to sell one of its prime buildings, the Waiata Centre, to Corroboree Properties Limited another commercial lessor. The assets being sold comprise the land, building and fitout of the Waiata Centre. Shark and Corroboree agree on a purchase price of $150 million but they do not allocate that purchase price between the land, building and fitout. When Shark files its tax return it allocates the purchase price as follows: Item Amount Land $100m Building $40m Fitout $10m Total $150m However, Corroboree obtains a valuation of the building and applies that valuation to determine the values in its tax return: Item Amount Land $80m Building $50m Fitout $20m Total $150m This results in a tax mis-match between the two taxpayers over the same assets giving Corroboree a higher tax depreciation base than the amount returned by Shark in determining its depreciation recapture income. The purchase price allocation rules address this lack of consistency and of information, applying to agreements for the disposal and acquisition of property entered into on or after 1 July 2021. An agreement is entered into once it is binding on the parties, whether or not there are conditions (for example, a standard finance condition for the benefit of the purchaser) that remain to be met and which if not met will mean the transaction does not proceed. Key features  Purchase price allocations are to be made at the level of the following classes of ‘purchased property’: i) trading stock, other than timber or a right to take timber ii) timber or a right to take timber Page 35 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 iii) depreciable property, other than buildings iv) buildings that are depreciable property v) financial arrangements, and vi) purchased property for which the disposal does not give rise to assessable income for person A (the vendor) or deductions for person B (the purchaser). Agreed allocations  If the parties agree an allocation to the classes of purchased property and record it in a document before the first tax return for the year in which the transaction occurs is filed, they must both follow that allocation in their returns. This agreed allocation over-rides any prior unilateral allocation that may have been made (see below). Unilateral allocations meeting timeframes  If the parties do not agree an allocation and record it in a document before the first tax return for the transaction is filed, the allocation will be determined by a notification made by one of the parties, or the Commissioner. However, a unilateral allocation does not need to be notified if the total consideration for the purchased property is less than: a) $1 million, or b) $7.5 million, if the only purchased property is residential land (which includes residential buildings) together with its chattels.  The vendor has three months after the change in ownership of the property to notify an allocation to the purchaser and the Commissioner, which then binds the vendor and the purchaser.  If the vendor does not notify an allocation within three months, the purchaser has three months (that is, until six months after the change in ownership) to notify an allocation to the vendor and Commissioner, which then binds the purchaser and the vendor. No unilateral allocation meeting timeframes  Where the parties have not agreed an allocation, and neither party notifies a unilateral allocation (filing of a return containing an allocation is not notification of an allocation): – the Commissioner may determine the allocation, – the purchaser is not entitled to any deductions for the purchased property until the Commissioner notifies an allocation to the purchaser. General market value requirement and exceptions  Allocations must be based on the relative market values of the assets, except when the tax book value minimum on a unilateral vendor allocation applies to make the Page 36 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 value allocated to a class of assets higher than market value, or the low-value depreciable property exception applies (see third bullet point below).  The Commissioner can dispute an allocation that she considers is not based on relative market values.  However, the Commissioner cannot challenge an allocation to an item of depreciable property if its original cost is less than $10,000, the total amount allocated to the item and any identical items is less than $1 million, and the amount allocated to the item is no less than its tax book value and no greater than its original cost. Figure 1 illustrates the application of the purchase price allocation rules. Page 37 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Figure 1: Application of the purchase price allocation rules Page 38 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Application date The rules apply to agreements for the disposal and acquisition of property entered into on or after 1 July 2021. Detailed analysis Effect of purchase price allocation agreement Generally, parties to a sale and purchase agreement who agree an allocation of the transaction price to specific assets will follow that agreement when filing their tax returns. However, sometimes, purchasers have agreed an allocation in a sale and purchase contract and then argued that they are entitled to use a different figure in their tax return, on the basis that the agreed figure is less than market value. New section GC 20 requires parties who have agreed a purchase price allocation in writing to file their income tax returns on the basis of that allocation, even if they do not think it reflects market values. This is achieved by section GC 20(2)(a). Example 27 Dizrythmia Consultants Limited (DCL) enters into negotiations to sell its commercial office building to Double Happy Properties Limited (Double Happy). The sale consists of land (class (vi)), building (class (iv)), and building fit-out (class (iii)). DCL asks a price of $10 million, but states that this price is contingent on Double Happy agreeing to the following purchase price allocation: Item Amount Land $4m (valuation) Building $4.5m (tax book value) Fitout $1.5m (tax book value) Total $10m Double Happy is convinced that the cost base for the building fit-out is too low – and has a valuation to support that view – but nevertheless agrees to the allocation because it considers $10 million to be an acceptable price for the whole bundle of assets. DCL and Double Happy must file their respective returns of income on the basis of the agreed allocation. If the Commissioner considers that the agreed amount does not reflect the relative market value of the class of property, the Commissioner can treat the class of property as disposed of and acquired for a different amount. This is achieved by section GC 20(2)(b). Relative market values should be determined either at the time the parties enter into their agreement or, if later, when they agree their allocation. Page 39 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Section GC 20(3) is an exception to the Commissioner’s ability to challenge an agreed allocation. The Commissioner cannot challenge an allocation to an item of depreciable property if: a) the original cost of the item for the vendor is less than $10,000, and b) the total amount allocated to the item and to any identical items is less than $1 million, and c) the amount allocated to the item is no less than its tax book value and no greater than its original cost. This exception is primarily included to give certainty to vendors taking a low compliance cost approach to allocating to low-value depreciable assets. Condition (a) of the exception sets the de minimis ceiling of a single item at $10,000. Condition (b) is a caveat to condition (a). If there is a large number of identical low-value assets with an aggregate allocated value under the transaction of $1 million or more, the exception does not apply. Example 28 Matinee Idyll Property Limited (Matinee) is selling a commercial building with 600 identical office desks. Matinee has agreed with the purchaser an allocation to depreciable property which is based on an aggregate allocation to the desks of $2 million – their tax book value. The desks were entered as one item on the vendor’s depreciation register. While the value of each individual desk is low, the aggregate value of the set is high, and any aggregate discrepancy between tax book value and market value could be material. Therefore, the Commissioner will retain the right to challenge an allocation in respect of these assets. Condition (c) sets the range of unchallengeable values. The allocation must be no lower than tax book value and no higher than original cost. The rationale for this range is that the immediate effect of an allocation within it will be either revenue neutral or positive, and symmetrical. However, an allocation below tax book value would give the vendor a loss, and an allocation above original cost would give the vendor an untaxed capital gain but a higher cost base for the purchaser’s deductions. Purchase price allocation required: no agreement New section GC 21 provides a hierarchy of unilateral allocation rules that apply where the vendor and purchaser do not agree an allocation to the classes of property before the first tax return for the year of the transaction is filed. The purpose of these rules is to give parties a mechanism to file on the basis of a single allocation in cases where they are unable to agree one. Page 40 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 De minimis Section GC 21(2) sets out two thresholds below which the unilateral allocation rules do not apply. A unilateral allocation does not need to be notified where the total consideration for the purchased property is less than: a) $1 million, or b) $7.5 million, if the only property in the disposal is residential land (which includes residential buildings) together with its chattels. ‘Consideration’ encompasses both the purchase price and the value of any vendor liabilities assumed by the purchaser (such as warranty obligations). Example 29 Amy is selling her small software business – ‘Twelfth Dimension Software’ – to Titus. The business assets include software (class (iii)) and goodwill (class (vi)). Titus offers Amy $950,000 for the business, which Amy accepts. They do not agree a purchase price allocation between the software and goodwill, but because the total price is less than $1 million, and section EB 24 does not apply to the software or goodwill, they are not subject to any consistency rules. Therefore, they are able to adopt their own allocations in their tax returns, based on their own respective assessments of market value. Suppose the facts are varied so that Titus also agrees to take over certain obligations to customers, which the parties value at $60,000 (in addition to the $950,000 cash payment). The consideration is now above the de minimis, and section GC 21 applies. The amount allocated to the business assets will of course be increased by the $60,000. ‘Residential land’ is defined in the Act and includes residential buildings. Chattels are any items sold with the residential building that do not form part of the building. The vast majority of residential property sales will be below the $7.5 million threshold. Residential sales data for 2018–2021 shows there were only 115 sales at or above $7.5 million over the period – 0.03% of total sales. Of these, some are likely to have been sales of a house by one owner-occupier to another, which are not affected by the purchase price allocation rules, since all the property is outside the tax base for both parties. The residential transactions that are likely to be caught are sales of high-end rentals, or multi-dwelling buildings such as apartment blocks. A higher threshold for residential property transactions is justified on the basis that residential buildings are non-depreciable, so the scope for tax manipulation in these transactions is low. Page 41 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Example 30 Hermit McDermitt owns a number of high-end rental properties. One such property is located in a prime area in Nelson and Hermit has decided to sell the property. Sandy Allen has been looking for a property she can rent out to wealthy tourists once the borders have opened for travel and puts in an offer for the property of $7.2 million which is $1.5 million over the RV of the property and Hermit accepts this. They do not allocate the purchase price between, land (class (vi)), house (class iv)) and chattels (class (iii)). Because the consideration is less than $7.5 million and the only property being sold is the land, house and chattels, the purchase price allocation rules do not apply. Section EE 45(10) requires Hermit McDermitt to allocate market value to the chattels. If Hermit has been occupying the property as his main home, the sale will be non-taxable for him, and he will not need to make an allocation. Vendor allocation Section GC 21(3) provides that, if the vendor uses different income tax treatments for two or more of the classes of property (and is thus required to make an allocation), the vendor may notify the Commissioner and the purchaser of an allocation within three months of the change in ownership of the property. The amount allocated to each class of property must be the greater of the relative market value and the tax book value of the class. ‘Tax book value’ is defined in subsection (13) as: ‘the total amount that person A uses or would use, for purchased property in the class of property, in calculating person A’s tax position for their income year in which the change in ownership of the purchased property occurs.’ The tax book value minimum protects the purchaser from an unreasonably low allocation to taxable/deductible property by the vendor, which the Commissioner may not wish to challenge. The vendor will not be able to comply with the tax book value floor where the aggregate tax book value of all the classes of taxable property plus the relative market value of the class of non-taxable property exceeds the total purchase price. This could be the case in a distressed sale where the vendor is making a genuine loss. Section GC 21(4) provides a mechanism to deal with the excess of the amount required to be allocated by the previous subsection above the total purchase price. The excess is applied: a) first, to reduce any amount allocated to the class of non-taxable property (for example, goodwill, or non-taxable land) b) second, to reduce, pro rata, any amounts allocated to the other classes of property. Therefore, where the amount allocated to the class of non-taxable property is higher than the excess, the excess can be eliminated entirely by reducing the allocation to that class. Where the amount allocated to that class is already zero – whether by virtue of having been reduced by the first step, or of there being no non-taxable property in the transaction in the Page 42 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 first place – the tax book values of the classes of taxable property must be reduced proportionately until they collectively equal the purchase price. Example 31 Frenzy Fabrics Limited (Frenzy) is selling one of its factories to Poor Boy Pastels Limited (Poor Boy). The sale consists of land (class vi)), building (class (iv)), factory fit-out, and machinery (both class (iii)). During negotiation, Frenzy and Poor Boy try to reach agreement on an allocation, but Frenzy is adamant the fitout and machinery are worth $4 million less than tax book value of $7 million but that the land has appreciated significantly. Poor Boy claims the land has not moved much in value, but the machinery is worth closer to its original cost of $10 million. Frenzy has obtained a valuation for the underlying land that is much higher than Poor Boy’s assessment of the land value. Despite not being able to agree an allocation with Frenzy, Poor Boy is committed to purchasing the factory, and the two companies complete the deal for $50 million. Having not agreed an allocation with Poor Boy, Frenzy has the first allocation right under the new rules. Based on its valuation, Frenzy wants to make the following allocation: Item Amount Land $35m (valuation) Building $12m (tax book value) Fitout & machinery $3m (own assessment of market value) Total $50m However, the aggregate tax book value of the fit-out and machinery is $7 million. Because Frenzy is making a unilateral allocation, it is required to allocate at least tax book value. Three weeks after settlement, it therefore notifies the following allocation to Poor Boy and to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue: Item Amount Land $31m (valuation less additional allocation to fitout and machinery) Building $12m (tax book value) Fitout & machinery $7m (tax book value) Total $50m The allocation binds Poor Boy, and both companies file their returns on the basis of it, as required by the new rules. The Commissioner may only dispute the allocation of $7 million to fitout and machinery if she believes it is less than market value. Purchaser allocation In some cases, the vendor may not make an allocation. For example, if the vendor is a dealer (taxable on all the property), or tax exempt, they are not able to make one. Page 43 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Section GC 21(5) provides that if the vendor does not notify an allocation within the three months, the purchaser may notify the Commissioner and the vendor of an allocation within six months of the change in ownership of the property. An allocated amount must reflect the relative market value of the relevant class of property proportional to the other classes of property. There are no other constraints on the purchaser’s allocation. Parties must notify each other following the requirements of sections 14A to 14G of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This means that in the case of a purchaser allocation, so long as they do this it will not matter that the vendor may no longer exist at the time the purchaser notifies their allocation (for example, where the vendor has wound up or liquidated after settlement). Example 32 Time and Tide Financing Limited (TnT) is selling its finance business as a going concern to Charlie. The business’s assets are receivables (financial arrangements class (v)), goodwill (class (vi)), and software (class (iii). TnT claims most of the business’s value is in the goodwill, and that the receivables should be significantly discounted because there has recently been an economic downturn and some of TnT’s clients have been laid off and had to enter into special debt repayment plans. Charlie believes that the economy will soon recover and that the clients will pay quickly and in full and wants the receivables to be allocated their tax book value. They claim the goodwill is worth substantially less than TnT’s assessment. The parties do not agree an allocation, but Charlie wants to go ahead with the transaction and buys the finance business for $8 million. After settlement, the owners of TnT start focusing on their next business venture and neglect to notify a purchase price allocation to Charlie and the Commissioner. Three months pass, and Charlie – having received no allocation – notifies their own allocation, based on their assessment of market values, to the owners of TnT and to the Commissioner: Item Amount Receivables $5m Goodwill $2m Other intangibles $1m Total $8m The allocation binds both parties and they file their respective tax returns on the basis of it, in accordance with the rules. The Commissioner may challenge this allocation, if satisfied it was not made on the basis of relative market values. No timely notification If no allocation is notified on a timely basis – that is, within six months of settlement – the power to determine the allocation passes to the Commissioner. Page 44 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 If the vendor or purchaser notifies an allocation after the six months, it will be at the Commissioner’s discretion whether to bind both parties to it, or to instead notify her own allocation in accordance with market values, which both parties must then adopt. Where neither party notifies an allocation at any stage, they will still have to make allocations in filing their tax returns. Such allocations will be subject to adjustment by the Commissioner. The Commissioner may require a party to allocate, to the classes of purchased property: a) the amounts allocated by the vendor to the classes of purchased property, or b) the amounts allocated by the purchaser to the classes of purchased property, or c) amounts that reflect the relative market value of the relevant class of purchased property, proportional to the other classes of purchased property. The Commissioner will notify the required allocation to both the vendor and the purchaser, either for them to use in filing their respective tax returns, or – if they have already filed returns – in an amended assessment for one or both parties. Allocated amounts enforced Subsection GC 21(7) provides that a class of purchased property is treated as disposed of and acquired for the amount allocated under subsections (3) to (6). In effect, a unilateral vendor, purchaser, or Commissioner allocation is binding on the parties, with no right for a party to contest the allocation by filing a notice of proposed adjustment or to take any other proceedings to challenge the allocation. The Commissioner retains the right to dispute an allocation by one of the parties that is not market value, unless it is an allocation made in accordance with section GC 21(3)(b) and is higher than market value, or it is an allocation to low-value depreciable property protected by the exception (see section GC 21(11)). No deductions for purchaser until allocation To incentivise the purchaser to notify an allocation when they have the allocation right, sections GC 21(8) to (10) provide that the purchaser is not entitled to any deductions in relation to the purchased property until the first income year for which they file a return of income on a timely basis after the earlier of the following:  The purchaser’s notification of their allocation to the Commissioner, and  The Commissioner’s notification of her allocation to the purchaser. The purchaser should therefore notify their allocation to the Commissioner and the vendor as soon as possible to ensure they can claim deductions in their next tax return, and not have them deferred. Any deductions that are deferred will be able to be claimed in the return that is filed on a timely basis after an allocation is notified to or by the Commissioner. This will result in the claiming of deductions for more than one year in a single return. Page 45 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Example 33 Missing Person Detective Agency Limited (MPDA) a very successful private investigation firm has decided to sell its business to I Hope I Never Security Limited (IHNS) in the 2023–24 income year. The assets being sold are the building premises (class (iv)), fit out (class (iii)), customer database and goodwill (both class (vi)). MPDA and IHNS agree on a purchase price of $28m but don’t agree on an allocation. Time moves on and neither MPDA nor IHNS notifies an allocation to the other party or the Commissioner. Both parties file tax returns for the 2023–24 income year recognising the transaction, with different allocations. MPDA allocates tax book value to its fit out, while IHNS allocates a greater amount. In early 2026, when reviewing the 2023–24 tax return for IHNS, the Commissioner realises that no allocation has been notified by the parties. She determines that IHNS’s allocation is the more reasonable. She therefore issues an amended assessment to MPDA increasing its income in the 2023–24 year by the additional depreciation recovery implied by IHNS’s valuation. She also issues an amended assessment to IHNS denying a deduction for depreciation of the premises and fit out altogether for the 2023–24 year. These assessments trigger an obligation to pay UOMI, and shortfall penalties may also apply. IHNS will be able to claim the denied deductions in its next tax return, along with the deductions for that year. Exception for low value depreciable property The low value depreciable property exception in section GC 20(3) is replicated in section GC 21(11). Relationship with other provisions of the Act Several existing provisions in the Act deal with amounts allocated to property sold in a mixed supply. Section EB 24 provides that when trading stock is disposed of together with other business assets, the sale proceeds must be apportioned between the trading stock and the other assets in a way that reflects their respective market values. Also, the purchaser must use the vendor’s allocation to the trading stock. Section DP 10 contains rules consistent with section EB 24 that relate solely to disposals of timber. Section EE 45(10) provides that when depreciable property is sold with other items, the amount allocated to the depreciable property is its market value. Section GC 21(12) provides that any such existing provision of the Act that expressly requires the use of market value for purchased property is overridden by the purchase price allocation rules to the extent to which the amount allocated to that property is determined under the purchase price allocation rules. This override serves two main purposes. First, it prevents parties from attempting to use two different market values for an item or class of property on the argument that one value is Page 46 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 determined under the purchase price allocation rules and another is determined under a different provision of the Act. Second, it allows the tax book value floor on a unilateral vendor allocation to operate correctly; where the relative market value of a class of property is lower than its tax book value, the tax book value is used. Example 34 Parrot Fashion Pines Ltd (PFP) is selling one of its forests, which comprises trees (timber, class (ii) and freehold land (class (vi)), along with depreciable equipment (class (iii))with a cost of $73,000 and a book value of $20,000. PFP has incurred expenditure on the land within various categories described in schedule 20 Part G of the Income Tax Act 2007. The original amount of such expenditure was $150,000, and it has been depreciated down to $85,000 at the end of the year before the sale, using the rates provided for in Part G. PFP and the buyer, Bold as Brass Ltd have agreed a price and an allocation of: Item Amount Depreciable Property $20,000 Land $1,800,000 Trees $180,000 Total $2,000,000 PFP will recognize $180,000 income from the sale of trees, no depreciation recapture, and no other income. Bold as Brass will have a cost of trees of $180,000, depreciable property of $20,000, and an amortisation deduction in the year of sale of the appropriate percentage of the $85,000 of unamortised land related costs under section DP 3 (provided PFP gives Bold as Brass a record of this expenditure). There is no requirement for an allocation of the purchase price to the unamortised land related costs – these costs will generally be reflected in the value of land or other improvements. The allocation to timber is subject to the Commissioner’s right to dispute it if she considers it is not in accordance with relative market value (section GC 20(2)(b)). First variation Assume that:  PFP bought the forest by way of an asset purchase 2 years before the sale to Bold as Brass and paid $300,000 for the trees (log prices have declined significantly since then). PFP has not incurred any other expenditure which has had to be added to the cost of timber, and  PFP and Bold as Brass have not agreed an allocation. If PFP makes an allocation under section GC 21(3), it must treat itself as selling the trees for $300,000 for tax purposes. This will also be Bold as Brass’s cost for the trees. This will reduce the allocation to land to $1,680,000. Second variation Assume that Bold as Brass and PFP are associated parties, and that they have agreed the $180,000 allocation to the timber. In this case, the sale price will be respected for tax purposes (subject to the Commissioner’s ability to challenge it as not in accordance with relative market Page 47 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 values). However, PFP will only be entitled to deduct $180,000 as cost of timber (section DP 10(4)) and Bold as Brass will add the “missing” $120,000 to its cost of timber (section DP 10(5)), giving it a cost of $300,000. When a mixed supply involves an acquisition of depreciable property by a person (purchaser) from an associate (vendor), sections GC 20 and GC 21 operate in conjunction with section EE 40(7), which limits the amount of depreciation that can be claimed in such a case. The person’s depreciation claim is based on the lesser of the cost to the person and the cost to the associate. While the cost to the person is determined by sections GC 20 or GC 21 if the acquisition from the associate was a mixed supply, if this amount is greater than the cost of the item to the associate, the person’s depreciation claim is based on the lesser amount. Definitions Section GC 21(13) provides definitions for three terms used in the purchase price allocation provisions. The term ‘allocation notification’ is used in sections GC 21(9) and (10), which defer a purchaser’s deductions. ‘Allocation notification’ means the earliest of the following: i) the time when the purchaser’s notification of their allocation is provided to the Commissioner in the form prescribed by the Commissioner, and ii) the time when the Commissioner’s notification of her allocation under subsection (6) is provided to the purchaser. The term ‘pre-allocation deduction’ is also used in sections GC 21(9) and (10). It means the purchaser’s deductions for purchased property that, ignoring sections GC 21(9) and (10), would be allocated to an income year before the income year in which allocation notification occurs. In effect, pre-allocation deductions are the deductions that are deferred. The term ‘tax book value’ is used in sections GC 20(3)(c)(ii), GC 21(3)(b) and GC 21(11)(c)(ii). ‘Tax book value’ means the total amount that the vendor uses or would use, for purchased property in the class of property, in calculating their tax position for their income year in which the change in ownership of the property occurs. For trading stock, the tax book value is the value of the stock on hand at the time of the transaction as calculated under the valuation method used by the vendor for the income year in which the transaction takes place. For depreciable property, the tax book value is the amount the property has been written down to at the end of the year before the transaction, less a pro rata portion of the depreciation for the vendor in the year of the transaction. For financial arrangements, the tax book value is the consideration that would give an amount of income or expenditure under section EW 31 (base price adjustment formula) equal to the income or expenditure the vendor would have for the purchased property in the Page 48 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 year of the transaction, for the part-year period before the transaction, using the relevant spreading method for the property for the part-year period, pro-rata. Subsection (b) of the trading stock definition in section YA 1 is amended to include sections GC 20 and GC 21. This means that in the purchase price allocation rules, trading stock: i) includes anything produced or manufactured ii) includes anything acquired for the purposes of manufacture or disposal iii) includes livestock iv) includes timber or a right to take timber v) includes land whose disposal would produce income under any of sections CB 6A to CB 15 (which relate to income from land) vi) includes anything for which expenditure is incurred and which would be trading stock if possession of it were taken vii) does not include a financial arrangement to which the financial arrangement rules or the old financial arrangement rules apply. This is the broad definition of trading stock used for the purposes of section EB 24 and several other sections. Notifications by vendor or purchaser Notification to the Commissioner of an allocation should be made online via MyIR, or via a letter. This notification should include the phrase “Purchase Price Allocation” in the subject line and contain the following information:  The names, IRD/GST numbers and contact details of the vendor and purchaser  The date of agreement to the transaction  The date on which the property was transferred (that is, settlement/change in ownership)  The total consideration (including the value of any liabilities assumed)  The amounts allocated to each of the following classes of property sold, allocating zero to any class of property not sold: i) trading stock, other than timber or a right to take timber ii) timber or a right to take timber iii) depreciable property, other than buildings iv) buildings that are depreciable property v) financial arrangements, and Page 49 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 vi) purchased property for which the disposal does not give rise to assessable income for person A (the vendor) or deductions for person B (the purchaser)  A statement that the amounts have been allocated in accordance with section GC 21  If desired, supporting documents such as the sale and purchase agreement and the notification provided to the other party. Practical variations Nominees In some transactions the acquirer of the purchased property will be a nominee of the purchaser, rather than the purchaser named in the contract. If the vendor agrees an allocation with the purchaser, and the agreement also allows for nomination, the vendor should include a provision in the sale and purchase agreement to ensure that any nominee is bound to that agreed allocation. If the vendor makes a unilateral allocation under section GC 21, that allocation will bind the purchaser or the nominee without the need for any special contractual provision. Mortgagee sales The purchase price allocation rules may apply to a mortgagee sale, where the vendor is a bank or other lender (mortgagee) recovering funds by selling the property of an owner (mortgagor) who can no longer meet their repayment obligations. Neither the mortgagee nor the mortgagor is likely to be engaged on the issue of allocation, but if the purchaser wants to agree an allocation with the mortgagee, they should ensure that the mortgagee has been authorised by the mortgagor to agree an allocation. Auctions and tenders In competitive bid processes such as auctions and tenders, purchasers may often have to submit bids without the opportunity to agree a purchase price allocation. The outcome of the initial bidding process could be influenced by whether particular bidders have specified a potential purchase price allocation, since the allocation could impact on the vendor’s returns. Parties may navigate these commercial realities in a number of ways. For example, in a tender, purchasers may express bids as being conditional on a specified allocation. Or the vendor in an auction may specify an allocation, to ensure that all bids are made on an even footing. Purchase price adjustments When an agreement provides for contingent payments to be made, the amount of those payments will often not be known before the parties agree an allocation or make a unilateral Page 50 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 allocation. However, the parties may agree, or in the case of a unilateral allocation, specify, the “in principle” allocation of those payments to particular categories of assets. For example, earn out payments may be allocated to goodwill. If the allocation is agreed or specified in that way, sections GC 20 and GC 21 should apply to that allocation in the same way as they apply to non-contingent payments. If the non-contingent amounts have not been allocated in that way, their allocation will be dealt with under existing law. Dealers and tax-exempt parties In some transactions the vendor or purchaser may treat the entire amount of the consideration in the same way. This will be the case if the party is a dealer or an exempt entity. A dealer or exempt party is not able to make an allocation. If the other party to the transaction is required to make an allocation because they use two or more different tax treatments for the purchased property, then as a practical matter that other party will be able to determine the allocation. Whether the formal mechanism for this is agreement or a unilateral allocation should not be significant, since the dealer or exempt party will not be applying the allocation in any event. Where both parties to a transaction are dealers or exempt entities, the purchase price allocation rules do not apply. Page 51 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Unclaimed money The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure and Remedial Matters) Act 2021 (“ARFERM Act”) was passed on 23 March 2021 and received the Royal assent on 30 March 2021. This Act amends the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 (“UCM Act”). The amendments modernise the unclaimed money regime with the aim of simplifying the process of reporting and transferring unclaimed money to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The reforms also recognise that customers are increasingly interacting with their accounts in new ways (for example, online or using institution specific software such as an “app”). Background Unclaimed money refers to money which has become detached or somehow disconnected from its owner for a given period. A common example is money which has been left untouched in a bank account by its owner for several years. That is, the owner of the account has not made any withdrawals or deposits, or provided written instructions to the bank. Once the money has been left in an account for a given period, it will become unclaimed under the UCM Act. It is then passed from the holder (for example, bank or service provider) to Inland Revenue, who will hold the money until the owner claims it. The unclaimed money regime had not been reviewed substantially since its enactment in 1908. Accordingly, the administrative procedures required by the UCM Act were reflective of an era in which the use of paper and postage dominated administration. Inland Revenue’s ongoing transformation programme provided an opportunity to modernise the administration of unclaimed money. The reforms make the administration of unclaimed money more efficient by lowering compliance costs for holders of unclaimed money and make it easier for owners to be reunited with their money. Key features The reforms to the UCM Act include the following:  Reducing the amount of time which must pass before money is deemed unclaimed by replacing the previous deeming periods of 6 and 25 years with a single period of five years for all funds.  Expanding the forms of account interaction which will prevent money from becoming unclaimed to include new forms of account activity (for example, online banking).  Allowing holders to, in limited circumstances, transfer money to the Commissioner before it is unclaimed.  The repeal of the requirement for a holder to keep and maintain a register of unclaimed money. Page 52 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021  A quarterly reporting regime (which will allow holders to transfer unclaimed money to Inland Revenue on a quarterly basis).  Transitional provisions to assist holders who will require further time to update their systems to align with the reforms. Application date The amendments apply from the date of Royal assent, with the exception of section 178 of the ARFERM Act, which took effect on 1 March 2021. Detailed analysis The Amendment Act amends the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Unclaimed Money Act 1971, and the KiwiSaver Act 2006. These amendments support the administration of unclaimed money. The definition of unclaimed money (section 4 of the UCM Act) This section refers to money that is more than $100. This is intended to refer to money in the traditional sense. The UCM Act is not intended to apply to other stores of value such as units in Portfolio Investment Entities (PIE). Money covered by the Public Finance Act 1989 is excluded by section 5(3) of the UCM Act. Inland Revenue is aware that some PIE fund managers choose between transferring unclaimed money to the Commissioner under the UCM Act or to the Crown under the new section 149 of the Trusts Act 2019. There is merit in allowing the flexibility to transfer unclaimed money under both Acts. As noted, units in PIEs are not included within the definition of unclaimed money. Therefore, although Inland Revenue will not accept units in PIEs, it will remain possible for fund managers to transfer the redeemed units (in money) to the Commissioner once it has remained in the holder’s possession for the required deeming period (or where the holder wishes to transfer the money earlier). Example 35 B&E Limited is a PIE fund manager which administers several PIE funds. Natisha is an investor in the Ultra risky fund which has high volatility. Each year Natisha is contacted by an employee of B&E to see if she is happy with her investment mandate. Over the last two years B&E has not received any reply from Natisha and some letters have been returned to B&E as undeliverable. Three years later B&E decides that Natisha’s investment is effectively unclaimed money. B&Es terms and conditions provide that if they cannot contact a client after four years, they can convert the investment to cash, which they do for Natisha’s investment. At this point the unclaimed money deeming period starts. However, B&E decides that it has made reasonable efforts to contact Natisha and decides to pay the funds to Inland Revenue as unclaimed money before the five-year deeming period has ended. Page 53 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Monetary threshold (section 4 of the UCM Act) Amounts of $100 or less are not unclaimed money for the purposes of the UCM Act. However, the UCM Act retains the alternative use provision in place under the previous UCM Act, which allows fund holders to transfer amounts of $100 or less to the Commissioner as unclaimed money. Holders have a choice between paying these amounts to the Commissioner or putting them to another purpose (such as donating them to charity). Money applied for the benefit of the holder, or another use, will cease to be unclaimed money. However, this does not affect any claim that the owner of the money may have against the holder for repayment. Amounts which are retained by a holder which are not unclaimed money will be income in the hands of the fund holder. 6 Example 36 Crimson Permanent Assurance Limited (Crimson) is a life insurance company that provides life insurance for pets at very low premiums (with very low pay outs). Over the last few years Crimson has received many claims from clients but have been unable to locate the owners after the claim has been made. There are 24 claimants and all the claims are under $100. Despite trying to contact the claimants through multiple channels, Crimson has received no reply from any of them. Crimson holds the money for five years and then decides these claimants are never going to claim the funds and so decides to donate them to a charity that finds homes for former greyhound racing dogs. As the money does not meet the definition of unclaimed money (being $100 or less) Crimson can do whatever it wishes with it, although they will need to return the amount as taxable income for the year and a donation credit for the donation. Under the former section 4(1), any amounts owed to the same owner were combined to determine whether the value of the unclaimed money was $100 or less. This was designed to avoid amounts which were individually $100 or less but collectively more than $100 being applied to some other purpose rather than transferred to the Commissioner. This approach is preserved under section 4(3) of the amended UCM Act. Length of time until money is unclaimed (section 4 of the UCM Act) Previously, the length of time which was required to pass before money was deemed unclaimed was either 6 or 25 years from the date of the owner’s last interaction with the holder, depending on the type of funds. The reforms consolidate the prior two deeming periods into one uniform deeming period of five years. In other words, the standard deeming period of five years will apply to all amounts of money. To avoid engaging the deeming period, an owner must request information or provide instructions to the holder about the money or another matter, within five years. If owner 6 See Inland Revenue public rulings- BR Pub 17/01 Income Tax – Treatment of unclaimed amounts of $100 or less and BR Pub 17/02 Income Tax – Treatment of unclaimed amounts of $100 or less- amounts held on trust. Page 54 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 does not do so, the money will be deemed unclaimed. The deeming period will commence from the date of the owner’s last interaction with the money. A common issue for some holders arises from money which is discovered during a routine financial remediation process. These amounts can now be paid to the Commissioner immediately where there is little prospect of reuniting them with their owner (see “Transfer of money to the Commissioner before it becomes unclaimed” below). Account activity (section 4(3)(a) of the UCM Act) To recognise modern forms of account interaction which will prevent money from becoming unclaimed, section 4(3)(a)(i) and (ii) now refer to owners “requesting information” or “providing instructions” to the holder. This includes, for example, customer interaction through internet banking (for example, where a customer views their account balance online). This broadens the 1970s definition of forms of account activity from making a deposit, withdrawal or providing instructions in writing. Institutional approach to account activity ( section 4(3)(a) of the UCM Act) The reforms apply a customer’s account activity on one account to all accounts the customer holds with the same institution. This is reflected in the wording of section 4(3)(a)(i) and (ii) which refer to the owner requesting information or providing instructions to the holder about “another matter”. This is intended to avoid money at the same institution from becoming unclaimed while the owner remains engaged with their funds. Account activity will also include an owner’s interaction with a joint account or another product held with the same institution (for example, an account holders’ cash-PIE investment). Example 37 Sabena has $1,000 in a savings account with Money Bags Bank (MBB). She is keen to save the money, so she decides to leave the $1,000 untouched and doesn’t withdraw any money for ten years. She also holds an on-call account with MBB which she accesses frequently for her everyday purchases. The institutional approach to account activity means that Sabena’s interaction with her on-call account will prevent the funds in either account from becoming unclaimed. The broad wording of this section gives banks and other holders the ability to determine for themselves whether customers have been interacting with another of their accounts at that institution. Holders are expected to apply their best judgement when determining account interaction, as the nature of account interaction may vary between institutions. Page 55 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Transfer of money to the Commissioner before it becomes unclaimed (section 4(3)(b) of the UCM Act) Historically there was no ability for holders to pay unclaimed money to the Commissioner before the expiry of the six or 25-year holding periods specified under the previous regime. In some circumstances, however, Inland Revenue appreciates that there is little to be gained by requiring holders to retain amounts owed to former clients where they have identified that the owner is unable to be contacted. To assist holders, section 4(3)(b) allows holders to choose to pay money which has not yet become unclaimed to the Commissioner where they have made reasonable efforts under section 5B and have been unsuccessful in locating the owner. There is no requirement that a holder first contact the Commissioner before transferring such money to Inland Revenue. Allowing holders this option is intended to increase the chances of an owner being reunited with their money. This may assist holders who owe, for example, amounts identified during a routine remediation process or backdated holiday pay. Example 38 Really Big Bank (RBB) conducts a financial remediation process and identifies that it has overcharged their client (Mr. Bach) $105 in account fees. However, before RBB realises its error, Mr. Bach closes his accounts with RBB and moves to a remote location in the Northern Territory. Once its process is complete, RBB seeks to contact Mr. Bach to return the funds and apologise for the error. However, despite its best efforts, Mr. Bach cannot be located. While the refund of fees owed to Mr. Bach will become unclaimed money five years from when the error first arose, RBB takes the view that there is little sense in it retaining the funds any longer. To increase the chances of reuniting Mr. Bach with his money, RBB chooses to pay the $105 to the Commissioner as unclaimed money before the five-year deeming period has expired. Treatment of renewing term deposits (section 4(6)(b) of the UCM Act) The reforms recognise that it is common for term deposits to be automatically reinvested on similar terms and conditions upon maturity. The amended section 4 refers to these as “renewing-term arrangements.” The definition in section 4(6)(b) is intended to cover a deposit which contains an option for repayment but is treated as reinvested where the option is not exercised. There may be situations in which a term deposit is the only investment which a customer has with a financial institution. In such a situation, the standard deeming period would conventionally apply five years from the date the customer last provided instructions to the bank. Page 56 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 To ease the administrative burden on institutions and depositors, section 4(3)(a)(ii) provides an exception to the usual deeming period. Where the deposit is the only investment which the customer has with an institution, the five-year deeming period will not commence until the second term (that is, first rollover) of the renewing term arrangement. Once the deeming period starts and five years has passed with no interaction, the money will be deemed unclaimed money. However, to avoid breaking a deposit mid-term, section 4(3)(a)(ii) prevents a deposit becoming unclaimed money before the end of a term. Example 39 Josh is a customer of Conservative Cash Bank (CCB) but he decides to try his chances at investing in a one-off account with Money Bags Bank (MBB). He invests $1,500 in a two-year term deposit with an option for repayment, but which is treated as reinvested where that option is not exercised. This is his only investment with MBB. Provided Josh does not exercise the option for repayment, the timeline looks as follows: Investment period Period of investment Total length of time unclaimed Period one Two years N/A Period two Two years Two years Period three Two years Four years Period four Two years Six years Josh’s first period of two years does not engage the unclaimed money regime. The UCM Act views the first period of investment as a free period. Once the term deposit rolls over for another two years, the unclaimed money deeming period begins. However, Josh does not have any linked accounts with MBB and does not check his balances over this time. Period two represents years one and two of the deeming period. Without any directions from Josh, the money rolls over into period three, which represents years three and four of the deeming period. When the money rolls over into period four of the renewing term arrangement, Josh has completely forgotten about the money and does not interact with MBB. The unclaimed money deeming period stops at five years, but the money will not be deemed unclaimed until the end of period four. This removes the need for the bank to transfer a deposit before the end of the fourth term. In this example, the money will become unclaimed once six years have elapsed since the first roll-over. Holder (section 5(2) of the UCM Act) The reforms allow a person, firm, body or institution which holds money:  which is not unclaimed money under section 4(2) or 4(7) of the UCM Act, and  if it excluded by section 4(5), it meets the requirements of section 4(7) to elect to be a holder under the UCM Act. Page 57 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Obligations of holders Reasonable efforts (section 5B of the UCM Act) The reforms require a holder to make “reasonable efforts” to locate an owner of unclaimed money. Section 8(1) of UCM Act requires that holders have met this requirement within one month and 20 days of the end of their reporting period (see below, “Payment and transfer of unclaimed money.”) However, for some holders, the requirement to make “reasonable efforts” to locate the owner of the money may already have been met owing to past attempts to contact the owner having been unsuccessful. The obligation on a holder to make reasonable efforts is intended to encourage holders to use their resources and the information they hold efficiently. This is a move away from the formalistic process for contacting owners prescribed by the previous legislation. Holders are required to pursue the avenues of contact which they consider will be most productive. This will require holders to exercise reasonable judgement. However, this is not intended to impose additional compliance costs upon holders and does not require them to pursue avenues of contact which they know will prove unproductive. For example, a holder is not required to attempt to contact an owner using a phone number or email address which is considered or known to be no longer current. Example 40 Fantastic Filing Bank Ltd (FFB) has many customers who hold renewing term arrangements. Every so often, FFB reaches out to account holders to provide an account update. FFB has tried to update Baz who holds a single account with the bank. Baz does not interact with the account for three years. During this time, FFB sends two emails to update him on his account but they both “bounce back” as undeliverable. FFB decides to send a letter to his last recorded physical address, but the letter is returned to sender as Baz no longer resides at that address. As FFB’s attempts to contact Baz using known avenues prior to the conclusion of the deeming period are reasonable, FFB will not have to repeat its efforts to contact Baz once the five-year deeming period has elapsed. The obligation to make reasonable efforts simply requires holders to use the information available to them in each situation. To optimise the customer experience, holders may wish to develop their own guidelines to be applied in accordance with the contact options available to the holder in each case. Inland Revenue would expect most holders would, in providing good customer service, make multiple attempts to contact the customer before the deeming period ends. The holder may, at its discretion, send a final notice to the customer once the funds become unclaimed, but this is not required. Page 58 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Example 41 Another Institution Ltd (AIL) is not up to speed with the unclaimed money rules. An employee of AIL notices that one account of $625 has just become unclaimed money. AIL’s internal system has three avenues of contact recorded for the account owner: an email address, a cell phone number, and a physical address. Standard practice at AIL is to send a pre-formatted letter to the owner’s physical address because this saves time. However, in this case, the letter is returned as the customer no longer resides at that address. AIL does not attempt to contact the owner by cell phone or email, although it has no reason to believe they are not current. The Commissioner would not consider AIL’s actions satisfy the standard of reasonable efforts required by section 5B. Ideally, AIL would attempt to contact the customer using the other avenues of contact which it has available to it. Information collection and transfer (section 5B(2) of the UCM Act) This section requires holders of unclaimed money to provide the Commissioner with any information in their possession or control relating to the owner of the money and the amount. Section 8(1) of the UCM Act requires holders to provide this information to the Commissioner within 1 month and 20 days of the end of their reporting period (see below, “Payment and transfer of unclaimed money”). Information which holders should provide to the Commissioner includes (in summary):  how the money came to the holder  the identity and whereabouts of the owner (if known  why the money belongs to the owner, and  any identifying data (for example, the owner’s IRD number). For example, a bank which submits information to Inland Revenue using the relevant schedule could categorise money as arising from a range of sources including bonds, credit cards, investments or bank charges. The bank could also use the space within the schedule to note any particulars associated with the owner (such as the owner’s name, date of birth, contact details and IRD number). A detailed guide to the transfer of unclaimed money may be obtained from Inland Revenue. However, this is not intended to impose any added information collection requirements on holders of unclaimed money. Rather, holders should provide the Commissioner with any readily available information which they hold relating to the owner or the money. This will assist the Commissioner in verifying the owner. Inland Revenue will provide holders with an electronic template to facilitate the transfer of relevant information from the holder to Inland Revenue. To send the template, holders will need to register as a holder in myIR and submit their schedule online. Page 59 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Maintaining a register (section 6 and 7 (register sections) of the UCM Act repealed) A holder is no longer required to maintain a publicly available register of unclaimed money. Holders are instead encouraged to maintain internal records which align with the information collection requirements of section 5B. Inland Revenue will supply holders with appropriate electronic schedules for submitting information. Payment and transfer of unclaimed money (section 8 of the UCM Act) The reforms institute a reporting and transfer regime. This, in summary, allows holders to combine all the money which became unclaimed during a reporting period and transfer it to Inland Revenue within one month and 20 days of the end of the reporting period. Reporting period Section 8(5) sets out the reporting periods available to a holder. Holders are expected to report quarterly. A quarter is defined in section 2 as a period of three consecutive calendar months ending on the last day of March, June, September, or December. Holders may apply to the Commissioner to seek a longer reporting period of two consecutive quarters either as a “one-off” or on an ongoing basis. Table 3: The UCM Act’s reporting and transfer periods Reporting period Transfer of money and information by 1 January – 31 March 20 May 1 April – 30 June 20 August 1 July – 30 September 20 November 1 October – 31 December 20 February Example 42 Really Big Bank (RBB) has noted that three deposits of money will be deemed unclaimed on the 1st of March. These will be reported as unclaimed for the quarter 1 January – 31 March. RBB will have one month and 20 days from the end of the quarter to make reasonable efforts to locate the owners. However, as the money became unclaimed at the beginning of March, RBB can start seeking the owners in early March. If the owners cannot be located, it must transfer any relevant information and the deposits to the Commissioner by 20 May. Transitional periods Due to the change in timelines from the old deeming periods to the new five-year deeming period, transitional provisions are necessary. To assist in explaining the money that will be Page 60 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 affected by the reforms, it is helpful to distinguish between the “flow” and “stock” of unclaimed money. Flow For present purposes, “flow” refers to money which becomes unclaimed (that is, satisfies the five-year deeming period) the day on which the Amendment Act receives Royal assent, and in the days which follow. Holders of money that becomes unclaimed the day the Amendment Act receives Royal assent will be subject to the new reporting requirements unless they apply for the extended reporting period available to applicants in the new section 8(5)(c) of the Act. However, for most holders, the first reporting period will commence on 1 April 2021 (refer to table 3 above). Where a holder requires more time to update its computer systems to comply with the reforms, the holder will need to apply to the Commissioner for an extension of the reporting period. Where a holder receives the maximum available extension, the relevant reporting and transfer dates are as follows: Table 4: Reporting timetable for money that becomes unclaimed on or after 30 March 2021 Amendment Act receives assent Date money becomes UCM under the new definition First reporting period end date Date to transfer UCM and file return by Maximum extension of first reporting period Extension to transfer UCM and file return by 30 March 2021 30 March 2021 30 June 2021 20 August 2021 31 March 2023 20 May 2023 Holders who are granted the full extension will be reporting on all amounts deemed unclaimed money over the preceding 24-month period. Normal reporting requirements will then apply to these holders’ second reporting period. This means that holders will be required to report quarterly unless the holder has applied for an alternative reporting period of two consecutive quarters (that is, six months) which has been approved by the Commissioner under section 8(5)(b). Stock The reforms also contain transitional provisions to deal with the large amount of money which will be rendered unclaimed money overnight once the reforms implement the five- year qualifying period. Page 61 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 The issue of “stock” arises because the prior regime had longer deeming periods of either six or 25 years depending on the category of unclaimed money. 7 Once the reforms take effect, the five-year deeming period will apply “instantly” to the pool of money (“stock”) which had not yet qualified as unclaimed money under the previous deeming periods. Money which falls into the category of “stock” must be transferred to the Commissioner within the period which is two years after the Amendment Act receives Royal assent. This is expressed in section 210(5) of the ARFERM Act 2021. As the reforms received the Royal assent on 30 March 2021, the “stock” of unclaimed money must be transferred to the Commissioner no later than 30 March 2023.This deadline applies irrespective of any extension in reporting period applied for under section 8(5)(c) of the Act. Unclaimed money yet to be transferred under the previous regime The previous regime imposed a reporting calendar upon holders. For the 2021 year, this ran from 1 June 2020 to 31 May 2021. If the UCM Act had remained unchanged, the required steps of a holder in 2021would have looked like this: Table 5: Due dates under the former regime 01/06/2020– 31/05/2021 01/06/2021 30/06/2021 30/09/2021 31/10/2021 UCM accrues Holders enter particulars of unclaimed money arising in the past year into their registers. Holders write to owners of unclaimed money by post. Holders send list of unclaimed money to the Commissioner. Holders transfer any remaining unclaimed money to the Commissioner. Money deemed unclaimed between 1 June 2020 and the day prior to enactment would usually not have been transferred to Inland Revenue until 31 October 2021. However, as the reforms come into force mid-way through this reporting calendar, some holders will hold money which has become unclaimed but has not yet been transferred to Inland Revenue. This category of money does not fit easily within the categories of “stock” and “flow” which we have described above. Therefore, to assist holders in managing the transfer of this unclaimed money, (section 210(7) of the ARFERM Act 2021) allows holders to transfer it over two years, along with the category of “stock” noted above. This means that holders must transfer such money within the period which is two years after the day the reforms receive Royal assent. 7 These two categories were described as fixed term deposits and renewing term deposits. In the case of fixed term deposits, the prior regime required the money to have been unclaimed by its owner for a period of 6 years. Conversely, in the case of a renewing term deposit, the prior regime required the money to have been left for a period of 25 years. Page 62 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Capacity of trustees The reforms insert a new section 11B which affirms the principle that a person acting in the capacity of a trustee of a trust acts in a capacity which is separate from the person’s other capacities. These other capacities include the person’s personal capacity, their capacity as a body corporate which is a legal person, or as a trustee of another trust. Therefore, in applying the institutional approach to account interaction, holders should be mindful that a person’s interaction with an account of a trust of which they are a trustee cannot be taken as interaction with an account which they hold in their personal capacity, or in their capacity as trustee of another trust. However, there will be situations in which a person’s interaction with an institution may establish interaction in more than one capacity. An example might be where a person is able to log into his or her online banking “portal” and view both personal accounts and any accounts of which they are a trustee. Accessing accounts in this way will constitute interaction with all the accounts accessed. The deeming period will therefore not commence in connection with any of the linked accounts. Amounts no longer claimable under the reforms ( sections 11(6) – (8) of the UCM Act) The reforms make three categories of money received or held by the Commissioner unclaimable. These are amounts which:  have been unclaimed money for 25 years or more  have no identifying information, or  are $100 or less. Amounts that fall within these categories are removed from the list of unclaimed money by the Commissioner and may not be claimed by their owners. In each case, these amounts cease to be unclaimed money when they meet the requirements for delisting by the Commissioner. The Crown becomes the owner of this money. Amounts aged 25 years or older Previously there was no time limit on an owner’s ability to claim money held by the Commissioner. This meant an owner could make a claim for money which had accrued as long ago as the regime’s beginning in 1908. However, the longer the money remains with Inland Revenue, the less likely it is to be returned to its owner. This is typically due to incomplete information or a lack of eligible claimants. The reforms introduce a time bar of 25 years upon an owner’s ability to claim money from the Commissioner. A time bar allows Inland Revenue to focus public resources on the Page 63 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 amounts of unclaimed money which have the best chance of being reunited with their owners, while also allowing sufficient time for owners to claim their money. Un-associated amounts Amounts of unclaimed money which have no information associated with them are referred to as “un-associated amounts”. It is impossible for the Commissioner or the fund owners to establish an entitlement to these amounts. Amounts $100 or less Although holders are not required to pay amounts of $100 or less to the Commissioner, they may transfer such amounts to Inland Revenue if they choose. Amendments to other Acts Defining the UCM Act as an Inland Revenue Act (schedule 1 of the Tax Administration Act 1994) The reforms amend the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) to bring the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 within the Inland Revenue Acts included in Schedule 1 of the TAA. This will allow Inland Revenue to use the existing tax information which it holds in its system to assist in validating claims. This should increase the likelihood of owners being reunited with their money. Disclosure permitted (schedule 7, part A, clause 13C of the TAA) As the UCM Act will become an Inland Revenue Act, administrative matters will be covered by the general confidentiality provisions of the TAA in section 18. The amendment creates a specific exclusion from the confidentiality provisions of the TAA which will allow the publication of unclaimed money data. This will allow the Commissioner to publish searchable information on Inland Revenue’s website and make it easier for owners to find and claim funds. This information will include the name of the owner and the amount, the name of the holder who sent Inland Revenue the unclaimed money, and broad physical location of where the money was located (for example, Christchurch). Due to the inclusion as an Inland Revenue Act, the bespoke secrecy provision in section 12 of the UCM Act is no longer necessary and has been repealed. Page 64 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Extension of binding rulings regime (section 91C(1)(db) of the TAA) The TAA has been amended to include the UCM Act within the binding rulings regime. This allows Inland Revenue to make binding rulings in respect of matters affected by the UCM Act to offer certainty to taxpayers as to the Commissioner’s application of the UCM Act. Alignment of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 with the reforms (section 83(1)(a) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006) Section 83(1)(a) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 deals with KiwiSaver contributions that the Commissioner is unable to administer in accordance with the UCM Act due to insufficient information. Inland Revenue acts as a holder for the purpose of these funds and is subject to the unclaimed money rules. This amendment aligns section 83 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 with the new five-year deeming period. Consolidation of deeming period under KiwiSaver Act 2006 (section 83(3)(ab) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006) Previously, under the KiwiSaver Act 2006, different dates could apply to determine when employee and employer KiwiSaver contributions were deemed to be in the Commissioner’s possession. This could create administrative issues where it has not been possible to associate the contribution with a specific member. To simplify this process, the date the money is in the Commissioner’s possession will be deemed to be the last day of the month to which the employment income information applies for the purposes of unclaimed KiwiSaver contributions. Allowing use of unclaimed money to offset a tax liability (section 173V of the TAA) The reforms insert the new section 173V into the TAA. This section allows a taxpayer with a valid claim to an amount of unclaimed money held by the Commissioner to apply all or some of that amount to a liability the taxpayer owes to Inland Revenue. This option is available to taxpayers on a voluntary basis. Page 65 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Mycoplasma Bovis tax issue (Sections CZ 37, EH 1, EH 5, EH 13, EH 35, EH 36, EH 61, EZ 4B, EZ 80, EZ 81, YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007) These amendments enable the taxable income arising from the culling of certain qualifying Mycoplasma bovis affected livestock to be spread over six income years. Background Some farmers have significant unexpected taxable income through their herds being culled following a primary sector and government decision to eradicate Mycoplasma bovis in New Zealand. Federated Farmers requested an amendment to ensure there would be no income tax implications from culling and replacing dairy and beef cattle impacted by Mycoplasma bovis. They cited the special treatment given to depreciation recovery income on buildings damaged by the Christchurch and the Hurunui-Kaikōura earthquakes as a precedent. The issue arises for farmers who have used a cost-based method (that is, national standard cost (NSC) and the self-assessed cost scheme) 8 to value their breeding stock on hand for tax purposes. This is because the difference between the total proceeds received from the cull and the cost of the stock is income. This creates a cash-flow issue for those farmers who purchase replacement livestock after the cull. The replacement stock is valued at its purchase price and cannot, for tax purposes, be immediately written down to the homebred cost to offset the income. To avoid this outcome, the legislative changes enable the proceeds from the cull to be transferred from the year of the cull and to be spread evenly over the following six income years. This ability to spread is optional. Key features The income can only be spread if:  The business has been subject to Biosecurity Security New Zealand requiring a cull of Mycoplasma bovis affected stock.  The business is a dairy or a beef breeding operation, with the breeding stock that is culled being valued under NSC or the cost price method. The expectation is that the 8 The NSC scheme values the animals at, if the animal is homebred, a standard cost (determined by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue) for the respective age and type of animal that reflects that animal’s average costs of production, or at its purchase cost if the stock is purchased. The self-assessed cost scheme involves farmers using their own farm costs rather than standard costs. It is a Commissioner approved “cost price method” under section EC 25. Its details are set out in Tax Information Bulletin, Volume 4, No.7, March 1993, Appendix A. Page 66 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 breeding stock that is culled comprises mainly mixed-aged cows, in combination with any other class of breeding stock.  The stock is substantially replaced through purchasing equivalent breeding stock by the end of the income year following the cull year.  The replacement stock continues to be valued using, as relevant, NSC or the cost price method. This is to ensure that farmers cannot enter the herd scheme on more advantageous terms than those not affected by Mycoplasma bovis. Given that a livestock owner might use a couple of valuation methods in combination, 9 not all of the breeding stock might be valued at cost. However, only the income derived from the culling of the breeding stock valued under NSC or the cost price method can be spread. For this purpose, breeding stock includes immature female stock intended for future breeding in the business. Owners of the affected livestock, including sharemilkers, are covered, that is, the ability to spread income from the cull is not be limited to just the owners of farmland with livestock. The qualifying proceeds from the cull would comprise payments from the slaughterhouse, top-up compensation from the government for the difference between the normal market value for the stock and the payments from the slaughterhouse, and in some cases, further compensation to cover the additional cost of purchasing equivalent replacement stock. The income arising from the culling of stock valued under another valuation method, or stock culled from a fattening stock business valued under NSC, do not qualify for this spreading provision. The Income Equalisation Scheme is available in those circumstances to mitigate the income implications of the cull. Livestock owners who have previously made deposits into the Income Equalisation Scheme or the now repealed Adverse Events Income Equalisation Scheme to mitigate the impact of the additional income, can retrospectively switch to the income spread. In such cases, the tax effects of the deposit will be reversed. Application date The amendments apply for the 2017–18 and later income years. Detailed analysis The Act amends the Income Tax Act 2007. 9 For example, an owner might use the herd scheme in conjunction with NSC (the alternative valuation option). Page 67 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Relevant current legislation The livestock valuation rules are contained in subpart EC of the Income Tax Act 2007, including the requirements that apply when using multiple valuation options and the restrictions on switching between valuation options. These rules ensure that the cost of stock on hand is valued appropriately and that the cost of purchases is not deducted ahead of their being sold. Precondition for the spread (section EZ 4B(1)) New section EZ 4B(1) sets out the following preconditions:  A person needs to have, as part of their business, mixed-age cows on hand at the start of the cull year that they use for breeding and those cows need to be valued under either NSC or the cost price method at the end of the income year before the cull year. The cull year would need to be before the 2028–29 income year. (The focus on mixed-age cows is to ensure that the spread is provided to those who have sizeable additional income as a result of the cull given that female breeding stock make up a high proportion of a standard herd. The 2028–29 income year cut-off is in the expectation that Mycoplasma bovis should be less significant by that stage).  In the cull year, some or all of the person’s cattle need to be destroyed, because of Mycoplasma bovis, using the powers in either sections 121 or 122 of the Biosecurity Act 1993 that enable Biosecurity New Zealand to examine organisms and give directions. (Normally the whole herd is destroyed but in some isolated cases only a portion needs to be destroyed).  A significant portion of the culled stock need to be replaced by the end of the income year following the cull year. The expectation is that the culled livestock are replaced with purchased stock. Specifically, the requirement is that the number of mixed-age cows valued under the national standard cost scheme or the cost price method that the person has on hand (or expects to have on hand) at the end of the income year following the cull year is at least seventy five percent of the number of mixed-age cows valued under the national standard cost scheme or the cost price method that the person had on hand at the start of the cull year. The spread (sections EZ 4B(2), (3) and (5) to (13)) There are two parts to the spread. Section EZ 4B(2) enables the income calculated under section EZ 4B(5) to be spread evenly over the six income years following the cull year. Section EZ 4B(3) spreads the deduction that the livestock owner would otherwise be able to claim under section EC 2 for the equivalent number of stock. 10 Their combined effect is that the net income arising from the culling of the relevant livestock is spread. 10 Section EC 2 provides a deduction at the beginning of the cull year for the value of stock on hand at the end of the preceding income year. Page 68 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 For the income spread component, the formula in section EZ 4B(5) is: Σ(number × (sale proceeds + compensation) ÷ culled stock) This formula works on a livestock class basis, where:  Σ is the summation of the amounts calculated using the formula for each of the following classes of each of the beef cattle and dairy cattle types of livestock: (a) rising 1 year heifers (b) rising 2 year heifers (c) mixed-age cows; and (d) breeding bulls.  Number, for a class of livestock, is the number that is the lesser of: (a) the number calculated using the formula in section EZ4B(12): valuation method breeding stock + culled stock − opening stock (b) the number of livestock of that class that: (i) were breeding stock or stock that the person expected to be capable of, and intended be used for, breeding upon reaching maturity, and (ii) the person valued under NSC or the cost price method in the income year before the cull year.  Sale proceeds, for a class of livestock, is the amount of income the person derives from the disposal of the livestock of that class that are part of the destroyed cattle.  Compensation, for a class of livestock, is the amount of compensation which the person is entitled to under section 162A of the Biosecurity Act 1993 and that the person receives by the end of the income year following the cull year for: (a) the difference between the stock’s market value and the sale proceeds; and (b) the cost of the replacement cattle of the same class being greater than the total amount received in relation to the stock it replaces.  Culled stock, for a class of livestock, is the number of livestock of that class that are part of the destroyed cattle.  Valuation method breeding stock is the number of livestock of that class that: (i) were breeding stock or stock that the person expected to be capable of, and intended be used for, breeding upon reaching maturity; and (ii) the person valued under NSC or the cost price method in the income year before the cull year. Page 69 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021  Opening stock is the number of livestock of that class that the person had on hand at the start of the cull year. The formula takes into account the possibility that a livestock owner might be using more than one valuation method to value the stock and might reduce the number on NSC or the cost price method between the start of the cull year and the cull date. When all the stock are on NSC or the cost price method, stock numbers are constant and all stock is culled, then the formula simplifies to just the sales proceeds plus compensation. If there is an increase in livestock numbers for a class over the cull year, those additional stock are excluded from the spread through section EZ 4B(8)(b) which caps “number” at the number of livestock of that class on hand at the beginning of the cull year and valued in the previous year under either NSC or the cost price method. Person ceasing business (section EZ 4B(4)) Should a person cease carrying on the business in which they use the relevant livestock, section EZ 4B(4) requires any unallocated amount of spread income and deduction to be allocated to the cessation year. In the case of a sole trader, the person would effectively cease business once probate has been granted, but with a company, the death of a shareholder would not automatically trigger an allocation of the remaining spread. In the case of a look through company or a partnership, the owner or partner who has died would effectively cease their proportion of the business which would trigger an allocation of their proportion of the remaining spread. Notification (sections EZ 4B(14) to (16)) Those taking up the spreading option need to notify Inland Revenue in writing. This can be done electronically. Section EZ 4B(14) requires an election to be made by the date of filing the taxpayer’s return of income for the 2020–21 income year, if the cull year is the 2020–21 income year or earlier, and by the date of filing their return for the cull year in any other case. The additional compliance costs from this notification requirement would be small given the anticipated small number of farmers affected by Mycoplasma bovis. The amount of income and tax involved is significant for each affected taxpayer so knowing who has taken up this option will also be helpful from a compliance perspective. The election is irrevocable, but under section EZ 4B(16) is treated as not being made if, at the end of the income year following the cull year, the number of mixed-age cows on hand that were valued under one of the cost schemes is less than seventy five percent of the equivalent pre-cull levels. This is to ensure that there has been material replacement of the culled stock. Page 70 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Enabling switching from the Main Income Equalisation Account or Adverse Events Income Equalisation Account to the income spread (S ections CZ 37, EH 1, EH 5, EH 13, EH 35, EH 36, EH 61, EZ 4B, EZ 80, EZ 81) As culls began in 2017, some Mycoplasma bovis-affected farmers will by now have made deposits into the Main Income Equalisation Scheme (MIES) or the now repealed Adverse Event Income Equalisation Scheme (AEIES), to mitigate the tax consequences created by the cull. The legislation gives Mycoplasma-bovis affected farmers that made such deposits the option of retrospectively switching to the proposed six-year income spread provided the tax effects of the relevant deposits are reversed and the election is made by the date of filing their return of income for the 2020–21 income year. The spread is likely to be better at mitigating the income effects as in many cases the deposits will have needed to be withdrawn after a year to fund the purchase of replacement stock. Under normal circumstances, a deposit into the MIES or AEIES results in a deduction for the livestock owner, for the amount of the deposit, and a withdrawal of a MIES or AEIES deposit results in equivalent income. However, deposits in any one year cannot exceed net income. If deposits in a year exceed this maximum, the excess needs to be refunded. This concept is built upon in the new legislation to achieve the necessary reversals of the tax effects of deposits made in relation to the income that is now to be spread. It also means that the tax effects of deposits in relation to other income are not reversed. Reversal of deduction for the deposit Specifically, a retrospective amendment to section EH 35 (meaning of main maximum deposit) ensures that the spread is included in the calculation of the maximum deposit and, therefore, automatically leads to a reversal of the earlier deductions for the deposit, to the extent the maximum deposit is then exceeded. A comparable change has been made to section EH 61 to include the spread in the meaning of adverse event maximum deposit. Reversal of income from withdrawal of deposit Any such excess deposit is refundable. This is separate from any earlier excess deposit that arose under the standard provisions (respectively, sections EH 8 and EH 42) that require Inland Revenue to refund amounts that exceed the maximum deposit. Sections EZ 80 and EZ 81 treat this refund as excluded income (and therefore as not taxable) to negate any income that would have arisen when the deposit was withdrawn – see section EZ 80 (6)(b) and EZ 81(6)(b) in conjunction with section CZ 37(2). Sections EZ 80(8) and EZ 81(8) stipulate that section EZ 80 and EZ 81 respectively override sections EH 8 and EH 42. This override is necessary to distinguish when Inland Revenue needs to repay any additional excess deposits arising from the spread, from any other excess deposit situation. Sections EH 8 and EH 42 envisage the automatic refund of an excess deposit soon after the end of the accounting year. They were therefore considered to be Page 71 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 impracticable for an election to spread the income which is made retrospectively and may involve amounts that have already been refunded under other provisions. To the extent that the excess deposit has not already been withdrawn, sections EZ 80(2) and EZ 81(2) require Inland Revenue to pay it out as soon as practicable after the election to use the spread is made. Practicably, the revised income tax returns outlining the spread amount will be necessary for Inland Revenue to calculate any remaining deposit amounts that need to be repaid. Refunds are to first come from the deposits made for the accounting year in which the excess arose. In many cases an excess amount will likely have already been refunded through a standard withdrawal request, to pay for replacement livestock. Therefore, if there are insufficient remaining deposit amounts to fully refund the excess deposit, sections EZ 80(5) and EZ 81(5) provide ordering rules (starting with the earliest refunded deposits) to determine which, and how much, of the deposits for that accounting year that have been already refunded under other provisions (sections EH 13 and EH 15 but not EH 8), are instead treated as being refunded under sections EZ 80 and EZ 81. This means that those refunds change from being income to being excluded income. Treatment of interest Any interest paid or payable on the deposits, under sections EH 6 (interest on deposits in main income equalisation account) and EH 40 (interest on deposits in adverse event equalisation account), will still stand and be income. Interest on any excess deposits is calculated to the date the election is made (see sections EZ 80(7) and EZ 81(7) which respectively modify sections EH 6 and EH 40 to achieve this). Example 43 A livestock owner deposits $200,000 into their MIES account in their 2018–19 accounting year. As the maximum deposit that they could make at that stage was $120,000, $80,000 was refunded under section EH 8 (and is excluded income). With the passage of the new legislation, the person decides to take up the income spread option for the 2018–19 accounting year. This reduces their maximum deposit amount to $0, in which case Inland Revenue now needs to refund a further $120,000 (which is also treated as excluded income, and no deduction can be claimed for that deposit amount). $100,000 of deposits for 2018–19 have already been withdrawn (ignoring the $80,000 refunded under section EH 8). Those withdrawals are now treated as refunds under new section EZ 80. The remaining $20,000 not already withdrawn is also refunded under section EZ 80. Interest on the $20,000 is still payable as those funds have been in the scheme for more than one year. The $100,000 withdrawn earlier did not meet this standard timing test to qualify for any interest. Page 72 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Example 44 A livestock owner deposits $150,000 into their MIES account in their 2018–19 accounting year, the maximum deposit that they could make. This comprises $100,000 for the additional net income arising from the cull of their herd in that year, plus $50,000 in relation to other income. With the passage of the new legislation, the person decides to take up the income spread option for the 2018–19 accounting year. This reduces their maximum deposit amount to $50,000. As none of the $150,000 deposited for that year has been withdrawn, under section EZ 80 Inland Revenue now needs to refund $100,000 (which is treated as excluded income, and no deduction can be claimed that deposit amount). Under section EH 6, interest is payable on the full $150,000. Interest is payable on the $100,000 up to the date of the election. Interest is payable on the remaining $50,000 up until the deposit is refunded, either because it has been withdrawn or the maximum deposit period has expired (whichever is earlier). The maximum deposit period ends five years after the end of the accounting year for which the deposit was made. Consequential changes Consequential changes have been made to sections EH 1, EH 5, EH 13, EH 36, YA 1 and the former EZ 80 (now EZ 82) to update them for the new provisions. Already filed income tax returns Since the spread applies from the 2017–18 income year, taxpayers who take up the spread for a past year, can now request that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue amend their relevant past assessments, under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Previously, up to the enactment of the legislation, Inland Revenue had been allowing instalment arrangements to be entered into in relation to the tax due for the 2018–19 income year, to match the proposed spread.

Background Section LY 5(1), as previously written, defined R&D expenditure as being eligible to the extent to which it was:  incurred on an eligible R&D activity in the relevant income year  described in schedule 21B, part A (which lists the categories of expenditure that are eligible for R&D tax credits), and  not described in schedule 21B, part B (which lists the categories of expenditure that are ineligible for R&D tax credits). These tests did not specify how closely the expenditure had to be connected to an R&D activity to be eligible. To ensure that expenditure claimed has sufficient nexus with the eligible R&D being conducted, the amendment clarifies that expenditure is only eligible if it is directly related to, required for, and integral to the R&D taking place. Application date This amendment applies from the beginning of the R&D tax credit regime, which is the 2019–20 income year. The amendment is a simple clarification that expenditure must be directly connected with R&D to be eligible and is not intended as a change in policy, or to change the way the law currently operates. It should therefore not affect R&D tax credit claims already filed and should provide future claimants with more explicit legislative direction regarding what expenditure may be eligible for the credit. Key features The amendment adds new tests to the definition of eligible R&D expenditure for the R&D tax incentive, as prescribed in section LY 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007, to clarify that only expenditure directly connected with an eligible R&D activity is eligible. The amendment does this by adding in the following requirements, so that expenditure is only eligible if it is:  directly related to conducting an R&D activity Page 76 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021  required for conducting an R&D activity, and  integral to conducting an R&D activity. The existing requirement that expenditure must be listed in schedule 21B, part A and not in schedule 21B, part B also applies. All section references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Detailed analysis The amendment to section LY 5(1)(a) inserts a requirement that expenditure must be directly related to, required for, and integral to an eligible R&D activity to be eligible for the credit. These are in addition to the existing requirements in the section that expenditure must be listed in schedule 21B, part A and not described by schedule 21B, part B. Directly relates to (new section LY 5(1)(a)(i)) The “directly relates to” requirement clarifies that expenditure must have a direct connection to an R&D activity to be eligible. A person must make a reasonable assessment of whether their expenditure has a sufficiently close connection to R&D to be eligible. If a person’s expenditure relates to an R&D activity, but also relates to another purpose, the person must apportion the expenditure accordingly. This requirement is intended to ensure that expenditure that is too remote from the R&D activity to which it relates is not eligible for the credit. Requiring expenditure to directly relate to an R&D activity clarifies the policy intent, which is that only expenditure that closely relates to an R&D activity should be eligible. Example 45: Expenditure must directly relate to R&D to be eligible for the credit LiamCo operates a mixed-use facility in Auckland, where fifty percent of the facility is devoted to R&D, while the other fifty percent is used for HR for LiamCo’s operations across New Zealand. LiamCo has an ongoing contract with a cleaning company to clean its Auckland facility. LiamCo’s payments to the cleaning company would be eligible expenditure where they relate to cleaning the R&D area of the facility (while used for eligible R&D), because they directly relate to performing eligible R&D. However, the costs of cleaning the HR work area would not be eligible, even though HR spends some time supporting R&D staff, because these costs have no direct connection with performing R&D. Required for and integral to (new section LY 5(1)(a)(ii) and (iii)) The “required for” requirement clarifies that expenditure is only eligible to the degree it is necessary to support an R&D activity. The “integral to” requirement clarifies that expenditure Page 77 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 must be essential to an R&D activity to be eligible. That is, the activity could not be performed or completed without the expenditure. Similarities with supporting activity limb These two requirements are taken from the definition of supporting R&D activity in section LY 2(3)(a). A supporting R&D activity is an activity that contributes to and is necessary for a core R&D activity (a core R&D activity is one that resolves scientific or technological uncertainty, via a systematic method, in order to produce new knowledge or things). The policy intent is that supporting activities must be very closely connected to a core activity in order to be eligible, and the tests required by the supporting R&D activity definition are designed to necessitate this close connection. The policy intent for R&D expenditure is likewise that it must be closely connected with an eligible R&D activity to be eligible for the credit. Replicating part of the supporting R&D activity tests for the definition of eligible R&D expenditure clarifies that there must be a close connection between expenditure and an R&D activity for the expenditure to be eligible. This ensures the legislation matches the policy intent. Example 46: Expenditure must be required for and integral to the R&D To the extent that their duties relate to eligible R&D, expenditure on the salaries of staff at LiamCo’s Auckland facility is eligible for the credit, as it is required for and integral to the R&D taking place. This includes the salaries of LiamCo’s R&D staff, but also the salaries of the HR staff inasmuch as their duties relate to the R&D staff, as this expenditure is considered required for and integral to R&D (it relates to the performance of R&D and the R&D could not be performed without it). However, the HR staff at the Auckland facility also perform HR duties for LiamCo’s operations nationwide. The salaries of the HR staff cannot be claimed to the extent that their duties do not relate to R&D staff, as this expenditure is not required for R&D. In addition to their salaries, staff at the facility receive a number of employee benefits, such as discounted gym subscriptions and on-site childcare facilities. These benefits are optional and are not factored into an employee’s remuneration package. While some R&D staff may use these facilities, they are not integral to the R&D taking place; R&D could still be performed even if these benefits were not provided. Expenditure on these benefits is therefore not eligible. "Only or main purpose” test not included Not all of the supporting activity tests are included in the amended eligible expenditure definition in section LY 5. In particular, the “only or main purpose” requirement has not been included, as this test would go beyond the policy intent by requiring that expenditure be incurred only or mainly for the purpose of supporting an R&D activity to be eligible. For example, a business does R&D in a lab, which forms part of a larger complex that also includes non-R&D facilities. The R&D portion of the total complex is twenty five percent. The Page 78 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 policy intent is that twenty five percent of the rent be eligible for the credit; however, an “only or main purpose” test may completely exclude the rent. Therefore, the “only or main purpose” has not been included in the amendment. Businesses not obligated to minimise expenditure As with the supporting R&D activity tests, the new “required for” and “integral to” expenditure tests do not obligate a business to adopt the cheapest possible approach to its R&D. For instance, one business may want the highest possible quality for materials and equipment used in R&D, while another may be satisfied with a lower standard. In both cases the expenditure required for and integral to the R&D activity is eligible. Similarly, businesses may go about their research in different ways. Expenditure that is required for an approach that a business has chosen is not disqualified simply because another business might have chosen a cheaper option. Example 47: Business not obligated to minimise expenditure Loud Co is performing eligible R&D to develop new drilling equipment for use in constructing tunnels. Their equipment emits noise at a volume damaging to human hearing, so, to protect its employees’ (and future customers’) health and safety, Loud Co incorporates noise-reducing technologies into the design of its drilling equipment. At the same time, Equally Loud Co is performing R&D on similar equipment. Rather than altering the design of the equipment, Equally Loud Co addresses the problem more cheaply by buying noise-cancelling earmuffs for all of its employees working on the drill. Both Loud Co’s expenditure on reducing the noise of the drill and Equally Loud Co’s expenditure on earmuffs are eligible for the credit. It does not matter that Loud Co could have taken a cheaper approach to solve the issue. Existing requirements in section LY 5(1)(a) and (b) still apply Schedule 21B, pa rt A To be eligible, expenditure must be described in schedule 21B, part A, which provides a list of expenditure that may be eligible for the R&D tax credit (section LY 5(1)(a)). This requirement is not affected by the new amendment and continues to apply as before. Schedule 21B, pa rt B If expenditure is described in schedule 21B, part B, it is not eligible for the R&D tax credit (section LY 5(1)(b)). This requirement is also not affected by the new amendment and continues to apply as before. “To the extent” test still applies Page 79 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 The amendment removes the “to the extent” test (which ensures that expenditure is only eligible to the extent to which it is incurred on an R&D activity) from LY 5(1)(a). However, the test still applies to R&D expenditure because it is explicitly referred to in each of the clauses in schedule 21B, part A. Each of the clauses in this schedule stipulates that expenditure in that category is only eligible to the extent to which this expenditure relates to performing an R&D activity. Example 48: Eligible R&D expenditure under the new requirements GeneriCo is a company whose main business activity is performing R&D. It files its supplementary return for the 2020–21 income year. GeneriCo can claim the costs of employees performing eligible R&D, as well as costs for other staff to the extent that their duties are required for and integral to performing R&D. For instance, GeneriCo can claim the cost of HR staff to the extent that they are supporting R&D staff, cleaning staff to the extent that they are cleaning facilities used for R&D, and payroll staff to the extent that they are paying R&D staff. However, GeneriCo cannot claim expenditure with a less direct connection to R&D. For instance, it cannot claim the cost of payroll staff to the extent that they are paying HR staff who are supporting R&D staff, or cleaning staff to the extent that they are cleaning the offices of payroll staff who are paying R&D staff, and so on. This is because these costs do not directly relate to an R&D activity. GeneriCo can claim rent, utilities, insurance, and other expenses necessary to operate its R&D- performing facility in Christchurch, to the extent that the expenses relate to the performance of eligible R&D activities. However, GeneriCo cannot claim the costs of its on-site cafeteria or grounds maintenance costs at the facility. These costs are not required for or integral to the performance of R&D – R&D could still take place at the facility even in the absence of these costs. Variation of facts: Under the previous expenditure rules The legislation previously required that expenditure be on an activity but gave no direction as to how closely the expenditure must be connected to the activity. Without the clarification provided by this amendment, this could allow GeneriCo to claim costs that are only loosely connected with R&D, contrary to the policy intent (which is that only expenditure that closely relates to and is reasonably necessary for performing R&D should be eligible). For instance, GeneriCo might interpret the law in a way that allows it to claim the full cost of its staff for the credit; as GeneriCo’s main business is performing R&D, all staff costs could be considered as necessary to support the performance of R&D activities. Likewise, as they are part of the costs of a facility used solely for R&D activities, GeneriCo might interpret the law in a way that allows it to claim the costs of the staff cafeteria or maintaining the grounds at its Christchurch facility. Page 80 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Exclusions in relation to miners (Schedule 21, parts A and B, and schedule 21B, part B of the Income Tax Act 2007) This amendment clarifies the treatment of capital assets used in the petroleum and mineral mining industries for the purposes of the tax credit regime and aligns it with the existing treatment of depreciable assets used in other industries. Background The intent is that the upfront cost of capital assets is not generally eligible for the R&D tax credit. This is achieved through a number of expenditure exclusions in schedule 21B part B of the Act (which lists categories of ineligible expenditure) that target various types of expenditure on depreciable property. Most industries use the depreciation rules when amortising their assets for tax purposes, and their assets are therefore caught by the exclusions, as intended. However, assets used in the petroleum and mineral mining industries have their own tax treatments, set out in subparts DT and DU (respectively) of the Act. As these tax treatments are not technically depreciation, assets used in the mining industry are therefore not considered depreciable and are thus not covered by the existing expenditure exclusions in schedule 21B part B that relate to depreciable property. A taxpayer can thus claim the full upfront cost of these assets for the credit, contrary to the policy intent. To ensure that the upfront costs of assets used in the mining industry are not inappropriately eligible for the credit, the amendment adds a new clause to schedule 21B part B that specifically excludes the cost of these assets from being eligible. Key features The amendment adds a new expenditure exclusion that excludes assets used in the petroleum and mineral mining industries, using language which aligns with the petroleum and mining tax regimes that already exist in the Income Tax Act 2007 (“the Act”). It achieves this by excluding expenditure or loss by a “petroleum miner” or “mineral miner” (as defined in section YA 1 of the Act). The new exclusion includes exceptions for labour costs that contribute to core R&D and for prototypes (parallel to the treatment of tangible depreciable property). To ensure the exclusion covers the same range of industries as the existing activity exclusion on prospecting for, exploring for, or drilling for, minerals, petroleum, natural gas, or geothermal energy, miners of “minerals” (as defined in section YA 1 of the Act) and geothermal energy are explicitly covered by the exclusion. As its intent is covered by the new exclusion, the amendments also repeal the existing activity exclusion. Page 81 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Application date The amendment applies from the beginning of the R&D tax credit scheme, which is the 2019–20 income year (1 April 2019 for most taxpayers). Detailed analysis The amendment adds a new clause, clause 3B, to schedule 21B part B of the Act, which lists categories of excluded expenditure for the R&D tax credit. Clause 3B excludes expenditure or loss incurred by a petroleum miner, mineral miner, or a person who would be a mineral miner of geothermal energy and “minerals” (in the broader sense defined in section YA 1 of the Act). Assets used in petroleum and mineral mining have their own tax regimes in the Act (subparts DT and DU). These regimes centre on the terms “petroleum miner” and “mineral miner,” as defined in the Act. These terms are linked to a number of expenditure-related defined terms, such as “mining development expenditure” and “petroleum development expenditure,” which provide for the alternative tax treatment of assets created and used by miners when undertaking mining activities. Anchoring the clause to the definitions of a petroleum miner or mineral miner thus excludes all expenditure that falls within these expenditure-related terms. The petroleum and mineral miner definitions, and the expenditure-related terms that depend on them, only affect a taxpayer in their capacity as a miner. Any R&D activities performed by a business involved in mining that meet the other legislative requirements could therefore potentially be claimed for the credit, so long as it is not performed by the business in their capacity as a miner. This is in line with the policy intent, which is to exclude the cost of assets used in the mining industries from the tax credit while still allowing a credit for R&D performed in these industries. As its intent and function is similar to existing exclusions on tangible depreciable property, clause 3B contains similar exceptions for labour costs that contribute to core R&D and for prototypes only used in R&D (refer to Amendment to tangible depreciable property exclusion, for a detailed analysis of how these exceptions work). This brings the treatment of expenditure on assets in the mining industries fully into line with the treatment of expenditure on depreciable tangible property in other industries. The mining regimes in the Act include terminology that covers the intent of clause 5 of schedule 21 parts A and B (which excludes “prospecting for, exploring for, or drilling for, minerals, petroleum, natural gas, or geothermal energy” as an eligible activity). The amendments accordingly repeal clause 5 of schedule 21 parts A and B. However, the term “mineral miner” and the terms associated with it in the Act (for example, “mining prospecting expenditure,” “mining exploration expenditure”) refer only to “listed industrial minerals,” rather than minerals in the broader sense. The definition of “listed industrial minerals” in the Act does not cover some minerals intended to be covered by the Page 82 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 exclusion, such as coal. Geothermal energy, which is also covered by the present exclusion, would not be covered. To achieve the policy intent, clause 3B also deems miners of “minerals” (as defined in the Act) and geothermal energy to be “miners”. Amendment to tangible depreciable property exclusion (Schedule 21B, part B of the Income Tax Act 2007) Schedule 21B, part B, clause 3 renders expenditure or loss that contributes to the cost of tangible depreciable property ineligible for the credit, other than expenditure or loss on developing prototypes. An amendment to clause 3 ensures the exception for expenditure or loss on prototypes is working as intended, while also allowing expenditure or loss in relation to labour on core R&D activities to be eligible (regardless of whether the property is a prototype). Background Schedule 21B, part B, clause 3 excludes expenditure or loss that contributes to the cost of tangible depreciable property. An exception exists for expenditure that contributes to the cost of property intended for use solely in performing an R&D activity. This prototype exception is intended to capture expenditure required to produce items created by and solely used in core R&D activities, such as prototypes. Expenditure on tangible depreciable property that meets this test is still eligible for the tax credit. This amendment changes the exclusion in two ways. The first change amends the prototype exception. The second allows certain labour costs to be eligible, even if they contribute to the cost of tangible depreciable property. Prototype exception The policy intent of the prototype exception is to allow expenditure or loss on items of tangible depreciable property created through R&D and used solely in R&D throughout their lifetime to be eligible. However, as previously worded, the exception may have included a greater range of expenditure than was intended. The amendment brings the legislation in line with the intent by requiring, in addition to the requirement that the property must only be used in performing R&D, that the property must only be intended for use in performing R&D in the future, and that creating the property must involve a core R&D activity. Labour cost carve-in The amendment also allows labour-related expenditure or loss on an item of tangible depreciable property to be eligible for the tax credit, regardless of whether it meets the above tests, to the extent to which it relates to performing core R&D activity. This means that Page 83 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 a business can claim expenditure on employees or on contracted labour that contributes to the cost of an item of tangible depreciable property for the tax credit, even where the item of property is not intended as a prototype, to the extent that the employees or contractors are performing a core R&D activity. Usually this means an identifiable separate activity incidental to the creation of a larger item of tangible depreciable property. This is consistent with the existing inclusion for labour costs for R&D undertaken in commercial production environments and recognises that it should be easier to identify whether labour costs directly relate to R&D compared with non-labour costs, such as electricity costs. The amendment allows more genuine R&D costs to be eligible while still ensuring any fiscal risk posed by R&D projects involving significant tangible depreciable assets is minimised. Key features This amendment makes two changes to the existing exclusion on expenditure or loss that contributes to the cost of tangible depreciable property (schedule 21B, part B, clause 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007). First, it clarifies the scope of the exception for expenditure that contributes to the cost of property intended for use as a prototype (“prototype exception”), by adding further requirements that:  the property must only be intended for use in performing R&D in the future, and  creating the property must involve a core R&D activity. This ensures that the provision operates consistently with the policy intent, which is for expenditure on tangible depreciable property to be ineligible unless it is on a prototype (property that is developed through R&D and is only used in R&D). Second, it allows expenditure/loss on labour in relation to core R&D to be eligible for the credit, despite the exclusion for costs that contribute to tangible depreciable property (“labour cost carve-in”). Application date The amendment applies from the beginning of the R&D tax credit scheme, which is the 2019–20 income year (1 April 2019 for most taxpayers). Detailed analysis Clarifying the prototype exception The amendment adds further tests into the clause that ensure the prototype exception is better targeted towards the concept of a prototype. In addition to the requirement that an Page 84 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 item of property is only used in R&D, these tests require that the property’s sole intended future use is in performing R&D, and that the creation of the item involves a core R&D activity:  Sole intended future use is in performing R&D means that a person’s intent must be that the item of property will only ever be used in performing R&D activities, and never be used for any other purpose.  Creation involves a core R&D activity means that, for expenditure or loss on an item of property to be eligible, the expenditure or loss must also be incurred on performing a core R&D activity (that is, the creation of the item involves resolving a scientific or technological uncertainty via a systematic method). For expenditure or loss on an item of tangible depreciable property to be eligible, all three tests must be met. New exception for labour costs on core R&D activity The amendment also allows expenditure or loss on an item of tangible depreciable property to be eligible for the tax credit, regardless of whether it meets the above tests, to the extent to which it relates to labour costs on core R&D activity. Labour expenditure can be claimed regardless of whether it relates to employees or to contracted labour. Expenditure or loss on labour for an item of tangible depreciable property is ineligible to the extent to which the costs do not relate to performing a core R&D activity (unless the item of property meets the tests required by the prototype exception). Example 49: Tangible depreciable property exclusion and labour costs Claire’s Construction is experimenting with new construction materials that would allow the construction of lighter yet sturdier bridges. The construction of their first bridge involves some eligible R&D as it requires the resolution of scientific or technological uncertainty. Assuming the R&D is successful, Claire’s Construction intends that the bridge be used for commercial transport once it is complete. Claire’s Construction contracts a local university to provide scientific expertise to help resolve the uncertainty. The university’s scientists work alongside engineers who are directly employed by Claire’s Construction. The company also hires workers to build the bridge, who are variously employed or contracted. The cost of the scientists and engineers working to resolve the scientific or technological uncertainty involved in creating the bridge is eligible expenditure for the tax credit (as these costs relate to a core activity). However, Claire’s Construction cannot claim the cost of the workers building the bridge (as building the bridge is a supporting activity), nor any of the costs of materials or equipment. Page 85 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Other amendments to the schedule of excluded expenditure (Schedule 21B, part B of the Income Tax Act 2007) The Act makes a number of other amendments to schedule 21B, part B of the Income Tax Act 2007 clarifying what expenditure is excluded from the R&D tax credit. Key features The Act makes several additions or changes to the categories of expenditure ineligible for the R&D tax credit set out in schedule 21B, part B. These are:  Amending the exclusion on expenditure to acquire depreciable property (clause 2) to clarify that “acquiring” depreciable property, for the purposes of the exclusion, does not include making depreciable property.  Amending the exclusions on expenditure to acquire depreciable property (clause 2) and on expenditure that contributes to the cost of depreciable tangible property (clause 3) to exclude expenditure or loss on property which would have been depreciable in the absence of an election to treat it as non-depreciable under section EE 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007.  Changing the word “purchase” in the existing exclusion on expenditure to purchase land (clause 10) to “acquire”.  Changing the exclusion on professional fees incurred in determining a person’s entitlement to the tax credit (clause 13) to also cover in-house expenditure incurred in determining a person’s entitlement.  Inserting new clause 13B, which excludes expenditure or loss incurred in performing corporate governance activities.  Inserting new clause 20B, which excludes expenditure or loss incurred in decommissioning.  Inserting new clause 20C, which excludes expenditure or loss incurred in remediating land.  Changing the exclusion on expenditure or loss supported by or related to a government grant (clause 21) to allow amounts not directly supported by other forms of government funding to be claimed for the credit. Application date The amendments apply from the beginning of the R&D tax credit scheme, which is the 2019– 20 income year (1 April 2019 for most taxpayers). Page 86 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Detailed analysis Clarifying that expenditure to make depreciable property can be eligible for the credit (clause 2) An amendment to clause 2, which excludes expenditure or loss to acquire items of depreciable property, clarifies that this exclusion does not apply to expenditure or loss to make depreciable property. The policy intent is that expenditure on the upfront cost of large capital assets generally be ineligible for the credit. Instead, it is intended that depreciation loss on these assets over time be eligible (to the extent the assets are used in R&D), similar to the tax treatment of these assets. As R&D can involve the creation of a capital asset, the original intent of clause 2 was to exclude expenditure on acquiring these assets through any means other than making them. It was intended that expenditure on making depreciable property be generally eligible, subject to the other exclusions in schedule 21B part B. However, the Income Tax Act 2007 defines “acquire” to include “make” in relation to depreciable property. Under the previous wording, taxpayers were thus prevented from claiming the tax credit for any costs of making depreciable property, giving the exclusion unintended overreach. Treatment of items of property where election made under section EE 8 (clauses 2 and 3) Amendments to clause 2 (which excludes expenditure to acquire depreciable property) and clause 3 (which excludes certain expenditure that contributes to the cost of depreciable tangible property) clarify that these exclusions also apply to expenditure or loss on acquiring an item of property that would have been depreciable in the absence of an election under section EE 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The policy intent is that expenditure on the upfront cost of large capital assets generally be ineligible for the credit. Instead, it is intended that depreciation loss on these assets over time be eligible (to the extent the assets are used in R&D), similar to the tax treatment of these assets. Section EE 8 allows a taxpayer to elect that an item of property be treated as non- depreciable property (where, in the absence of this election, it would otherwise be depreciable property) upon acquisition or, in limited circumstances, a change in use. This could potentially allow taxpayers to bypass the exclusions for the upfront cost of depreciable property and claim the full upfront cost of their property as eligible expenditure, contrary to the policy intent. The amendments ensure the legislation better satisfies the policy intent by aligning the treatment of depreciable property and property that would have been depreciable absent an election under section EE 8. Changing “purchase” to “acquire” (clause 10) Clause 10 excludes expenditure to purchase land. It is not appropriate to give an R&D tax credit for land acquired for use in R&D for two reasons. The first is that it is difficult to Page 87 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 apportion what cost of the land relates to R&D, given the land could be used for non-R&D purposes later. The second reason is that land generally increases in value and therefore can be sold to recoup the cost. This amendment broadens the scope of clause 10 so that it excludes expenditure to acquire land, rather than merely to purchase it. This is consistent with the policy intent of the original exclusion, which is intended to exclude expenditure on obtaining land regardless of the method used to obtain it. Excluding in-house costs on determining tax credit entitlement (clause 13) Clause 13 excludes professional fees incurred in determining a person’s entitlement, or lack of entitlement, to an R&D tax credit. This exclusion covers fees paid to determine the eligibility of a person, activity, or amount of expenditure, such as amounts paid to an accounting firm to prepare a person’s R&D claim. The amendment broadens the scope of clause 13 to cover all expenditure or loss incurred in determining a person’s entitlement to the tax credit by replacing the words “professional fees” with “expenditure or loss.” This is intended to exclude in-house expenditure on determining entitlements, as well as the fees currently targeted by the exclusion. These amounts should be ineligible under current legislation because they do not directly relate to R&D (they do not relate to resolving scientific or technological uncertainty), but the amendment to clause 13 provides explicit legislative guidance that these costs are not eligible for the R&D tax credit. Exclusion of expenditure on corporate governance activities (new clause 13B) New clause 13B excludes expenditure or loss on performing corporate governance activities. These costs should already be ineligible under current legislation, but the new exclusion provides certainty and clarity to firms that they cannot claim these costs. These amounts are excluded because they do not directly relate to R&D. They are costs that have to be incurred regardless of whether R&D takes place. Exclusion of decommissioning expenditure (new clause 20B) New clause 20B excludes expenditure on decommissioning. This exclusion is intended to cover expenditure involved in doing the following to assets (including land):  dismantling, demolishing, disposing of, removing, or abandoning an asset  preventing access to an asset  converting an asset so that it can be used to conduct a different activity (unless it is being converted for use in R&D), and  otherwise decommissioning an asset. The exclusion is intended to apply to assets (including land) such as: Page 88 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021  structures  plant and machinery, and  any improvements or alterations to land. Note that the above lists are not exhaustive. This expenditure, in and of itself, should largely already be excluded from the credit as it is unlikely to relate to resolving scientific or technological uncertainty. The intent of this exclusion is to clarify that expenditure on decommissioning is not eligible for the credit. Note that the exclusion only relates to expenditure on the act of decommissioning itself. Expenditure on R&D relating to decommissioning is potentially eligible for the credit, providing it meets the other eligibility criteria, is an identifiable separate activity, and is incidental to the decommissioning activity. Exclusion of expenditure on remediating land (new clause 20C) New clause 20C excludes expenditure on remediating land. This exclusion is intended to cover the costs of restoring or remedying a site or area of land ("site"), where a person's activities on the site have resulted in changes to the site. This also includes any monitoring or maintenance activities that relate to restoring/remedying a site. This expenditure, in and of itself, should largely already be excluded from the credit as it is unlikely to relate to resolving scientific or technological uncertainty. The new clause clarifies this by explicitly excluding expenditure on remediating land from the credit. Note again that the exclusion only relates to expenditure on the act of remediating land itself. Expenditure on R&D relating to remediation could still be eligible for the credit, providing it meets the other eligibility criteria, is an identifiable separate activity, and is incidental to the decommissioning activity. Amending the exclusion of expenditure related to a government grant (clause 21) Clause 21 excludes expenditure or loss that is related to a grant made by the Crown or a local authority. This is a broad exclusion introduced to avoid ‘double-dipping’ by preventing businesses from claiming multiple sources of government funding for expenditure relating to the same R&D activity. An amendment in the Act clarifies the scope of the exclusion to allow more expenditure unsupported by any other funding mechanism to be claimed for the credit, while maintaining the anti-double-dipping provision. The broader policy intent of the tax credit is to incentivise and support businesses to increase their expenditure on R&D. However, as previously written, the exclusion applied very broadly, so that (for example) expenditure that relates to R&D funded by a Project Grant but is not directly funded by the grant, and beyond the specified co-funding, was excluded from the credit. This expenditure was thus supported by neither the Grant nor the credit, contrary to the intent of the credit. Page 89 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Under a Project Grant, businesses can receive funding for up to 40% of a project’s estimated cost (and are required to contribute 60% as co-funding). However, the terms of the funding agreement specify that the business must spend any additional funding required to complete the project beyond the required 60% co-funding. This means that any additional expenditure by the business on the project is considered to be incurred in connection with expenditure that has already been subsidised through the grant and was therefore considered ineligible for the RDTI under schedule 21B, part B, clause 21 as previously written. Example 50: Current practice Company A undertakes R&D project X and applies for a Project Grant. At the time of application, the company estimates that Project X will cost $500k. Company A’s application is approved, and it receives funding from Callaghan Innovation of $200k (which is 40% of 500k). The company is required by its Project Grant funding agreement to complete the agreed R&D project and spend a minimum of $300k on top of the $200k funded by the grant. After starting the project, Company A discovers that it will need to spend an additional $700k on the project. The $700k of additional expenditure is considered ineligible for the RDTI under schedule 21B, part B, clause 21 because it relates to expenditure supported by a Project Grant. The amendment narrows the scope of clause 21 so that it does not cover amounts over and above the estimated cost of the project (as specified in the Project Grant contract), allowing these amounts to be claimed for the credit provided they meet the other criteria. It also removes the words “or otherwise related to” from the exclusion, allowing for other amounts that are not directly supported by a government grant to be claimed. Criteria and methodologies application due date change (Section 68CC of the Tax Administration Act 1994) This amendment brings forward the due date for submitting an application for criteria and methodologies (CAM) approval to six months before the end of a person’s income year. Background From the 2020–21 income year, businesses must obtain either general approval or criteria and methodologies (CAM) approval. Under general approval, a business must apply for approval of each of its core and supporting R&D activities. Businesses which expect to spend more than $2m on R&D in a given year can opt out of general approval and into CAM approval. Under CAM approval, a business instead applies for approval of the criteria and methodologies it uses to determine the eligibility of its R&D activities and expenditure. Under the previous legislation, CAM approval applications were due after the end of the income year. The amendment changes the due date for applying for CAM approvals to six months before the end of the first income year to which a CAM relates (CAM approvals can be obtained for up to three income years). So, for a standard balance date (31 March) Page 90 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 claimant in the 2021–22 income year, their year-end would be 31 March 2022, and their CAM approval application would be due on 30 September 2021 under the proposed new due date. This amendment does not require that the CAM approval process be completed by the above due date, only submitted. This earlier due date ensures businesses have the correct R&D processes and methodologies in place when their R&D is actually occurring (during the relevant income year). This reduces the need for businesses to have to retrospectively amend their processes and methodologies to ensure their R&D claims are correct. In addition, an earlier due date means businesses have more time to seek general approval should their CAM approval application be declined (or only cover part of their R&D). This is important, because without general or CAM approval, a person is not eligible for the R&D tax credit regime from the 2020–21 income year. Example 51: Applying for CAM approval under the new rules Widgets-R-Us, a large company with a major R&D arm, is considering applying for the R&D tax incentive in the 2021–22 income year. Its balance date is 30 June. As Widgets-R-Us undertakes a wide variety of R&D projects, it elects to apply for CAM approval for the 2021–22, 2022–23, and 2023–24 income years (rather than seeking general approval for each project). The due date for applying for CAM approval is six months before the end of the first income year to which the CAM relates. As Widgets-R-Us’s balance date for the 2021–22 income year is 30 June 2022, its application is due on 31 December 2021. The company submits its CAM application on 21 December 2021. The application takes six weeks to process and is completed on 1 February 2022. Most of Widgets-R-Us’s R&D projects are included in the CAM approval; however, the core team is not satisfied with the company’s systems for identifying eligible expenditure in two of its projects. These projects are not covered by the CAM approval. The core team advises Widgets-R-Us to apply for general approval for both projects. The due date for applying for general approval for the 2021–22 income year is unchanged; applications are due on or before the 7th day of the 2nd month after the end of the first income year. For Widgets-R-Us, this is 7 August 2022. The company applies for general approval for both projects before the due date. Variation of facts: Under the previous legislation Under the previous legislation, CAM approval applications were due on or before the 7th day of the 2nd month after the end of the first income year to which the CAM relates. As Widgets-R- Us’s balance date for the 2021–22 income year is 30 June 2022, its application would be due on 7 August 2022. The company submits its application on 28 July. As above, the CAM takes six weeks to approve (it is approved on 8 September 2022), and two projects are not covered. The due date for applying for general approval is still 7 August 2022. Widgets-R-Us cannot apply for general approval for the two projects not covered by its CAM approval in time. The company cannot claim the credit for these projects in the 2021–22 income year. The amendment also contains a discretion for the Commissioner to accept and approve applications after the new due date, where the applicant has had a change in their balance Page 91 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 date for the first income year to which the CAM relates. This ensures that taxpayers who have a transitional tax year due to a change in their balance date are not rendered unable to apply for CAM approval in a timely manner due to their balance date being brought forward. The amendment applies prospectively from the 2021–22 income year (from 1 April 2021 for most claimants). This ensures that taxpayers (particularly those with early balance dates) intending to apply for CAM approval for the 2020–21 income year have sufficient time to plan for the new due date. Application date The amendment applies from the 2021–22 income year (1 April 2021 for most taxpayers). Key features The amendment brings forward the due date for applying for CAM approval applications in section 68CC(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, so that applications must be submitted on or before the last day of the 6th month before the end of the first income year to which the CAM applies (30 September for most taxpayers). Applications submitted after that date will not be considered for the relevant income year. However, the amendment also provides the Commissioner with discretion to accept an application at a later time of her choosing where the applicant has changed the end date of their income year due to a change in their balance date. More time to consider requests to increase R&D claims (Section 108(1E) of the Tax Administration Act 1994) This amendment provides the Commissioner with more time to consider section 113 requests to increase claims in a taxpayer’s favour. Previously, the legislation imposed a time bar that prevents the Commissioner from considering requests if more than a year has passed since a taxpayer’s income tax return due date for the relevant year. Background A person can only file a request to increase their R&D tax credit claim once for each R&D tax credit claim they make (section 113E of the Tax Administration Act 1994), whether through a section 113 request or a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA). A time bar prevents the Commissioner from increasing a person’s R&D tax credit claim if the person fails to make the request to increase their claim within a year of their income tax return due date (section 108(1E)). As previously drafted, the legislation required a section 113 request to increase an R&D tax credit claim to be initiated and processed within a year of the relevant taxpayer’s income tax Page 92 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 return due date. This is contrary to the policy intent, which is simply that the person must initiate the disputes process within that timeframe. By requiring the request to be processed within that timeframe, the Commissioner may not have enough time to fully consider requests. An amendment in the Act removes the requirement that the request be fully processed within that timeframe, while still requiring the request be initiated within a year of the relevant taxpayer’s income tax return due date. This makes the time bar which applies to section 113 requests consistent with the rules that apply for NOPAs, which were amended by the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 in a similar way. The amendment ensures the Commissioner has enough time to consider requests consistent with the policy intent. Key features Section 108(1E) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is amended to allow the Commissioner to adjust a person’s R&D tax credit claim upwards if the person has made a section 113 request within a year of their income tax return due date. Provided a request is initiated within this timeframe, the Commissioner can consider the request. Application date The amendment applies from the beginning of the R&D tax credit scheme, which is the 2019–20 income year (1 April 2019 for most taxpayers). Page 93 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Ability to transfer tax refunds to an amount borrowed under the Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme (Section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994) An amendment is made to the definition of “tax” in the Tax Administration Act 1994 to ensure that tax refunds owed to a recipient of a loan under the Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme (SBCS) can be transferred by Inland Revenue to their outstanding loan balance at their request. Background The Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme (SBCS) opened for applications on 12 May 2020 as a response to the economic impacts of COVID-19. Borrowers are able to access a loan of up to $100,000, with the amount depending on the number of full-time-equivalent employees employed by the business or organisation. Previously, if a borrower was owed a tax refund, they were unable to request that Inland Revenue transfer this amount toward paying down their SBCS balance. This is because a loan under the SBCS was not included in the definition of “tax” for the purpose of Part 10B of the Tax Administration Act 1994, where transfers of excess tax can be made to another tax type or to another amount due. This meant that tax refunds had to be made to the borrower’s bank account, at which point the borrower had to make a manual repayment to repay their loan under the SBCS. Key features The Act provides for an amendment to section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow Inland Revenue to transfer a tax refund owed to an SBCS recipient to their outstanding SBCS balance at the recipient’s request. Application date The amendments apply from the date the Act received Royal assent. Detailed analysis The Act amends the Tax Administration Act 1994. Page 94 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The definition of “tax” in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is amended for the purpose of Part 10B to include an amount payable in relation to a loan made under the SBCS. The amendment allows Inland Revenue to transfer a tax refund owed to an SBCS loan recipient to their outstanding SBCS balance at the recipient’s request. This simplifies the process for a loan recipient who wants to use a tax refund they are owed to pay down their SBCS loan balance. The purpose of the amendment is to reduce compliance costs for loan recipients who want to offset a tax refund against their SBCS balance. Instead of a loan recipient receiving a refund before using it to make a manual repayment of their loan, the recipient may choose for a tax refund to be directly transferred to their outstanding SBCS balance. This amendment does not give Inland Revenue authority to make a transfer without the recipient’s permission. Page 95 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Portfolio investment entities – remedial amendments Changing the due dates for locked-in PIEs Sections 25E, 25J, 25K and 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The amendment brings forward the date to 15 May by which multi-rate portfolio investment entities (PIEs) that are a superannuation fund or retirement savings scheme are required to file detailed income information for their investors. Background Existing rules provide for a year-end square-up of the tax on income from multi-rate PIEs for natural persons. This PIE tax square-up happens alongside the year-end process for income tax. The outcome of the square-up is applied to the person’s end-of-year income tax position, resulting in one overall tax refund or bill, if any. However, currently the due date for filing of PIE information is not standardised which can result in delays in squaring up taxpayers PIE tax. Key features The amendment brings forward the filing due date by which multi-rate PIEs that are a superannuation fund or retirement savings scheme are required to file detailed income information for their investors to 15 May, to align with that of other multi-rate PIEs and enable the year-end square-up. Application date This amendment applies retrospectively from the 2020−21 income year to align with the application date of the new PIE rules. The first filing due date under the change is 15 May 2021. Detailed analysis For individuals who only have reportable income, (income that Inland Revenue receives regular information about, typically from third party payers such as employers), the year-end process for tax on PIE income is an automated process at the same time as the auto- calculation process for income tax. Section 25K of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to require multi-rate PIEs that are a superannuation fund or retirement savings scheme (for example, a locked-in fund) to file the detailed income information for their investors by 15 May each year (previously 30 June), to align with other, non-locked-in funds. Page 96 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 This avoids delays to the year-end income tax automatic calculation process for a large number of individuals under the new PIE tax square-up. Changes to the PIE schedular income year-end adjustment rules (Sections BC 7, DB 53, HM 36B, HM 52, HM 56, LA 6, LS 3, LS 4 and YA 1 (residual income tax) of the Income Tax Act 2007) Amendments have been made to the way in which the portfolio investment entity (PIE) year- end process works to clarify the rules, and to simplify and future proof the calculations. Background The Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 introduced changes to allow for overpaid tax on PIE income of individuals to be refunded from the 2020/21 tax year. This is achieved through a year-end square-up comparing the amount of tax paid on PIE income during the year (by PIEs on behalf of their investors) with the amount of tax that should have been paid on a person’s PIE income for the tax year. This year-end square-up addresses any over- or underpayment of tax on PIE income during the tax year. Any resulting refund due or tax payable is added to the person’s end of year tax position and would either be refunded, payable, or would reduce the person’s tax payable or reduce the person’s tax refund. These current amendments clarify the year-end adjustment process and better integrate it into existing income tax legislation and processes. All references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Key features The key changes are as follows:  The year-end adjustment calculation formula described in legislation is replaced with an outline of what the Commissioner needs to take into account when calculating the adjustment.  PIE losses and loss tax credits attributable to a natural person investor are included when calculating the individual’s PIE schedular tax adjustment.  Only taxpayers who have used the incorrect prescribed investor rate (PIR) or who have changed their PIR during the year will have additional tax to pay or a refund from a PIE schedular tax adjustment.  Clarification that the year-end PIE schedular tax adjustment: − applies only to natural person investors who are resident in New Zealand, and Page 97 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 − does not apply to a natural person who derives PIE income as beneficiary income from a trust that is not a PIE.  Multi-rate PIE income is taxable income for the purposes of the calculation of the PIE schedular tax adjustment only. This limits the removal of PIE income from excluded income.  The PIE schedular tax adjustment will form part of an investor’s residual income tax for provisional tax purposes. Application date The amendments apply retrospectively from 1 April 2020, when the new year-end PIE tax adjustments came into effect. Detailed analysis PIE schedular income year-end adjustment calculation The year-end adjustment calculation formula described in subsections HM 36B(2) and (3) was overly prescriptive. This risked preventing the ability to include some types of attributed tax credits in the calculation for the benefit of the investor both in the 2020–21 year or in the future as more detailed information can be supplied by fund managers. The prescriptive formula is changed to an outline of what the Commissioner needs to consider when calculating the adjustment. The recommended amendments are designed to future-proof the calculation and enable the Commissioner to incorporate any potential improved data reporting around credits in the future. A PIE schedular tax adjustment is only required where a natural person investor resident in New Zealand has had tax deducted from their PIE income using an incorrect prescribed investor rate (PIR). This could occur when an incorrect PIR is provided by the investor, where they have changed their PIR during the year, or where a PIE has not applied the correct PIR or applied a zero rate to some or all of the PIE income. This change eliminates the charging of small amounts of tax payable to investors due to the timing of the calculation process. Page 98 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Example 52 Tim is an investor in the B&E PIE. Tim started the year on a 17.5% PIR, however, after filing his tax return for the prior year he works out that his PIR for the year should be 28% but he fails to change his PIR with the B&E PIE. At the end of the year the B&E PIE undertakes a tax calculation using the following information: Amount PIE income $20,000 Tax on that @17.5% $3,500 Tax to pay $3,500 The B&E PIE redeems some of Tim’s units and pays the PIE tax liability. At the end of the year Inland Revenue performs the PIE tax adjustment for Tim’s PIE income from the B&E PIE using the following information and Tim’s correct PIR: Amount PIE income $20,000 Tax on that @28% $5,600 Less: PIE tax paid $3,500 Tax to pay $2,100 Tim will have additional tax to pay of $2,100 to bring his PIE tax for the year up to the correct PIR. As Tim used an incorrect PIR and tax was deducted using that incorrect PIR during the year this amount will be charged to him. The PIE schedular tax adjustment is now included as part of residual income tax, which forms the basis for any provisional tax liability. This amendment reduces complexity for taxpayers and Inland Revenue’s systems in that the tax liability for the year will be the same as their residual income tax liability on which provisional tax is calculated. Example 53 Noel is an investor in a KiwiSaver fund administered by Spoons Funds Limited (Spoons). When Noel opened his fund in the 2023–24 income year he gave Spoons his PIR at 10.5% thinking that he would get a good timing advantage from having his funds taxed at a lower rate than his correct PIR of 28%. Noel is self-employed and he is a provisional taxpayer with residual income tax (before PIE schedular tax adjustment) in the 2023–24 income year of $26,000. Inland Revenue adds his PIE adjustment of $6,000 to his income tax liability for the year and his residual income tax for the 2023–24 income year will be $32,000 on which his 2024–25 provisional tax will be based. Page 99 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Example 54 Eddie, an employee of The Lost Cat Cattery Limited, is an investor in a PIE fund administered by Pioneer Phunds Limited (Pioneer). Eddie figures that it will be great timing advantage to delay paying as much PIE tax on his investment as possible and gives Pioneer a PIR of 10.5% even though he should be on the 28% PIR. Inland Revenue has notified Eddie that he is on an incorrect PIR but he does not notify the PIE. At the end of the year Inland Revenue calculates his PIE schedular tax adjustment as $5,300 which he will have to pay but it will also mean that Eddie will be a provisional taxpayer for that year. He will be liable to pay provisional tax in the following year even though the rest of his income is taxed at source. However, it is likely that cases such as the example of Eddie will be reduced, as Inland Revenue will be notifying investors that they are on an incorrect PIR to enable them to correct this and reduce the exposure to provisional tax liabilities. PIE losses and loss tax credits are incorporated when calculating a person’s PIE schedula r ta x a djustment PIE schedular tax adjustments calculated under section HM 36B only referred to attributed PIE income. This amendment clarifies that attributed losses and resulting tax credits are included when calculating the PIE schedular tax adjustment. The amendment will ensure that a natural person investor, who is resident in New Zealand, that is attributed a loss that has or is entitled to have a tax credit calculated on the loss using their prescribed investor rate (PIR), can also receive an adjustment where the rate used is not the investor’s PIR. Clarification of whom the PIE schedular tax adjustment rules apply to Specific rules apply to non-resident investors in a multi-rate PIE and to trustees of a trust investing in a multi-rate PIE. The new year-end PIE schedular tax adjustment rules were not intended to make changes to these rules. The amendments clarify that the new year-end adjustment only applies to natural person investors who are resident in New Zealand, and that the new year-end adjustment rules do not apply to a person who is an investor in a multi-rate PIE and derives income as a beneficiary of a trust that is not a PIE. Limiting the removal of the excluded income status for multi-rate PIE income Prior to the new PIE schedular tax adjustment rules being introduced, income from a multi- rate PIE was largely excluded income of a natural person, meaning this income did not flow through to the person’s income tax assessment. To better incorporate the new year-end adjustment process into existing income tax processes, this excluded income status was Page 100 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 removed entirely, meaning attributed income from a locked-in PIE (such as KiwiSaver) was included in a taxpayer’s PIE taxable income. The excluded income status is reinstated for multi-rate PIE income attributed to a natural person who is resident in New Zealand except for the calculation of the PIE schedular tax adjustment. This avoids any unintended flow-on consequences that treating the adjustment as non-excluded income might have for loss offsets and any added complications for Working for Families tax credits, student loans, and child support. Example 55 Iris works for Ghost Girl Comics Limited as an illustrator. She has a student loan obligation which is deducted from her salary each fortnight. She is also a member of KiwiSaver and has her fund held by One Step Ahead Funds Limited (OSA). When Iris started in KiwiSaver she made a mistake in calculating her PIR and gave OSA a PIR of 10.5% when she should have been on 17.5%. At the end of the year Inland Revenue calculates a PIE schedular tax adjustment for Iris and because she was on an incorrect PIR she has additional tax to pay of $346.50. Although this amount is included in her income tax liability for the year it will be excluded income for the purposes of calculating her liability to repay her student loan. Page 101 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 COVID-19 tax relief for donations of trading stock (Sections FZ 9, GZ 4, GZ 5, CZ 38 and YA1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; section 225ABA of the Tax Administration Act 1994) The new legislation provides tax relief for businesses that have made, or are contemplating making, donations (or supplies for less than market value) of trading stock during COVID-19. Rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 impose tax on the market value of trading stock disposed of for no consideration or an amount that is less than the market value. The application of the rules can act as a significant disincentive to donate trading stock. As a COVID-19 relief measure, a temporary amendment has been made so that disposals of trading stock between 17 March 2020 and 16 March 2022 (inclusive) are not subject to these rules if the recipients are donee organisations, public authorities, or other persons not associated with the transferor. The amendment requires trading stock deductions to be offset by an amount of deemed income in certain circumstances. A new section authorises the making of an Order in Council to extend the period for which the new sections apply or to declare a later period for which the new sections apply. Background Trading stock is generally deductible in the income year it is purchased as a business expense. If it is not sold in the year of purchase, closing stock is included as income at the end of the year and then becomes deductible as opening stock the following year. Deemed income rules in sections GC 1 and FC 2 apply when a person disposes of trading stock for less than market value or when it is transferred on the making of a gift. The rules deem the market value of donated trading stock to be assessable income. This means businesses are effectively taxed on a deemed profit margin for the donated goods, (that is, the difference between the deemed market value and the deduction obtained on purchase or in the opening stock adjustment). The deemed income rules were introduced to counter tax avoidance, including situations where sole traders use their trading stock for private purposes. However, the application of the rules can act as a significant disincentive to donate trading stock. For example, a hand sanitiser business may be liable for tax if it donates some of its products to a hospital, or a farmer may be liable for tax if they donate livestock for meat to be sent to a foodbank. In 2010–2011 an 18-month exclusion was introduced to provide relief for trading stock donations made in response to the Canterbury earthquakes. A permanent provision allows relief when trading stock is donated to a person not associated with the donor for the use in a farming, agricultural or fishing business that is affected by a self-assessed adverse event. Page 102 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Key features The following changes have been made to the Income Tax Act 2007 and to the Tax Administration Act 1994.  Inserting new sections GZ 4 and GZ 5. Section GZ 4 provides an exclusion for disposals of trading stock to public authorities and donee organisations from section GC 1. Section GZ 5 provides an exclusion from section GC 1 for disposals of trading stock by a business to persons not associated with that business.  Inserting new section CZ 38, which applies where a business disposes of trading stock to a person not associated with that business (other than a public authority and donee organisation) and there is no business purpose for making the disposal. In these circumstances, the deduction they have taken for the trading stock is offset by a deemed income amount.  Amending the definition of trading stock in section YA 1 for the purposes of the new sections to exclude timber or a right to take timber or land whose disposal would produce income under any of sections CB 6A to CB 15.  Inserting new section FZ 9, which provides an exception from the rule in section FC 2(1) that requires the transfer of property on the making of a gift to be treated as a disposal and acquisition at market value.  Inserting new section 225ABA into the Tax Administration Act 1994. That section authorises the making of an Order in Council to extend the period for which the new sections in the Income Tax Act 2007 apply or to declare a later period for which the new sections apply. Application date The amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 apply from 17 March 2020. The amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994 applies from the date of enactment. Detailed analysis Sections GZ4 and GZ 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Sections GZ 4 and GZ 5 both provide exceptions from the deemed income rule in section GC 1 for the period that starts on 17 March 2020 and ends on 16 March 2022. Section GZ 4 provides an exception from section GC 1 where a business disposes of trading stock to a public authority or donee organisation. The exception applies even if the public authority or donee organisation is associated with that business. This exception recognises that public authorities and donee organisations exist for the public benefit, are subject to Page 103 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 regulation and are publicly transparent, so it is appropriate to remove disincentives to donate to these organisations, particularly as a response to COVID-19. Section GZ 5 provides an exception from section GC 1 where a business disposes of trading stock to a person not associated with that business (that is not a public authority or donee organisation). However, this provision includes a new offset rule, which applies when there is no business purpose for disposing of the trading stock. It ensures that if trading stock is disposed of to a person that is not a donee organisation or public authority for no business purpose (for example, by way of gift), a net deduction for the trading stock is not available to the business. The deduction the business would normally take for the trading stock, being either the cost or the value under section EB 3 at the end of the previous income year, is offset by a deemed income amount under section CZ 38. The deemed income amount is reduced to take into account consideration received for the trading stock (if any). For the purposes of sections GZ 4 and GZ 5, trading stock has the meaning given in section YA 1 paragraph (b). However, it does not include timber or a right to take timber or land whose disposal would produce income under any of sections CB 6A to CB 15. This narrower definition of trading stock has been used because the temporary amendments are a COVID-19 relief measure and are not directed at significant disposals of this nature. Section GC 1 will continue to apply where trading stock is disposed of to associated persons, which are not donee organisations or public authorities, for no consideration or an amount that is less than the market value of the trading stock at the time of disposal. Section CZ 38 of the Income Tax Act 2007 When trading stock disposals are excluded from the deemed income rules in sections GC 1 and FC 2, the person disposing of the trading stock will typically qualify for a deduction. The deduction is available under section DA 1 if the stock is purchased in the year it is disposed of and section DB 49 if the disposal is from opening trading stock. If section GZ 4 applies, the person disposing of the trading stock will not be required to offset the deduction by a deemed income amount. If section GZ 5 applies, the person disposing of the trading stock may be required to offset the deduction by a deemed income amount under section CZ 38. The formula for the deemed income offset is contained in section GZ 5 and is explained above. Section FZ 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Section FC 2(1) requires the transfer of trading stock, being revenue account property, to be treated as a disposal by the transferor at the market value. There is some overlap between subpart FC and section GC 1 in the case of gifts. To have effect, any adjustment to section GC 1 must be accompanied by a corresponding adjustment to subpart FC. Page 104 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Section FZ 9 provides an exception from the rule in section FC 2(1) in respect of trading stock, provided the transferee is not associated with the transferor or, if they are associated with the transferor, the transferee is a donee organisation or a public authority. The exception applies to transfers made in the period that starts on 17 March 2020 and ends on 16 March 2022. For the purposes of section FZ 9, trading stock means property that is trading stock under section EB 2 as well as livestock not used in a dealing business and consumable aids to be used in the process of producing trading stock. Section 225ABA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Section 225ABA authorises the making of an Order in Council to extend the period for which the new sections in the Income Tax Act 2007 apply or to declare a later period for which the new sections apply. The Minister of Revenue may only recommend extending the period if satisfied that people in New Zealand are likely to continue to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. The Minister may recommend specifying a new application period if satisfied that there is an emergency event that significantly adversely affects people in New Zealand. The event must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition of emergency in section 4 of the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002. Page 105 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Temporary loss carry-back remedial – loss grouping (Section IZ 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007) Background Section IZ 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007 contains the temporary loss carry-back rules. The rules allow a company with net losses in the 2019–20 or 2020–21 income years to carry losses back to offset taxable income in the immediately preceding income year, in order to receive a tax refund. Key features The purpose of this remedial amendment is to ensure companies in non-wholly owned corporate groups are able to use the loss carry-back. A non-wholly owned corporate group (“group”) is a group of companies that have at least 66%, but less than 100%, common ownership. Under previous rules, to be eligible for the loss carry-back, a company in a group was required to:  have a net loss in the 2019–20 or 2020–21 income years (the “loss year”), and  have taxable income in the income year immediately preceding the loss year (the “profit year”). If a company had losses in both the profit and loss years, then the company was not able to use the loss carry-back under the previous rules, even if another group member had taxable income in the profit year against which the losses could be offset. This outcome was contrary to the policy intent expressed in the COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Other Regulatory Urgent Measures) Bill commentary. The policy intent is for a company to be able to carry back and offset its losses against a group member’s taxable income in the profit year, even if the company has losses in both the profit and loss years. This remedial amendment amends section IZ 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007, so that the legislation now satisfies the policy intent. Page 106 of 107 Public Act 2021 No 8 | 28 April 2021 Example 56 Mippy Co and Snowy Co are 80% commonly owned. In 2018–19, Mippy Co has net income of $100,000 and Snowy Co has $50,000 of losses. Snowy Co decides to offset its $50,000 of losses against Mippy Co’s income that year, so Mippy Co has taxable income of $50,000. In 2019–20, Mippy Co has net income of $50,000 and Snowy Co has net losses of $75,000. After offsetting Snowy Co’s losses against Mippy Co’s net income,\* Snowy Co still has $25,000 of losses remaining. It decides to use the temporary loss carry-back so that it can offset its remaining $25,000 of losses against Mippy Co’s 2018–19 taxable income. Snowy Co carries its remaining $25,000 of losses back to 2018–19, and offsets the losses against Mippy Co’s 2018–19 taxable income of $50,000. Mippy Co receives a tax refund of $7,000 ($25,000 × 28%, which is the corporate tax rate). After using the loss carry-back, Mippy Co still has $25,000 of taxable income remaining in 2018–19. Snowy has $0 losses remaining in 2019– 20 after using the loss carry-back. 2018–19 income year Mippy Co Snowy Co Net income/(loss) (before offsets and loss carry-back) $100,000 ($50,000) Taxable income/(loss) (after offsets but before loss carry-back) $50,000 $0 2019–20 income year Net income/loss (before offsets and loss carry-back) $50,000 ($75,000) Taxable income/loss (after offsets but before loss carry-back) $0 ($25,000) Temporary loss carry-back 2018–19 taxable income/(loss) (after loss carry-back) $25,000 $0 2019–20 taxable income/(loss) (after loss carry-back) $0 $0 Amount refunded under loss carry-back $7,000 $0 \* In this example the two companies have chosen to offset losses within the group in the loss year before using the loss carry-back. This is not a requirement for groups that are not wholly owned. Application date This remedial amendment applies for the duration of the temporary loss carry-back scheme, so applies to two pairs of income years: the 2018–19/2019–20 and 2019–20/2020–21 profit/loss years.
