29 August 2019 UNCLASSIFIED Question When does the business premises exclusion in s CB 19 apply to preclude land sales from being taxed under ss CB 6 to CB 11? Answer The business premises exclusion in s CB 19 applies to premises acquired and occupied, or erected and occupied by the landowner mainly to carry on a substantial business. “Business premises” means land, typically including a building, from which a person carries on a business. Subject to certain limitations, the exclusion also applies to land reserved with the business premises for the use of the business. The s CB 19 business premises exclusion applies only to the extent that the land sold is business premises (together with land reserved with the premises for the use of the business). However, the s CB 19 business premises exclusion is not available if the landowner has engaged in a regular pattern of buying and selling or building and selling business premises. QB 19/14 Income tax – When does the business premises exclusion in s CB 19 apply to preclude land sales from being taxed under ss CB 6 to CB 11? QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) explains when the business premises exclusion in s CB 19 of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies to sales of land that would otherwise be subject to tax under any of the land taxing provisions in ss CB 6 to CB 11. It will be of interest to those selling their business premises, if the sale is potentially taxable under one of those provisions. Primarily this will be taxpayers who bought the premises with the purpose or intention of resale, or taxpayers who are dealers, developers or builders, or associated with someone in one of those businesses. Key provision Section CB 19 of the Income Tax Act 2007. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated. QB 19/14: 29 Aug 2019 2 UNCLASSIFIED Explanation The scope of this QWBA 1. This QWBA focuses on the application of the business premises exclusion in s CB 19. The s CB 19 business premises exclusion is relevant where the sale of land is potentially taxable under: • s CB 6 – purpose or intention of resale; • ss CB 7 and CB 9 – business of land dealing; • ss CB 7 and CB 10 – business of developing or subdividing; • ss CB 7 and CB 11 – business of erecting buildings; or • s CB 8 – land used for landfill. 2. The s CB 19 business premises exclusion is only relevant to the above land sale rules. There is a separate business premises exclusion for the purposes of the bright-line test. These two business premises exclusions are briefly compared at \[ 30\]. The business premises exclusion to the bright-line test is covered in more detail in “QB 19/13: Income tax – When does the business premises exclusion to the bright- line test apply?”. Meaning of “premises of a business” 3. Under s CB 19, the sale of land that would otherwise be taxed under ss CB 6 to CB 11 will not be taxable if: • the land is the “premises of a business” (referred to in this QWBA as “business premises”) (s CB 19(1)(a)); and • the landowner acquired and occupied, or erected and occupied, the premises mainly to carry on a substantial business from them (s CB 19(1)(b)). 4. Land that is reserved with business premises for use in the business may also be covered by the s CB 19 business premises exclusion when it is sold with the business premises. This is discussed from \[ 17\] to \[23\]. Business premises requirements (s CB 19(1)(a)) 5. “Business premises” is not defined in the Act for the purposes of s CB 19. “Premises” is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011) as: A house or building, together with its land and outbuildings, occupied by a business or considered in an official context. 6. At common law, “business premises” can refer to a variety of places from which a business is carried on, whether just buildings, buildings and associated land, or bare land. (Case Y10 (2007) 23 NZTC 13,097 (TRA); Thames Water Ltd v Hampstead Homes Ltd \[2003\] 1 WLR 198 (CA); Gardiner v Sevenoaks Rural District Council \[1950\] 2 All ER 84 ( QB); C of T v Nightcaps Coal Company (Ltd) (1909) 29 NZLR 885 (SC)). 7. T he Commissioner considers that while business premises will typically include a building, there may be instances where land without a building is business premises. For instance, a quarry may be business premises even if it does not have a building on it, provided that the further requirements of s CB 19 are met. It will be up to the taxpayer to show that the land is business premises. QB 19/14: 29 Aug 2019 3 UNCLASSIFIED Requirements of s CB 19(1)(b) 8. Although land may be business premises, this does not mean s CB 19 will necessarily apply. Section CB 19(1)(b) provides that the business premises must be acquired and occupied, or erected and occupied by the landowner mainly to carry on a substantial business from them. Acquired/erected and occupied mainly to carry on a substantial business 9. The Commissioner considers that to satisfy the requirements of s CB 19(1)(b), the landowner must have first acquired or erected the premises mainly for the purpose of carrying on a substantial business from them. This is tested when the landowner acquired or erected the premises. 10. Section CB 19(1)(b) also requires the landowner to have occupied the business premises mainly to carry on a substantial business. “Occupied” in this context means the landowner ( which would include their agent or employee) has a physical presence at the business premises and retains the right to exclude others from the property. A physical presence does not necessarily require a human presence at the premises. The presence of structures or equipment may be sufficient. For example, an automated self-service petrol station would satisfy the “occupation” requirement of s CB 19. 11. Where a landowner leases business premises to another taxpayer, giving them exclusive possession, the landowner does not “occupy” the business premises. Where land is owned by a trust, the trustees must have acquired/erected and occupied the premises mainly to carry on a substantial business of the trust. Occupation by a beneficiary of the trust mainly to carry on their own substantial business will not be sufficient. 12. In the context of s CB 19(1)(b), “mainly” is considered to have the same meaning as “primarily and principally”, the phrase used in the earlier equivalents of s CB 19 prior to the rewrite of the Income Tax Act, which was done progressively from 1994. 13. The phrase “primarily and principally”, and therefore “mainly” for s CB 19, requires that the relevant purpose ( for the premises being acquired/erected) and use (the occupation of the premises) is not only the main purpose or use in the sense of outweighing all the other purposes or uses, singly or collectively, but also the primary purpose or use: Newman Tours Ltd v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,027 (HC). 14. Situations may arise where a landowner has occupied premises to carry on a substantial business, for most, but not all of the time they owned the land. This might occur where the landowner vacated the premises prior to sale in order to give vacant possession, or where the landowner temporarily leased the premises to another taxpayer. In these situations, the s CB 19 exclusion may still apply, provided the landowner occupied the premises mainly to carry on a substantial business. However, it will be more difficult to argue that premises were acquired/erected and occupied mainly to carry on a substantial business the longer premises are: • o ccupied by a third party (and not the landowner); • occupied by the landowner for a non-business use; or • unoccupied. 15. For the s CB 19 exclusion to apply, the premises must have been acquired/erected and occupied “ to carry on a ... business”. Whether there is a business will be determined using the business test set out in Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682 (CA). Where a landowner meets the Grieve business test, then some or all of the activities of that business must have been “carried on” from the business premises. QB 19/14: 29 Aug 2019 4 UNCLASSIFIED “Carrying on” a business from a location requires some or all of the activities of the business to be conducted continuously or habitually from there. 16. Finally, s CB 19(1)(b) requires that the landowner acquired/erected and occupied the premises mainly for carrying on a “substantial” business. Whether a business is “substantial” is a question of fact. Requirements of s CB 19(3) – what land is included? 17. While s CB 19(1) focuses on land that is business premises, s CB 19(3) provides that non-business premises land may also be covered by the business premises exclusion where it is: • land reserved, with the premises, for the use of the business; but • limited to an area no greater than what is required for the reasonable occupation of the premises and the carrying on of the business. “Land reserved, with the premises, for the use of the business” 18. For land to be considered “ reserved, with the premises, for the use of the business” under s CB 19(3)(a), the land must: • be reserved for the use of the business that is carried on from the premises; and • have a sufficiently close ph ysical connection to the business premises land. 19. The Commissioner considers that land reserved “with” business premises will usually be in close proximity to the business premises. Where the reserved land is not part of , or immediately adjoining the business premises land, the closer it is to the business premises, the more likely it is to be considered reserved “with the premises”. 20. The words “for use of the business” do not require business activities to be “carried on” from the land. For example, although business activities are unlikely to be carried on from a carpark reserved for staff parking, the carpark would nonetheless be considered reserved “for the use of the business”. T he Commissioner considers that the words “for the use of the business”, contemplate both current and future business uses. Land reserved for the future use of a business might be land not currently in use, but kept for the future expansion of the business. An area no greater than that required for the reasonable occupation of the premises and the carrying on of the business” 21. Even if land meets the requirements of s CB 19(3)(a), s CB 19(3)(b) limits such reserved land to “an area no greater than that required for the reasonable occupation of the business premises and the carrying on of the business”. 22. The amount of reserved land that is required for the reasonable occupation of particular business premises and the carrying on of the relevant business will be a question of fact. The Commissioner acknowledges that while some taxpayers might reserve additional land with their business premises for the future expansion of the business, whether all of the land reserved is “ required” for the carrying on of the business will depend on the particular situation. QB 19/14: 29 Aug 2019 5 UNCLASSIFIED Must be sold with business premises 23. It is important to note that for reserved land to be covered by the business premises exclusion, it must be sold with the business premises land with which it is reserved. Apportionment under the s CB 19 business premises exclusion 24. The s CB 19 business premises exclusion applies to the extent that the land sold meets the requirements of the provision. This means it is possible for the s CB 19 business premises exclusion to apply only to part of the land sold, leaving the other part to which the exclusion does not apply still subject to tax. Where a landowner occupies part of a building as their business premises (for example, a single storey of a multi-storey office building), then the s CB 19 business premises exclusion will apply to the proportion of the total sale price of the land that is attributable to that part of the building. 25. The residential land exclusion in s CB 16 applies in the same way. This means situations could arise where some of the land sold by a landowner is eligible for the s CB 19 business premises exclusion, with the balance of the land qualifying for the s CB 16 residential land exclusion. The result in this type of scenario would be that none of the land sold would be taxable. Section CB 19(2) – the exclusion will not apply if there is a regular pattern 26. Although a land sale might meet the requirements of s CB 19(1) and (3), s CB 19(2) states that the exclusion will not apply if the landowner “has engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing, or erecting and disposing, of premises for businesses”. 27. Whether a landowner has a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing, or erecting and disposing of business premises will be a question of fact. It will depend on the number of similar transactions and the intervals of time between them. There is no fixed rule about the number of times or how frequently you can buy and sell or build and sell business premises and still use the s CB 19 business premises exclusion. However, generally at least three prior transactions would be needed for there to be a regular pattern – see the discussion in “QB 16/07: Income tax – land sale rules – main home and residential exclusions – regular pattern of acquiring and disposing, or building and disposing”, Tax Information Bulletin V ol 28, No 9 (October 2016): 4. 28. QB 16/07 outlines when a person has engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing, or erecting and disposing of dwellinghouses under s CB 16(3). These same principles apply to de termining whether a landowner has engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of or erecting and disposing of business premises, which would mean the s CB 19 exclusion is not available. Business premises land sold at a loss 29. If a landowner sells land covered by the s CB 19 exclusion at a loss, t he loss will be capital in nature, so will not reduce the taxpayer’s net income. The sale proceeds are not income ( unless a taxing provision without a business premises exclusion applies), so the cost of the land is not deductible. Comparison between the s CB 19 and s CB 6A business premises exclusions 30. As noted at \[ 2\], s CB 19 is not the only business premises exclusion in the land taxing rules. There is a separate business premises exclusion for the purposes of the bright- line test. Although these two ex clusions are both described as “business premises exclusions”, they are not the same. “ QB 19/13: Income tax – When does the business premises exclusion to the bright-line test apply?” d iscusses the application of the QB 19/14: 29 Aug 2019 6 UNCLASSIFIED s CB 6A business premises exclusion in more detail. In short, the main differences between the s CB 19 business premises exclusion and the bright-line business premises exclusion are as follows: • Section CB 19 relates to the land taxing provisions from s CB 6 to s CB 11. The bright-line business premises exclusion applies only to s CB 6A (the bright-line test). • Section CB 19 applies only to land that is the landowner’s business premises (and land reserved with the premises for the use of the business). The bright- line business premises exclusion potentially applies where someone else uses the land as business premises. • Section CB 19 requires the landowner to have acquired and occupied or erected and occupied the relevant business premises mainly to carry on a substantial business. For the bright-line business premises exclusion, the premises do not have to be those of the landowner and the business does not have to be substantial. • Section CB 19 applies to the extent that the land sold is business premises (or land reserved with the premises for the use of the business), while the bright- line business premises exclusion applies to all of the land sold, or not at all. • Section CB 19 does not apply where the landowner has engaged in a regular pattern of buying or building business premises and selling them. The bright- line business premises exclusion does not have such an exception. Examples 31. The following examples explain how the law applies. Examples Example 1 – Business premises of a tenant not the landowner Mungbean Holdings Ltd (MHL) is associated with Mungbean Developments Ltd (MDL), a company carrying on a business of property developments. MHL is in the business of leasing commercial office space. It owns several office buildings including one that it leases to Edamame Transport Ltd (ETL). ETL has exclusive use of the office building for its transport business. MHL sells the office building within 10 years of purchase. The sale is taxable under s CB 10(2) because at the time MHL acquired the office building, MHL was associated with MDL, and MDL was carrying on a property development business. Although the office building was business premises, s CB 19 does not apply because MHL did not occupy the office building to carry on its own business of commercial property leasing. MHL also owns another office building that it occupies exclusively to carry on its commercial leasing activities. If MHL were to sell that building within 10 years of acquiring it, the s CB 19 exclusion would apply, so the land sale proceeds would not be income under s CB 10(2). Example 2 – Business premises of the landowner Greenbean Construction Ltd (GCL) is in the business of erecting buildings. It purchases a piece of land and erects a building to use exclusively as its offices and workshop. Three years later, GCL sells the building and purchases a bigger property on the other side of town. Absent s CB 19, GCL would be liable to pay tax on the sale of the property under s CB 11. However, because GCL erected and occupied the building to carry on a substantial business from, the s CB 19 exclusion applies, so the land sale proceeds are not income under s CB 11. QB 19/14: 29 Aug 2019 7 UNCLASSIFIED Example 3 – No building on the land Redbean Scrapmetal Merchants Ltd (RSML) purchases a piece of bare land for the main purpose of carrying on a substantial business from it. At the time RSML acquired the land, RSML was associated with Favabean Land Dealers Ltd (FLDL), a company carrying on a business of dealing in land. RSML sets up a scrapmetal yard on the land and carries on a substantial business from there. The scrapmetal yard has no buildings on it, just an office in a converted shipping container. T he business is very successful. So successful that six years later, RSML needs to move to a bigger site so it sells the land. Absent s CB 19, the sale of the land would be taxable under s CB 9(2). This is because when RSML acquired the land, RSML was associated with FLDL, and the land was sold within 10 years. However, because the requirements of the s CB 19 exclusion are met, the land sale proceeds are not income under s CB 9. Example 4 – Land with a building that is partly business premises and partly a dwelling Favabean Beanery Ltd (FBL) purchases a building in the suburbs. At the time FBL purchased the building, it was also associated with Favabean Land Dealers Ltd (FLDL), a company carrying on a business of dealing in land. The building comprises a downstairs retail space and a single-bedroom flat upstairs. The downstairs retail space is twice the size of the upstairs flat. FBL purchased the property for the main purpose of carrying on its large-scale bean import business. FBL occupies the downstairs retail space and carries on its large-scale bean import business from there. The upstairs flat is rented to Mr Beane under a residential tenancy for the whole time FBL owns the property. After eight years, FBL sells the building for a profit. Absent s CB 19, the sale of the whole property would be taxable under s CB 9 . This is because when FBL acquired the building, FBL was associated with FLDL, which was carrying on a land dealing business, and the land was sold within 10 years. However, because the downstairs retail space was occupied by FBL to carry on its substantial import business, the portion of the sale price attributable to the downstairs retail space is excluded from s CB 9 . The portion of the sale price attributable to the upstairs flat is income under s CB 9 , because the flat was not business premises, nor reserved with the premises for the use of the business. The cost of the property should be apportioned on the same basis, with only the portion attributable to the upstairs flat being deductible under s DB 23. Example 5 - Business premises land sold at a loss Three Bean Salad Ltd (TBSL) purchases a small factory for $100,000 with the intention of carrying on a bean salad manufacturing business from the factory. At the time of purchase, TBSL was also associated with Favabean Land Dealers Ltd (FLDL), a company carrying on a business of dealing in land. To TBSL’s surprise, the bean salad business takes off and the company soon needs to move to bigger premises. Unfortunately, TBSL bought the factory at the peak of the property market, and when it sells, the value of the factory has dropped to $80,000. Absent s CB 19, the sale of the property would be taxable under s CB 9(2). This is b ecause when TBSL acquired the land, TBSL was associated with FLDL, and the land was sold within 10 years. However, as TBSL occupied the premises to mainly carry on a substantial business, the s CB 19 exclusion will apply to exclude the sale of the property from being taxable under s CB 9(2). As a consequence, the $80,000 sale price will not be income to TBSL, and no deduction will be allowed for the $100,000 purchase price. Example 6 – Business premises vacated before sale Stringbean Prefabrication Ltd (SPL) carries on a substantial business of erecting buildings. SPL purchases bare land intending to build apartments on the land, which SPL will then on- sell. However, before building the apartments, SPL decides it needs a new workshop for prefabricating building components. The property it purchased to build the a partments on is in an ideal location for a workshop. Accordingly, instead of building the apartments on the QB 19/14: 29 Aug 2019 8 UNCLASSIFIED Subject references Business premises exclusion Land tax Legislative references Income Tax Act 1976, s 67(5)(a) Income Tax Act 2004 Income Tax Act 2007, ss CB 6A, CB 6–CB 11, CB 16, CB 19, YA 1 (“residential land”) Case references C of T v Nightcaps Coal Company (Ltd) (1909) 29 NZLR 885 (SC) Case G76 (1985) 7 NZTC 1,348 (TRA) Case K21 (1988) 10 NZTC 218 (TRA) Case M102 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,634 (TRA) Case Y10 (2007) 23 NZTC 13,097 (TRA) Gardiner v Sevenoaks Rural District Council \[1950\] 2 All ER 84 (QB) Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682 (CA) Newman Tours Ltd v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,027 (HC) Thames Water Ltd v Hampstead Homes Ltd \[2003\] 1 WLR 198 (CA) Other references Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011). “QB 16/07: Income tax – land sale rules – main home and residential exclusions – regular pattern of acquiring and disposing, or building and disposing”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 9 (October 2016): 4. “QB 19/13: Income tax – When does the business premises exclusion to the bright-line test apply?”. land, SPL erects a workshop from which to carry on its business. SPL then occupies and operates its business out of the workshop. If SPL were to sell the workshop, it would be covered by the s CB 19 exclusion. Even though SPL did not acquire the land “mainly for carrying on a substantial business”, it erected business premises for this purpose. SPL then occupied the workshop mainly for carrying on a substantial business. After three years of occupying the workshop solely to carry on its business, SPL runs into financial difficulties. SPL moves out of the workshop and tries to find a buyer for the property. The workshop is vacant for six months before SPL finally sells it. SPL is still eligible for the s CB 19 exclusion. This is because even though SPL did not occupy the workshop for the last six months, SPL erected and occupied the workshop mainly to carry on a substantial business. SPL carried on a substantial business for three years from the premises and so mainly occupied them for that purpose, taking into account the whole period of ownership, including the last 6 months when the premises were vacant.

20 May 2019 1 UNCLASSIFIED Question What are my income tax obligations if I rent out my home or a separate dwelling on my property as short- stay accommodation? Answer If you rent out your home (or part of your home) as short-stay accommodation, any amounts you receive from guests will be income. However, you may have different options for meeting your tax obligations, depending on your circumstances. You may be able to use “standard costs” set by the Commissioner for your expenses. If you use this approach, your income up to the level of the standard costs will be treated as exempt. You would only have to declare the rental income in excess of the standard costs. If you can’t use the “standard cost” approach, or you don’t want to, your deductions will be based on your actual costs related to earning the income. Some of those costs will only be partly deductible because they also relate to your private use of the home. If you rent out a separate dwelling on the same property as your home for short-stay accommodation, different tax rules could apply, depending on your situation. QB 19/05 What are my income tax obligations if I rent out my home or a separate dwelling on my property as short-stay accommodation? QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This “Question We’ve Been Asked” (QWBA) explains how the income tax rules apply if you occasionally rent out your home, a room in your home, or a separate dwelling on your property for short stays (e g, through Airbnb, Bookabach or Holiday Houses). Key provisions Income Tax Act 2007 – ss CC 1, DA 1 and DA 2 Key terms Guest means a person provided with short-stay accommodation in return for payment. Sh ort-stay accommodation means accommodation provided for up to four consecutive weeks in a dwelling that is not the guest’s ordinary residence. It doesn’t include accommodation provided to residential tenants, boarders or care home residents, and it doesn’t include student or emergency accommodation.  Before you read this QWBA This QWBA is one of a series covering the tax rules for short-stay accommodation hosts. Check Overview – Short-stay accommodation items to make sure it’s the item that’s relevant to your circumstances. QB 19/05: 20 May 2019 2 UNCLASSIFIED Explanation 1.Different rules apply depending on whether you’re renting out your own home (or part of your home) or a separate dwelling on the same property. In this QWBA we look at separate dwellings first as they are either straightforward or covered by another item. Renting out a separate dwelling on the same property as your home 2.If you rent out a separate dwelling on the same property as your home (for example, a sleep-out or a cottage on the property) for short-stay accommodation, different income tax rules could apply, depending on your situation. The dwelling is looked at as a separate asset. If it is only rented out and never used privately, all of its rental income will be taxable, and you may claim 100% of your deductible expenses in relation to the dwelling. If, in addition to sometimes renting out the dwelling, you also sometimes use it privately, the dwelling may be subject to either the “mixed-use asset” rules or the standard income tax rules. To work out which rules apply, see QB 19/06: What income tax rules apply if I have a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use myself? Renting out all or part of your home 3.If you rent out all or part of your home as short-stay accommodation, any amounts you receive from the guests will be taxable as rental income. The activity doesn’t need t o b e run as a business for the amounts you receive to be income. 4.You may have two options for meeting your tax obligations (summarised in Table 1) , d epending on your circumstances: •the standard-cost approach; or •the actual-cost approach. 5.If you meet certain criteria, you may choose to use standard costs, set by the Commissioner, for your expenses. This is referred to as “the standard-cost approach” . If you use this approach, you don’t need to declare income from the rental activity u p t o the amount of the standard costs. You only need to declare any income you make t o t he extent it exceeds the standard costs. This approach is easier, because it means you don’t have to work out your actual expenses, which would require some of the expenses being apportioned . The criteria you have to meet to be able to use this approach are set out in \[ 7\]. 6.If you can’t use the standard-cost approach, or you don’t want to, your deductions wil l be based on your actual costs related to earning the income. Expenses that relate solely to your rental activity (eg, advertising fees) are 100% deductible. But mixe d e xpenses, that relate to both your rental activity and your own use of your home (eg, home loan interest, insurance and rates), need to be apportioned. This QWBA will help you understand how to calculate the percentage of your mixed expenses that’s tax deductible. QB 19/05: 20 May 2019 3 UNCLASSIFIED Table 1: Comparison of standard-cost and actual-cost approaches C an I use the standard-cost determination for short-stay accommodation providers? 7.You may choose to use the standard-cost approach in DET 19/02: Standard-cost household service for short-stay accommodation providers, if: Standard-cost approach Actual-cost approach The income up to the amount of your standard-costs is exempt income. You don’t include it in a tax return. The amount of income in excess of your standard-costs is assessable income. You need to include it in a tax return. You can’t claim deductions for any of your actual expenses that are covered by the standard-costs in DET 19/02: Standard-cost household service for short-stay accommodation providers. All of the income is assessable income and has to be declared. You may claim associated expenses and depreciation losses as tax deductions. You’ll need to work out how much you may deduct, bearing in mind that: •expenses that relate solely to the rental activity (eg, advertising) are 100% deductible; •mixed expenses (eg, home loan interest, insurance and rates), need to be apportioned; and •depreciation losses in respect of chattels used both privately and by paying guests also have to be apportioned. If you’re not the only owner of the property, you’ll need to think about who should declare the income – see from \[38\]. (1)you’re a natural person (eg, an individual not a company); (2)you rent out a room or rooms of your home to guests for short-stay accommodation (not more than four consecutive weeks); (3)you don’t rent out rooms for more than 100 nights in the income year (counting each room that’s rented out separately); (4)the property isn’t held in a trust, or if it is you paid all of the costs for the year for the use of the property (eg, home loan interest or rent, insurance, rates, and repairs and maintenance); (5)you don’t provide the short-stay accommodation service as part of a GST taxable activity; (6)your home isn’t used in the income year to provide both a short-stay accommodation service and a private boarding service (as defined in DET 19/01: Standard-cost household service for boarding service providers or any determination that replaces DET 19/01) ; (7)neither you nor anyone else applies any other standard-cost household service determination (eg, DET 0 9/02: Standard-cost household service for childcare providers ) in relation to services provided in the home; and (8)no one claims deductions for actual costs incurred in relation to the use of your home to provide accommodation to others, such as flatmates, for any time in the income year when the short-stay accommodation service is provided. QB 19/05: 20 May 2019 4 UNCLASSIFIED 8. If you meet these criteria and choose to use the standard-cost approach for the year, the rest of this QWBA won’t be relevant to you. If you choose to use the standard-cost approach, DET 19/02: Standard-cost household service for short-stay accommodation providers explains what you need to do to meet your income tax obligations. 9. Be aware that you may only use the standard-cost approach for years in which you meet the criteria. If you don’t meet the criteria for a particular income year, you’ll need to base your deductions for that year on your actual costs, which will involve apportioning some expenses. This QWBA explains how the rules work if you have to, or choose to, use the actual-costs approach. Can I use the standard-costs for boarders instead? 10. A separate determination sets standard costs for expenses for people who receive income from private boarders. You can’t use that determination for income from providing short-stay accommodation. This is because short-stay accommodation guests are not boarders. A boarder is someone who lives in someone else’s home and receives meals, in return for payment. To be a boarder, the person has to actually live in your home and use it as their normal residence for a period (often this is a year or a semester). Someone who pays to stay in your home for a short period and isn’t using it as their normal residence is not a boarder. This QWBA calls these people “guests”. 11. If you receive income from both boarders and short-stay accommodation guests, you can’t use either of the standard-cost determinations. If you’re in this situation, you’ll need to use your actual costs for your deductions. 12. The boarders determination that applies from the start of the 2019-20 income year, DET 19/01: Standard-cost household service for boarding service providers , can be found on the Inland Revenue website. Each year, updated weekly standard-costs for the boarders determination are published on the Inland Revenue website. If I’m using the actual-cost approach, how do I work out what deductions I can claim? 13. As noted in the table at \[6\], if you’re using the actual-cost approach some of your expenses will be fully deductible and some will only be partly deductible. This is because some of your expenses (eg, home loan interest, insurance and rates) relate partly to your rental activity and partly to your own private use of your home. 14. You’ll also be able to claim deductions for the depreciation of the chattels in your home that paying guests can use. But, as with your mixed expenses, you may only claim for part of the depreciation for chattels that are used both privately and by paying guests. 15. The following will help you work out what deductions you may claim – and will help you calculate what percentage of your mixed expenses and depreciation is tax deductible. Expenses that are fully deductible – expenses that relate solely to your rental activity 16. If you’re not using the standard-cost approach, you may claim deductions for 100% of expenses that relate solely to your rental activity. This would include: • advertising costs; • any commission or fee you pay to an advertising platform or transaction facilitator (this does not include any service fee the guests pay the platform – just fees you pay); • supplies used solely by your paying guests; • any additional insurance premium you pay (over what you would otherwise pay) because of the rental activity; and QB 19/05: 20 May 2019 5 UNCLASSIFIED • any additional rates you have to pay (over what the normal residential rates would be) because of the rental activity. Expenses that are partly deductible – expenses that relate to both rental activity and private use 17. You may only claim deductions for part of any expenses that relate to both your rental activity and the private use of your home. These sorts of mixed expenses would include things like: • power bills; • internet expenses; • interest on your home loan; • property insurance (or what the insurance premium would be if you have to pay more because of the rental activity); • repairs and maintenance; and • rates (or what the normal residential rates would be if you have to pay more because of the rental activity). 18. While you’ll generally only be able to deduct part of these sorts of expenses, there are some situations where they’ll be fully deductible, because they don’t relate to the private use of your home at all. This could be the case, for example, if you can identify actual usage charges for a period where you vacated the house and rented out the whole property. 19. But in most situations where you rent out all or part of your home, to work out what proportion of these mixed expenses you may claim, you’ll need to take into account: • the floor area of different parts of your house; and • the number of nights during the year that the room was rented out. 20. If there’s a reasonable basis for apportioning a particular expense other than floor area, you can use that. 21. While less common, in some situations instead of taking into account the number of nights the room was actually rented out, you may take into account the periods it was either rented out or available to be rented out. This is explained below from \[24\]. How to apportion mixed expenses based on the number of rental nights 22. Generally, you should apportion mixed expenses, like those mentioned at \[17\], based on the floor area that the guest has exclusive use of, as a proportion of the total floor area of your house. You may also add a reasonable amount based on the guest’s access to common areas – Inland Revenue will accept 50% as a reasonable amount in most situations. Generally, where you rent a room in your house you may only claim expenses for when the room was rented out. QB 19/05: 20 May 2019 6 UNCLASSIFIED Example 1 : Apportioning mixed expenses based on the number of rental nights Hayley has a two-bedroom villa. She uses the second bedroom occasionally as an office, or when friends or family stay. She decides to rent out the second bedroom through a peer-to-peer platform to make some extra money. When she rents out the room, the guests are also able to use some common areas in the villa – the lounge, dining room, kitchen, laundry, and main bathroom. Hayley rented out the room for 120 nights during the year. The floor areas of the different parts of Hayley’s villa are shown in the diagram below. Hayley should apportion her mixed expenses on the following basis: Used exclusively by guests – 100% deductible for days the room is rented out Common areas – 50% deductible for days someone is renting the bedroom Private area – 0% deductible Hayley has to calculate what proportion of her mixed expenses she may deduct for the areas of the house used exclusively by guests, and what proportion she may deduct for the common areas. The results of those calculations are then added together. The areas used exclusively by guests are 20m 2 out of the total 100m 2 floor area of the villa, and are 100% deductible for the 120 out of 365 days in the year that the room is rented out: 20 100 × 120 365 × 100 = 6.58% The common areas, able to be used by both Hayley and guests, are 55m 2 out of the total 100m 2 floor area of the villa, and are 50% deductible for the 120 out of 365 days in the year that the room is rented out: 55 100 × 120 365 × 50 = 9.04% Adding these figures (6.58% and 9.04%) together, Hayley calculates that she may deduct 15.62% of her mixed expenses for the year. Her mixed expenses include her Lounge and dining (shared) Kitchen and laundry (shared) Total common areas 55m2 Bedroom for rent 12m 2 Main bathroom (exclusively for guests) 8m 2 Hayley’s bedroom and ensuite 25m2 20m 2 55m 2 25m 2 QB 19/05: 20 May 2019 7 UNCLASSIFIED 23. If you rent out your whole house for a period, and the guests have access to the whole house, you don’t need to factor in the floor area calculations. Your apportionment would just be based on the number of nights the house is rented out. How to apportion mixed expenses based on availability 24. As noted in \[20\], while less common, in some situations instead of taking into account the number of nights the space was actually rented out, you may take into account the periods it is either rented out or available to be rented out. 25. For a room in your home, you could only do this where you don’t use the space at all, including for storage, and it is essentially not used as part of your home. This would be difficult to show, as in most situations it would be expected that expenses for a room in your own home are private expenses for periods when the room is not actually rented out. One example of a situation where you might be able to show otherwise is if you operated a bed and breakfast with high occupancy from your home, so the rental rooms are essentially not used as part of your home. Example 4 covers a situation like this. 26. Another situation where availability could potentially be used is if you have a separate dwelling on the same property as your home that’s not used as part of your home and is not a mixed-use asset. For example, a sleep-out that’s only rented out and not used privately at all, or a sleep-out that’s rented out and used privately, but isn’t unused for 62 days or more in the year. In either of those situations, the mixed-use asset rules wouldn’t apply – see QB 19/06: What income tax rules apply if I have a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use myself? Example 3 covers a situation like this. power bills, internet expenses, the interest on her home loan, her property insurance, and her rates. In addition, Hayley may deduct 100% of her expenses that relate solely to the rental activity. These expenses include the cost of advertising the room for rent, her host service fees, the sheets and towels she bought for guests to use (she only uses those for guests renting out the room), and the tea, coffee, sugar, cereal and milk the guests use. Example 2 : Apportioning mixed expenses based on the number of rental nights Jason and Kim are saving for an overseas holiday and decide to rent out their apartment for four weeks during a high-profile sporting event in their city. They stay with Jason’s parents during this time. Jason and Kim should apportion their mixed expenses on the following basis: The whole apartment is used exclusively by guests for 28 out of the 365 days in the year, and the mixed expenses are 100% deductible for that period: 28 365 × 100 = 7.67% Therefore, Jason and Kim may deduct 7.67% of their mixed expenses for the year. Their mixed expenses include 28 days’ worth of the daily fixed charge for their power connection, internet expenses, the interest on their home loan, their property insurance, and their rates. In addition, Jason and Kim may deduct 100% of their expenses that relate solely to the rental activity. These expenses include the cost of advertising the apartment for rent, their host service fees, the power usage charges for the period (if this can’t be identified precisely an average may be used), and supplies used by the guest (eg, cleaning products, toilet paper, and pantry staples). QB 19/05: 20 May 2019 8 UNCLASSIFIED 27. In situations where you may take into account the periods the space is either rented out or available to be rented out and not being used privately, you’ll need to have evidence that shows when it was available to be rented out. Evidence that the space is available for rent would need to be more than a mere statement of its availability, sporadic or limited advertising, or advertising that isn’t likely to attract many customers. You would have to have evidence of active and regular marketing of the space at market rates, and that it’s available at times and for periods that demonstrate it’s genuinely available to rent. Example 3 : Apportioning mixed expenses based on availability – a separate dwelling from your home Melanie and Alistair live in a very popular wine region, and regularly rent out the sleep- out in their garden. They don’t use the sleep-out themselves for anything. The sleep- out is advertised year-round, and in the last tax year it was available for rent at any time other than for six weeks (42 nights) over the Christmas holidays when Melanie’s parents, who live overseas, came to stay and used the sleep-out. In the tax year, the sleep-out was used to earn income and was also used privately (by Melanie’s parents). Melanie and Alistair have used QB 19/06: What income tax rules apply if I have a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use myself? to work out the sleep-out isn’t a mixed-use asset for the tax year because it was only unused for 58 days. It would have to have been unused for 62 days or more to be a mixed-use asset. Therefore, the rules in this QWBA apply. The sleep-out does not have a bathroom, so guests who stay there use the main bathroom of Melanie and Alistair’s house, which can be accessed from the garden. The sleep-out is on a separate power connection from the house. Guests can use Melanie and Alistair’s wi-fi. There are tea and coffee facilities in the sleep-out, and guests can order a cooked breakfast for an additional charge. Melanie and Alistair rented out the sleep-out for 265 nights during the tax year. The floor areas of the different parts of the property are shown in the diagram below. Rest of the house (not used by guests) 110m 2 Bathroom (shared) 10m 2 Sleep-out for rent 12m 2 QB 19/05: 20 May 2019 9 UNCLASSIFIED 28. As noted in \[19\], where you occasionally rent out a room in your home, normally you would need to apportion your mixed expenses based on the number of nights the room is actually rented out (as shown in Example 1). This is because when you are not renting out the room, those expenses are purely private expenses related to keeping your home. However, the following example shows a situation where it would be accepted that the mixed expenses could be apportioned on the basis of the availability of the rooms for rent. Melanie and Alistair should apportion their mixed expenses on the following basis: Used exclusively by guests – 100% deductible for days the sleep-out is rented out or available to be rented out, as it is not used by Melanie and Alistair Common area – 50% deductible for days someone is renting the sleep- out Private area – 0% deductible Melanie and Alistair have to calculate what proportion of their mixed expenses they may deduct for the sleep-out, which was used exclusively by guests, and rented or available for rent all but six weeks (42 nights) of the year, and what proportion they may deduct for the common area (the shared bathroom). The results of those calculations are then added together. The sleep-out, used exclusively by guests, is 12m 2 out of the total 132m 2 floor area of the dwellings on the property, and is 100% deductible for the 323 out of 365 nights in the tax year that it was either rented out or available to be rented out: 12 132 × 323 365 × 100 = 8.04% The common area, the shared bathroom, which is able to be used by Melanie and Alistair and guests, is 10m 2 out of the total 132m 2 floor area of the dwellings on the property, and is 50% deductible for the 265 out of 365 nights in the year that the sleep-out is rented out: 10 132 × 265 365 × 50 = 2.75% Adding these figures (8.04 % and 2.75%) together, Melanie and Alistair calculate that they may deduct 10.79% of their mixed expenses for the year. Their mixed expenses include their internet expenses, the interest on their home loan, their property insurance, and their rates. Because the sleep-out is on a separate power connection from the house, Melanie and Alistair may deduct 100% of the power bills for the sleep-out for the 323 out of 365 nights in the year that it is either rented out or available to be rented out. In addition, Melanie and Alistair may deduct 100% of their expenses that relate solely to the rental activity. These expenses include the cost of advertising the sleep-out for rent, the host service fees, and the tea and coffee supplies in the sleep-out. The amounts Melanie and Alistair receive for cooked breakfasts are income, and they may deduct the cost of the ingredients used. 12m 2 10m 2 110m 2 QB 19/05: 20 May 2019 10 UNCLASSIFIED Example 4 : Apportioning mixed expenses based on availability – space within your home Josh and Sarah run a bed and breakfast (B&B) from their home in a tourism hotspot. The B&B has four bedrooms, each with an ensuite, which are advertised year-round and are available for rent at any time other than for three weeks in winter, when Josh and Sarah take a holiday. Guests can use a sunroom and a billiard room. If guests wish to dine in, meals can be enjoyed in the dining room, or room service can be requested. The B&B has approximately 60% occupancy, and Josh and Sarah had guests in at least one room for 300 days during the year. The floor areas of the different parts of the B&B are shown in the diagram below. Josh and Sarah should apportion their mixed expenses on the following basis: Used exclusively for the B&B operations – 100% deductible Used exclusively by guests – 100% deductible for days the rooms are rented out or available to be rented out, as they not used by Josh and Sarah Common areas – 50% deductible for days someone is renting a room in the B&B Private area – 0% deductible Josh and Sarah have to calculate what proportion of their mixed expenses they may deduct for the: • office and storage area, which is used exclusively for B&B operations; • rental rooms, which are used exclusively by guests and are available for rent for 49 weeks of the year; and • common areas. They then need to add the results of those calculations together. Other common areas (hallways) 30m 2 Bedroom 4 for rent 25m 2 Bedroom 2 for rent 25m 2 Bedroom 1 for rent 25m 2 Sunroom 15m 2 Office and B&B storage 15m 2 Kitchen 20m 2 Josh and Sarah’s bedroom 25m 2 Dining room 20m 2 Bedroom 3 for rent 25m 2 Billiard room 35m 2 15m 2 120m 2 25m 2 100m 2 QB 19/05: 20 May 2019 11 UNCLASSIFIED The office and storage area, used exclusively for B&B operations, is 15m 2 out of the 260m 2 total floor area of the house, and is 100% deductible as it is only used in relation to the rental activity: 15 260 × 100 = 5.77% The rental rooms, used exclusively by guests, are 100m 2 out of the total 260m 2 floor area of the house, and are 100% deductible for the 49 out of 52 weeks in the year that the rooms are either rented out or available to be rented out: 100 260 × 49 52 × 100 = 36.24% The common areas, which are used by Josh and Sarah and guests, are 120m 2 out of the total 260m 2 floor area of the house, and are 50% deductible for the 300 out of 365 days in the year that at least one of the rooms is rented out: 120 260 × 300 365 × 50 = 18.97% Adding these figures (5.7 7%, 36.24% and 18.97%) together, Josh and Sarah calculate that they may deduct 60 .98% of their mixed expenses for the year. Their mixed expenses include their power bills, internet expenses, the interest on their home loan, the amount of their property insurance premium that equates to what their premium would be if they didn’t run the B&B from the property, and the portion of their rates that they would have to pay if they didn’t run the B&B from the property (ie, what normal residential rates would be for the property). In addition, Josh and Sarah may deduct 100% of their expenses that relate solely to the rental activity. These expenses include the cost of advertising the rooms for rent, the host service fees, the amount they pay in additional property insurance premiums (over what they’d pay if they didn’t run the B&B from the property), the amount they pay in additional rates (over what the normal residential rates would be) because they run the B&B from the property, and bathroom supplies for the rooms. The amounts Josh and Sarah receive for meals purchased by guests are income, and they may deduct the costs of providing those meals. Depreciation of chattels 29. As noted in \[14\], you’ll also be able to claim deductions for the depreciation of the chattels in your home that paying guests can use. Depreciation deductions reflect that chattels in your home are subject to wear and tear resulting in them reducing in value while being used to earn income. 30. If the chattels are only used by guests (eg, chattels in a bedroom you only use for renting out), the full amount of depreciation will be deductible. 31. But you may only claim for part of the depreciation on “mixed-use” chattels – ie, chattels in common areas that guests are able to use, and chattels in a room you rent out and also use privately. 32. The approach to work out how much depreciation you may claim each year for “mixed- use” chattels is similar to the approach to apportioning your mixed expenses. But it differs slightly, because there is a specific apportionment formula in the Income Tax Act 2007 for depreciation of assets partly used to earn income. QB 19/05: 20 May 2019 12 UNCLASSIFIED 33. Before you can apply the formula, you need to work out the depreciation loss for the year for each asset. 34. For low value items ($500 or less), the depreciation loss is the item’s cost. If the item is part of a group of items you purchased at the same time from the same supplier, and the items would have the same depreciation rate, the $500 threshold applies to the group of items. For example, if you bought $2,000 worth of linen at one time, you would have to depreciate the linen using one of the methods mentioned at \[35\]. 35. For other items, you work out the depreciation loss for the year using either the diminishing value method or the straight-line method. There’s information about those methods on Inland Revenue’s website , and you can find the relevant depreciation rates using Inland Revenue’s depreciation rate finder – available on Inland Revenue’s website. 36. Once you know the depreciation losses for the year for the chattels in your home that are both used privately and able to be used by paying guests, you need to work out what proportion of those losses you may deduct. To do this, multiply those losses by: a + b c Where – “a” is : nights in the year the space (eg, room, or whole house) is rented out “b” is : nights in the year the space is available to be rented out and the mixed- use chattels are not used privately “c” is : nights in the year the mixed-use chattels are used or available for any purpose 37. For mixed-use chattels in common areas, item “b” in the formula would typically be zero. This is because when the room you rent out is available for rent, you are still using the chattels in your lounge or other common areas for private use. An example of where this would not be the case would be if you were away overseas and renting out your whole house for short stays. In that situation, f or the periods in between paying guests, you would not be using the chattels for private use, so those days the house is vacant would be counted in item “b”. Whichever method you use, you can’t pool assets to depreciate them as a single asset if they’re partly used privately – so you won’t be able to use the pooled approach for chattels in the common areas of your home that guests can use, or for chattels in a room you rent out and also use privately. QB 19/05: 20 May 2019 13 UNCLASSIFIED Example 5: Calculating a deduction for depreciation of chattels Jasper rents out the spare room in his house for short stays. When he has paying guests, they can use the lounge, dining room, kitchen, laundry and bathroom. Jasper rents out the room for a total of 120 nights during the year. Jasper doesn’t use the spare room at all. Jasper may deduct the full depreciation loss he calculates for the chattels in the spare room, as these are only used by paying guests. Jasper calculates that he may deduct 32.88% of his depreciation losses in respect of the chattels in the common areas of the house that paying guests can use: 120 365 × 100 = 32.88% If Jasper was away for work for 30 nights during the year, the calculation would remain the same. While Jasper did not use the chattels in the common areas privately on those days, they were also not available to be used by paying guests, as Jasper only rents out the spare room when he is home. Who should declare the income? 38. The income belongs to the owner of the land (including leasehold land) and they must declare it to Inland Revenue. If there is more than one owner, the income needs to be split appropriately between them. 39. If the land is owned in a trust, the rules about who has to declare the income are more complicated, and we recommend you see a tax advisor to help you with your affairs. 40. If you lease the property from a relative (other than a trust) and use it to earn income, you should ensure you’re paying an adequate amount of rent for the property to the extent of the income-earning use. If you don’t, the Commissioner can deem there to be adequate rent paid. This is to ensure that property can’t be leased between relatives for low or nominal rent to shift income for a tax benefit (see s GC 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007). What records do I need to keep? 41. You need to keep records of: • the number of nights you rent out your home, the room, or the separate dwelling on your property; • how much income you receive for renting out the area; and • any expenses you will want to claim deductions for. Provisional tax 42. If the tax you have to pay at the end of the year is more than $2,500, the next year you’ll have to pay provisional tax – which means that you pay tax instalments during the year. There’s information about provisional tax on the Inland Revenue website .

(Inland Revenue)
20 May 2019 1 UNCLASSIFIED Question What income tax rules apply if I have a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use myself? Answer Different rules could apply in this situation. The rules that apply will determine the tax treatment for the dwelling. Different rules can apply each year, so at the end of each income year you’ll need to work out which rules the dwelling falls into for that year: • the “mixed-use asset” rules; or • the standard tax rules. The main difference between the mixed-use asset rules and the standard rules is how you calculate the proportion of your costs you can deduct. This QWBA will help you work out which tax rules apply to the dwelling for each income year. You need to revisit which rules apply each year. QB 19/06 What income tax rules apply if I have a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use myself? QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This “Question We’ve Been Asked” (QWBA) will help you work out which income tax rules apply to a dwelling you sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation (eg, through Airbnb, Bookabach and Holiday Houses) and sometimes use yourself – eg, a holiday home. Key provisions Income Tax Act 2007 – subpart DG Key terms Guest means a person provided with short-stay accommodation in return for payment. Mixed-use asset means an asset that is used both privately and to earn income, and is also unused for at least 62 days in the year. Short-stay accommodation means accommodation provided for up to four consecutive weeks in a dwelling that is not the guest’s ordinary residence. It doesn’t include accommodation provided to residential tenants, boarders or care home residents, and it doesn’t include student or emergency accommodation.  Before you read this QWBA This QWBA is one of a series covering the tax rules for short-stay accommodation hosts. Check Overview – Short-stay accommodation items to make sure it’s the item that’s relevant to your circumstances. QB 19/06: 20 May 2019 2 UNCLASSIFIED Explanation 1. If you have a dwelling that you rent out as short-stay accommodation, and also sometimes use yourself, you will need to work out which income tax rules apply so you can meet your tax obligations. The dwelling could be a holiday house or a separate dwelling on the same property you live on (for example, a sleepout or a cottage). 2. Depending on your circumstances, the dwelling will either fall under: • the “mixed-use asset” rules; or • the standard tax rules. 3. This QWBA explains how to work out which rules apply in your situation. Records you’ll need to keep 4. You’ll need to keep good records to work out each year which rules apply, and then to apply the relevant rules correctly. This would include records of: • the number of nights the dwelling is used privately (this includes by you, by people you’re associated with, and by anyone for less than 80% of the market value rent); • the number of nights you rent out the dwelling, and how much income you receive for renting it out; • when the dwelling was available to be rented out (this will be relevant if the standard rules apply); and • any expenses you want to claim deductions for. Mixed-use asset rules or standard rules? 5. The mixed-use asset rules deal with deductions for certain assets (including land) that are used both privately and to earn income, but are also unused for significant periods during the year. Under these rules, the expenses incurred for a dwelling that’s sometimes rented out are deductible for the periods it’s rented out and non-deductible for the periods it’s used privately. 6. The issue the rules address is how to treat the expenditure incurred when the dwelling is empty. Under the standard rules, deductions for the time the dwelling is empty are based on whether it is available for income earning. However, under the mixed-use asset rules, the proportion of expenses that may be deducted for the empty periods is reduced. The amount that may be deducted is based on the proportion of income- earning use of the dwelling relative to the total use of the dwelling during the year. 7. If you have a dwelling that you sometimes rent out for short-stay accommodation and also sometimes use yourself, the factor that determines which rules apply is whether the dwelling is unused for 62 days or more during a year. QB 19/06: 20 May 2019 3 UNCLASSIFIED 8. A dwelling can flip in and out of the mixed-use asset rules from one year to the next, so you need to look at which rules are relevant to the dwelling for each income year (which for most people is 1 April – 31 March). The mixed-use asset rules can apply to most ownership structures, so it doesn’t matter if you own the property or if it’s owned by another entity or held in another structure (eg, a trust or a family company). 9. The dwelling will be a “mixed-use asset” if, during the year: • you partly used it to earn income; • you partly used it privately (this includes use by family members, or by friends renting it for “mates’ rates” that are less than 80% of the market value rent); and • it was not used for at least 62 days in the year. Standard rules 10. If the dwelling doesn’t meet the three criteria listed in \[9\] for a particular income year, the standard tax rules will apply for that year. QB 19/08: How do the standard income tax rules apply to a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use privately? explains how the standard rules work. You’ll need to revisit which rules apply each year. Mixed-use asset rules 11. If the dwelling meets the three criteria at \[9\] for a particular income year, the mixed- use asset rules are relevant. However, there are two situations in which you may opt out of the tax rules altogether for the rental income from the dwelling. Opting out of the tax rules for the rental income if the dwelling is a mixed-use asset 12. You may choose to opt out of the tax rules if: • your rental income for the year from the dwelling is under $4,000; or In the income year, you had a dwelling that you earned rental income from and used privately Private use includes use by natural persons you’re associated with, and by anyone for “mates’ rates” of less than 80% of the market value rent – both discussed further at \[15\] Was the dwelling unused for at least 62 days in the year? The mixed-use asset rules are relevant to the dwelling for the income year Check if you may opt out of the tax rules (see from \[12\]). The standard tax rules apply to the dwelling for the income year QB 19/08 will guide you through the standard rules. No Yes QB 19/06: 20 May 2019 4 UNCLASSIFIED • you made a loss from the dwelling and would have some of your deductions quarantined (that is, carried forward to the next year). 13. If you choose to opt out of the tax rules for the rental income from the dwelling, the income is exempt. This means that you don’t pay tax on it and you can’t claim tax deductions for your expenses related to the dwelling. Opt-out: rental income from the dwelling is under $4,000 14. The first situation in which you can opt out of the mixed-use asset rules (and the tax rules generally) for the rental income from the dwelling is where the gross rental income (before expense deductions) for the year is under $4,000. 15. The $4,000 threshold for opting out of the tax rules doesn’t include income that’s classed as exempt income. Exempt income is income from renting out the dwelling to associated persons (eg, family members), and income from renting out the dwelling for less than 80% of the market value rent (eg, renting it to friends for “mates’ rates”). Both of these are explained below: Income from renting out the dwelling to associated persons • This covers income from renting the dwelling to natural persons you’re associated with (eg, close relatives such as your children, grandchildren, siblings or in-laws). • If a trust, partnership or company owns the dwelling, this would cover income from the dwelling being rented to associated natural persons (eg, for a trust, the settlors and beneficiaries). Income from renting out the dwelling at “mates’ rates” • This covers income from renting the dwelling to friends at “mates’ rates” of less than 80% of the market value rent. Your dwelling is a mixed-use asset for the year See \[9\] Opt-out: rental income under $4,000 See \[14\] Opt-out: you would have quarantined expenditure See \[17\] Use the mixed-use asset rules See QB 19/07 Inland Revenue guide IR620 can help you work out if someone is associated with you. It can be found on Inland Revenue’s website. If a company owns the dwelling, in addition to the normal rules about association, the company will be associated with anyone who has a share in the company that gives them the right to use the dwelling. QB 19/06: 20 May 2019 5 UNCLASSIFIED • This does not include income from renting the dwelling at a lower price because it’s off-peak season, a longer-term rental, or for other similar reasons. This is because in those situations the market rate is the lower price. 16. All of your other rental income from the dwelling is counted. If your counted income for the year from renting out the dwelling is less than $4,000 gross (that is, before expense deductions), you may opt out of the tax rules – see further from \[25\]. Opt out: quarantined expenditure 17. The second situation in which you may opt out of the tax rules for the rental income from the dwelling is where you would otherwise have what’s called “quarantined expenditure” for the year for the dwelling. 18. You would have quarantined expenditure if: • your income from renting out the dwelling during the income year was less than 2% of the property’s value; and • you made a loss from renting out the dwelling (that is, the expenses you can deduct for the year under the mixed-use asset rules exceed the income). 19. In this situation, if you don’t opt out of the tax rules, you may only deduct your expenses up to the amount of income. Your expenses over and above your income from the dwelling are “quarantined” – meaning they are carried forward to a future income year to offset against any future profits from the dwelling. 20. Instead of that, if you want you may opt out of the tax rules by choosing to treat the income for the year as exempt, and not get any deductions for your expenses related to the dwelling. 21. In working out if your income was less than 2% of the property’s value, you don’t include exempt income (amounts of income described in \[15\]). It’s your taxable income from the dwelling that’s counted towards the 2% threshold. 22. The property value you use to measure the 2% threshold against is generally the local rating value. However, if you bought the property from someone you aren’t associated with since the rates value was last set, you use the purchase price. 23. If there’s another dwelling on the same property, the 2% threshold is measured against a proportion of the local rating valuation, based on the percentage of the total land area that the asset is on. So, for example, if you have a sleepout that’s a mixed-use asset on the same property as your house, and the area of the sleepout is 20% of the total section, you’d test the 2% threshold against 20% of the rating valuation. 24. If you calculate that you would have quarantined expenditure for the year for the dwelling, you can opt out of the tax rules – see further from \[25\]. If you decide to opt out 25. If you’re in one of above situations, and you choose to opt out of the tax rules for the rental income from the dwelling, you don’t need to do anything for that income for that income year. All of the income from renting out the dwelling is classed as exempt income, and you can’t claim any related expenses as deductions. 26. For each income year, you need to revisit whether the dwelling is a mixed-use asset (see from \[5\]) and if it is, whether you are able to opt out of the tax rules (see from \[12\]). QB 19/06: 20 May 2019 6 UNCLASSIFIED If you can’t or don’t opt out 27. If the dwelling is a mixed-use asset and you can’t or don’t opt out of the tax rules for the rental income, the mixed-use asset rules will apply for the particular year. QB 19/07: How do the mixed-use asset income tax rules apply to a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use privately? explains how the mixed-use asset rules work. You’ll need to revisit which rules apply each income year.

20 May 2019 1 UNCLASSIFIED Question How do the mixed-use asset income tax rules apply to a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use privately? Answer If the mixed-use asset rules apply, rental income from the dwelling will generally be taxable. However, some income will be exempt – for example, income from renting the dwelling to family members or to others at “mates’ rates”. The mixed-use asset rules set out how to determine the costs you may deduct against your income from providing the short-stay accommodation. QB 19/07 How do the mixed-use asset income tax rules apply to a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use privately? QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This “Question We’ve Been Asked” (QWBA) explains how the income tax rules apply to a dwelling you sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation (eg, through Airbnb, Bookabach and Holiday Houses) and sometimes use privately, where the dwelling is subject to the mixed-use asset rules. Before you use this QWBA, you need to work out if the mixed-use asset rules apply to the dwelling. QB 19/06: What income tax rules apply if I have a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use myself? will help you work that out. Key provision Income Tax Act 2007 – subpart DG Key terms Guest means a person provided with short-stay accommodation in return for payment. Mixed-use asset means an asset that is used both privately and to earn income, and is also unused for at least 62 days in the year. This would include many baches. Short-stay accommodation means accommodation provided for up to four consecutive weeks in a dwelling that is not the guest’s ordinary residence. It doesn’t include accommodation provided to residential tenants, boarders or care home residents, and it doesn’t include student or emergency accommodation.  Before you read this QWBA This QWBA is one of a series covering the tax rules for short-stay accommodation hosts. Check Overview – Short-stay accommodation items to make sure it’s the item that’s relevant to your circumstances. QB 19/07: 20 May 2019 2 UNCLASSIFIED Costs that are solely related to renting out the dwelling are fu lly deductible. Costs that are solely related to your private use of the dwelling are not deductible. Other costs are partly deductible – the deductible amount is based on the number of rental nights relative to the total number of nights the dwelling is used. If you make a loss from renting out the dwelling, you may not be able to deduct all of your expenses that year – some might be carried forward to future years. Explanation 1. If you have a dwelling that you sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and also sometimes use yourself, you will need to work out which income tax rules apply, so you can meet your tax obligations. The dwelling could be a holiday home, or a separate dwelling on the same property you live on (eg, a sleep-out or cottage). 2. Depending on your circumstances, the dwelling will either fall under the “mixed-use asset” rules or the standard tax rules. 3. To work out which rules apply in your situation, see QB 19/06: What income tax rules apply if I have a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use myself? You’ll need to revisit which rules apply each year. 4. This QWBA will be relevant if: • you’ve determined that for a particular income year the dwelling is a mixed-use asset; and • you haven’t opted out of the tax rules. \[You can only do this in certain circumstances – see QB 19 /06 : What income tax rules apply if I have a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use myself?\] Background 5. The mixed-use asset rules apply where assets are sometimes used privately, sometimes used to earn income, and are also unused for a significant period during the year. The rules ensure an appropriate proportion of the expenses that relate to the “unused” period is deductible. The proportion that’s deductible is based on the amount of income-earning use relative to the total use of the asset. What do I do if the mixed-use asset rules apply to the dwelling? 6. Once you’ve determined that the mixed-use asset rules apply to the dwelling for a particular income year (see QB 19/06: What income tax rules apply if I have a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use myself?), you’ll need to work out: • what rental income is taxable; • what income is exempt; and • what proportion of your expenses is tax deductible. 7. This QWBA covers each of those issues. QB 19/07: 20 May 2019 3 UNCLASSIFIED What income is taxable and what income is exempt? 8. Income you receive from renting out the dwelling is generally taxable. However, there are two situations where it will be exempt. Where you have exempt income, you don’t pay tax on the amount you receive, and you can’t deduct expenses for those days. Figure 1 summarises what you need to consider when working out whether your rental income is taxable or exempt. Figure 1: Determining whether rental income is taxable or exempt Exempt income: renting out the dwelling to an associated person 9. The first situation where income you receive from renting out the dwelling is exempt is where you rent it out to a natural person who’s associated with you. 10. This covers income from renting out the dwelling to natural persons you’re associated with (eg, close relatives such as your children, grandchildren, siblings or in-laws). 11. If a trust, partnership or company owns the dwelling, this would cover income from the dwelling being rented to associated natural persons (eg, for a trust, the settlors and beneficiaries). Exempt income: renting out the dwelling at “mates’ rates” 12. The second situation where income you receive from renting out the dwelling is exempt is where you rent it out for less than 80% of the market value rent. Rental income from the dwelling Income from renting the dwelling to associated persons See from \[9\] Income from renting the dwelling at “mates’ rates” See from \[12\] All other income from renting the dwelling See from \[15\] Exempt Taxable Inland Revenue guide IR620 can help you work out if someone is associated with you. It can be found on Inland Revenue’s website. If a company owns the dwelling, in addition to the normal rules about association, the company will be associated with anyone who has a share in the company that gives them the right to use the dwelling. QB 19/07: 20 May 2019 4 UNCLASSIFIED 13. This covers income from renting the dwelling to friends at “mates’ rates” of less than 80% of the market value rent. 14. It doesn’t include income from renting the dwelling at a lower price because it’s off- peak season, a longer-term rental, or other similar reasons. This is because in those situations the market rate is the lower price. Taxable income 15. Other than the two situations above, any amounts you receive from renting out the dwelling are taxable. The activity doesn’t need to be run as a business for the amounts you receive to be income. 16. You’ll be able to deduct expenses related to the dwelling. We explain below how to work out what proportion of expenses is deductible. What portion of my expenses can I claim deductions for? 17. You’ll be able to claim deductions for 100% of expenses that relate solely to your rental activity. Any expenses that relate solely to your private use of the dwelling are not deductible. But many of your expenses will relate to both your income-earning and private use of the dwelling, so will be only partly deductible. 18. If the dwelling is owned by a close company (eg, a family company), there are special rules for interest deductions. These rules aren’t covered in this QWBA, but you can read about them in Inland Revenue’s Special Report on mixed-use assets (14 August 2013), which is on Inland Revenue’s website. The following paragraphs explain how the general rules work. Expenses that are fully deductible 19. You may claim deductions for 100% of some expenses. To be fully deductible, the expense (which can’t be a capital expense) must: (1) relate solely to the use of the dwelling to derive income (not including exempt income); and (2) meet either or both of the following: (a) be expenditure that you wouldn’t reasonably expect to receive a personal benefit from (or if a company owns the dwelling, no associate of the company would be reasonably expected to receive a personal benefit from); and / or (b) be expenditure that you must reasonably incur to meet a regulatory requirement to be able to use the dwelling to derive income, and you wouldn’t have incurred the expenditure otherwise. 20. These expenses would include things like: • advertising costs, including any commission or fee you pay to an advertising platform or transaction facilitator (this does not include any service fee the guests pay the platform – just fees you pay); • supplies used solely by your paying guests; • cleaning costs for the rental periods; • any additional insurance premium you pay (over what you would otherwise pay) because you rent out the property; and QB 19/07: 20 May 2019 5 UNCLASSIFIED • any additional rates you pay (over what the normal residential rates would be) because you rent out the property. 21. You may also deduct 100% of the cost of repairing damage to the property that occurred when it was being used to earn income. This doesn’t include when it’s used to earn exempt income (which is in the two situations mentioned from \[8\]). It also doesn’t include damage that’s the result of ordinary wear and tear, as that occurs during both periods the dwelling is rented and periods it’s used privately. Expenses that are non-deductible 22. Any expenses that relate solely to the private use of the dwelling are not deductible. Private use includes use by you, by natural persons you’re associated with, and by anyone for “mates’ rates” of less than 80% of the market value rent. For example, if you use the dwelling for a month over the summer and you can identify actual usage charges that are a component to some of your expenses (eg, power), you can’t deduct any of the usage component for that period as it relates solely to your private use of the dwelling. Similarly, any consumables you use at the dwelling are not deductible. Expenses that are partly deductible 23. All of your other deductible expenses must be apportioned between the income-earning use of the dwelling, and the private use. This would be the case for expenses such as: • power bills; • internet expenses; • interest on your home loan; • property insurance (or what the insurance premium would be if you have to pay more because you rent out the property); • repairs and maintenance; • depreciation on chattels; and • rates (or what the normal residential rates would be if you have to pay more because you rent out the property). 24. There’s a formula to use to apportion these expenses, so you know what proportion is deductible. 25. Under the formula, the proportion of expenses that are deductible reflects the income- earning use of the dwelling relative to the private use. Only days the dwelling is actually used are counted, so days it is available to be rented out but isn’t actually rented out don’t alter the proportion of expenses you may deduct. 26. For example, if you stayed at the dwelling for 30 nights a year, and rented it out for 25 nights, you could deduct 45.45% of your expenses (25 income-earning nights out of a total of 55 nights the dwelling was used). 27. The formula (in s DG 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007) refers to “days”, but if a different unit of measure would give a more appropriate apportionment, you use that measure instead. For accommodation, “nights” would be the measure you would use. Therefore, the formula would be: your expenditure × income-earning nights income-earning nights + counted nights QB 19/07: 20 May 2019 6 UNCLASSIFIED 28. “Income-earning nights” are: - Nights the dwelling i s used to earn income, other than exempt income So nights you rent out the dwelling to someone who’s associated with you or for “mates’ rates” (less than 80% of the market value, as discussed from \[12\]) are not counted as “income-earning nights”. - Nights you use the dwelling to repair damage caused by a renter This doesn’t include nights you stay at the dwelling to repair damage caused by renters you get exempt income from (which is in the two situations mentioned at \[8\] – associates and people paying “mates’ rates”). It also doesn’t include nights you stay at the dwelling to repair damage that’s the result of ordinary wear and tear. Your use of the dwelling to carry out the repairs must be necessary for you to be able to count those nights as “income-earning nights”. Therefore, you may only count the nights you need to stay at the dwelling to complete the repairs from damage caused on an “income-earning night”. - Nights the dwelling was reserved by someone who didn’t end up using it These nights may be counted as “income-earning nights” if the dwelling isn’t available for use because the person who’d reserved it didn’t end up using it. For example, a no-show, or a cancellation close to the reserved date which means the dwelling can’t be used by someone else. 29. “Counted nights” are: - Nights the dwelling is used, but aren’t “income-earning nights” This includes nights you use the dwelling, nights someone associated with you uses the dwelling, and nights the dwelling is rented out for less than 80% of the market value rent. Examples of “income-earning nights’ and “counted nights” Income-earning nights • You rent the property to a non-associated person at market rates. • Guests damage the property: - You stay there for two nights and spend the whole weekend repairing the damage  these are both income-earning nights - After a tiring weekend of repairs, you decide to stay for an extra 2 nights  Only the nights you had to stay for the repairs are income-earning nights – the extra nights are “counted nights” • A guest cancels on the first day of their 3- night booking and no-one else books the place for those nights. Counted nights • You stay at the property for a holiday. • You rent the property to your in -laws at market rates. • You rent the property to your best friend for “mates’ rates” of $50 a night rather than the usual price of $100. • Your in -laws or friend who stayed at “mates’ rates” damage the property and you stay there for two nights to spend the weekend repairing the damage. • The paint in the bedrooms is looking shabby, so you stay at the property for a week re-painting. • A non-associated guest paying market rates damaged the property, but the damage is only minor and you fix it in a couple of hours on your next family holiday at the property. QB 19/07: 20 May 2019 7 UNCLASSIFIED 30. Example 1 at \[37\] shows how the apportionment formula works. 31. If you don’t want to do the calculations yourself, there’s a calculator on the Inland Revenue website that you can use to work out how much you may deduct for the expenses that need to be apportioned (eg, the expenses listed at \[ 24\]). 32. Remember, if the dwelling is owned by a close company, there are special rules for interest deductions, which aren’t covered here. See \[18\] for where to find out more about those special rules. Losses and the expenditure quarantine rules 33. If you make a loss from renting out the dwelling (that is, the deductible expenses for the year exceeded the rental income), you might not be allowed to deduct all of your expenses for that year. These rules are called the “expenditure quarantine rules”, and if they apply, you may only deduct your expenses up to the amount of the rental income from the dwelling. Any deductions in excess of that are carried forward to future income years until they’re able to be offset against any future profits from the dwelling (whether the mixed-use asset rules or the standard tax rules apply in the year that you make a profit from the dwelling). 34. If the expenditure quarantine rules apply, the effect is that the allowable deductions in excess of the income from the dwelling can’t be offset against your income from other sources (eg, your salary and wage income). 35. The expenditure quarantine rules apply if: • your income from renting out the dwelling during the income year was less than 2% of the property’s value; and • you made a loss from renting out the dwelling (that is, the deductible expenses for the year exceeded the income). 36. In working out if your income was less than 2% of the property’s value, you don’t include exempt income (described Figure 1 at \[8\]). It’s your taxable income from the dwelling that has to meet the 2% threshold. This is illustrated in Example 1. Example 1: Using the apportionment formula Matt’s holiday home has a rating value of $300,000. He bought the holiday home before the last time the rating value was reset. Matt rented out his holiday home for 20 nights in the income year, at $200 a night. All of the rental nights were to people he isn’t associated with, and at full market rate. Matt used the holiday home for 35 nights, and his brother (an associated person) used it for 12 nights. Matt’s fully deductible expenses (which relate solely to the rental use of the holiday home) for the year were $230 for advertising, and a total of $500 for cleaning services after each guest (not including associates or friends paying “mates’ rates”). The expenses Matt has that relate to both the rental activity and the private use of the holiday home total $20,000 (which includes home loan interest, rates, insurance, utility bills and general maintenance). Matt does not have any expenses that relate only to his private use of the holiday home. Using the apportionment formula, Matt calculates that he may deduct $5,970.15 of those expenses: $20,000 × 20 67 = $5,970.15 So the total amount Matt may deduct is $6,700.15 ($230 + $500 + $5,970.15). His total income from renting out the holiday home was $4,000 (20 nights × $200). QB 19/07: 20 May 2019 8 UNCLASSIFIED 37. The property value you use to measure the 2% threshold against is generally the local rating value. However, if you bought the property from someone you aren’t associated with since the rates value was last set, you use the purchase price. Who should declare the income? 38. The income belongs to the owner of the land (including leasehold land) and they must declare it to Inland Revenue. If there is more than one owner, the income needs to be split appropriately between them. 39. If the dwelling is owned in a trust, the rules about who has to declare the income are more complicated, and we recommend you see a tax advisor to help you with your affairs. 40. If you lease the property from a relative (other than a trust) and use it to earn income, you should ensure you’re paying an adequate amount of rent for the property to the extent of the income-earning use. If you don’t, the Commissioner can deem there to be adequate rent paid. This is to ensure that property can’t be leased between relatives for low or nominal rent to shift income for a tax benefit (see s GC 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007). What records do I need to keep? 41. Because the dwelling may or may not fall within the mixed-use asset rules (remember, you’ll need to work out each year whether it does), you’ll need to keep good records so you can apply the income tax rules correctly either way. This includes records of: • the number of nights you rent out the dwelling at market value, and how much income you receive for this; • the number of nights you rent out the dwelling at “mates’ rates”, and how much income you receive for this; • the number of nights you, or people you’re associated with, used the dwelling; • when the dwelling was available to be rented out (this will be relevant if the standard rules apply); Therefore, Matt therefore has a net loss of -$2,700.15. Two percent of the property value for the holiday home is $6,000. Because Matt’s income from renting the holiday home ($4,000) is less than that, he may only deduct expenses up to the amount of income – so $4,000 worth. The remaining deductible expenses ($2,700.15) are carried forward to the next income year. Note: If you would otherwise have quarantined expenditure for an income year, you may instead choose to opt out of the mixed-use asset rules. This is discussed in QB 19/06: What income tax rules apply if I have a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use myself? If you do this, all of the income from renting out the dwelling is classed as exempt income and you can’t claim any related expenses as deductions. However, this QWBA is about how the mixed-use assets rules apply if you haven’t opted out of them. QB 19/07: 20 May 2019 9 UNCLASSIFIED • any expenses you want to claim deductions for; and • any quarantined expenditure you have in respect of the dwelling. Provisional tax 42. If the tax you have to pay at the end of the year is more than $2,500, you’ll have to pay provisional tax the next year – which means you pay tax instalments during the year. There’s information about provisional tax on the Inland Revenue website .

20 May 2019 1 UNCLASSIFIED Question How do the standard income tax rules apply to a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use privately? Answer If the standard tax rules apply, rental income from the dwelling will generally be taxable, including “mates’ rates” rental income. The only exception is minor contributions to expenses from family and friends. Costs that relate solely to renting out the property are fully deductible (eg, advertising). Costs that relate solely to your private use of the dwelling are not deductible. Other costs are partly deductible – the deductible amount is based on the number of nights the dwelling is rented or available to be rented relative to the total number of nights in the year. QB 19/08 How do the standard income tax rules apply to a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use privately? QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This “Question We’ve Been Asked” (QWBA) explains how the standard income tax rules apply to a dwelling you sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation (eg , through Airbnb, Bookabach and Holiday Houses) and sometimes use privately. Before you use this QWBA, you need to work out if the standard tax rules or the mixed-use asset rules apply to the dwelling. QB 19/06: What income tax rules apply if I have a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use myself? will help you work that out. Key provision Income Tax Act 2007 – s CC 1 Key terms Guest means a person provided with short-stay accommodation in return for payment. Short-stay accommodation means accommodation provided for up to four consecutive weeks in a dwelling that is not the guest’s ordinary residence. It doesn’t include accommodation provided to residential tenants, boarders or care home residents, and it doesn’t include student or emergency accommodation.  Before you read this QWBA This QWBA is one of a series covering the tax rules for short-stay accommodation hosts.

QB 19/08: 20 May 2019 2 UNCLASSIFIED If you make a loss from renting out the dwelling, you may not be able to deduct all of your expenses that year – some of your deductions might be carried forward to future years. Explanation 1. If you have a dwelling that you sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation, and also sometimes use yourself, you need to work out which income tax rules apply so you can meet your tax obligations. The dwelling could be a holiday home, or a separate dwelling on the same property you live on (eg, a sleepout or a cottage). 2. Depending on your circumstances, the dwelling will fall into either the mixed-use asset rules or the standard tax rules. 3. To work out which rules apply in your situation see QB 19/06: What income tax rules apply if I have a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use myself? You’ll need to revisit which rules apply each year. 4. This QWBA will be relevant if you’ve determined that for a particular income year the dwelling is subject to the standard rules. 5. This QWBA doesn’t apply if the dwelling is owned by a company. What is the main difference between the standard rules and the mixed-use asset rules? 6. The main difference between the standard rules and the mixed-use asset rules is how you calculate the proportion of expenses you may deduct. Under the standard rules, the proportion of expenses that’s deductible is based on the amount of time the asset is used for or available for income earning. What do I do if the standard tax rules apply to the dwelling? 7. If you’ve determined that the standard rules apply to the dwelling for a particular income year (see QB 19/06: What income tax rules apply if I have a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use myself?), this QWBA will help you apply those rules. Remember, you need to look at whether the dwelling falls into the mixed-use asset rules or the standard rules each income year (which for most people is 1 April – 31 March). What’s income and what isn’t? Amounts received are generally income 8. If the standard rules apply to the dwelling, the amounts you receive from paying guests will generally be income under s CC 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The activity doesn’t need to be run as a business for the amounts you receive to be income. 9. You’ll be able to deduct expenses related to the dwelling. We explain how to work out what proportion of expenses are deductible from \[13\]. Minor contributions to expenses 10. An exception to amounts you receive from guests being income is where family or friends use the dwelling and aren’t charged rent, but make a minor contribution to your expenses (eg, they pay you $20 towards power and heating). In that situation, the contribution isn’t rental income, but you also can’t claim any deductions for that period. QB 19/08: 20 May 2019 3 UNCLASSIFIED Renting the dwelling at “mates’ rates” 11. If you rent the dwelling at less than full market rates (eg, to family or friends at “mates’ rates”), the rent will be income. In this situation, Inland Revenue will accept a deduction for your expenses for that period up to the amount of rent received for the period. What can I can claim deductions for? 12. You’ll be able to claim deductions for 100% of expenses that solely relate to your rental activity. Any expenses that solely relate to your private use of the dwelling are not deductible. But many of your expenses will relate to both your income-earning and private use of the dwelling – these “mixed expenses” are only partly deductible. 13. You’ll also be able to claim deductions for the depreciation of the chattels in the dwelling that paying guests can use. But, as with your mixed expenses, you can only claim for part of the depreciation because the chattels are used when the dwelling is rented out to earn income and also when it’s used privately. 14. The following paragraphs will help you work out what deductions you may claim, and will help you calculate what percentage of your mixed expenses and depreciation is tax deductible. Expenses that are fully deductible – expenses that relate solely to rental activity 15. You may claim deductions for 100% of expenses that solely relate to your rental activity. This would include: • advertising costs, including any commission or fee you pay to an advertising platform or transaction facilitator (this doesn’t include any service fee the guests pay the platform – just fees you pay); • supplies used solely by your paying guests; • cleaning costs for the rental periods; • any additional insurance premium you pay (over what you would otherwise pay) because you rent out the property; and • any additional rates you have to pay (over what the normal residential rates would be) because you rent out the property. 16. You may have some expenses that you can split between being related solely to your rental activity and being mixed rental and private expenses. For example, expenses that have a fixed component and a usage component (eg, power). If you can identify actual usage charges for a period where the dwelling was only rented out and not used privately at all, you don’t have to apportion the usage component for that period – it is fully deductible. The fixed charge component still needs to be apportioned, as it’s necessary to maintain a power connection, which is used both privately and by paying guests. Expenses that are non-deductible – expenses that relate solely to private use 17. Any expenses that relate solely to private use of the dwelling are not deductible (this includes use by family or friends who aren’t charged rent). For example, if you use the dwelling for a month over the summer and you can identify actual usage charges that are a component to some of your expenses (eg, power), you can’t deduct any of the usage component for that period as it relates solely to your private use of the dwelling. Similarly, any consumables you use at the dwelling are not deductible. QB 19/08: 20 May 2019 4 UNCLASSIFIED Expenses that are partly deductible – expenses that relate to both rental activity and private use 18. You may only claim deductions for part of an y expenses that relate to both your rental activity and the private use of the dwelling. These sorts of mixed expenses would include: • power bills (but see \[16\] and \[17\]); • internet expenses; • interest on your home loan; • property insurance (or what the insurance premium would be if you have to pay more because you rent out the property); • repairs and maintenance; and • rates (or what the normal residential rates would be if you have to pay more because you rent out the property). 19. Where you rent out a dwelling that you also sometimes use, to work out what proportion of these mixed expenses you may claim, you need to take into account: • the periods the property is rented out (including at “mates’ rates”) or available to be rented out; and • the periods the property is used privately (this includes use by family or friends who aren’t charged rent). 20. Generally, to work out the proportion of your expenses you may deduct, you multiply those expenses by: 21. You’ll need to keep track of the number of nights you rent out the dwelling, and you’ll need to have evidence of when it was available to be rented out. This evidence needs to be more than a mere statement of its availability, sporadic or limited advertising, or advertising that isn’t likely to attract many customers. You need to have evidence of active and regular marketing of the space at market rates, and that it’s available at times and for periods that demonstrate it’s genuinely available to rent. 22. Nights the dwelling is used privately aren’t counted as nights it’s available to be rented out. This is the case even if the property remains advertised (eg, if you don’t mark it as being “unavailable” or “booked” in an online booking system). Private use includes when you use the dwelling, and also when family or friends use it if they aren’t charged rent (even if they make a minor contribution to your expenses, as noted at \[10\]). 23. If renters have access to the whole dwelling (ie, there are no parts they are not permitted to use), your apportionment is just based on the number of nights the dwelling is rented out or available to be rented out, as a proportion of the total nights in the year. nights the dwelling is rented out or available to be rented out nights in the year QB 19/08: 20 May 2019 5 UNCLASSIFIED 24. If part of the house isn’t available for use by the guest (eg, a locked room in which you store your personal possessions), you may not deduct the proportion of mixed expenses that relate to that space. You need to factor in the floor area calculations like this: Example 3 Nathan and Joel from Example 2 keep items they and their family use on holiday in one of the bedrooms in the house, which is locked, and can’t be used by guests. The bedroom is 25m 2 , and the whole house is 200m 2 Nathan and Joel calculate that they may deduct 63.53% of their mixed expenses: 175 200 × 265 365 × 100 = 63.53% Depreciation of chattels 25. As noted at \[13\], you’ll also be able to claim deductions for the depreciation of the chattels in the dwelling that paying guests can use. Depreciation deductions reflect that chattels in the dwelling are subject to wear and tear, resulting in a reduction in their value while being used to earn income. 26. As with your mixed expenses, you may only claim for part of the depreciation because the chattels are used when the dwelling is rented out to earn income and also when it’s used privately. 27. The approach to work out how much depreciation you may claim each year is similar to the approach for apportioning mixed expenses. But it does differ slightly, as there is a specific apportionment formula in the Income Tax Act 2007 for depreciation of assets partly used to earn income. Example 2 Nathan and Joel have a holiday house in Queenstown, that they and their extended family use for a total of 100 nights during the year. The house is rented out for 240 nights during the year, and is advertised and available to be rented out throughout the year except when the family want to use it. The holiday house isn’t in the mixed-use asset rules, as it’s not unused for 62 days or more during the year. Nathan and Joel may deduct 100% of their expenses that relate solely to the rental activity. These expenses include the cost of advertising the house for rent, their host service fees, the additional rates they pay (over what the normal residential rates would be) because they rent the property out, and the additional insurance premium they pay (over what they’d otherwise pay) because they rent the property out. The house is rented out or available to be rented out for 265 out of the 365 nights of the year, so Nathan and Joel calculate that they may deduct 72.60% of their mixed expenses: 265 365 × 100 = 72.60% These expenses include the interest on Nathan and Joel’s home loan, utility bills, repairs and maintenance costs, the amount of their rates that equates to what the standard residential rates would be if the property wasn’t in a higher rating category, and the amount of their insurance premium that equates to what their premium would be if the property wasn’t rented out. QB 19/08: 20 May 2019 6 UNCLASSIFIED 28. Before you can apply the formula, you need to work out the depreciation loss for the year for each asset. 29. For low value items ($500 or less), the depreciation loss is the item’s cost. If the item is part of a group of items you purchased at the same time from the same supplier, and the items would have the same depreciation rate, the $500 threshold applies to the group of items. For example, if you bought $2,000 worth of linen at one time, you would have to depreciate the linen using one of the methods mentioned at \[30\]. 30. For other items, you work out the depreciation loss for the year using either the diminishing value method or the straight-line method. There’s information about those methods on Inland Revenue’s website , and you can find the relevant depreciation rates using Inland Revenue’s depreciation rate finder – available on Inland Revenue’s website. 31. Once you know the depreciation losses for the year for the chattels in the dwelling that paying guests can use, you need to work out what proportion of those losses you may deduct. To do this, multiply those losses by: 32. While it is the chattel depreciation that is being worked out, the chattels are only used or available for use when the dwelling is – which is why the dwelling rental and availability nights are used to calculate the allowable chattel depreciation loss. 33. The difference between this formula and the approach for mixed expenses is that you are identifying the number of nights the dwelling is rented out or available to be rented out as a proportion of all of the nights in the year it is available for any purpose, rather than as a proportion of all of the nights in the year. So, if the dwelling is not available for use by anyone for a period, those nights are not counted. nights the dwelling is rented out or available to be rented out nights in the year the dwelling is used or available for any purpose Whichever method you use, you can’t pool assets to depreciate them as a single asset if they’re partly used privately – so you won’t be able to use the pooled approach for the chattels in the dwelling. QB 19/08: 20 May 2019 7 UNCLASSIFIED Example 4 Nicola has a holiday home in a popular tourist town. She and friends used it for a total of 80 nights during the year, and it was rented out for 230 nights. The house was uninhabitable for 52 days during the year, while Nicola had the house extended by building a loft bedroom and deck with lake views. The house was advertised and available to be rented out throughout the year, except when booked out for Nicola and her friends to use, and over the building period. The holiday home isn’t in the mixed- use asset rules, as it’s not unused for 62 days or more during the year. Nicola calculates that she may deduct 63.84% of her mixed expenses (home loan interest, insurance, rates, power bills, internet, etc): 233 365 × 100 = 63.84% However, for depreciation the calculation is slightly different. Instead of dividing the rental/available for rental days by the number of days in the year, the total of those days is divided by the number of days the property is used or available for any purpose, which would exclude the 52 building days when it couldn’t be used. Nicola calculates that she may deduct 74.44% of her depreciation losses for the chattels in the house: 233 313 × 100 = 74.44% Losses and the proposed rental expenditure ring-fencing rules 34. There are currently rules proposed that may mean that if you make a loss from renting out the dwelling (that is, your deductible expenses for the year exceeded the income), you might not be allowed to deduct all of your expenses that year – some might be carried forward to future income years. If these rules are enacted, there will be information about them on Inland Revenue’s website. Who should declare the income? 35. The income belongs to the owner of the land (including leasehold land) and they must return it to Inland Revenue. If there is more than one owner, the income needs to be split appropriately between them. 36. If the dwelling is owned in a trust, the rules about who has to declare the income are more complicated, and we recommend you see a tax advisor to help you with your affairs. 37. If you lease the property from a relative (other than a trust) and use it to earn income, you should ensure you’re paying an adequate amount of rent for the property to the extent of the income-earning use. If you don’t, the Commissioner can deem there to be adequate rent paid. This is to ensure that property can’t be leased between relatives for low or nominal rent to shift income for a tax benefit (see s GC 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007). What records do I need to keep? 38. Because the dwelling may or may not fall within the mixed-use asset rules (remember, you’ll need to work out each year whether it does), you’ll need to keep good records so you can apply the income tax rules correctly either way. This includes records of: • the number of nights you rent out the dwelling at market value, and how much income you receive for this; QB 19/08: 20 May 2019 8 UNCLASSIFIED • the number of nights you rent out the dwelling at “mates’ rates”, and how much income you receive for this; • the number of nights you, or people associated with you, used the dwelling; • when the dwelling was available to be rented out (see \[21\] and \[22\]); • any expenses you want to claim deductions for; and • any ring-fenced expenditure you have in respect of the dwelling. Provisional tax 39. If the tax you have to pay at the end of the year is more than $2,500, the next year you’ll have to pay provisional tax – which means that you pay tax instalments during the year. There is information about provisional tax on the Inland Revenue website .

20 May 2019 1 UNCLASSIFIED Question Can I register for GST if I supply short-stay accommodation to guests in my home or holiday home? Answer Yes. Supplies of short-stay accommodation are taxable supplies. Provided you have a “taxable activity” of continuously or regularly supplying (or intending to supply) short-stay accommodation to guests for payment, you may register for GST. If your supplies exceed $60,000, or are likely to, in any 12-month period you must register. In most cases supplies of short-stay accommodation will likely be below the registration threshold of $60,000 in a 12-month period but you may voluntarily register for GST. However, registering for GST will not be right for everyone. If you register for GST, there are on-going requirements and when you sell your property or stop providing short- stay accommodation you will likely have GST to pay. QB 19/09 Can I register for GST if I supply short-stay accommodation to guests in my home or holiday home? QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This “Question We’ve Been Asked” (QWBA) explains whether hosts who provide short-stay accommodation in their house or property can register for GST. This QWBA is part of a series of items dealing with common issues encountered by those listing properties through peer-to-peer websites (eg, Airbnb, Bookabach and Holiday Houses). Key provisions Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the Act) sections: 2 (definition “dwelling”), 5, 6, 8, 11 (1)(mb), 14, 20, 21, 21F and 51. Key terms Guest: means the recipient of the supply of short-stay accommodation. Host: means the person supplying the short-stay accommodation. Short-stay accommodation: means accommodation provided for up to four weeks in a dwelling that is not the guest’s principal place of residence. It does not include accommodation provided to residential tenants, boarders or care home residents, and it does not include student or emergency accommodation.  Before you read this QWBA This QWBA is one of a series covering the tax rules for short-stay accommodation hosts. Check Overview – Short-stay accommodation items to make sure it’s the item that’s relevant to your circumstances. QB 19/09: 20 May 2019 2 UNCLASSIFIED Explanation 1. If you supply short-stay accommodation by renting out your house, a room in your house, a separate dwelling on your property, or your bach or holiday home then you can potentially register for GST. 2. To register under the Act, you need to have a “taxable activity”. A taxable activity involves making taxable supplies but excludes making exempt supplies. Confusion exists because some supplies of residential accommodation (such as long-term residential rental) are exempt under the Act. However, supplies of short-stay accommodation (as that term is used in this QWBA) are taxable supplies, so are not excluded from a taxable activity. 3. A taxable activity involves continuously or regularly supplying (or intending to supply) short-stay accommodation to guests for consideration (ie, payment). Determining whether your level of activity is sufficient to be a taxable activity is a question of fact. 4. If you carry on a taxable activity, you may register for GST. If your supplies exceed $60,000 in a 12-month period, you must register for GST. If your supplies are less than this amount, you may still voluntarily register for GST. If you register for GST you will have additional compliance costs in terms of recordkeeping, invoicing, regular filing of returns and adjustments for private and income-earning use. You will also need to balance the benefit of an initial GST refund for a portion of the property against the subsequent GST tax liability when the property is sold or your taxable activity ends. Because GST is charged on the property’s value and property usually increases in value, your GST tax liability when you sell or stop your activity will generally be greater than any initial benefit you receive. 5. In working out whether to register for GST, you need to understand the following aspects of GST: • supplies of short-stay accommodation; • carrying on a taxable activity; • registering for GST; • on-going requirements; and • stopping a taxable activity. Supplies of short-stay accommodation 6. A taxable activity involves making taxable supplies but excludes making exempt supplies. The Act treats the supply of accommodation in a “dwelling” as an exempt supply. A question arises as to whether the supply of short-stay accommodation in a room in your home or property is the supply of accommodation in a “dwelling” and an exempt supply. 7. “Dwelling” is defined in the Act by the nature of the use of the accommodation by the guest and not the function of the premises. While the accommodation may be a dwelling from your perspective, it does not mean there is a supply of accommodation in a dwelling from the guest’s perspective. For a supply of accommodation to a guest to be in a “dwelling”: • the premises must be the guest’s principal place of residence; • the guest must have rights of quiet enjoyment (from s 38 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986); and • the premises cannot be a commercial dwelling. QB 19/09: 20 May 2019 3 UNCLASSIFIED 8. Short-stay accommodation in this QWBA means accommodation provided for up to four weeks in a dwelling that is not the guest’s principal place of residence. It is assumed the guest will have a main residence elsewhere. This means the first requirement for the supply of accommodation to be an exempt supply will not be satisfied. 9. Quiet enjoyment in the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 generally applies to longer-term residential tenancies and not to short-stay ac commodation that is commonly offered on peer-to-peer websites. The quiet enjoyment must be without interruption from the landlord. It is unlikely you will provide this, and the standard terms and conditions on peer-to-peer websites normally exclude such rights of quiet enjoyment. The second requirement for the supply of accommodation to be an exempt supply is not satisfied either. 10. This means the supply of short-stay accommodation to a guest in your home or property will not be the supply of accommodation in a “dwelling” and an exempt supply. Your home or property will not be the guest’s principal place of residence and the guest will not have rights of quiet enjoyment. Because short-stay accommodation fails to satisfy these two requirements it is irr elevant whether your premises are also a “commercial dwelling”. 11. This means the supply of short-stay accommodation is a taxable supply, so you might be able to register for GST. Carrying on a taxable activity 12. To register for GST, you must be carrying on a taxable activity. For a taxable activity to exist: • there must be an activity; • which is carried on continuously or regularly by a person; and • that involves, or is intended to involve, supplies made to another person for consideration. 13. Where you provide short-stay accommodation, you will usually be carrying on an activity and the first requirement will be met. 14. The second requirement is that your activity is “carried on continuously or regularly”. For an activity to be carried on “continuously”, you must carry on the activity over a period or in a sequence uninterrupted in time. The activity must not have stopped in a permanent sense or have been interrupted in a significant way. For your activity to be carried on “regularly”, it must be carried on at reasonably short intervals with a steadiness or uniformity of action. Your activity must recur or be repeated at fairly fixed times, or at generally uniform intervals, to be of a habitual nature and character. An activity that is intermittent or occasional does not qualify. (Newman v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,229 (HC), Allen Yacht Charters Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,270, Wakelin v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,182 and Case N27 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,229). 15. A “taxable activity” must also be an activity that “involves or is intended to involve” the supply of goods and services to another person for consideration. This means your activity of providing short-stay accommodation must be for money. Sometimes you can have a taxable activity before you start getting paying guests. In determining the nature and character of an activity, any stated intention can be tested against the objective realities of the case and generally “actions speak louder than words” (Case N27). Where you are registering because you intend to start carrying on a taxable activity you must specify a commencement date. 16. Determining whether a taxable activity is being carried on, including whether it is being carried on continuously or regularly, is a question of fact and degree. If short-stay QB 19/09: 20 May 2019 4 UNCLASSIFIED accommodation is offered in your own home and does not occur very often, it can be difficult to determine whether the activity is sufficiently continuous or regular. All of the circumstances will need to be considered. The factor that usually will be the strongest indicator of a taxable activity is occupancy. Some factors that may be relevant in the short-stay accommodation context (particularly where the premises are your own home) could potentially include: • the level of occupancy; • the steps you have taken to start providing short-stay accommodation (for example, undertaking feasibility studies, preparing business plans, advertising (nature and extent), and approaching local authorities for necessary consent, if required); • whether your property is listed on various websites and at an appropriate price; • the type, size, design and layout of your home or premises; • the location of your home or premises and hence it’s desirability; • the extent and nature of modifications to your home or property to enable you to provide short-stay accommodation; • the time you dedicate, and can dedicate, to the activity; • whether you make the short-stay accommodation available over a sustained period; • the steps you have taken that demonstrate a continuing commitment to supply short-stay accommodation, for example, advertising and ongoing marketing activities; and • future bookings. 17. If you do not have a taxable activity, then you cannot register for GST. However, there may still be income tax implications. For more information see Overview – Short-stay accommodation items (Inland Revenue). If you do have a taxable activity, then you may register for GST. However, this does not necessarily mean that registration is either compulsory or right for you. These issues are discussed in the next section of this QWBA. Example 1 Luke and Betty own a three-bedroom house in a suburb of Lower Hutt. They were not that interested in renting out their home to strangers and they thought the income would be only modest as demand is limited for short-stay rentals in their suburban neighbourhood. That changed when they heard the area was set to host the Golden Oldies Commonwealth Games and that they could rent out their house for $1,000 a night. They listed their home on a website, and it was booked for 10 nights. They spent the time visiting their grandchildren in Australia. Luke and Betty thought it worked so well that they plan to do something similar in two years’ time during a rugby tournament. Apart from that, they have no intention of listing their property again. One-off or occasional rentals (even though they can be lucrative) will not be a taxable activity as the activity does not satisfy the requirement of being continuous or regular. The rugby tournament is too far away for the activity to be continuous (and Luke and Betty’s plans are too uncertain). Therefore, Luke and Betty do not have a taxable activity as this was essentially a one-off. Example 2 Peggy has seen various news items about Airbnb homestays. She has heard that it is a growth industry and a way of meeting interesting people. Her husband, who QB 19/09: 20 May 2019 5 UNCLASSIFIED Registering for GST 18. Provided you have a taxable activity, the Act requires you to register when the value of supplies you make in the course of carrying on “all” your taxable activities has or will exceed $60,000 (exclusive of GST) in any 12-month period. This is the total amount you receive before taking expenses into account. You need to be aware of two issues when calculating the $60,000 threshold: • Because all taxable activities are included, it is not necessary that any one taxable activity exceeds $60,000 in annual supplies. Amounts you earn from other taxable activities are included in calculating whether you exceed the registration threshold. This could apply, for instance, if you have another business. is in full-time employment, agrees. The couple live in a small farming town situated just off a main highway. It is a pleasant enough place, but does not have any notable attractions. The couple investigate the possibility of selling their existing home and buying a bigger property. They register for GST stating their taxable activity to be “homestay operators”. They sell their present home and buy a three-bedroom home about 10 kilometres from town. They claim an input tax deduction on part of the purchase price of the house. As soon as they move in, they advertise the homestay on a peer-to-peer website and put up a homestay sign outside the front gate. Inland Revenue queries the input tax deduction claim. Enquiries reveal that: • the town is too remote to attract guests on a regular basis; • the taxpayers have not undertaken research into the local market and have not taken any significant steps to ascertain the viability of the activity; • the distance of the home from the remote town makes it less likely that anyone would choose to stay there on holiday; and • at the time the claim is queried (6 months after registration) only two paying guests have stayed (and they were relatives of town residents). In the absence of other evidence being provided, this claim would probably be disallowed on the basis that the taxpayers are not carrying on a taxable activity. Example 3 Mai owns a small one-bedroom apartment in central Auckland. To help pay the mortgage she lets her entire apartment on Airbnb and goes and stays with her family in the Waikato. To make it worth her while she lists her apartment for $350 a night for a minimum of two nights. Charging a premium means she generally has guests only for weekends when there are big events on. She researches and targets big events like concerts, sports games and cultural events. Over the Christmas and summer holidays her apartment is rented for 4 weekends. Mai also has guests for 2 weekends for big concerts during February and a further weekend in March when the Black Caps play Australia. Over the next 9 months there are periods when there are no big events and Mai has far fewer bookings. She has guests for only 6 weekends during those remaining 9 months. Mai has a taxable activity. Although there are periods when she does not make supplies she has not stopped the activity in a permanent sense. The activity is also carried on regularly at (mostly) short intervals. There are “seasonal fluctuations” depending on what events are scheduled but the rental activity recurs and is habitual in nature and character. Further Mai dedicates a lot of time researching events coming up in Auckland and ensuring her pricing is profitable but competitive. QB 19/09: 20 May 2019 6 UNCLASSIFIED • The threshold calculation includes supplies to “associated persons” that will be valued at the open market value. This could apply , for instance, if a holiday home is owned by a family trust and rented out by the trustees who also allow the beneficiaries to stay for no or reduced consideration. The use of the property by the beneficiaries may be valued at market rates in calculating whether you exceed the registration threshold. 19. Even if the value of your supplies is less than $60,000 per year, you may voluntarily register if you carry on a taxable activity. However, as the following discussion shows, there are on-going requirements and obligations if you register for GST. On-going requirements if you register for GST 20. If you register for GST, you must satisfy on -going requirements and obligations. The following paragraphs summarise some of the main consequences of registration. This summary is a broad overview intended only as general guidance. Individual circumstances are inevitably different. Some aspects of GST, such as adjustments, depend on the particular circumstances, and hosts should consider seeking advice from a tax advisor. Administrative requirements 21. If you register for GST, you must file a GST return for each return period. For most hosts this will mean 6-monthly or 2-monthly returns. You will also need to satisfy the administrative requirements around invoicing and record keeping. Output tax 22. The GST charged on the supplies a registered person makes is called output tax. GST that you pay on goods and services you acquire is called input tax. If you register for GST, you need to account for GST output tax on all supplies you make of short-stay accommodation (including supplies to “associated persons”). From the amount of output tax payable in any return period, you can deduct some of the input tax you paid to determine the amount of tax payable. Input tax 23. Generally, you can claim input tax deductions to the extent to which the goods or services you acquire are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies. Where the short-stay accommodation is provided in your own home or in a property that you also use privately, you cannot claim the full amount of GST input tax that you paid. You need to do an apportionment calculation. Apportionment 24. Where the goods or services are used for both private purposes and making taxable supplies then the expenditure must be apportioned based on use (or intended use). Input tax on buying a property is apportioned based on how you intend to use the property and is subject to subsequent on-going adjustments where the actual use is different from the intended use. Change-in-use adjustments 25. If you register for GST, the Act requires you to work out at the end of an “adjustment period”, whether an adjustment is required for any difference between your intended use and the actual use of a property used for providing short-stay accommodation. An adjustment period is generally a year ending on your balance date. The calculation is then repeated each year. QB 19/09: 20 May 2019 7 UNCLASSIFIED 26. Not every change of use requires an actual adjustment provided the value and change of use remain below the thresholds in the Act. However, the requirement to calculate whether you need to make an adjustment applies for the whole time you own the land and remain registered for GST. In practice, this means when you claimed GST input tax on the purchase price or construction, you need to make annual adjustments where actual use is different to that initial intended use. Special rules for mixed-use assets 27. There are special rules for calculating input tax for “mixed-use assets”. A mixed-use asset is an asset that has both an income earning use and private use but is unused for at least 62 days a year (eg, holiday homes and baches). Put simply, the calculation ignores periods of non-use (eg, when a bach is empty) and input tax is divided between income-earning use and private use. Entitlement to input tax deduction for goods acquired before registration 28. Under the Act you may make an adjustment for goods purchased before you became GST registered that you subsequently use to make taxable supplies. Land and buildings can be “goods” in this context. This rule means an adjustment is allowed for your property if you acquired it before you registered for GST. This means your property will become subject to the same apportionment rules as any other asset. It also means a likely GST liability on sale or cancellation of registration. The Act allows you to bring property purchased pre-registration into the GST rules, but it does not allow you to claim GST input tax for periods when you owned that property prior to registration. Stopping a taxable activity 29. If you must register, or decide to register for GST, you need to be aware of what happens if you sell your property or stop providing short-stay accommodation from your property. In both cases, you will need to pay GST. Accounting for GST on sale 30. When you sell your property, you will have to account for GST output tax on the sale of the property. Depending on your circumstances, you may have to charge and account for GST on the sale proceeds from the property, but a deduction will be allowed for input tax that has not previously been claimed on the purchase price. Given the likely appreciation in value of the property, GST on sale will exceed (possibly significantly) the further input tax claimable. 31. There are a number of special provisions that deal with supplies of a dwelling and treatment on disposal that may apply to the sale of your property. Particularly relevant are the zero-rating provisions that charge GST at 0% on certain supplies of land and dwellings. However, for this to apply, the buyer of your property must be registered and have the intention of using the property to make taxable supplies – whether by also providing short-stay accommodation or some other taxable supplies. If this and other criteria are met, then GST is charged at 0%. This effectively means that you don’t pay GST on sale. However, the more common situation with sales of residential property would be to non-registered persons and such sales will attract GST. Cancelling GST registration 32. You can ask the Commissioner to cancel your registration where the value of your taxable supplies is below the registration threshold. Alternatively, if you stop your taxable activity, you must notify the Commissioner within 21 days and your registration for GST will be cancelled. However, if you have taxable activities other than providing short-stay accommodation (eg, if you have another business) you may QB 19/09: 20 May 2019 8 UNCLASSIFIED remain registered for GST but you will be required to undertake a change-in-use adjustment for your property. 33. The Commissioner also has the power to cancel your GST registration if she is satisfied that you are not carrying on a taxable activity. The Commissioner might suspect this is the case if you continue to be registered but file only “nil” returns and no longer make any taxable supplies. 34. If you stop being eligible to be registered for GST, you must account for GST output tax on any goods and services forming part of the assets of your taxable activity immediately before you stopped being a registered person (s 5(3) of the Act). You must account for GST based on the open market value of your assets used in your taxable activity (s 10(7A)). This means you will pay GST output tax based on the value of your property if you stop providing short-stay accommodation. Without planning for this, this can cause issues for two main reasons: • The output tax payable will usually be significantly more than the initial input tax claimed because property prices tend to rise over time. This means the relative amount of GST payable if you stop your activity will be more than the amount you originally claimed. • You may not have available funds to pay the GST. If you sell your property, you will have the money from the sale to pay the GST. If you just stop your activity, you still need to pay the GST, but you won’t have the sale money to pay the GST. Example 4 Baz has the opportunity to buy a house in Turangi. The house costs $400,000 but Baz reckons the local housing market is so strong that it will be worth $480,000 in a few years. He wants to either: • Rent the property to residential tenants; or • List the property as a holiday home on a website. He will use the property exclusively for providing short-stay accommodation. He believes the property will be popular year-round because of the proximity to the ski fields, the Tongariro Crossing and good fly fishing spots. Baz wants to know whether he can register for GST. Residential tenants If he rents the property to residential tenants he cannot register for GST. The supply of accommodation in a dwelling is not a taxable supply. If rented to residential tenants it is likely to be a supply of accommodation in a dwelling because it is the tenants’ principal place of residence and they have quiet enjoyment under their residential tenancy. Short-stay accommodation The provision of short-stay accommodation (as that term is used in this QWBA) is a taxable supply. It will not be an exempt supply of accommodation in a dwelling because the house will not be the guest’s principal place of residence and they will not have rights akin to quiet enjoyment. Baz can register for GST provided he has a taxable activity. Based on his research, Baz believes he can rent the property year-round. He estimates 120 nights of bookings per year at an average of $200 per night ($24,000 pa). If he proceeds with his plan Baz will have a taxable activity. The value of supplies in any 12-month period will be well below the $60,000 threshold and so registration is voluntary. If Baz does register for GST, there will be administrative requirements concerning invoicing and recordkeeping. He will also be required to make returns on either a two or six-monthly basis.

However, Baz will be able to claim input tax deductions on expenditure he incurs in providing the short-stay accommodation. This includes an input tax deduction on the purchase price of the property. (If Baz uses the property for his own use, he will need to apportion any input tax deductions and make subsequent adjustments. If there is private use, Baz will also have to consider the rules for mixed use assets.) If Baz sells (presuming it is not a zero-rated sale) he will have to account for GST output tax on the sale. Should Baz stop his taxable activity, his GST registration would be cancelled, and he would need to pay GST output tax based on the value of the property. Decision not to register Baz decides to use the property to solely provide short-stay accommodation but decides not to register for GST because he does not want the extra compliance costs. He also intends to retire in a few years and wants to use the house as a holiday home solely for his family. He does not want to be liable for GST output tax when he stops his taxable activity. Ba z calculates the expected increase in the property’s value would leave him over $10,000 worse off : • GST input tax will be 3/23 x $400,000 = $52,174 • GST output tax will be 3/23 x $480,000 = $62,609.
18 June 2019 1 UNCLASSIFIED Question When must an unincorporated body that provides administrative or management services to its members register for GST? Answer An unincorporated body that provides administrative or management services to its members must register for GST if: • it is carrying on a taxable activity; and • the value of its supplies of goods and services made in New Zealand exceeds the $60,000 registration threshold. This includes the value of supplies of administrative or management services the body makes to its members. An unincorporated body carrying on a taxable activity with supplies below the registration threshold may voluntarily register for GST. If registered, the body must account for GST on all its supplies of goods and services. Explanation Introduction 1. This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) provides guidance on when a group of property owners, tenants or professionals who join together for administration or management of their common interests will be an “unincorporated body” for GST purposes and required to register and charge GST under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act). 2. This QWBA is consistent with the following items to the extent they address unincorporated bodies and it updates and replaces them: • “Question 62 - clinics providing administrative services – taxable activity?” Public Information Bulletin Vol 158 (November 1986): 11; • “Question 112 - residential management committee – taxable activity?” Public Information Bulletin Vol 158 (November 1986): 27; and Sometimes a group of property owners, tenants or professionals might form an unincorporated body to manage and administer their common property or practice areas. This item looks at what is an unincorporated body in those circumstances and when it must register for GST. Key provisions Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, ss 2, 5(8A), 6(1), 10(1), 51, 57 QB 19/11 GST – administrative or management services provided by an unincorporated body to its members QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 19/11: 18 June 2019 2 UNCLASSIFIED • “GST and property administration” Public Information Bulletin Vol 173 (April 1988): 7. 3. This QWBA addresses the GST treatment of unincorporated bodies formed to provide administrative or management services to its members. However, it does not address the GST position of unincorporated bodies formed to provide administrative or management services to its members that are partnerships, joint ventures or the trustees of a trust. 4. In addition, this QWBA does not address bodies corporate under the Unit Titles Act 2010 (or its predecessor, the Unit Titles Act 1972). The GST Act includes specific rules for bodies corporate registered under the Unit Titles Act 2010. (See Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 28, No 3 (April 2016): 33.) Bodies corporate registered under the Retirement Villages Act 2003 should refer to the Interpretation Statement “IS 15/02: Goods and services tax – GST and retirement villages” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 11 (December 2015): 6. Analysis 5. For a “person” to be required to register for GST, the person must: 1 • carry on a “taxable activity”; and • the value of supplies it makes, or expects to make, in New Zealand in a 12- month period: o was $60,000 or more in the last 12 months; or o will be $60,000 or more in the next 12 months. 6. For GST purposes the term “person” includes: • a company; and • an unincorporated body of persons. 7. The term “company” in the GST Act is broader than simply companies incorporated under the Companies Act 1993 (or its predecessor). It means any body corporate (see s 2). A society incorporated under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908 is a body corporate, and so is treated as a company for GST purposes. This means an incorporated society is a “person” for GST purposes. 8. While the term “unincorporated body of persons” is not defined in the GST Act, the term “unincorporated body” is defined in s 2. An “unincorporated body” is an unincorporated body of persons, including a partnership, a joint venture or the trustees of a trust. It follows then that this definition is not exclusive and includes unincorporated bodies of persons that are not partnerships, joint ventures or the trustees of a trust. What is an unincorporated body of persons? 9. The meaning of the term “u nincorporated body of persons” ( and the similar term “unincorporated association”) has been considered by the courts in the context of whether a group of individuals, or co-owners of property, are an unincorporated body. The courts have held that: 1 It is assumed none of the exclusions for registration in s 51(1) apply. QB 19/11: 18 June 2019 3 UNCLASSIFIED • an unincorporated association is an organisation formed by members to effect their purpose in an agreed manner (Taunton Syndicate v CIR (1982) 5 NZTC 61,106); • a significant degree of regulation governing the relationship between the co- owners of the property is required before finding there is an unincorporated association or body (Case P70 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,469); • the agreement between the members of an unincorporated association might be in the bodies’ rules and constitution and include some basic terms covering: o the qualification to be a member of the association; o the number of members the association may have; o how the association is to be managed; and o how a member withdraws or retires from the association or disposes of their share in the association (Taunton Syndicate, Conservative and Unionist Central Office v Burrell (Inspector of Taxes) \[1982\] 2 All ER 1); • an unincorporated association involves two or more persons bound together for one or more common purposes by mutual undertakings (Conservative and Unionist Central Office); • the necessity to co-operate where common decisions are needed about commonly-owned property does not amount to an unincorporated body (Anglesea Builders Partnership v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,181); • for there to be an unincorporated association there must be some sense of mutual duties and obligations between the co-owners, beyond the loosest of moral obligations to consult co-owners (McElwee v CIR (1988) 10 NZTC 5,181); • while an unincorporated body is more likely to be found to exist where there is a contract between the members, a written contract may not be essential (Conservative and Unionist Central Office, Anglesea Builders, McElwee); and • a “body of persons” are persons who together are properly to be considered as a body rather than as a number of individuals as there is such regulation of their internal affairs that there is a structure by which they can be recognised as a collective entity – the unincorporated equivalent of a body corporate (Edwards v Legal Services Agency \[2003\] 1 NZLR 145). 10. Based on this case law, a group of individuals or co-owners of property including a residents’ association, a property management committee or a clinic or practice manager established by professionals to carry out administrative services may be an “unincorporated body of persons” for GST purposes if they have the following kinds of characteristics: • is formed by its members for one or more common purposes; • has a significant degree of regulation governing the relationship between its members; • has agreed rules, setting out matters like: o how it is governed and how decisions are made by the body; o how its funds may be used; o what happens when members join and leave the group; and • is a structure recognised as a collective entity of its members. QB 19/11: 18 June 2019 4 UNCLASSIFIED 11. An unincorporated body will also usually have a name and a bank account. 12. Special rules in s 57 of the GST Act support treating a GST registered unincorporated body as a separate person for GST purposes. These rules are discussed further at \[24\]. What is not an unincorporated body of persons? 13. A group of people will not usually be an “unincorporated body of persons” for GST purposes if: • they simply own property together, and all that is involved is a loose moral obligation to consult with their co-owners; • they make decisions together, but without forming a body with mutual duties and obligations between members; • there is no significant degree of regulation or agreement between them governing their relationship; and • their relationship is confined to a cost-sharing arrangement. 14. Cost-sharing arrangements arise when a group of people simply agree between themselves to share in costs associated with pursuing a common interest. They can sometimes involve one person in the group incurring costs and then being reimbursed. Cost-sharing arrangements can also involve property owners contributing on an ad hoc- basis, or a regular basis, to particular expenditure on common property. For example, regular payments might be made by property owners to cover the expense of having a gardener maintain their shared garden every month. 15. Co-owners of cross-leased properties will usually be in a cost-sharing arrangement and not an unincorporated body, unless their cross-leasing arrangements establish a body with agreed rules setting out matters like: • how the body is governed, • how decisions are made by the body; • how its funds may be used; and • what happens when lessees join and leave the group. When will an unincorporated body be carrying on a “taxable activity”? 16. To establish whether an unincorporated body must register and charge GST the body must be carrying on a taxable activity. Based on s 6(1) of the GST Act, an unincorporated body that provides administrative or management services to its members will be carrying on a taxable activity when: • it carries on an activity continuously or regularly, whether or not for a pecuniary profit; • the activity involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person; and • the supply of goods and services is for consideration. Continuous or regular activity 17. An unincorporated body that provides administrative or management services to its members must carry on an activity that is organised in some coherent way. The activity must be carried on continuously or regularly. 18. The definition of a taxable activity is very broad and applies to any activity carried on QB 19/11: 18 June 2019 5 UNCLASSIFIED continuously and regularly by any person. A taxable activity is not limited to a “business” but also includes any activity carried on in the form of a “... profession, vocation, association, or club”. It is not necessary for the activity to have a profit- making purpose. 19. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view an activity carried on in the form of an unincorporated body is recognised as being an activity that, if carried on continuously and regularly, will satisfy the first requirement of the definition of “taxable activity”. 20. In the context of an association, a committee, or a society that provides administrative or management services for its members on a not-for-profit basis, it is to be expected that the body will be undertaking an activity on a continuous and regular basis for the members. For example, in the context of a property management committee, the committee would likely be regularly involved in engaging, managing and paying employees or contractors to perform repairs, maintenance, and cleaning. The committee might also take on a financial management and planning role to determine the residents’ contributions, and to timetable maintenance requirements. In the Commissioner’s view these duties would amount to an activity carried on continuously or regularly by such a committee. 21. Similarly, it is expected a n unincorporated body that is a “clinic” established by a group of medical professionals to undertake the administration of their practices would be carrying on an activity regularly and continuously. Supply of goods to another person 22. For an activity to be a taxable activity it must involve, or be intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration. Therefore, the next question is whether an unincorporated body’s activity involves making supplies to any other person. 23. This is an important requirement when considering an unincorporated body that provides administrative or management services to its members. For GST purposes an unincorporated body is treated as a separate entity, distinct from its members. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, when an unincorporated body provides administration or property management services to its members, the unincorporated body is making a supply to another person (the members individually) and has not been implicitly acting as the agent of the members. 24. This view is supported by the definition of “person” and in the case of unincorporated bodies, by the provisions of s 57 of the GST Act. In particular, s 57(2) confirms that an unincorporated body is a separate person for GST purposes by providing that: • the members of an unincorporated body cannot register in relation to carrying on the taxable activity carried on by the body (s 57(2)(a)); • any supply made in the course of carrying on an unincorporated body’s taxable activity is treated as supplied by the unincorporated body and not by the members of that body (s 57(2)(b)); • any supply made to or by a member acting in their capacity as a member of the body and in the course of the carrying on of the body’s taxable activity is treated as being made to or by the unincorporated body and not the member (s 57(2)(c)). Conversely, where a supply is made to or by a member, and the member is not acting in their capacity as a member of the body nor in the course of the carrying on of the body’s taxable activity, then the supply is made to or by the member and not the unincorporated body; • the unincorporated body is registered under the body’s name (s 57(2)(d)); and QB 19/11: 18 June 2019 6 UNCLASSIFIED • any change of members of the unincorporated body has no effect for GST purposes (s 57(2)(e)). 25. This approach is also supported by Gallen J in Taupo Ika Nui Body Corporate v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,147 (HC). Taupo Ika Nui was an appeal by the taxpayer against the Taxation Review Authority decision reported as Case S34 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,228. Gallen J upheld Judge Barber’s decision in Case S34 that a unit title body corporate was a separate entity from the proprietors of the land, and so there were supplies between that entity and the proprietors. Gallen J (like Judge Barber) rejected the argument that there were no supplies because the proprietors were merely acting on their own behalf. 26. Accordingly, when an unincorporated body makes supplies of administrative or management services to its members, that activity involves the body making supplies to another person, so the second requirement of the definition of “taxable activity” is met. It is also possible a body may be making supplies to third parties. Consideration 27. Finally, the supply of goods and services must be for consideration. The Commissioner considers that any levies or other amounts paid by the members of an unincorporated body for supplies of administrative or management services are consideration. 28. This is because “consideration” is a very widely defined term and includes payments made “in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services”. The words “in respect of” are words of the very widest meaning. For an unincorporated body that is providing services to its members the question is whether the amounts paid by members are paid “in respect of” the supply of any goods and services so as to amount to consideration. 29. As Cull J notes in Canterbury Jockey Club Inc v CIR \[2018\] NZHC 2,569 at \[124\] the case authorities are clear that “there needs to be some reciprocity or nexus between the supply made and the consideration passing between supplier and recipient”. In the Commissioner’s view, a nexus or link exists between the goods and services supplied by an unincorporated body and the levies or other amounts paid by its members (ie, reciprocity). Therefore, the levies or other amounts are paid “in respect of” the supplies of services, so are “consideration”. 30. Judge Barber in Case S34 was easily satisfied that the payment of levies by proprietors to a unit title body corporate was consideration for the supply of services. On the other hand, Gallen J in Taupo Ika Nui held there was no consideration because there was no reciprocity. While the facts in Taupo Ika Nui are somewhat similar to the situation being addressed in this QWBA, the Commissioner considers the Court of Appeal’s decisions in Turakina Maori Girls College Board of Trustees v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,032 , Chatham Islands Enterprises Trust v CIR \[1999\] 2 NZLR 388 and CIR v New Zealand Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 are better authority on reciprocity and consideration. This is because those decisions are from a higher court and have been more widely applied in subsequent judgments concerning GST and consideration. 31. For example, in Rotorua Regional Airport Ltd v CIR (2010) 24 NZTC 23,979 the High Court held that a development levy, charged under the Airport Authorities Act 1966, was consideration for a service supplied. D eparting passengers used the airport to gain access to their plane and the payment of the levy enabled them to access the plane at the Rotorua Airport. Mallon J applied Turakina but distinguished NZ Refining and Chatham Islands (which both found no reciprocity) to find a nexus (or reciprocity) existed between the payment and the service. She held that the levy was consideration “in respect of” or “in response to” the supply of services. 32. Accordingly, in the Commissioner’s view any levies or other amounts paid by the QB 19/11: 18 June 2019 7 UNCLASSIFIED members of an unincorporated body for supplies of administrative or management services are consideration, so the third requirement for a taxable activity is met. 33. It is noted that a legislative change was made to the GST Act following Taupo Ika Nui to clarify for unit title body corporates that a levy or other amount paid to a unit title body corporate by a member of the body corporate is to be treated as being consideration received for services supplied by the body corporate to the member (see s 5(8A) of the GST Act). As noted earlier, unit title bodies corporate are not included in this QWBA but s 5(8A) could arguably be seen as clarifying for other bodies that members’ levies can be consideration for supplies. When must an unincorporated body register for GST? 34. An unincorporated body’s liability to be registered for GST depends on it carrying on a taxable activity and also the value of supplies it makes, or expects to make, in the course of that activity in a 12-month period (s 51 of the GST Act). The unincorporated body must register for GST, when the value of supplies the unincorporated body makes, or expects to make, in a 12-month period: • was $60,000 or more in the last 12 months; or • will be $60,000 or more in the next 12 months. 35. When calculating the value of supplies it makes, or expects to make, an unincorporated body that is carrying on a taxable activity must include the value of any supplies it makes to its members. (Unit title bodies corporate are treated differently for GST purposes. They are not required to account for the value of supplies made to their members (see s 51(1B) of the GST Act)). 36. Generally, the value of a supply is equal to the consideration for the supply or, where the consideration is not in money, the open market value of the consideration (see s 10(1) of the GST Act). 37. Where the value of an unincorporated body’s supplies is under $60,000 it can voluntarily register for GST (see s 51(3) of the GST Act) but it must account for GST on all its supplies of goods and services. 38. The following examples are included to assist in explaining what an unincorporated body is and when an unincorporated body must register for GST. QB 19/11: 18 June 2019 8 UNCLASSIFIED Examples Example 1 – Residents’ committee of a housing community The residents of the four freestanding town houses at 10 Harbour Close establish a residents’ committee to help them manage the upkeep of their properties and the tree-lined shared driveway, and to provide a forum for addressing any concerns of residents. The committee is not a body corporate under the Unit Titles Act 2010. Each town house has its own fee simple title, subject to some covenants regarding use and maintenance. For instance, under a covenant the residents must paint their town houses every four years using an agreed colour scheme. The residents’ committee is responsible for ensuring the trees along the driveway are trimmed, the grass by the roadside and under the driveway trees is cut, the electronic security gate is maintained, pot holes in the driveway are repaired, and the drive is re-sealed every 10 years. The residents draw up some rules for the residents’ committee, which provide that the committee comprises one representative from each of the four town houses, and sets out what happens when an owner sells their town house and a new owner joins. Meetings are to be held by the committee on a six-monthly basis. The rules also establish how decisions can be made by the committee and what will happen if there is not unanimous agreement between the committee members. The rules also set out that a separate bank account is to be opened in the residents’ committee’s name and that any quotes for work must be obtained in the committee’s name. The rules specify that the residents of each town house are to make an annual contribution to the residents’ committee of $2,000. These funds are used to meet the residents’ committee’s ongoing costs. Any surplus funds are retained in the committee’s bank account for future expenditure. The residents’ committee is an unincorporated body of persons. While the residents’ committee is not seeking to make a profit, it still carries on a regular and continuous activity involving the making of supplies to another person for consideration. In return for the monthly levies paid by the residents, the committee makes supplies of property management services. Accordingly, the residents’ committee is carrying on a taxable activity. The value of the supplies made by the residents’ committee will not exceed the GST registration threshold, so the committee is not required to register for GST. However, the committee may choose to register for GST and in that case would be required to charge GST on the annual contributions requested from residents but the committee can also claim GST input tax deductions for supplies made to them. Example 2 – Co-owners of cross-leased land Brian, Hemi and Penelope each live in a house on a piece of land in Auckland. A shared driveway on the land leads to the houses, a small turning bay for cars, and a communal garden area. The land, including the driveway, is subject to a cross-lease. Brian, Hemi and Penelope own the land as tenants in common in equal shares. Each leases their house and a small area for a private courtyard from the others. The term of the lease is 999 years. QB 19/11: 18 June 2019 9 UNCLASSIFIED The cross-lease arrangements were established some time ago when the houses were developed. The leases contain a number of covenants. They set out that the costs of maintaining the common areas are to be shared between the three lessees, unless any damage or wear is attributable to the use of one of the lessees. They also set out how the three neighbours can use the common areas – for instance, they restrict the lessees from parking their cars in the turning bay. Although Brian, Hemi and Penelope have all used the common areas reasonably, the driveway has not been resealed in some years and is in desperate need of repair. Brian, Hemi and Penelope agree Hemi will approach three contractors for quotes for the repair and resealing. The best quote is for $20,000 which the three neighbours agree is reasonable. Brian and Penelope pay their one-third share of the $20,000 to Hemi, who pays the contractor. Brian, Hemi and Penelope all have busy jobs and in the past the shared garden area had become overgrown. The three neighbours decide that the simplest option is to hire a gardener to tend to the garden once a month. The gardener charges $150 per month for the work. Hemi and Brian set up an automatic payment into Penelope’s bank account for $50 each per month. This covers the regular cost of the gardener. Although there are rights and obligations between Brian, Hemi and Penelope arising from the lease covenants and general land law, these obligations do not establish a body with rules relating to its governance or funding. The covenants in the lease agreements are not sufficient to establish an unincorporated body of persons. Accordingly, there is no “person” for GST purposes so collectively Brian, Hemi and Penelope do not need to nor can register for GST as co-owners of the land. Example 3 – Clinic supplying administrative services to its members Four independent medical practitioners share an old converted villa. They each have a separate lease with the landlord giving them the right to occupy one particular room in the villa and use the villa’s shared spaces (a reception/waiting room area, a bathroom and an office). The four resident practitioners enter into a shared service provider arrangement. The arrangement is governed by a simple agreement signed by each practitioner. Under the arrangement, the practitioners agree to establish the Fit and Well Clinic to manage the day-to-day administration of their practices. The agreement sets out the rules of the arrangement, including: • how the clinic will be governed; • how decisions are to be made; • how its funds may be used; and • what happens when a practitioner joins or leaves the villa. The clinic leases a photocopier, provides shared supplies, arranges cleaning and furnishing of the waiting room and employs an administrator/receptionist to greet patients, answer phone calls and take messages. The administrator/receptionist also organises the day-to-day operation of the clinic. Each month the practitioners pay a levy of $1,500 into the clinic’s bank account to cover the clinic’s costs. Any amounts left over at the end of each month are retained in the clinic’s account to cover the clinic’s future unplanned costs. QB 19/11: 18 June 2019 10 UNCLASSIFIED The clinic is an unincorporated body. While the clinic is not seeking to make a profit, it still carries on a continuous activity involving the making of supplies of administrative services i n return for the monthly levies paid by the practitioners. Accordingly, the clinic is carrying on a taxable activity. The value of the supplies made to the practitioners by the clinic exceeds the GST registration threshold and so the clinic must register for GST.

\[UNCLASSIFIED\] QUESTIONS WE’VE BEEN ASKED Elections not to depreciate commercial buildings Issued: 16 December 2021 Publication number QB 21/11 This question we’ve been asked sets out the position for taxpayers making an election to not depreciate their commercial building since the depreciation rate of 0% was removed from commercial buildings with effect from the 2021 income year. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act) unless otherwise specified. Key provisions Income Tax Act 2007 – s EE 8 Question The depreciation rate for buildings with a useful life of at least 50 years was reduced to 0% from 1 April 2011, the start of the 2012 tax year. With effect from the 2021 income year, the ability of taxpayers to claim a depreciation loss on the commercial buildings they own was reinstated, at a rate of 2% (using the diminishing value (DV) method) or 1.5% (using the straight-line (SL) method). Given this change, what are the consequences for taxpayers who elected, before the 2012 income year, to treat their commercial building as not being depreciable property and so not claim the relevant depreciation loss? Page 1 of 8 UNCLASSIFIED QB 21/11 | 16 Dec 2021 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Answer Where a taxpayer makes an election to treat their commercial building as not being depreciable property, that election is irrevocable, and the taxpayer is bound by that election until the building is disposed of. For the election to be effective, the taxpayer must make it “in writing”. A taxpayer who does not make an election and who claims a depreciation loss for their commercial building must continue to depreciate that building at the rate the Commissioner has set. A taxpayer who does not make a written election and has never claimed a deduction for a depreciation loss on their commercial building may make a retrospective election not to depreciate that building. The retrospective election will apply from the date the taxpayer acquired the building. Key terms Commercial building means (for the purpose of this item) a building that is not a “residential building”. Election means notice given to the Commissioner in a taxpayer’s return of income. 1 Residential building means a dwelling. It includes a building intended to ordinarily provide accommodation for periods of fewer than 28 days at a time, if the building, together with other buildings on the same land, has fewer than four units for separate accommodation. 2 1 s EE 8(4) of the Act. 2 s YA 1 of the Act. Page 2 of 8 UNCLASSIFIED QB 21/11 | 16 Dec 2021 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Explanation Background The depreciation regime 1. Taxpayers are allowed a deduction for a depreciation loss on items of depreciable property 3 that a business uses to gain assessable income. 4 2. It is mandatory for a taxpayer to claim a deduction for a depreciation loss where one is allowed. The deduction is calculated by using the most appropriate rate of depreciation for that asset as set out in the Commissioner’s table of depreciation rates 5 and applying it to the cost of the asset. 6 3. When they dispose of the asset, the taxpayer is generally considered to have claimed the applicable depreciation loss, even in circumstances where they have chosen not to claim the loss. For the purposes of calculating the depreciation recovery income or loss on sale, taxpayers are considered to have claimed the allowable depreciation loss. The quantum of income or loss on disposal is calculated accordingly. 4. A taxpayer may have valid commercial reasons for not wishing to claim a deduction for a depreciation loss. It was with this in mind that, in 1997, Parliament introduced s EE 8 of the Act 7 to allow taxpayers to elect to treat certain assets as not being depreciable property. The effect of making such an election is that a taxpayer cannot claim a deduction for the depreciation loss on the elected asset(s) that they otherwise would have been entitled to. 5. An election to treat an asset as not being an item of depreciable property must be made in the year that the taxpayer acquired the asset, or the year in which the use of that asset in the taxpayer’s business changed. A change in use can occur when, for instance, a private asset is introduced into a business and is able to be depreciated. Once made, an election is irrevocable. 3 Depreciable property is defined in s EE 6 of the Act. 4 ss DA 1, DA 4, and EE 1(2) of the Act. 5 See Inland Revenue’s booklet General depreciation rates IR 265 (July 2021), available at ird.govt.nz 6 s EE 16(3) of the Act. 7 Previously s EG 16A of the Income Tax Act 1994. Page 3 of 8 UNCLASSIFIED QB 21/11 | 16 Dec 2021 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 6. After making an election, a taxpayer is unable to “pick and choose” which years they claim a deduction for a depreciation loss on those assets. An election can only be made:  prospectively at the time that the taxpayer acquires the asset, or its use changes, or  retrospectively, but only if the taxpayer has not claimed a deduction for a depreciation loss in any year since they acquired the asset (or its use changed). 7. Once a taxpayer has claimed a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss on their asset or made an election to treat that asset as not being depreciable property, they are bound to follow that treatment until they dispose of the asset. The taxpayer therefore chooses “once and for all” whether to claim a deduction for a depreciation loss on that asset. 8. A taxpayer can only make an election to treat an asset as not being depreciable property by giving “notice” to the Commissioner of their intention to do so in their return of income. The Commissioner must be “notified”. 9. Given the election requirements stated at \[6\], a taxpayer needs to provide the Commissioner with the following information:  Where the taxpayer is making a prospective election, the notice needs to advise the Commissioner of the asset(s) they are making the election for and of that asset’s acquisition date (or the date that its use in the business changed and how it changed).  Where the taxpayer is making a retrospective election, the notice will need to advise the Commissioner of the asset(s) they are making the election for, and the asset’s acquisition date or the date that its use changed. The notice must also include a statement that the taxpayer has not made a claim for a depreciation loss for the asset(s) since that date. A taxpayer can make a retrospective election in any income year after the year they acquired the asset, including the year that they dispose of the asset and the years following its disposal. 10. Although the taxpayer must make the election in their return of income, the election also needs to provide notice to the Commissioner of the election. Given that a taxpayer’s return does not provide the Commissioner with any of the required information, the Commissioner does not expect taxpayers to literally attempt to provide notice “in” their return of income. It is the Commissioner’s view that an election under s EE 8 must be in writing; it may take the form of a letter, email or Page 4 of 8 UNCLASSIFIED QB 21/11 | 16 Dec 2021 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] webmail and be either attached to the return or provided separately to the Commissioner at or close to the time when the taxpayer provides the return. 11. Simply choosing not to depreciate an asset in a taxpayer’s tax accounts does not notify or provide notice to the Commissioner that the taxpayer wishes to elect to treat that asset as not being an item of depreciable property. This is because tax accounts are not supplied to the Commissioner with a taxpayer’s return of income. In addition, per \[2\], unless taxpayers make an election, they must claim an amount of depreciation loss where one is allowed and (per \[3\]) incorrectly not claiming an amount of depreciation loss will have consequences when the taxpayer disposes of the asset. The depreciation of commercial buildings3 12. Before the 2012 income year, it was possible to depreciate buildings with an estimated useful life of at least 50 years for tax purposes. This included commercial buildings. However, the budget of 20 May 2010 introduced several changes to the depreciation regime, including replacing the then applicable rates of depreciation for most buildings with a rate of 0%. 13. This change was included in the Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010 8 and was effective from the beginning of a taxpayer’s 2011–2012 income year. It is important to note that the Act did not remove the ability for taxpayers to claim a depreciation loss. What changed was the rate at which the amount of any depreciation loss was calculated. 14. Commercial buildings remained depreciable at the rate of 0% until the beginning of the 2020–2021 income year. 9 The COVID-19 Response (T axation and Social Assistance Urgent Measures) Act 2020 amended the rate at which commercial building owners were able to claim a depreciation loss. It provided for a depreciation rate for these buildings of 2% DV or 1.5% SL . 10 The effect of making (or not making) an election to treat a commercial building as not being depreciable property 15. Before the depreciation rate for commercial buildings was reduced to 0%, most taxpayers claimed the depreciation loss on their commercial buildings. However, some 8 See Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 7 (August 2010) for more information. 9 For more information on the application date for this change, see QB 21/05: The application date for the depreciation of commercial buildings. 10 See Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32, No 5 (June 2020) for more information. Page 5 of 8 UNCLASSIFIED QB 21/11 | 16 Dec 2021 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] taxpayers made a written election to treat their building as not being depreciable property and so did not claim a deduction for a depreciation loss on that commercial building. 16. Other taxpayers, while deciding not to depreciate their commercial building, did not give adequate notice to the Commissioner of their election (which they needed to do by notifying the Commissioner in writing, per \[5\] – \[1 1\]). Instead, they did not claim a deduction for the depreciation loss on their commercial building in their tax accounts in the mistaken belief that this was all that was required to make an “election”. 17. The following sections summarise the effect of these previous decisions to depreciate (or not depreciate) commercial buildings now that taxpayers can depreciate their commercial buildings at a rate other than 0%. Taxpayers who have previously claimed a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss on their commercial buildings 5 18. Unless a taxpayer first elects to treat an asset as not being depreciable property, they must claim a deduction for an allowable depreciation loss (per \[2\]). Once a taxpayer has made a claim for an amount of depreciation loss for that commercial building in any income year, they are no longer able to elect to treat that asset as not being depreciable property until a “disposal event” occurs (per \[20\]). As stated, (at \[6\]), a taxpayer can only make a retrospective election where they have never made a claim for a depreciation loss on that asset. 19. A taxpayer in those circumstances must therefore continue to claim a deduction for the depreciation loss on their commercial building in each income year. If a taxpayer does not claim a deduction for the depreciation loss on their commercial building in an income year, they will be considered to have made a claim for the applicable amount of depreciation loss (per \[2\] and \[3\]). Taxpayers who have previously made a written election to treat their commercial building as not being an item of depreciable property 20. When a taxpayer makes an election to treat their commercial building as not being an item of depreciable property, that election is irrevocable. It has effect for the income year in which the taxpayer acquired the building (irrespective of when the election is made) and in all future income years until a disposal event occurs. A disposal event is an event where: Page 6 of 8 UNCLASSIFIED QB 21/11 | 16 Dec 2021 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  the commercial building is disposed of, 11 or  the use of the building changes and, as a result, the taxpayer is denied a deduction for a depreciation loss on the building, 12 or  the nature of the taxpayer’s activities changes to one of gaining exempt income, or  the building suffers irreparable damage or damage that makes it useless, or  the building is subject to acquisition by a person acting under statutory authority. 21. Until a disposal event occurs, a taxpayer who has previously made an election to treat their commercial building as not being an item of depreciable property cannot claim a depreciation loss on that building. This condition applies despite the possibility that the rate of depreciation may change for the elected asset (which, for commercial buildings it has; to 0% from the 2012 tax year, and then to 2% DV or 1.5% SL from the 2021 tax year). Taxpayers who have not previously claimed a depreciation loss on their commercial building, but have not made a written election to treat their commercial building as not being an item of depreciable property 22. This circumstance may arise because the taxpayer acquired their commercial building:  before 1 April 2011 and mistakenly believed that they could make an election by simply not claiming a deduction in their tax accounts for the depreciation loss that was allowed on their building, or  before 1 April 2011 and was unaware that claiming an amount of depreciation loss that is allowable is mandatory, or  between 1 April 2011 and 31 March 2020, at a time when the depreciation rate was 0%. Because the rate of depreciation was 0%, it is highly unlikely that a taxpayer in this circumstance would have made an election to treat that building as not being an item of depreciable property. Taxpayers acquiring a commercial building prior to 1 April 2011 23. If either of the first two bullet points above applies, the effect is that the taxpayer has failed to claim a mandatory deduction. 11 s EE 8(5) of the Act. 12 s EE 47 of the Act. Page 7 of 8 UNCLASSIFIED QB 21/11 | 16 Dec 2021 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 24. Given this, the taxpayer in either of these categories has two options. Either:  (if they wish to claim the allowable depreciation loss) the taxpayer starts to claim the relevant depreciation loss on their commercial building and request that the Commissioner reassess the relevant back year returns to claim the appropriate amount of depreciation loss in those years 13 (as far as they are able before the time-bar rules contained in s RM 2 of the Act take effect), or  (if they do not wish to claim the allowable depreciation loss) as the taxpayer has not claimed a deduction for any amount of depreciation loss for the commercial building, they can now provide the Commissioner with a written election to retrospectively treat the commercial building as not being an item of depreciable property. 14 Taxpayers acquiring a commercial building between 1 April 2011 and 31 March 2020 25. In the final circumstance set out at \[22\], where a taxpayer has acquired their commercial building during the time that the depreciation rate for their building was 0% (between 1 April 2011 and 31 March 2020), they have not failed to claim a depreciation loss (as none was available). The reassessment of prior returns of income is therefore not required. If the taxpayer wishes to claim the allowable depreciation loss on their commercial building they can simply commence to do so. 26. Because the taxpayer has not claimed a deduction for any amount of depreciation loss for the commercial building, if they do not wish to claim the amount of allowable depreciation loss on their commercial building, they can provide the Commissioner with a written election to retrospectively treat the commercial building as not being an item of depreciable property. Effect of retrospective elections 27. Retrospective elections are effective for all years from the year that the taxpayer acquired the commercial building. Making a retrospective election therefore rectifies the errors made in the taxpayer’s past returns of income. 28. As stated at \[9\], a taxpayer can make a retrospective election in any income year after the year they acquired the asset. This includes the year that they disposed of the asset and the years following its disposal. 13 Such a request can be made in terms of s 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. See also standard practice statement SPS 20/03: Requests to amend assessments . 14 s EE 8(3) of the Act.

However, taxpayers can generally rely on them in determining their tax affairs. See further Status of Commissioner’s advice (December 2012).

\[UNCLASSIFIED\] QUESTIONS WE’VE BEEN ASKED GST – Does zero-rating apply to certain services that airport operators supply to international airline operators? Issued: 16 June 2022 QB 22/05 This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) discusses the GST treatment of garbage disposal, lighting and security, aircraft parking and terminal services that airport operators supply to international airline operators. Key provisions Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) – s 11A(1)(a) Page 1 of 9 QB 22/05 | 16 June 2022 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Question Does zero-rating apply to garbage disposal, lighting and security, aircraft parking and terminal services that airport operators supply to international airline operators? Answer No. The services are standard-rated, not zero-rated. Explanation 1. “GST on services supplied to international aircraft” Public Information Bulletin 173 (April 1988): 11 (the PIB) states that the following services (the relevant services) supplied by local authorities (who own and operate airports) to international aircraft are standard-rated:  garbage disposal;  lighting and security;  aircraft parking; and  terminal fees (for terminal services). 2. The PIB considered that the relevant services were standard-rated because they were not zero-rated under the earlier versions of s 11A(1)(a), (h) and (i). 3. This QWBA reviews the PIB’s conclusion in light of court cases and changes to the GST Act that have occurred since the publication of the PIB. Most international airports in New Zealand are now owned and operated by private companies with local council shareholdings. When services can be zero-rated under s 11A(1)(a) 4. A transaction is zero-rated under s 11A(1)(a) where:  there is a supply of services;  the supply of services is chargeable with tax under s 8; and  the services, not being ancillary transport activities such as loading, unloading and handling, are the transport of passengers or goods: o from a place outside New Zealand to another place outside New Zealand; Page 2 of 9 QB 22/05 | 16 June 2022 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] o from a place in New Zealand to a place outside New Zealand; or o from a place outside New Zealand to a place in New Zealand. There is a supply of services 5. GST is a transaction-based tax, and the focus is on the supply by a supplier to a recipient in the particular case. 1 The test for determining whether a supply of services is chargeable with GST is what the nature of the supply is. 2 6. Applying that test requires identifying what the relevant supply is and who the supplier is. 3 To do that, it is necessary to examine the contract between the parties. 4 It is important to determine the legal obligations of the parties and what they have agreed on. 5 7. The Act therefore is contractually based and is concerned with determining the legal arrangements between the parties. The particular transaction in question must be carefully considered in order to determine the legal character of that transaction. 8. Here, the contractual agreement for the supply of the relevant services is between the airport operators and the international airline operators. In exchange for payment from the international airline operators for the relevant services, the airport operators agree to provide the relevant services. 9. The provision of flights is a different contractual arrangement between the international airline operators and their customers (passengers or owners of transported cargo). Under this separate arrangement, international airline operators contract to fly passengers or goods for which their customers pay consideration by way of a fee. Although international airline operators can pass all or some of the costs for the services from airport operators on to their customers, this does not affect the fact that there is a separate contract. The supply of services is chargeable with tax under s 8 10. A registered person charges GST of 15% on the supply of goods and services in New Zealand in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by them, by 1 Databank Systems Ltd v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,093 (CA) at 6,103–6,105. 2 Databank (CA) at 6,093. 3 CIR v Databank Systems Ltd (1990) 12 NZTC 7,227 (PC) at 7,321-7,235. 4 Wilson & Horton Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325 (CA) at 328. 5 British Railways Board v Customs and Excise Commissioners \[1977\] STC 221 (AC); CIR v Bayly (1998) 18 NZTC 14,073 (CA); Television New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,295 (HC). Page 3 of 9 QB 22/05 | 16 June 2022 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] reference to the value of that supply, unless the supply is an exempt supply (s 8). However, they charge GST at the rate of 0% if zero-rating provisions apply. 11. The relevant supply is from the airport operators to international airline operators and both parties are GST registered. Airport operators provide the relevant services in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity, which includes the provision of such services. 12. The supply of the relevant services is not an exempt supply under the GST Act. Therefore, the supply of the relevant services is chargeable with tax under s 8. Whether GST is charged at 15% (standard-rated) or at 0% (zero-rated) depends on whether the last requirement of s 11A(1)(a) is satisfied. The services are the transport of passengers or goods and not ancillary transport activities 13. The relevant services zero-rated under s 11A(1)(a) are the transport of passengers or goods from one place to another, where at least one place is outside New Zealand. This means that only the transport of passengers or goods is zero-rated, not other services. 14. The relevant services will not be zero-rated if they are ancillary transport activities. Ancillary transport activities, such as loading, unloading and handling, are standard- rated. The PIB concluded that the relevant services were standard-rated because they were “ancillary transport activities”. 15. Section 11A(1)(a) has undergone changes since the GST Act was enacted in 1985. At first, services had to be “directly in connection with transportation ... of passengers or goods” to be zero-rated. In 1988, the wording was intentionally narrowed to require the zero-rated services to “comprise the transport of passengers or goods”. From 2000, the wording in s 11A(1)(a) is that the services “are the transport of passengers or goods”. 16. The Commissioner considers that the change from “comprise the transport” to “are the transport” does not change the meaning of the provision. The words “comprise” and “are” are essentially synonyms. 6 6 Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011) defines “comprise” to include “consist of, be made up of; contain”, and “are” to include “(when connecting a subject and complement) having a specified state, nature, or role”. Page 4 of 9 QB 22/05 | 16 June 2022 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Transport 17. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary relevantly defines the term “transport” as “a system or means of transporting”. 18. In addition to Case P78 and Auckland Regional Authority considered below, court decisions have looked at what constitutes the transport of passengers or goods. 7 They have concluded that the essence of transport is the carriage of a passenger or goods from one point to another. 8 The word “transport” has a wider meaning than a seat on an airliner and can include in-flight catering. 9 Ancillary 19. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines “ancillary”, which appears in the phrase “ancillary transport activity”, as “providing support to the primary activities of an organisation”, “additional but less important” and “subsidiary”. 20. A number of court cases have considered the meaning of the word “ancillary”. They show that the meaning can be broad and the answer to the question of whether one activity is ancillary to another depends on the context. 10 21. In Smith’s Snackfood Company, the court concluded the meaning of “ancillary” is “auxiliary”, “accessory”, “subordinate” or “providing central support to the functioning of a central service”. These interpretations are consistent with:  dictionary definitions of “ancillary”;  Green v Britten (“subsidiary, subordinate or appurtenant to”); 11 and  Minagall v Ingram 12 (where a relationship was required between the principal matter and an ancillary matter). 22. However, in some cases an ancillary activity may not be subservient to another (Smith’s Snackfood Company). 7 Case P78 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,523; Auckland Regional Authority v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,080 (HC). 8 Commissioners of Customs and Excise v Blackpool Pleasure Beach Co \[1974\] 1 All ER 1011 (QB); Quarry Tours Ltd v The Commissioners \[1984\] 12 VATTR 238. 9 British Airways v Customs & Excise Commissioners \[1990\] BTC 5,124 (AC).

Page 5 of 9 QB 22/05 | 16 June 2022 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Ca se P78 23. The court in Case P78 considered the earlier versions of s 11A(1)(a). Judge Barber held that landing, aircraft parking, meteorological, control tower and safety services that an airport operator supplied to international airline operators were “directly in connection with transportation” and, therefore, zero-rated. This was because they were an integral part of transportation. 13 24. Judge Barber considered that the services under consideration were not “ancillary transport activities” because they were not in a similar category to loading, unloading and handling. He considered that “ancillary” in this case meant subservient or subordinate to the provision of transport. 14 25. Judge Barber also held that the services under consideration “comprise the transport” of passengers or goods and were not ancillary transport activities. This was because without the facility to land and take off, the air service could not occur. He said in passing that terminal services would have “comprised” transportation too. 15 26. Judge Barber did note that the phrase “comprise the transport” is narrower than “directly in connection with transportation”. However, the Commissioner considers that Judge Barber essentially applied the broader “directly in connection with” analysis in coming to the conclusion that the services under consideration “comprise” the transport of passengers or goods. 16 27. Judge Barber concluded that rubbish disposal did not “comprise” transportation because it was not part of the carrying process and transportation activity. 17 Auckland Regional Authority 28. In the High Court decision in Auckland Regional Authority, Barker J said that the phrase “comprise the transport” in an earlier version of s 11A(1)(a) seems to confer zero-rating only on services that “actually comprise” the transport of passengers or goods. Barker J did not need to decide the point because he was considering the earlier phrase “directly in connection with transportation” on similar facts to Case P78. 18 13 Case P78 at 4,531–4,532. 14 Case P78 at 4,532. 15 Case P78 at 4,532. 16 Case P78 at 4,532. 17 Case P78 at 4,533. 18 Auckland Regional Authority at 11,083. Page 6 of 9 QB 22/05 | 16 June 2022 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 29. However, Barker J’s comment may have been referring to the acknowledgement in Case P78 that the carriers or airlines provide “the actual transport of goods and passengers”. 19 His comment is also consistent with the conclusion in Case P78 that rubbish disposal is not part of the carrying process. 30. Barker J considered the meaning of “ancillary transport activity”. Contrary to Case P78, he concluded that international terminal services 20 were ancillary because they were “secondary or subservient” and were “of the same kind of transport activity as loading, unloading and handling”. 21 31. However, Barker J agreed with Case P78 that landing and departing were not ancillary transport activities (although this was in the context of considering the “directly in co nnection with transportation” phrase). He also agreed that rubbish disposal was provided as a separate service but considered that it was, alternatively, an “ancillary transport activity”. Conclusion on s 11A(1)(a) 32. The Commissioner considers that none of the relevant services considered in this QWBA (garbage disposal, lighting and security, aircraft parking and terminal services) is the transport of passengers or goods for the purposes of s 11A(1)(a). This is because the relevant services do not involve the carriage of a passenger or goods from one point to another. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that the relevant services are not zero-rated under s 11A(1)(a). 33. The PIB concluded that the relevant services were standard-rated but for a different reason. The PIB considered the relevant services to be “ancillary transport activities”. It is not strictly necessary to reach a conclusion on this point because it is already concluded here that the relevant services are standard-rated. However, t he Commissioner considers that the relevant services are, alternatively, ancillary transport activities that are not zero-rated under s 11A(1)(a). This is because the relevant services relate to the provision of essential support to a central service. The relevant services support the supply of transport by international airline operators. 19 Case P78 at 4,532. 20 The terminal services included the use of air bridges, maintenance and cleaning of carousels, gate lounges, storage and distribution areas, and removal of sewage tanks. 21 Auckland Regional Authority at 11,085. Page 7 of 9 QB 22/05 | 16 June 2022 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] When services can be zero-rated under s 11A(1)(h) and(i) 34. Services are zero-rated under other paragraphs of s 11A(1). These include services that are supplied directly in connection with:  goods in transit through New Zealand, including stores for aircrafts, provided the goods are not removed from the aircraft while in New Zealand (s 11A(1)(h)); and  temporarily imported goods (s 11A(1)(i)). 35. The Commissioner considers that the relevant services are not “directly in connection” with goods in transit or temporarily imported. The relevant services are services that airport operators provide to international airline operators. These are not services supplied directly in connection with the goods themselves such as loading, unloading and handling. 22 Therefore, there is no clear and direct relationship between the relevant services and the goods. 36. Further, although a private aircraft can be a temporarily imported good, the Commissioner considers that temporary imports do not include commercial aircraft with goods and passengers that arrive in and depart from New Zealand. 37. The Commissioner therefore considers that s 11A(1)(h) and (i) also does not apply to zero-rate the relevant services. On this basis, the relevant services are subject to GST at the standard-rate of 15%. 22 Wilson & Horton Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,221 (HC) at 11,224.

However, taxpayers can generally rely on them in determining their tax affairs. See further Status of Commissioner’s advice (December 2012).

UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] FACT SHEET GST and Income Tax – Payments made by parents to private schools Issued: 27 October 2022 QB 22/08 and QB 22/09 FS This fact sheet accompanies QB 22/08 Income Tax – Payments made by parents to private schools and donation tax credits and QB 22/09 Goods and Services Tax – Payments made by parents to private schools, which consider the tax treatment of payments parents make to private schools. Key terms Donee organisation is a private school that is a registered charity or otherwise on Inland Revenue’s list of approved donee organisations. Parent includes a child’s guardian or caregiver who makes payments to a private school. Private school means a school registered under s 214 of the Education and Training Act 2020. Introduction 1. Most payments parents make to their children’s private schools are subject to GST. This is because the payments are fees and are paid in return for the supply of education and education-related goods and services by the school. 2. Usually private schools will charge GST at the standard rate of 15% on the supplies they make to parents. But some boarding fees private schools charge might be subject to a lower rate of GST where they include a charge for the supply of domestic goods and services. QB 22/08 and QB 22/09 FS | 27 October 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 3. In addition to paying fees, parents might choose to donate money to their child’s private school. Where the school is a donee organisation, the parent may be entitled to claim a donation tax credit for these donations and the payments may be exempt from GST. 4. In the past, some parents have made payments incorrectly called “donations” to private schools in substitution for paying no or low school fees. Such payments are not donations for tax purposes. There are no donation tax credits for any payments parents pay to private schools incorrectly described as “donations”, and such payments are subject to GST. Whether the payment is a fee or donation 5. Where the private school is a donee organisation, special rules apply to determine if payments made by parents to private schools are:  fees and subject to GST; or  donations, so exempt from GST, and the parent may be entitled to claim a donation tax credit. 6. The special rules are summarised in Flowchart 1. Flowchart 1: Applying the special rules to determine if payments are subject to or exempt from GST QB 22/08 and QB 22/09 FS | 27 October 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] GST on boarding fees 7. Special rules apply for calculating the GST on school boarding fees. Where students have arranged to board at the school for more than four weeks, the school charges GST at a lower rate to the extent the boarding fee is for the supply of domestic goods and services. This covers the amount charged for the child’s right to occupy the boarding house (including ancillary supplies such as power, cleaning and other chattels related to that right to occupy the premises). Supplies of other non-domestic goods and services (such as meals, pastoral care and personal laundry services) are always subject to GST at the standard rate of 15%. 8. The lower rate of GST for boarders staying more than four weeks applies from different dates, depending on whether the boarding house is used predominantly (that is, more than 70%) for stays exceeding four weeks. If it is, then the lower rate of GST applies from the first day of a boarder’s stay. If not, then the lower rate of GST does not apply until a boarder’s stay exceeds four weeks. 9.

QUESTIONS WE’VE BEEN ASKED | PĀTAI KUA UIA MAI Income tax: scenarios on tax avoidance – 2023 No 2 Issued | Tukuna: 3 February 2023 QB 23/02 This Question we’ve been asked (QWBA) is one of two QWBAs that updates tax avoidance scenarios from earlier QWBAs that have become outdated. The earlier QWBAs were based on the Commissioner’s statement on tax avoidance published in 2013 (IS 13/01). IS 13/01 has been replaced by IS 23/01: “ Tax avoidance and the interpretation of the general anti-avoidance provisions s ections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007”. Ke y provisions | Whakaratonga tāpua Income Tax Act 2007 – ss BG 1 , GA 1 REPLACES | WHAKAKAPIA: QB 15/11 scenarios 1 and 3 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 24 QB 23/02 | 3 February 2023 Background | Horopaki 1.This Question we’ve been asked (QWBA) is one of two QWBAs that replaces some of the scenarios on tax avoidance that appeared in the following QWBAs that ar e w ithdrawn from the date of this QWBA: Q B 14/11: Income tax – scenarios on tax avoidance QB 15/01: Income tax – tax avoidance and debt capitalisation QB 15/11: Income tax – scenarios on tax avoidance – 2015. 1 2.The withdrawn QWBAs were based on the Commissioner’s statement on tax avoidance IS 13 /01. 2 IS 13/01 has been replaced by IS 23/01 “ Tax avoidance and the i nterpretation of the general anti-avoidance provisions sections BG 1 and GA 1 of t he I ncome Tax Act 2007”. This QWBA updates some of the earlier scenarios to reflect t he new statement. The answers as to whether or not s BG 1 applies in each of the scenarios have not changed. Due to subsequent legislative changes, some of t he scenarios in the withdrawn QWBAs have not been updated. 3 3.Section BG 1 is the principal vehicle to address tax avoidance in the Income Tax Act 2007. The Supreme Court in Ben Nevis considered it desirable to settle the approac h t o the relationship between s BG 1 and the specific provisions in the rest of the Act with the Parliamentary contemplation test. 4 The Supreme Court confirmed the P arliamentary contemplation test as the proper and authoritative approach to applying s BG 1 in Penny and Frucor. 5 4.The test involves ensuring Parliament’s purpose for the specific provision and its purpose for s BG 1, as the principal vehicle in the Act to address tax avoidance, ar e a chieved. This occurs by the specific provision and s BG 1 working in tandem wit h ea ch providing the context that defines the meaning and scope of the other. Hence, the Parliamentary contemplation test requires consideration of Parliament’s purpos e for the specific provision and its purpose for s BG 1. Parliament’s overall purpose c omprises both of these purposes. 1 Published in: Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 11 (December 2014): 3 (QB 14/11), Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 3 (April 2015): 25 (QB 15/01) and Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 10 (November 2015): 27 (QB 15/11). 2 IS 13/01: Tax avoidance and the interpretation of ss BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25, No 7 (August 2013): 4. 3 This QWBA comprises scenarios 1 and 3 from QB 15/11. Scenario 2 has been updated separately in QB 23/01 “Income tax: scenarios on tax avoidance – 2023 No 1”. 4 Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289 at \[100\]. 5 Penny v CIR \[2011\] NZSC 95, \[2012\] 1 NZLR 433 (also known as Penny & Hooper) at \[33\] and Frucor Suntory New Zealand Ltd v CIR \[2022\] NZSC 113 at \[53\]. UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 24 QB 23/02 | 3 February 2023 5.The Commissioner’s view as to whether s BG 1 applies in these scenarios must be und erstood in the following terms: The arrangements are framed broadly. The conclusions reached are limited to the arrangements as set out. Additional relevant facts or variations to the stated facts might materially affec t ho w the arrangements operate and different outcomes under s BG 1 could arise. Because the objective is to consider the application of s BG 1, the analysis proceeds on the basis that the tax effects under the applicable specific provisions of the Act are achieved as stated. The implications of any relevant specific anti-avoidance provisions are not considered. 6.Applying s BG 1 requires answering the “ultimate question” under the Parliamentary contemplation test: d oes the arrangement, when viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, make use of or circumvent the specific provisions in a manner consistent with Parliament’s purpose? 6 7.If the arrangement uses or circumvents a specific provision in a manner that is outside P arliament’s purpose, it has a tax avoidance purpose or effect. Where an arrangement has two or more purposes or effects and one purpose or effect is tax avoidance, s BG 1 w ill apply only if the tax avoidance purpose or effect is more than merely incidental to another purpose or effect of the arrangement. 8.The merely incidental test involves the consideration of many of the same factors that are considered under the Parliamentary contemplation test. A conclusion under t he P arliamentary contemplation test that an arrangement uses or circumvents a specific provision in a manner that is outside Parliament’s purpose (ie, it has a tax avoidanc e pur pose or effect) means it is unlikely that the arrangement’s tax avoidance purpos e w ill be merely incidental. 7 9.Where it applies, s BG 1 voids a tax avoidance arrangement. Voiding an arrangement may or may not appropriately counteract the tax advantages arising under t he a rrangement. If the voiding of the arrangement does not appropriately counteract t he ta x advantages, the Commissioner is under a duty to apply s GA 1 to ensure this outcome is achieved. 6 Ben Nevis (SC) at \[109\]. 7 Ben Nevis (SC) at \[114\].

Scenario 1 — Use of a limited partnership Question | Pātai 11.Does s BG 1 apply in the following circumstances: There are three New Zealand resident companies: oCompany A, a tax loss company; oProfit Co, a wholly-owned subsidiary company of Company A that is operating a profitable business; and oCompany B, a company that is unassociated with Company A and Profit Co; Companies A and B establish a limited partnership registered under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008 (the LP); Companies A and B make equal contributions to the capital of the partnershi p a nd agree to each receive a 50% share of partnership profits and losses; and Profit Co sells its business operations to the LP at the open market value of thos e o perations. 12.The following diagram shows the situation before and after the above events: Company A 100% Company A 100%50% Company B 50% Profit Co Limited Partnership (LP) Profit Co Business Business Before After Business sold UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 24 QB 23/02 | 3 February 2023 Answer | Whakautu 13.No. The Commissioner’s view is that, without more, s BG 1 would not apply to this arrangement. Explanation | Whakamāramatanga Introduction 14.The Commissioner’s approach to applying s BG 1 is as follows. First, understand the le gal form of the arrangement in terms of its scope, commercial or private purposes and tax effects. 15.Then, ascertain Parliament’s purpose for the specific provisions the arrangement uses or circumvents. 16.The Commissioner considers that, in some cases, a helpful practical technique may be to consider “facts, features or attributes” for a specific provision. Once Parliament’s purpose for a specific provision has been ascertained, that purpose maybe translate d in to facts, features or attributes that Parliament would contemplate being present (or absent) to give effect to that purpose. This is because a specific provision sets out a legal rule that will be activated or satisfied by the existence (or non-existence) of certain explicit and implicit facts, features or attributes. These might include legal, commercial, economic, or other concepts. 17.Next, understand the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement as a whole. Factors the courts have referred to that may be helpful to consider include: whether the taxpayer has gained the benefit of the specific provision in a n a rtificial or contrived way, or by pretence; the manner in which the arrangement is carried out; the role of all relevant parties and their relationships; the economic and commercial effect of documents and transactions; the nature and extent of the financial consequences; the duration of the arrangement; whether there is circularity in the arrangement; whether there is inflated expenditure or reduced levels of income in t he a rrangement; whether the parties to the arrangement have undertaken limited or no real commercial or economic risks; and UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 24 QB 23/02 | 3 February 2023 whether the arrangement is pre-tax negative. 18.Then consider the implications of the preceding analysis of Parliament’s purposes for t he specific provisions and the arrangement’s purposes, tax effects and commercial and economic reality as a whole. Bearing in mind s BG 1’s purpose as the principal vehicle in the Act to address tax avoidance, the analysis is likely to highlight a number of interrelated matters, including those concerning: The presence (or absence) of artificiality, contrivance or pretence. The veracity of the arrangement’s commercial or private purposes (in contrast to the clarity or otherwise of the arrangement’s tax advantages). Whether or not the use or circumvention of the relevant specific provisions is consistent with Parliament’s purposes for the specific provisions. 19.The preceding analysis of the arrangement may highlight that tax advantages have been o btained by artificiality or contrivance. Artificiality or contrivance is a significant factor because the courts have confirmed that using or circumventing specific provisions to obtain tax advantages in artificial or contrived ways is outside Parliament’s contemplation for those specific provisions. The related concept of pretence will also be highly relevant. 20.Artificiality, contrivance or pretence must be considered in the context of the a rrangement as a whole and can be described as including something that i n c ommercial and economic reality (as objectively determined): is not commercially realistic; would not happen in that particular way or would not happen at all i n c ommercial or private dealings, independent of the tax advantages; has no commercial or private purpose; has a commercial or private purpose, but that purpose has no commercial or private rationale or logic, independent of the tax advantages; or distorts the application or non-application of specific provisions. 21.The analysis of the arrangement’s commercial and economic reality may show the a rrangement’s apparent commercial or private purposes as previously analysed may not be consistent with its commercial and economic reality. The analysis may show that the arrangement may not, in reality, have any commercial or private purposes o r t hat aspects of the arrangement suggest those purposes lack a rationale or justificatio n once shorn of the tax advantages. Arrangements are likely to be outside Parliament’s purpose for the specific provision where: the arrangement has no commercial or private purpose; UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 24 QB 23/02 | 3 February 2023 a step in the arrangement has no commercial or private purpose and the step us es or circumvents the specific provision; the arrangement (or a step) has a commercial purpose, but that purpose has no commercial rationale or viability independent of the tax advantage; or the arrangement (or a step) is structured in a manner where the commercial or private purposes are dependent on a tax advantage being achieved. 22.Understanding the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement as a whole m ay indicate the arrangement uses (or circumvents) specific provisions in a manner that is not consistent with Parliament’s purposes. 23.Practically, the technique of using facts, features or attributes may be helpful in some c ases with ascertaining whether an arrangement has crossed the line into tax avoidance. This involves considering whether the facts, features or attributes previously translated from Parliament’s purpose for the specific provision are consistent with those that are present (or absent) in the arrangement when viewed as a whole and in a commercially and economically realistic way. 24.A lack of consistency under the facts, features or attributes technique may indicate that P arliament’s purpose for the specific provisions is not being met. On the other hand, consistency under the facts, features or attributes technique does not prevent t he a pplication of s BG 1. The technique can only assist in assessing whether Parliament’s overall purpose for the specific provisions and s BG 1 is being met. It is not a bright- line test nor a substitute for considering all the relevant facts and reaching a reasonable inference or conclusion. 25.Also, some types of arrangements do not lend themselves as readily as others to the use of the facts, features or attributes technique. See, for example, Penny (SC) wher e t here was “no failure to comply with any express requirement of the Act in the setting of salaries, since there is none”. 8 26.Finally, taking into account all of the matters considered above, answer the ultimate question: Does the arrangement, viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, use or circumvent, the specific provisions in a manner that is consistent wit h P arliament’s purpose? The answer must be a reasonable inference that is: open on the evidence and on the facts established from the evidence; logical and convincing; not mere speculation; and not an intuitive subjective impression. 8 At \[33\]. UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 24 QB 23/02 | 3 February 2023 27.If tax avoidance is not the sole purpose or effect of the arrangement, consideration will need to be given to whether the tax avoidance purpose or effect is merely incidental. Applying the merely incidental test involves considering: the relationship between the tax avoidance purpose or effect of the arrangement and other purposes or effects of the arrangement (non-tax avoidance purposes); and whether the tax avoidance purpose or effect follows as a natural incident of another purpose. 28.Therefore, the non-tax avoidance purposes of the arrangement (which generally are id entified when considering the arrangement under the Parliamentary contemplatio n t est) are also relevant to the merely incidental test. Non-tax avoidance purposes include: commercial purposes; private purposes; and purposes giving rise to legitimate tax advantages (ie, where the use or t he c ircumvention of specific provisions is within Parliament’s contemplation). The arrangement’s scope, purposes and tax effects 29.The steps and transactions that make up the arrangement described at \[11 \] are: Companies A and B establish a limited partnership registered under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008 (the LP); Companies A and B make equal contributions to the capital of the partnershi p a nd agree to each receiving a 50% share of partnership profits and losses; Profit Co sells its business operations to the LP at the open market value of thos e o perations; Company A and Profit Co apply the group company rules of subpart IC to their respective tax positions taken for income tax purposes; and Company A and Company B return for income tax purposes a 50% share each of the LP’s profits. 30.On the face of it, t he arrangement serves the commercial purposes of Company B ta king a financial interest in the business of Profit Co. 31.The tax effects of the arrangement are: Profit Co no longer derives business income; the LP derives business income; UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 of 24 QB 23/02 | 3 February 2023 the LP is transparent for tax purposes with Companies A and B each deriving 50% of the LP’s income; Company A can offset its share of LP income against its tax losses; and Company A’s ability to group tax losses with Profit Co under subpart IC i s una ffected. 32.These tax effects arise under the following specific provisions: s CB 1 (Amounts derived from business) subpart HG (Joint venturers, partners, and partnerships) subpart IA (General rules for tax losses) subpart IC (Grouping tax losses). 33.There may also be tax effects arising from the sale of the business (eg, depreciation r ecovered), although these are not of significance to the subsequent s BG 1 analysis. Parliament’s purposes for the specific provisions Business income 34.Parliament contemplates that amounts a person derives from a business are treated as income and taxed. This is made clear by Parliament explicitly legislating s CB 1 to ensure this is the case. As stated by Richardson J of a predecessor of s CB 1 in AA Finance Ltd (CA), “\[a\] gain made in the ordinary course of carrying on the business is thus stamped with an income character”. 9 L osses 35.Parliament contemplates taxpayers incurring losses where their annual total deduction i s more than their annual gross income (s BC 4(3)). It contemplates the net loss being dealt with in certain ways. A net loss is dealt with under Part I (Treatment of tax losses) and it may be offset against future income, made available to certain other persons o r d ealt with in certain other ways (s BC 4(4)). A person’s taxable income for a tax year i s d etermined after subtracting any available tax losses under Part I (s BC 5). 36.Generally, Part I provides that a person’s tax loss for a tax year is the sum of their loss balance brought forward, current year net loss and certain other amounts (eg, unused imputation credits) (s IA 2). Any tax losses not able to be offset against current incom e 9 AA Finance v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,383 (CA) at 11,391. UNCLASSIFIED Page 10 of 24 QB 23/02 | 3 February 2023 can be carried forward to subsequent income years and offset (s IA 4). Temporary rules also permit some losses to be carried back to prior years (s IZ 8). 10 37.However, Parliament has also provided specific restrictions for companies (s IA 5). 11 T hese restrictions require a minimum of 49% continuity of voting interests to be held by the same group of people from when the losses are incurred to when they ar e u ltimately offset against income. That is, within some limits, Parliament generally expects the same group of people with a financial interest in the company when t he losses are incurred get to enjoy the benefit of those losses being offset against income in the future. 38.Similarly, where a tax loss is to be made available to another person and the parties are c ompanies, Parliament expects a 66% commonality of shareholding to exist betw een t he profit and loss companies from the start of the period when the loss was incurred to the end of the year of offset (subpart IC). Limited partnerships 39.The primary objective of the limited partnership rules is to facilitate sustainable growth i n New Zealand’s investment capital sectors, such as venture capital, by providing a legal and tax structure recognised and accepted by investors. 12 40.A limited partnership under the Act means a limited partnership registered under the L imited Partnerships Act 2008. It includes an overseas limited partnership but does no t i nclude a “listed limited partnership” or a “foreign corporate limited partnership” (s YA 1 definition of “limited partnership”). 41.Generally, limited partnerships are treated as transparent for tax purposes (s HG 2). For the purposes of calculating partners’ obligations and liabilities, the partners are treated as carrying on the partnership’s activities and having the status, intention and purpos e o f the partnership (s HG 2(1)). Any income, expenses, tax credits, rebates, gains and losses arising for the partnership flow through to the partners in proportion to their interest in the partnership (s HG 2(2)). There are rules concerning the entry and exit of partners (ss HG 3 to HG 10). There are also rules placed on limited partners that ensure the partners’ tax losses are restricted if the amount of the loss exceeds the tax book value of their investment (s HG 11). 10 The COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Other Regulatory Urgent Measures) Act 2020 introduced a temporary loss carry back regime applicable to the 2018-19 and 2019-20 income years. 11 With effect on 1 April 2020, subpart IB provides that in certain situations a tax loss may be carried forward despite a breach of s IA 5 if there is no major change in the nature of the business. For the purposes of this scenario, it is assumed the parties could not rely on the rules in subpart IB. 12 New legislation – Taxation (Limited Partnerships) Act 2008, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 8 (September/October 2008): 4. UNCLASSIFIED Page 11 of 24 QB 23/02 | 3 February 2023 Facts, features or attributes 42.Having identified Parliament’s purposes for the specific provisions in this scenario, it is possible to translate Parliament’s purposes into the following facts, features or attributes that Parliament would contemplate being present: The formation of a partnership relationship between Companies A and B. The registration of the partnership as a limited partnership under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. Companies A and B contributing equally to the capital of the LP as agreed between them. The disposal of Profit Co’s business to the LP, with the consequences that Profit Co no longer conducts the business and ceases to derive business income. The LP acquiring the business of Profit Co at its open market value, with the consequences that the LP conducts the business and commences deriving business income. Companies A and B sharing equally in the profits or losses of the LP, returning these as income or losses in their respective tax returns each year t he a rrangement remains operative. A minimum of 49% continuity of shareholding in the group of persons holding voting interests in Company A from the beginning of the year in which th e c ompany’s tax losses were incurred until the end of any year in which they ar e offset against LP income (or failing that, the business continuity provisions of subpart IB are met). A minimum of 66% commonality of shareholding between the group of persons holding voting interests in Company A and Profit Co from the time Company A i ncurred the tax losses until the end of any year in which they are offset against any future income of Profit Co. Viewing the arrangement as a whole and in a commercially and economically realistic way 43.In the Commissioner’s opinion, when the arrangement is viewed as a whole and in a c ommercially and economically realistic way using the factors mentioned at \[17\], it can be seen that there are real economic consequences to the parties that reflect t he a rrangement’s legal form and there are no indications of tax advantages arising as a r esult of artificiality or contrivance. 44.That is, the reality of the arrangement accords with: UNCLASSIFIED Page 12 of 24 QB 23/02 | 3 February 2023 Companies A and B contributing equally to the formation of a registered limited partnership from which they return equal shares of income and losses for tax purposes; an arm’s-length sale of Profit Co’s business to the LP; the LP, and not Profit Co, conducting the business and deriving business income; and no change in the composition of the group of persons holding voting interests i n C ompany A or Profit Co. 45.In reality, a limited partnership has been formed through which a third- party investor, Company B, has contributed capital to take an interest in an actual and existing profitable business. The nature and extent of the financial consequences for t he pa rties is consistent with this arm’s-length investment by Company B. 46.For its part, Company A divests itself of half of its interests in the business and suffers the economic burden of no longer having full access to the profits of the business. It does, however, continue to have the ability to offset losses against half of those profits when those profits are received in the form of LP income. This is because there has been no change in shareholding in Company A that could have meant the company was not able to offset its losses against its share of the LP income or any future incom e of Profit Co. Answering the ultimate question 47.Applying s BG 1 requires answering the “ultimate question” of whether the arrangement, viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, uses or circumvents the specific provisions in a manner that is consistent with Parliament’s purpose. 48.As mentioned, viewing the arrangement in this scenario as a whole in a commercially and economically realistic way does not highlight that tax advantages have been o btained by artificiality, contrivance or pretence. 49.The arrangement serves the commercial purposes of Company B taking a financial interest in the business of Profit Co. 50.There is a partnership between Companies A and B registered under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008 which the partners are contributing to and benefiting from equally. Accordingly, Company B’s investment through a limited partnership is consistent with Parliament’s purposes that limited partnerships are used as investment vehicles. UNCLASSIFIED Page 13 of 24 QB 23/02 | 3 February 2023 51.There has been no change in who holds shares in Company A or Profit Co affecting the c ommonality or continuity of shareholding requirements of the Act. This means t he a rrangement does not defeat Parliament’s general expectation that the group of people with a financial interest in a company when losses are incurred should also enjoy the benefit of those losses being offset against income in the future. 52.Accordingly, the arrangement does not appear to use or circumvent specific provisions of the Act in a manner outside Parliament’s contemplation. This can also b e ( optionally) analysed in terms of the facts, features or attributes Parliament would expect to be present or absent (see \[\[16\], \[\[ 23\] and \[42\] above). 53.All the facts, features or attributes mentioned earlier are present in the arrangement as matters of commercial and economic reality, further reinforcing the view that t he a rrangement does not appear to use or circumvent specific provisions of the Act in a manner outside Parliament’s contemplation. 54.It may be thought that the step of selling the business to the LP was included in the a rrangement for tax reasons. That is, to invest in the business activity of Profit Co, Company B could have bought shares in that company. Had this been t he a rrangement instead, one of the tax effects of this alternative arrangement would ha ve been t o breach the loss grouping provisions of the Act. Company A would then ha ve been una ble to offset its losses against any of the profits generated by the business activity. 55.However, applying the Parliamentary contemplation test requires determining the c ommercial and economic reality of the arrangement actually entered into. Establishing tax avoidance does not require identifying some hypothetical alternative arrangement the taxpayer may have entered into (sometimes referred to as a “ counterfactual”). New Zealand’s courts have not relied on counterfactuals to reach a view on whether an arrangement has a tax avoidance purpose or effect. 56.In addition, the Supreme Court in Ben Nevis considered that taxpayers have the f reedom to structure transactions to their best tax advantage. They cannot, however, do so in a way that is proscribed by the general anti-avoidance provision. That is, provided taxpayers make use of the provisions of the Act in a way contemplated by Parliament, they have freedom to choose how they structure their arrangements. 13 A ccordingly, there is no general requirement for the parties in this scenario to adopt a n a lternative, less tax-favourable, arrangement. 57.In the Commissioner’s opinion, taking into account all of the above matters, this arrangement does not use or circumvent the specific provisions in a manner that i s o utside Parliament’s purposes for those provisions. As such, it is not a tax avoidanc e 13 Ben Nevis (SC) at \[111\] and Penny (SC) at \[49\]. UNCLASSIFIED Page 14 of 24 QB 23/02 | 3 February 2023 arrangement as it does not have a tax avoidance purpose or effect and, without more, s BG 1 would not apply. Scenario 2 — Use of a discretionary trust Question | Pātai 58.Does s BG 1 apply in the following circumstances: trustees of a trust pay or vest income in an income year to beneficiaries that ar e ei ther: oan individual adult beneficiary who is taxed on the beneficiary income at the lowest marginal tax rate; or oa corporate beneficiary (that may or may not be solvent) with total tax losses available in that year equal to, or greater than, the beneficiary income; or oa corporate beneficiary, where the beneficiary income is a dividend from a foreign company and exempt income of the beneficiary under s CW 9; the trust was validly established and the trustees have fully complied with the Tr usts Act 2019, the terms of the trust deed and with their obligations under general trust law to distribute income to the beneficiaries; the terms of the trust deed do not require the trustees to distribute any or all of the income derived each year; the trustees also have the discretion to choose the beneficiaries or class of beneficiaries that are to receive trust property; all beneficiaries of the trust are existing beneficiaries of the trust and New Zealand tax residents; and for tax purposes, the trust is classified as a complying trust under s HC 10. Answer | Whakautu 59.No. The Commissioner’s view is that, without more, s BG 1 would not apply to the a rrangement. Variations to the facts that may lead the Commissioner to reach a different view are discussed from \[92\] below. UNCLASSIFIED Page 15 of 24 QB 23/02 | 3 February 2023 Explanation | Whakamāramatanga Introduction 60.The Commissioner’s approach to applying s BG 1 is set out in scenario 1 at \[14\] to \[28\] above. The arrangement’s scope, purposes and tax effects 61.The steps and transactions that make up the arrangement are: The trustees of the trust appointing the beneficiaries. The trustees deriving income and paying or vesting that income to the benef iciaries. 62.On the face of it, t he arrangement serves the commercial or private purposes of vesting income in, or paying income to, a beneficiary taking into account t he benef iciary’s tax position. 63.The tax effect of the arrangement is that the income derived by the trustees and vested in or paid to the beneficiary is not trustee income and not subject to tax at the trust ee ta x rate of 33%. 64.Instead, the tax effect is that the income is beneficiary income and: in the case of the individual, is taxed at a rate of tax that is less than the trustee ta x rate; in the case of the loss company, is not taxed because of the availability to t he be neficiary of sufficient tax losses to offset against the income; and in the case of the dividend from a foreign company paid or vested to a corporat e benef iciary, is not taxed because the income retains its identity as foreig n d ividends and is exempt income of the beneficiary under s CW 9. 65.The relevant provisions of the Act are the trust rules in subpart HC relating to beneficiary income and the core provisions in Part B. Parliament’s purposes for the specific provisions Beneficiary income 66.Subpart HC provides rules for the taxation of trusts, including the taxation of beneficiary income. Income derived by a trustee is treated as trustee income and taxed at the rate of 33% unless it is distributed as beneficiary income (s HC 5). Beneficiary UNCLASSIFIED Page 16 of 24 QB 23/02 | 3 February 2023 income is taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate. An amount derived by a person is income under s CV 13(a) if it is beneficiary income under s HC 6. 67.In order to be a valid distribution, an amount must be vested or paid in accordance w ith the terms of the trust. The terms of some trusts may limit the amount of t he g ross income the trustees can distribute to an amount equal to the net income of t he t rust. Otherwise, if it is permitted, a trustee could distribute all the gross incom e m eaning any expenditure incurred has to be paid out of other sources (previous income, capital or corpus) and possibly lead to the trustee incurring a tax loss. 68.Also, if an amount of income derived by a trustee is of a particular character (eg, interest income), the income will retain this character in the hands of the beneficiary when the amount becomes beneficiary income. Similarly, if an amount of income has a source in New Zealand it will have the same source in the hands of the beneficiary when the amount becomes beneficiary income. 69.Under s HC 6, for income to be treated as beneficiary income it must be income d erived by a trustee that: “vests absolutely in interest” in a beneficiary in the income year, or is “paid” to a beneficiary either in the income year or within a certain period after the end of the income year (ie, within six months of the end of the income year or the earlier of when the trust tax return is filed or is due). 70.Accordingly, beneficiary income can arise in two ways—where it vests absolutely in i nterest in the beneficiary or where it is paid to the beneficiary (although there is som e o verlap between the two). 71.Beneficiary income is discussed in Part 5 of the Commissioner’s Interpretation S tatement IS 18/01. 14 IS 18/01 makes the following additional points concerning beneficiary income: the amount vested or paid can take the form of money or money’s worth; the exact amount vested or paid need not be specified at the time as long as t he a mount can be calculated when the assessment of income is made for t he in come year; where an amount is future property or an expectancy, the vesting or payment will not be effective until the amount is received or receivable; an amount may vest in a beneficiary as a result of a clause in a trust deed or as a result of the exercise of a discretion given to a trustee to allocate an amount to a beneficiary; 14 IS 18/01: Taxation of trusts – Income tax, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 30, No 7 (August 2018): 17. UNCLASSIFIED Page 17 of 24 QB 23/02 | 3 February 2023 an amount will vest in a beneficiary only if the beneficiary is given an indefeasible r ight to the amount (ie, the trustee cannot later change their mind and decid e no t to give the amount to the beneficiary); on vesting, a beneficiary obtains an absolute interest in the amount vested. T he i nterest can be a right to present or future possession of the amount; even if there is a right to present possession, the trustee may hold the amount until the beneficiary demands it; 15 the vesting cannot be subject to a condition being met or an event occurring; beneficiary income will be paid to a beneficiary either when it is distributed to the beneficiary; credited to the beneficiary or is dealt with in their interest or o n t heir behalf in some other way; making a loan to a beneficiary will not constitute payment of beneficiary incom e bec ause of the obligation to repay the loan amount; and where a beneficiary has a discretionary interest in income, it is necessary for t he t rustee to pass a resolution that initiates the making of a payment to that beneficiary. 72.Section GB 22 is a specific anti-avoidance provision applying to situations where a trustee enters into an arrangement to defeat the intent and application of the rules relating to beneficiary income and taxable distributions. However, the existence of a specific anti-avoidance provision does not preclude the application of s BG 1. 16 73.The phrase used in the legislation for beneficiary income that “vests absolutely in i nterest” is discussed in more detail in the Commissioner’s Interpretation Statement IS 12/02. 17 D iscretionary trusts and allocating beneficiary income 74.Subpart HC is silent on how trustees of discretionary trusts that are classified as c omplying trusts should determine who receives beneficiary income or the amount of that income. Parliament has generally left it to general trust law to determine this aspect of trust taxation. However, once trustees make decisions within the constraints 15 Note, that since IS 18/01 was published it has been accepted that the income tax law around whether a beneficiary who leaves distributions in a trust is considered a settlor of the trust has been unclear (see Commissioner’s Operational Position – New section HC 27(6) – treatment of beneficiary as a settlor in certain circumstances, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31, No 8 (September 2019): 113. From 1 April 2020, s HC 27(6) provides that a beneficiary is not a settlor of the trust solely as a result of being owed money by a trustee if the amount owing is not more than $25,000 or the trustee pays market rate interest on the amount. 16 Penny (SC) at \[48\]. 17 IS 12/02: Income tax — Whether income deemed to arise under tax law, but not trust law, can give rise to beneficiary income, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 7 (August 2012): 49. UNCLASSIFIED Page 18 of 24 QB 23/02 | 3 February 2023 of general trust law, Parliament has indicated its expectations as to the tax consequences that arise. It can be seen that in some areas Parliament has placed practical limitations on trustees in terms of amounts allocated to beneficiaries. 75.For example, where beneficiary income includes imputation credits trustees are ef fectively prevented by s LE 5 from streaming the credits to one beneficiary. Section LE 5 limits the imputation credit available to a beneficiary by pro-rating the credits over all distributions made to all beneficiaries in the relevant income year. Similarly, in certain circumstances trustees are deterred by s HC 35 from distributing beneficiary income of more than $1,000 in an income year to a beneficiary that is a minor as amounts in excess of that are taxed at the trustee tax rate. 76.Under trust law, where a trust instrument provides trustees with a discretion to choose w hich beneficiaries should receive trust property, the trustees are entitled to prefer some beneficiaries over others. The House of Lords’ decision in Gartside made it clear that the beneficiaries of a discretionary trust have no proprietary interest in the trust property or its income. 18 Their rights are restricted to a right to be considered for nomination as a beneficiary by the trustees and a right to compel proper administration of the trust. 77.Gartside also confirmed that the trustees of a discretionary trust owe fiduciary duties to discretionary beneficiaries. The beneficiaries have a right that would attract t he pr otection of a court of equity to ensure the trustees carry out their duties fairly, reasonably or properly. This means trustees of a trust must not exercise their discretion without properly considering all relevant matters as directed by the Trust s Act 2019, the trust deed and general trust law. 78.Parliament’s purposes for trustee income and beneficiary income can be found in a combination of the Trusts Act 2019, general trust law, Part B and subpart HC of the Act. From this, it can be concluded that neither the Trusts Act 2019, general trust law nor the Act prevents trustees of a discretionary trust taking into account the tax consequences arising for a beneficiary if they were to receive beneficiary income. These tax consequences arise in the context of the core provisions of the Act from which income tax obligations and entitlements are determined, taking into account such things as tax rates, credits and deductions. Parliament contemplated that tax rates, credits and deductions apply to the income actually derived by the taxpayer. Income derived by a taxpayer could include beneficiary income. 79.In other circumstances, the Act provides for tax losses to arise and for these to be o ffset against income actually derived by taxpayers. Also, s HC 22 shows tha t 18 Gartside v IRC \[1968\] 1 All ER 121 (HL). UNCLASSIFIED Page 19 of 24 QB 23/02 | 3 February 2023 Parliament contemplates that, in some contexts in relation to non-complying trusts, taxpayers deriving beneficiary income may also have tax losses. Facts, features or attributes 80.Having identified Parliament’s purposes for the specific provisions in this scenario, it is possible to translate Parliament’s purposes into the following facts, features or attributes that Parliament would contemplate being present: A valid trust exists, where the trustees act in accordance with the trust deed and general trust law: oThe necessary prerequisites to the formation of a trust are met, including the certainty of: an intention to establish a trust; the trust assets being unambiguously defined; and the beneficiaries being able to be ascertained. oThe trustees are holding and dealing with trust property, including deriving income from the trust property, on behalf of beneficiaries in accordanc e w ith the trust deed and general trust law. Income derived by the trustees is paid or vested as beneficiary income to beneficiaries. The beneficiaries receiving distributions of income are eligible to benefit under the trust. That is, they are, in reality, beneficiaries of the trust. The beneficiaries receive the distributions of income. That is, they benefit i n s ome way, either immediately or from future possession of the income so that, i n r eality, there is a distribution of income to them. The core provisions of the Act, including the rules concerning income, exempt income, basic tax rates and tax losses, apply according to the individual circumstances of the beneficiary. Viewing the arrangement as a whole and in a commercially and economically realistic way 81.In the Commissioner’s opinion, when the arrangement is viewed as a whole and in a commercially and economically realistic way using the factors mentioned at \[17\], it can be seen that the arrangement’s commercial and economic reality is consistent with its legal form and tax advantages do not arise as a result of artificiality or contrivance. UNCLASSIFIED Page 20 of 24 QB 23/02 | 3 February 2023 82.That is, in reality, there is in this scenario a validly established trust. The distributions of beneficiary income have been undertaken in compliance with the Trusts Act 2019, t he t rust deed, general trust law requirements and subpart HC of the Act. There is no suggestion the beneficiaries are not, in reality, entitled under the trust, or that they will not benefit from the distribution of income to them. Answering the ultimate question 83.Applying s BG 1 requires answering the “ultimate question” of whether the arrangement, viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, uses or circumvents the specific provisions in a manner that is consistent with Parliament’s purpose. 84.As mentioned, viewing the arrangement in this scenario as a whole, in a commercially and economically realistic way does not indicate tax advantages have been obtained by artificiality , contrivance or pretence. 85.As stated, in the arrangement for this scenario there is a validly established trust. The d istributions of beneficiary income have been undertaken in compliance with the trust deed, general trust law requirements and subpart HC of the Act. There is no suggestion the beneficiaries are not, in reality, entitled under the trust, or that they will not benefit from the distribution of income to them. 86.The arrangement serves the commercial or private purposes of vesting income in, or paying income to, a beneficiary taking into account the beneficiary’s tax position. I n s hort, the arrangement achieves the usual purposes of a discretionary trust. 87.Accordingly, the arrangement does not appear to use or circumvent specific provisions of the Act in a manner outside Parliament’s contemplation. This can also b e ( optionally) analysed in terms of the facts, features or attributes Parliament would expect to be present or absent (see \[16\], \[23\] and \[80\] above). 88.All these facts, features or attributes are present in the arrangement as matters of commercial and economic reality, further reinforcing the view that the arrangement does not appear to use or circumvent specific provisions of the Act in a manner outside Parliament’s contemplation. 89.In the Commissioner’s opinion, taking into account all of the above matters, this arrangement does not use or circumvent the specific provisions in a manner that is outside Parliament’s purposes for those provisions. As such, it is not a tax avoidance arrangement as it does not have tax avoidance as a purpose or effect and, withou t m ore, s BG 1 would not apply. 90.The Commissioner considers this is the correct conclusion despite the implication that the trustees’ choices in this scenario were significantly influenced by tax considerations. UNCLASSIFIED Page 21 of 24 QB 23/02 | 3 February 2023 The Supreme Court in Ben Nevis considered that taxpayers could structure their arrangements to their best tax advantage, provided the use of the provisions is consistent with what Parliament would have contemplated. 19 Where the use of the provisions is outside what Parliament would have contemplated for them it is appropriate for s BG 1 to apply. 91.Accordingly, arrangements strongly influenced by tax outcomes are not necessarily tax avoidance arrangements subject to s BG 1. Such influences on arrangements would be r elevant to whether tax outcomes were merely incidental, but this only becomes important if the arrangement has a tax avoidance purpose or effect in the first instance. Note that, prior to Ben Nevis (SC), Richardson J recognised this for trusts in Challeng e Co rporation (CA): 20 ... but it was obviously never intended that the use of trusts, which in New Zealand practice in the vast majority of cases is substantially influenced by tax considerations, should be automatically voided under its provisions. Factual variations 92.While the Commissioner considers s BG 1 does not apply on the simple facts of the a rrangement in this scenario, there may be arrangements involving distributions of beneficiary income where the Commissioner may reach a different conclusion. Factual variations in relation to Parliament’s purposes for the trust rules 93.Different facts may call into question whether Parliament’s purposes for the trust rules are being given effect to. On some facts, it will be arguable that no distribution of income to a beneficiary of the trust was made from a commercial or economic perspective and this may be because of artificial or contrived elements or steps in t he a rrangement or the use of pretence. 94.That is, where it is arguable whether, in commercial or economic reality: the beneficiary is a beneficiary of the trust, or a distribution of income was made to the beneficiary. 95.Consideration would need to be given to various facts, including (but not limited to): the timing and pattern of the addition or removal of beneficiaries; 19 At \[111\]. 20 CIR v Challenge Corporation Ltd \[1986\] 2 NZLR 513 (CA) at 548–549. UNCLASSIFIED Page 22 of 24 QB 23/02 | 3 February 2023 how and when the income was distributed (eg, whether authorised distributions are paid in cash or credited to beneficiaries’ current accounts); any facts indicating that, in commercial and economic reality, parties other tha n t he trustees or the beneficiaries nominated to receive distributions obtain the us e a nd benefit of the income; and any facts indicating that, in commercial and economic reality, there is no realistic prospect of the beneficiaries ever benefiting from the income allocated to them. 96.However, the fact that in any income year the trustees have resolved to pay beneficiary distributions by credit to account and retain the funds for use within the trust would not, on its own, indicate Parliament’s purposes for the distribution of beneficiary income were not being given effect to. 21 97.Although argued under provisions other than the trust rules, Krukziener (No 3) is an example of where, in the context of s BG 1, a court clearly considered that the use and benefit of income distributed by trustees was enjoyed by a person other than t he benef iciaries nominated to receive the distributions. 22 Factual variations in relation to Parliament’s purposes for other provisions 98.Another situation where the Commissioner may reach a different conclusion is where a n arrangement is contrary to Parliament’s purposes for provisions of the Act, other than the trust rules. It is not possible to be specific about such arrangements due to the range of arrangements and other provisions of the Act that could arise. It is likely that, unlike the current scenario, such arrangements would involve additional entities and steps that contribute to the potential for these arrangements to be regarded as tax avoidance arrangements. 21 However, see footnote 15 regarding s HC 27 and the potential for a beneficiary to be treated as a settlor of the trust. 22 Krukziener v CIR (No 3) (2010) 24 NZTC 24,563 (HC).

However, taxpayers can generally rely on them in determining their tax affairs. See further Status of Commissioner’s advice (D ecember 2012).

QUESTIONS WE’VE BEEN ASKED | PĀTAI KUA UIA MAI Income tax – deductibility of expenditure – renting to flatmates Issued | Tukuna: 6 December 2023 QB 23/08 This Question We’ve Been Asked explains when a person can claim deductions for expenditure incurred in deriving rental income, where the person rents a room in their home to a flatmate. It considers the possible application of the interest limitation, residential ring-fencing and mixed-use asset rules. Key provisions | Whakaratonga tāpua Income Tax Act 2007 – ss DA 1, DA 2, YA, CC 1, DG 3, DH 5, EE 50, EL 4, EL 9, s YA 1 (“main home”), Schedule 15 Page 2 of 14 QB 23/08 | 6 December 2023 Question | Pātai If a home owner lives in their home and rents out a room to a flatmate, can they claim deductions for costs incurred in deriving the rental income? Answer | Whakautu Yes. A home owner can claim deductions for costs incurred to the extent the expenditure is incurred in earning the rental income from the flatmate(s). The rental income from the flatmate is taxable. Any expenditure incurred in earning the income from the flatmate needs to be apportioned between private use (living in the house) and income-earning use (rental income from a flatmate). Apportionment based on the use of physical space is a reasonable basis on which to determine the income-earning component of expenditure and to calculate the deduction amount. There are some specific rules that may impact the home owner’s tax treatment but these generally do not apply in flatmate situations:  The interest limitation rule will not apply if the land is used predominantly for the person’s main home.  The residential ring-fencing rule will not apply if more than 50% of the land is used for most of the income year by the person as their main home.  The mixed-use asset rules will not apply because the home is unlikely to be left vacant for the period required under the rules. If the mixed-use asset criteria are satisfied, the exclusion for long-term rental property is likely to apply. Generally, the fact a person rents out a room in their home to a flatmate while living in the home will not stop the home being the person’s main home. Explanation | Whakamāramatanga Introduction 1. This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) explains how a person (the owner) who rents out a room in their home to a flatmate calculates their deductions for costs incurred in deriving the rental income. Page 3 of 14 QB 23/08 | 6 December 2023 2. We have been asked to consider:  how to calculate the amount of expenditure incurred in deriving income from renting out a room to a flatmate;  whether a home is an owner’s “main home” if the owner shares their home with one or more flatmates;  whether the interest limitation rules apply to deny deductions for interest expenditure;  whether the residential ring-fencing rules apply to a person renting out a room to a flatmate; and  whether the mixed-use asset rules apply. 3. This item assumes the:  rental activities do not constitute the carrying on of a business;  person renting out the room is the property owner;  land has an existing single dwelling constructed on it;  land is not new build land within the scope of the s DH 4 exemption to the interest limitation rules;  property is the person’s only home; and  flatmate is a third party and not a guest or family member who pays below market rent. 4. Private boarders and home-stay students are different to flatmates. Boarders pay for accommodation and services (eg regular meals). To remove any doubt, our discussion on the deductibility of costs at \[6\] to \[19\] does not apply to people who apply DET 19/01: S tandard-cost household service for private boarding service providers (Determination, Wellington, Inland Revenue, May 2019) or DET 19/02: Standard-cost household service for short-stay accommodation providers ( Determination, Wellington, Inland Revenue, May 2019). 5. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Deductibility of costs incurred in renting a room to a flatmate 6. When renting a room to a flatmate, an owner will incur costs that relate to earning the rental income. Common types of costs include: Page 4 of 14 QB 23/08 | 6 December 2023  insurance;  local authority rates (including water rates);  electricity, gas, internet and other utilities;  repairs and maintenance; and  interest. 7. The owner is allowed to claim a deduction for expenditure to the extent it is incurred in deriving assessable income from renting a room to a flatmate. A deduction will be available only for periods where the owner has rented a room to a flatmate and not if the room is merely available for use. If the room is not rented out it will be for the owner’s private use. 8. Rent that the owner receives from their flatmate is assessable income (s CC 1). 9. It is a question of fact whether a sufficient relationship exists between the expenditure and the derivation of income. It requires ascertaining the true character of the expenditure and considering the relationship between the advantage sought or obtained from the expenditure and the owner’s income. 10. Generally, where an owner rents a room to a flatmate, a sufficient relationship between the rental income and above types of expenditure will exist and the issue is one of apportionment. Basis of apportionment 11. A deduction is allowed to the extent to which expenditure is incurred in deriving assessable income. 1 However, a deduction is denied to the extent the expenditure is of a private or domestic nature (this is known as the private limitation). 12. The owner needs to apportion any mixed-use expenditure between their private use of the property and the rental use of the property. 13. For the period the owner is renting a room in their home to a flatmate, the use of the physical space is a reasonable basis for apportionment of mixed-use expenses. The owner’s home will typically involve three types of space:  the owner’s private or exclusive use area; 1 The deduction amount may be limited to the amount of income derived where a flatmate pays less than a market value rent (Case E54 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,312 (TRA)). However, these situations are outside the scope of this QWBA. Page 5 of 14 QB 23/08 | 6 December 2023  the flatmate’s exclusive use area; and  common or shared areas. 14. An area will be for the flatmate’s exclusive use only if it is specifically agreed by the parties that it is for the flatmate’s exclusive use. 15. In the apportionment calculation, expenses wholly relating to:  the flatmate’s exclusive use area should be treated as 100% deductible.  the owner’s private use area should be treated as 0% deductible. 16. In addition, the Commissioner is satisfied that common use areas may be treated as 50% deductible. 2 Example | Tauira 1 at \[53\] illustrates how to apportion expenditure based on physical space. 17. Mixed-use expenditure must be apportioned. But it may be possible to identify some items of expenditure (for example, specific repairs and maintenance expenses relating to a flatmate’s room) as directly referable to the production of assessable income and not subject to apportionment under the private limitation. In these cases, the full amount may be deducted as expenditure incurred in deriving assessable income. On the other hand, there may be occasions where the expenditure is incurred solely for private use, so is non-deductible. Depreciation loss 18. A depreciation loss is not available for residential buildings ( that is, the home). However, the owner may be able to claim depreciation on chattels used or available for use in deriving assessable income. 19. If the owner has a depreciation loss in an income year, a deduction is allowed to the extent the loss is incurred by the owner in renting the room to the flatmate. 20. If the chattels are exclusively used by the flatmate, the owner can claim a deduction for the full depreciation loss. See the treatment of curtains in Example | Tauira 2. On the other hand, the owner cannot claim a depreciation loss if the chattels are for their exclusive use. 2 The Commissioner has generally accepted 50% as a reasonable apportionment for common use areas (see QB 19/05 : What are my income tax obligations if I rent out my home or a separate dwelling on my property as short-stay accommodation (Question We’ve Been Asked, Wellington, Inland Revenue, May 2019) and Interpretation statement IS 17/02: Deductibility of Farmhouse Expenses (Wellington, Inland Revenue March 2017)). Page 6 of 14 QB 23/08 | 6 December 2023 21. The owner may claim for only part of the depreciation on mixed-use chattels (that is, chattels in common areas that both the owner and flatmates can use). 22. The approach to work out how much depreciation the owner may claim each year for mixed-use chattels is similar to the approach to apportioning mixed expenses. The first step is to work out the depreciation loss for the year for each asset. 23. For low value items (up to $1,000), the depreciation loss is the asset’s cost. If the asset is part of a group of items purchased at the same time from the same supplier, and the items would have the same depreciation rate, the $1,000 threshold applies to the group of items. 24. For other assets, the depreciation loss for the year is worked out using either the diminishing value (DV) method or the straight-line (SL) method. For information about the methods and the depreciation rates, see our website: Depreciation rate finder and calculator. 25. Once the depreciation losses for the year are calculated for the mixed-use chattels (including for low value items 3 ) in the owner’s home, the next step is to work out what proportion of those losses may be deducted. 26. Generally, t he amount of the depreciation loss on chattels in common areas should be apportioned so that 50% is treated as relating to private use and non-deductible. However, where the actual use of the asset can be clearly demonstrated, an alternative basis may be adopted if it reflects a reasonable basis for apportionment. Interest limitation rules 27. The interest limitation rules operate to deny interest deductions claimed by residential property owners. The interest limitation rules contain, among other exclusions and exceptions, a form of main home exclusion and an exception for new builds. 4 28. The interest limitation rules deny the owner a deduction for interest incurred in relation to their land unless the land is ”excepted residential land” as described in Schedule 15. Schedule 15 contains a main home exclusion. 29. The interest limitation rule does not apply to l and used predominantly for a place configured as a residence or abode if that place is the person’s main home. 3 When determining whether an asset is a low value item, the asset’s cost must be equal to or less than $1,000 prior to any apportionment for private use. 4 For the purpose of this item, we have assumed the land is not new build land within the scope of the s DH 4 exemption. Page 7 of 14 QB 23/08 | 6 December 2023 30. Whether an owner who rents out a room in their home to a flatmate is denied deductions for interest due to the interest limitation rules depends on the facts of each situation, namely:  whether the land is used predominantly for a place configured as a residence; and  whether the place is the owner’s main home. “Used predominantly for a place configured as a residence” 31. Whether a place is “configured as a residence” depends on whether the place has been formed or shaped to function as a place of residence, irrespective of whether it is currently used as a place of residence. A “residence” means a place where a person has a fixed presence and a degree of permanence. Therefore, a place will be configured as a residence if it is capable of being used as a residence with a degree of permanence. 32. Land will have been used predominantly for a place configured as a residence where the physical area of the land used for the place is more than 50% of the total land area. 33. If the land is used for one place configured as a residence, the “used predominantly” threshold will be satisfied. If other dwellings are situated on the land or the land is used for other purposes, the physical space of the respective structures or uses needs to be determined. 5 This QWBA deals only with land that has a single existing dwelling situated on it. Main home 34. The next step is to consider whether the place is the owner’s main home. “Main home” is defined in s YA 1 as: main home means, for a person, the 1 dwelling— (a) that is used as a residence by the person (a home); and (b) with which the person has the greatest connection, if they have more than 1 home 5 See Example 9: Multiple residences on a single legal title in Special report on interest limitation and additional bright-line rules ( Wellington, Inland Revenue, March 2022). . Page 8 of 14 QB 23/08 | 6 December 2023 35. The definition provides that for a person the main home is the one dwelling they use as a residence. The focus of the main home definition is on the nature of the place and the relationship between the person and that place. 36. A “residence” is the place where a person has settled, where they ordinarily eat, live and sleep, and the place the person uses as a base for their daily activities and is the seat of that person’s domestic life and interests. “Used” means actual physical use of the dwelling and not intended use. Therefore, a dwelling is used as a residence when it is customarily or repeatedly used for this purpose. 37. The definition of main home does not contain any restrictions that precludes a dwelling being the owner’s main home due to the presence of a flatmate. 38. Generally, if the owner lives in the home and rents out a room to a flatmate(s) , the owner still uses the dwelling as their residence. 39. Where considerable areas of the dwelling are for the flatmate’s or flatmates’ exclusive use, it might be argued that the owner does not reside in the entire dwelling. However, the definition does not require that the owner has full use and enjoyment of the dwelling nor does it use any language of apportionment. For that reason, if the dwelling is used as the owner’s residence it will be within the scope of the main home exclusion and not subject to the interest limitation rules. Residential ring-fencing rules 40. The residential ring-fencing rules prevent the owner from offsetting deductions incurred for residential properties against other sources of income (for example, salary or wages). This means if the rental activity is loss-making (the deductible expenses exceed the income), the excess deductions cannot be claimed that year. Any excess deductions are not permanently forfeited but are carried forward and may be offset against any future income derived from the residential property. 41. The residential ring-fencing rules apply to residential land where the person who owns the land is allowed a deduction for expenditure relating to its use or disposal. “R esidential land” includes land that has a dwelling on it unless the land is farmland or used predominantly as business premises. 42. There are a few exclusions to the residential ring-fencing rules, including a main home exclusion. Page 9 of 14 QB 23/08 | 6 December 2023 Main home exclusion 43. The main home exclusion from the residential ring-fencing rules differs from the main home exclusion from the interest limitation rules. The owner can apply the main home exclusion if more than 50% of the land is used as the owner’s main home for most of the income year. Therefore, the main home exclusion will apply if:  more than 50% of the land is used as the owner’s main home (the space threshold); and  the land is used as the owner’s main home for more than 50% of the income year (the time threshold). 44. The definition of a main home was discussed at \[34\]. 45. As referred to above, where an owner rents out a room in their home to a flatmate, the three typical types of space are:  the owner’s private or exclusive use area;  the flatmate’s exclusive use area; and  common or shared areas. 46. The common use area is used by the owner as part of their residence. The fact the flatmate has access to the common use areas does not limit the owner’s ability to use the area as their residence. Therefore, the owner’s main home space consists of the owner’s private use area and the common use areas (without apportionment for the flatmate’s use). The area that is for the flatmate’s exclusive use is excluded from the space threshold calculation. 47. It is likely an owner will be able to satisfy the space threshold if the land contains a single dwelling. 48. The time threshold will be satisfied if the land is the person’s main home for more than 183 days in an income year. Whether the time threshold has been satisfied depends on the specific facts of each situation. 49. As sharing a home with flatmates does not prevent the home being the owner’s main home, if both the space threshold and time threshold are satisfied, the main home exclusion to the residential ring-fencing rules will apply. Mixed-use asset rules 50. The mixed-use asset rules apply where assets are sometimes used privately, sometimes used to earn income, and are unused for a significant period during the year. The rules Page 10 of 14 QB 23/08 | 6 December 2023 ensure an appropriate proportion of the expenses that relate to the “unused” period is deductible. The proportion that is deductible is based on the amount of income- earning use relative to the total use of the asset. 51. The mixed-use asset rules are unlikely to be relevant to an owner who rents out a room to a flatmate as the home is not unoccupied for at least 62 days during the income year. 52. If the mixed-use asset criteria are satisfied, it is likely that the specific exclusion for long-term rental property (s DG 3(4)(b)) will apply. Regardless of the mixed-use asset rules, a home owner will be unable to claim a deduction for expenditure incurred for any periods where the home is vacant. Examples | Tauira 53. The following two examples illustrate how the law applies. Example | Tauira 1 – Person rents out unfurnished rooms to two flatmates Nigel lives in his three bedroom home with two flatmates. He purchased the home on 5 March 2022 and started renting out the two spare bedrooms to flatmates on 1 April 2022. The home has a 180m 2 floor plan as shown in the diagram below. Nigel charges each flatmate $220 per week ( a total of $22,880 in the 2023 income year). Nigel also receives a salary of $62,400. Page 11 of 14 QB 23/08 | 6 December 2023 In the income year, Nigel incurred the following expenses (total $44,900) relating to the property:  interest – $37,000  local authority rates – $2,500  house insurance – $2,600  utilities (power, gas, internet) – $2,800. Nigel has elected not to depreciate any chattels. He should apportion his mixed expenses on the following basis:  40m 2 used exclusively by flatmates – 100% deductible  94m 2 common or shared areas – 50% deductible  46m 2 private area – 0% deductible. Nigel must calculate what proportion of his mixed-use expenses he may deduct for the areas of the house used exclusively by the flatmates and what proportion he may deduct for common areas. The results of those calculations are then added together. 40/180 x 100 = 22.22% 94/180 x 50 = 26.11% By adding the two figures (22.22% and 26.11%), Nigel calculates that, subject to any specific limitations, he may deduct 48.33% of his mixed expenses for the year ($21,700.17). Nigel’s land has been used predominantly for a place configured as a residence and that place is Nigel’s main home. Therefore, Nigel’s ability to claim a deduction for his interest costs is not subject to the interest limitation rules. For 2023 income year, Nigel calculates his taxable income as: Salary $62,400 Rental income $22,880 less deductible expenses ($21,700.17) $63,579.83 If Nigel had incurred a loss from the rental activity, the deductions over and above the amount of income would not be subject to the residential ring-fencing rules. This is Page 12 of 14 QB 23/08 | 6 December 2023 because more than 50% of the land was used for most of the income year by Nigel as his main home. The home has not been unoccupied during the income year, so the mixed-use asset rules have no application. Example | Tauira 2 – Calculating a deduction for depreciation of chattels This example uses the same facts as in Example | Tauira 1 except Nigel decides on 1 April 2022 to buy the following new items for his home and wishes to claim a depreciation loss:  washing machine $1,800  dryer $1,600  air fryer $300  shelving unit $2,000 The shelving unit is to be in Nigel’s toy collection space and will not be accessible to his flatmates. Nigel cannot claim a depreciation loss for the shelving unit due to its exclusive private use. Nigel can claim a depreciation loss on the other items to the extent the loss is incurred by Nigel in deriving assessable income. The washing machine, dryer and air fryer are all available for common use. Therefore, Nigel can deduct 50% of his depreciation losses in respect of the washing machine and dryer as follows:  Washing machine (30% DV) $540 depreciation loss subject to 50% apportionment = $270 deduction.  Dryer (30% DV) $480 depreciation loss subject to 50% apportionment = $240 deduction. A summary of Nigel’s fixed asset register shows: Asset Cost Annual Depreciation Charge Adjusted Tax Value Deductible Depreciation Loss Washing machine $1,800 $540 $1,260 $270 Page 13 of 14 QB 23/08 | 6 December 2023 Dryer $1,600 $480 $1,120 $240 As the cost of the air fryer is less than the $1,000 low value asset threshold, Nigel can claim a deduction for $150 (50% of $300) in relation to the air fryer. Later, Nigel decides to replace the old curtains with a more energy efficient option in each bedroom. On 1 April 2023, Nigel purchases new curtains at a cost of $1,000 per bedroom. Nigel cannot claim a depreciation loss for the cost to replace the curtains in his bedroom. However, Nigel can deduct the full depreciation loss he calculates for the curtains in the flatmates’ bedrooms as these rooms are exclusively used by his flatmates. Curtains (25% DV) $500 depreciation deduction for 2024 tax year.

QWBAs answer specific tax questions we have been asked that may be of general interest to taxpayers. While they set out the Commissioner’s considered views, QWBAs are not binding on the Commissioner. However, taxpayers can generally rely on them in determining their tax affairs. See further Status of Commissioner’s advice (December 2012). It is important to note that a general similarity between a taxpayer’s circumstances and an example in a QWBA will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case must be considered on its own facts.
FACT SHEET | PUKA MEKA When is a subdivision project a taxable activity for GST purposes? Issued | Tukuna: 25 June 2024 QB 24/04 FS 1 This fact sheet accompanies QB 24/04, which considers when a subdivision project is an activity carried on continuously or regularly in the definition of “taxable activity” for GST purposes. QB 24/04 FS 1 | 25 June 2024 Page 2 of 5 Introduction | Whakataki 1. If you are considering subdividing land you own into two or more lots, or are looking to acquire land to subdivide, you need to consider whether you have to register for GST. 2. You must register for and charge GST on the supply (sale) of most goods and services if you’re carrying on a taxable activity and the value of those supplies exceeds the registration threshold of $60,000. 3. This fact sheet summarises the QWBA to help you understand when a subdivision project is a taxable activity. It focuses on subdivisions that result in the sale of some, or all, of the subdivided lots of land. Usually, any land sale will exceed the GST registration threshold, so if you are carrying on a taxable activity you will likely need to register for GST. What if I only sell one lot? 4. A taxable activity must be carried on continuously or regularly. For a subdivision to be continuous or regular, it usually needs to involve the sale of more than one lot. A subdivision leading to only one sale is usually a one-off activity and not continuous or regular. 5. Some subdivisions leading to only one sale may be continuous or regular, but this will only be if the level of activity involved is very high. Working out the level of activity is explained below, but “very high” in this context means something like the construction and sale of a large office building or apartment block. 6. Building and selling an ordinary residential dwelling on subdivided land involves a lot of activity but it is not enough to be continuous or regular. What if I sell more than one lot? 7. The more sales involved in the subdivision, the more likely it is to be continuous or regular. If the subdivision leads to the sale of four or more lots, this is usually continuous or regular unless the level of activity involved is very low. 8. If the subdivision leads to the sale of two or three lots, it will be important to consider the amount of activity involved to subdivide and sell the lots. QB 24/04 FS 1 | 25 June 2024 Page 3 of 5 9. The following diagram illustrates that the more lots sold, the less activity is needed for the subdivision to be continuous or regular: 10. This approach comparing the number of sales with the level of activity may also be relevant for other land development projects, but it is not relevant for other types of potential taxable activity. How do I work out how much activity is involved? 11. When considering the level of activity in light of the number of lots sold, the following factors may be relevant:  The scale of the subdivision. This means how large or extensive the project is.  The level of development work. This includes any physical work done to develop the land, such as earthworks, roading, installation of infrastructure, and the construction of walls and fences, structures, and buildings.  The time and effort involved. Time means how long it takes for the project to be completed, combined with the work that needs to be done to complete it. However, if a project takes a long time because there are stages where no or very little work is being done, this might suggest the subdivision project is not QB 24/04 FS 1 | 25 June 2024 Page 4 of 5 continuous or regular. Effort includes non-physical work done on your part, such as arranging consent and engaging with lawyers and surveyors.  The level of financial investment. This is unlikely to be relevant on its own, but a higher level of financial investment might support other factors like the scale. If you buy a piece of land to sell, this may involve a higher level of financial investment than subdividing the land on your own property purchased for other purposes.  Level of repetition. Even if your subdivision project is a relatively small one involving only one lot, if you repeat this process multiple times, it is more likely to be continuous or regular. 12. The greater the extent to which these factors are present, the more likely the subdivision is to be continuous or regular. These factors may overlap, and there may be other factors that are relevant in different circumstances. Your situation needs to be considered carefully on its own facts. What factors are not relevant? 13. Factors that are not likely to be relevant to whether an activity is continuous or regular include:  Commerciality. This means it does not matter whether a subdivision has a “commercial” flavour, or whether you are simply subdividing your own private land to downsize (although this might affect the cost, as mentioned earlier).  Activity before intention to sell. Anything you do as part of a subdivision project that was done without an intention to sell the resulting land is not relevant. This means if you build a house on a subdivided lot with the intention of living in it, but later change your mind and decide to sell, work done before you change your mind is not relevant.  Activity relating to land not sold. For the same reason, anything you do on land you do not sell is not relevant. If you create two lots, build two houses to live in one and sell the other, work relating to the house you live in and the land it is on is not relevant. What else do I need to consider? 14. If you a re already registered for GST, you need to consider whether the subdivision project is carried on as part of that activity. If it is, then any lots you sell will need to be included as part of your existing taxable activity. QB 24/04 FS 1 | 25 June 2024 Page 5 of 5 15. You also need to consider when you can register for GST. The initial or preparatory steps taken in a subdivision project can form part of the taxable activity, so you can register from early in the process. However, if the subdivision does not proceed as planned beyond preparatory steps, or it is found the subdivision project is not a taxable activity, your registration may be cancelled from when you first registered. What about income tax? 16. Regardless of whether you are carrying on a taxable activity, any land you sell may be subject to income tax. Please see the Inland Revenue website for information on when land sales may be taxable for income tax purposes.

1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 10/04 Shortfall penalty for evasion or a similar act – knowledge required and Interpretation Statement IS0062 Section 141E(1)(d) to (f) – shortfall penalty for evasion or similar act – Tax Administration Act 1994 All legislative references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994. Question 1. We have been asked whether paragraphs (d) to (f) of section 141E(1) require knowledge of the unlawfulness of the act in question. It has been suggested that the Interpretation Statement for the shortfall penalty for evasion or a similar act is potentially ambiguous on this point. Answer 2. Knowledge of the unlawfulness of the act is necessary for paragraphs (d) to (f) of section 141E(1) to apply. 3. The Commissioner accepts that the first sentence in paragraph 4.54 of the Interpretation Statement for the shortfall penalty for evasion or a similar act is potentially ambiguous when read in isolation. However, paragraph 4.71 of the Interpretation Statement and section 141E(1) make it clear that knowledge of the unlawfulness of the act is necessary for paragraphs (d) to (f) of section 141E(1) to apply. Background 4. The Commissioner issued the Interpretation Statement ‘Shortfall penalty—evasion’ (IS0062) in November 2006 and published it in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 11 (December 2006). The Interpretation Statement concerns the interpretation of section 141E(1). 5. Section 141E(1) currently states: (1) A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if, in taking a tax position, the taxpayer— (a) Evades the assessment or payment of tax by the taxpayer or another person under a tax law; or (b) Knowingly applies or permits the application of the amount of a deduction or withholding of tax made or deemed to be made under a tax law for any purpose other than in payment to the Commissioner; or (c) knowingly does not make a deduction, withholding of tax, or transfer of payroll donation required to be made by a tax law; or (d) Obtains a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the taxpayer is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment under a tax law; or (da) attempts to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the taxpayer is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment under a tax law; or 2 (e) Enables another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the other person is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment under a tax law; or (f) attempts to enable another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the other person is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment under a tax law— (referred to as evasion or a similar act). \[Emphasis added.\] 6. Minor amendments have been made to section 141E since the Interpretation Statement was issued. However, those amendments do not affect the analysis. 7. The provisions of paragraphs (d) to (f) are explicit that the relevant act must be done “knowing that \[the person\] is not lawfully entitled” to the refund or payment. 8. The Interpretation Statement discusses Case W3 (2003) 21 NZTC 11,014. In Case W3 Judge Barber states (at page 11,025) that “knowledge of the existence of the facts in question without knowledge of the unlawfulness of an act will be sufficient”. (See also CIR v Gordon (1989) 11 NZTC 6,082.) The Interpretation Statement then draws the following conclusions from Case W3 at paragraph 4.54: 4.54 Although Case W3 was on paragraph (b) of section 141E(1), the observations on “knowingly” are applicable to all the paragraphs of section 141E(1) which use that term. It can be seen that many of the points made are consistent with the discussion above on “evasion”, however, unlike evasion it does not require any “blameworthy” intent to breach a law that is either known or suspected to exist. “Knowingly”:  requires knowledge of the doing of the act (or of the omission) that amounts to a breach;  is a subjective test;  can be satisfied by recklessness, but  negligence or carelessness is insufficient to satisfy the test. \[Emphasis added\] 9. The first sentence in paragraph 4.54, when read in isolation, could be interpreted to mean that knowledge of only the existence of the facts described in paragraphs (d) to (f) of section 141E(1) is required. This sentence, along with the first bullet point of paragraph 1.5 of the Interpretation Statement, could be viewed as inconsistent with the legislative requirements of this section. 10. However, as outlined in paragraph 4.71 of the Interpretation Statement, the correct interpretation is that paragraphs (d) to (f) of section 141E(1) require a taxpayer to have knowledge of the unlawfulness of the particular act in question. Paragraph 4.71 of the Interpretation Statement states: 4.71 Paragraphs (d), (da), (e), and (f) relate to the obtaining of a refund or payment of tax, knowing that there is no entitlement to that refund or payment of tax. Paragraphs (d) and (da) provide that the penalty will apply whether or not the taxpayer is successful in obtaining the refund or payment of tax. Paragraphs (e) and (f) provide that the penalty will also apply to a person who enables or attempts to enable another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax. \[Emphasis added\] 11. Therefore, paragraph 4.71 of the Interpretation Statement makes it clear that knowledge of the unlawfulness of the act is necessary for paragraphs (d) to (f) of section 141E(1) to apply. 3 12. Further, nothing in paragraph (b) of section 141E(1) requires a taxpayer to know that they are acting unlawfully, which is why Judge Barber in Case W3 held that knowledge of the existence of the facts is sufficient. However, paragraphs (d) and (da) of section 141E(1) expressly require a taxpayer to know that they are not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment under a tax law. Similarly, paragraphs (e) and (f) of section 141E(1) expressly require a taxpayer to know that another person is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment of tax under a tax law. Therefore, section 141E(1) itself also makes it clear that knowledge of the unlawfulness of the act is necessary for paragraphs (d) to (f) of section 141E(1) to apply. 13. Note that this Question We’ve Been Asked considers only the requirements for paragraphs (d) to (f) of section 141E(1). Other paragraphs have different requirements, which are set out in the Interpretation Statement.
1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 12/12 Abusive tax position penalty and the anti-avoidance provision All legislative references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA 1994) unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about s 141D: abusive tax position. The item answers a question raised about Interpretation Statement IS0061: Shortfall penalty for taking an abusive tax position (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 1 (February 2006): 24). Question 1. Does the abusive tax position penalty under s 141D apply automatically where there is a “tax avoidance arrangement” under s BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (s BG 1)? If not, what differentiates a case where s BG 1 applies but the penalty does not? Answer 2. The abusive tax position penalty under s 141D does not apply automatically where there is a “tax avoidance arrangement”. This is because:  Section BG 1 requires the tax avoidance purpose or effect of the arrangement to be more than merely incidental. Section 141D requires the dominant purpose to be avoiding tax. Therefore, the tests in the two provisions are fundamentally different.  The intention expressed in the pre-legislative material was that the abusive tax position penalty would only apply to “abusive avoidance”.  The courts have identified that there is a different test under s 141D than under s BG 1. 3. To determine whether the abusive tax position penalty applies it is necessary to decide whether the dominant purpose of the arrangement is avoiding tax. In order to determine that, the tax purposes must be weighed against any other purposes of the arrangement (such as commercial or family purposes) with reference to the specific structure of the arrangement. The presence or absence of certain factors may be relevant in weighing the different purposes. The factors may include artificiality, contrivance, circularity of funding, concealment of information and non-availability of evidence, and spurious interpretations of tax laws. Explanation 4. Penalties can be imposed on taxpayers who take incorrect tax positions that result in tax shortfalls. The level of the penalty is intended to reflect the seriousness of the breach. Section 141D applies a 100% penalty where a taxpayer has taken an abusive tax position. 2 Does the abusive tax position penalty apply automatically where there is a “tax avoidance arrangement”? 5. The abusive tax position penalty under s 141D does not apply automatically where there is a “tax avoidance arrangement” under s BG 1 of the ITA 2007 because:  there are different tests in the different provisions,  the legislative intent was that the penalty would only apply to abusive tax avoidance, and  the courts have recognised the need for a dominant purpose of avoiding tax for an abusive tax position penalty to apply. There are different tests in the different provisions Section 141D 6. Section 141D(7) defines an “abusive tax position” as follows: (7) For the purposes of this Part and section 177C, an abusive tax position means a tax position that,— (a) Is an unacceptable tax position at the time at which the tax position is taken; and (b) Viewed objectively, the taxpayer takes— (i) In respect, or as a consequence, of an arrangement that is entered into with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, whether directly or indirectly; or (ii) Where the tax position does not relate to an arrangement described in subparagraph (i), with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, whether directly or indirectly. 7. As a result, there are two key requirements for s 141D to apply. Firstly, under s 141D(7)(a) the tax position must be an “unacceptable tax position”. A tax position is an unacceptable tax position if, viewed objectively, the tax position fails to meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct: s 141B(1). The unacceptable tax position requirement is discussed in more detail in IS0055: Shortfall penalty – unacceptable interpretation and unacceptable tax position (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 9 (November 2005): 26). 8. Secondly, under s 141D(7)(b) there must be a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. Section 141D(7)(b) provides that an abusive tax position will occur in two situations. The first situation is where the taxpayer takes the tax position in respect of an arrangement with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax: s 141D(7)(b)(i). The second situation is where there is no such arrangement, and the taxpayer has taken the tax position with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax: s 141D(7)(b)(ii). Both of the situations require a “dominant purpose of avoiding tax”. 9. This item only discusses the issue of whether the penalty applies where there is a tax avoidance arrangement. This item, therefore, is limited to situations where there is an arrangement under s 141D(7)(b)(i) (and does not discuss s 141D(7)(b)(ii)). The courts have held that it is the purpose of the arrangement that is relevant under s 141D(7)(b)(i): Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 115, (2009) 24 NZTC 23,188 at \[207\]. Under s 141D(7)(b)(i) 3 “purpose” does not involve any focus on the motives or intentions of the taxpayer. 10. The term “dominant purpose” is not defined in the TAA 1994. The Oxford English Dictionary (online ed updated March 2012, 2nd edition, Oxford University Press, 1989, accessed 28 August 2012) defines “dominant” as follows: 1. governing, commanding; most influential 11. The same dictionary defines “purpose” as follows: 1. a. That which a person sets out to do or attain; an object in view; a determined intention or aim. 2. The reason for which something is done or made, or for which it exists; the result or effect intended or sought; the end to which an object or action is directed; aim. 12. There are aspects of the ordinary meaning of “purpose” that imply an element of motive or intention. However, the courts have held that the “purpose or effect” of an arrangement in the tax avoidance context is determined objectively: Newton v FC of T \[1958\] AC 450 (PC), Ashton & Anor v CIR (1975) 2 NZTC 61,030 (PC) and Glenharrow Holdings Ltd v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 116, (2009) 24 NZTC 23,236 at \[38\]. “Purpose”, in the context of tax avoidance, means the intended effect the arrangement seeks to achieve and not the motive of the parties, and “effect” means the end accomplished or achieved by the arrangement. 13. The Court of Appeal discussed the meaning of “dominant purpose” in CIR v National Distributors Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,346. Richardson J stated at 6,350: Adoption of a dominant purpose test in relation to the particular property purchased allows a sensible focus as a practical matter on what was truly important to the taxpayer at the time of acquisition. \[Emphasis added\] 14. While the case discusses “dominant purpose” in the context of a provision that refers to the subjective purpose of a taxpayer, the reference to what is “truly important” is considered to be relevant in the current context. 15. Judge Barber commented on the dominant purpose requirement in s 141D in Case Z1 (2009) 24 NZTC 14,001 as follows at \[119\]: I also find that the disputant entered into the arrangement with the dominant purpose of avoiding tax - refer s.141D(7). The arrangement could not be properly explained by any charitable purpose. The prime objective purpose was to avoid tax (and tax was avoided). 16. Judge Barber, therefore, referred to the dominant purpose as the “prime objective purpose”. 17. In Case Y18 (2008) 23 NZTC 13,180, Judge Barber also discussed “dominant purpose” in s 141D. Judge Barber described “dominant purpose” as an objective test, but arguably relied on subjective factors in applying the test to the facts at issue. As a result, the application of the test to the facts is arguably inconsistent with Ben Nevis. However, the discussion of “dominant purpose” is consistent with the other cases. Judge Barber stated at \[73\]: The additional requirement for s 141D to apply, if s 141B already applies, is that, viewed objectively, the dominant purpose of entering into the arrangement was avoiding tax. In FCT v Spotless Services Ltd & Anor (1996) 186 CLR 404 (HCA), the High Court of Australia considered the meaning of the “dominant purpose” of enabling a taxpayer to obtain a “tax benefit”. It held that: 4 “In its ordinary meaning, dominant indicates that purpose which was the ruling, prevailing, or most influential purpose.” 18. Judge Barber referred to Spotless Services in interpreting “dominant purpose” in s 141D. The High Court of Australia in Spotless Services considered the meaning of “dominant purpose” to be the ruling, prevailing, or most influential purpose. 19. It is considered, therefore, that the purpose is the result or effect intended or sought. The “dominant purpose” is the ruling, prevailing, governing, commanding or most influential or important purpose. The listed terms are synonyms. Section BG 20. In contrast, the general anti-avoidance provision applies if the tax avoidance purpose or effect of an arrangement is not merely incidental: s YA 1 “tax avoidance arrangement” of the Income Tax Act 2007. The definition of “tax avoidance arrangement” states that there can be one or more purposes or effects of the arrangement. The tax avoidance purpose or effect does not need to be the only or dominant purpose or effect. Instead, the tax avoidance purpose or effect needs to be only more than merely incidental. A merely incidental tax avoidance purpose or effect is something which “naturally attaches or is subordinate or subsidiary to a concurrent legitimate purpose or effect, whether of a commercial or family nature”: Westpac Banking Corporation v CIR (2009) 24 NZTC 23,834 (HC) at \[206\]. For a tax avoidance purpose to be merely incidental, it must be necessarily linked, without contrivance, to a non-tax purpose or effect. In that circumstance, the tax avoidance purpose or effect would be regarded objectively as a natural concomitant to the non-tax purpose or effect: CIR v Challenge Corporation Ltd (1986) 8 NZTC 5,001 (CA) at 5,005. Difference between the two tests 21. The “more than merely incidental purpose” requirement for s BG 1, therefore, is fundamentally different from the “dominant purpose” requirement in s 141D. The “dominant purpose” test determines which is the most important or influential purpose. The “merely incidental” test determines whether the relevant purpose naturally attaches to some other purpose or effect. Legislative intent was that penalty would only apply to abusive avoidance 22. Section 141D must be interpreted consistently with its immediate and general context: Commerce Commission v Fonterra Co-Operative Group Ltd \[2007\] NZSC 36 (SC). Relevantly, there is a graduated scale of penalties that apply to taxpayers who take tax positions that result in tax shortfalls. The shortfall penalties apply to tax positions that relate to tax avoidance arrangements and tax positions that breach other provisions. The range of possible penalties for tax avoidance arrangements is consistent with s 141D not applying automatically. In other words, another penalty (or no penalty) might apply to a tax position in respect of a tax avoidance arrangement. 23. The intention expressed in the pre-legislative material was that the abusive tax position penalty would only apply to “abusive avoidance”. The penalty was not intended to apply to all tax avoidance arrangements. The abusive tax position penalty was introduced as part of the penalties regime in the Tax Administration Amendment Act (No 2) 1996. This amending Act had previously been part of the Taxpayer Compliance, Penalties, and Disputes Resolution Bill 1995. There were two discussion documents before the Bi ll. The first discussion document, Taxpayer Compliance, Standards and Penalties (Government discussion 5 document, Legislative Affairs, Inland Revenue, August 1994), discussed the penalty as follows: 5.44 It will more clearly define the situations in which a penalty should be imposed. It will focus the penalty provisions on blatant and serious tax avoidance activity while recognising that not all tax avoidance necessarily merits a significant penalty. 24. The second discussion document, Taxpayer Compliance, Standards and Penalties 2: Detailed proposals and draft legislation (Government discussion document, Legislative Affairs, Inland Revenue, April 1995 (the Second Discussion Document), stated: 7.3 The earlier discussion document proposed a special penalty aimed at a narrow band of tax avoidance behaviour which was considered abusive. “Abusive avoidance” was considered to occur where arrangements had as their principal purpose the gaining of a tax advantage and the taxpayer’s interpretation was not “more likely than not” to be correct. Such arrangements would be defined by characteristics such as artificiality, contrivance and lack of commerciality. They might also involve concealment of information. ... 7.8 If a taxpayer does not have a reasonably arguable position a second test will be applied to determine whether a tax position taken is “abusive”. The second test is whether the dominant purpose of the arrangement was to avoid tax. The purpose will be determined by an objective consideration of the arrangement. ... 7.12 It is intended that the penalty for abusive arrangements apply not only in situations where a general or specific anti-avoidance provision is invoked, but also where other provisions have been applied. This recognises that the need to rely on an anti- avoidance provision does not necessarily indicate that the arrangement or tax position in question is inherently more deserving of a high penalty than are abusive interpretations of other provisions of the Acts. 25. The intention, therefore, was that the abusive tax position penalty would only apply to “abusive avoidance”. In other words, the penalty was not intended to apply to all tax avoidance arrangements. Courts have recognised the need for a dominant purpose of avoiding tax 26. There has been some uncertainty from various commentators about whether the approach adopted by the courts differs from the approach discussed above. Specifically, the various commentators have argued the approach adopted in Ben Nevis implies the abusive tax position penalty applies automatically if there is a tax avoidance arrangement. 27. Ben Nevis was called Accent Management v CIR in the High Court ((2005) 22 NZTC 19,027) and the Court of Appeal (\[2007\] NZCA 230, (2007) 23 NZTC 21,323). In the High Court, Venning J held the arrangement was a tax avoidance arrangement under s BG 1. However, Venning J held a tax avoidance arrangement was not a sufficient condition for the assessment of an abusive tax position penalty. Venning J emphasised the need for a dominant purpose of avoiding tax for an abusive tax position penalty to apply. On the facts, Venning J held the dominant purpose of the arrangement “was undoubtedly to achieve the taxation benefits of the arrangement” (at \[370\]). Venning J concluded, therefore, the abusive tax position penalty applied. On appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld the findings of the High Court. 28. Tipping, McGrath and Gault JJ delivered the majority judgment of the Supreme Court in Ben Nevis. The majority started by discussing the overall context of the penalty regime at \[180\]. This shows the majority considered it necessary to understand the context before looking at the specific requirements of the penalty. 6 This in turn suggests the majority did not consider the penalty automatically applied because there was a tax avoidance arrangement. 29. The majority discussed the dominant purpose test as follows at \[176\]: ... the tax position must be one that, viewed objectively, is taken by the taxpayer in respect, or as a consequence, of an arrangement that is entered into with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, whether directly or indirectly. Alternatively, where there is no arrangement, the tax position itself must be taken by the taxpayer for that dominant purpose. 30. The majority then discussed the requirements of the purpose test at \[205\]-\[208\]. The discussion focused on whether it was the taxpayer’s or the arrangement’s purpose that needed to be considered. The Supreme Court concluded it was the purpose of the arrangement that was relevant under s 141D(7)(b)(i). The differences between the purpose requirement under the anti-avoidance provision and the abusive tax position penalty were not the issue. As noted above, the High Court and the Court of Appeal (in the decisions cited as Accent Management) concluded the Trinity scheme had the dominant purpose of avoiding tax. The fact the majority of the Supreme Court did not comment on this factual finding does not mean the court considered the issue to be answered by the existence of a tax avoidance arrangement. 31. Various other cases have applied the abusive tax position penalty. Several cases have not analysed the issue discussed above but have concluded that the penalty applied on the facts: Alesco New Zealand Ltd v CIR (2011) 25 NZTC ¶20-099 (HC), Krukziener v CIR (2010) 24 NZTC 24,563 (HC), Case Z23 (2010) 24 NZTC 14,334, Case Z19 (2009) 24 NZTC 14,217, Case X25 (2006) 22 NZTC 12,303, CIR v Campbell Investments (2004) 21 NZTC 18,559 (HC) and Erris Promotions Ltd v CIR (2003) 21 NZTC 18,330 (HC). The cases have generally referred to the relevant dominant purpose. Judge Barber has more fully discussed s 141D in two Taxation Review Authority decisions: Case Y18 (2008) 23 NZTC 13,180 and Case Z1 (2009) 24 NZTC 14,001. In both cases Judge Barber emphasised the need for there to be a dominant purpose of avoiding tax for s 141D to apply. Judge Barber also noted the need for there to be a dominant purpose of avoiding tax for the penalty to apply in Case 11/2011 (2011) 25 NZTC ¶1-011. In Case 11/2011, Judge Barber held the dominant purpose of the relevant arrangement was avoiding tax but there was not an unacceptable tax position. 32. It is considered the courts have recognised the need for a dominant purpose of avoiding tax for an abusive tax position penalty to apply. The courts have recognised that the abusive tax position penalty does not apply automatically if there is a tax avoidance arrangement. Summary 33. In summary, the abusive tax position penalty under s 141D does not apply automatically where there is a “tax avoidance arrangement” under s BG 1. To determine whether the abusive tax position penalty applies it is necessary to decide whether the dominant purpose of the arrangement is avoiding tax. What differentiates a case where s BG 1 applies but the penalty does not? 34. The second question this item answers is what differentiates a case where s BG 1 applies but the penalty does not. This part, therefore, describes how to determine when the abusive tax position penalty will apply where there is a tax avoidance arrangement under s BG 1. 7 Key difference 35. As determined above, there is a key difference between the circumstances where s BG 1 applies and those where the abusive tax position penalty applies. The difference is that the abusive tax position penalty only applies where the dominant purpose is avoiding tax. If there is an arrangement, the abusive tax position penalty only applies where the dominant purpose of the arrangement is avoiding tax. As noted above at \[30\], under s 141D(7)(b)(i) “purpose” does not mean the motives or intentions of the taxpayer: Ben Nevis at \[207\], Erris Promotions at \[374\]. 36. To work out whether an arrangement has a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, the purposes of the arrangement will need to be identified and weighed. If the only purpose of the arrangement is avoiding tax then that will be the dominant purpose. If there are other purposes, these will need to be weighed against the purpose of avoiding tax to see which, if any, is dominant. 37. Purposes are identified and weighed in the context of the specific structure of the arrangement. As the test is to establish the dominant purpose of the arrangement, purposes will be relevant if they explain the specific structure of the arrangement. The fact that non-tax purposes may be able to be achieved by other structures does not in itself make them irrelevant. The point is: can the particular way the arrangement has been put together be explained by a non-tax purpose or purposes? If the specific features of the arrangement are mainly explicable by the tax purposes, then this would suggest that the dominant purpose is avoiding tax. If the specific features of the arrangement are mainly explicable by the non-tax purposes, then this would support the conclusion that the dominant purpose of the arrangement is not avoiding tax. If none of the purposes (tax or non-tax) are dominant, then the penalty will also not apply. Factual indicators 38. A number of possible factual indicators are likely to be relevant in determining whether the dominant purpose of the arrangement is avoiding tax. The Second Discussion Document and Taxpayer Compliance, Penalties, and Disputes Resolution Bill 1995: Commentary on the Bill (Legislative Affairs, Inland Revenue, September 1995) listed artificiality, contrivance, circularity of funding, concealment of information and non-availability of evidence, and spurious interpretations of tax laws as relevant indicators. However, the indicators were not included in the legislation. 39. The listed factors may be the same factors that indicate there is a tax avoidance arrangement. However, the factors have to be considered again in the context of the different standard in the dominant purpose test in s 141D. In other words, it is necessary to consider whether the factors support the conclusion that the dominant purpose of the arrangement was avoiding tax. 40. The Second Discussion Document stated relevantly: 7.10 The draft legislation does not include a list of indicators of dominant purpose. Although such a list could highlight some of the factors to be considered in determining whether a penalty should be applied for abusive avoidance, rather than lack of a reasonably arguable position, the list could not be exhaustive, and the absence or inclusion of one factor might take on a significance which is unintended. 41. The reason the factors were not included in the legislation, therefore, was to prevent the absence of any factor having the unintended consequence of the penalty not applying. As discussed above, the test is whether the dominant 8 purpose is avoiding tax. It is considered, therefore, that the absence of any of the factors will not indicate that the penalty does not apply. Further, the penalty may still apply if none of the listed factors are present. For example, there may be other factors (such as inflated values or a lack of economic substance) that may indicate that the dominant purpose of the arrangement is avoiding tax. Cases 42. The cases have weighed the tax purposes of the relevant arrangements against the non-tax purposes: Accent Management (HC) at \[370\] (upheld in Ben Nevis), Case Z23 at \[125\], Krukziener at \[71\]. The relevant cases have also looked at various indicators to help to determine if the dominant purpose of an arrangement is avoiding tax. For example, the courts have looked at the substance of the arrangement, the presence of artificiality and the extent to which the economic position of the person was altered by entry into the arrangement: Ronald Young J in Erris Promotions at \[375\] – \[376\], Wild J in Campbell Investments Ltd at \[51\] and Heath J in Alesco at \[178\] – \[179\]. 43. The Commissioner has not imposed an abusive tax position penalty in respect of all tax avoidance arrangements. In all the cases where the penalty was at issue and the relevant arrangements were held to give rise to unacceptable tax positions, the courts found that each of the arrangements had a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. There are no cases, therefore, that have found that the tax avoidance purpose or effect of the arrangement was more than merely incidental under s BG 1 but the arrangement’s purpose of avoiding tax was not dominant under s 141D. As a result, the courts have provided no guidance as to when a tax avoidance arrangement could be said to not have a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. Summary 44. There is a key difference between the circumstances where s BG 1 applies and those where the penalty applies. Section BG 1 requires the tax avoidance purpose or effect of the arrangement to be more than merely incidental. In contrast, s 141D applies where there is a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. The key difference, therefore, is the requirement for the arrangement to have a dominant purpose of avoiding tax for s 141D to apply. 45. To determine whether the dominant purpose of the arrangement is avoiding tax, the tax purposes must be weighed against any non-tax purposes with reference to the specific structure used. The pre-legislative material suggests that indicators of a dominant purpose of avoiding tax may include artificiality, contrivance, circularity of funding, concealment of information and non- availability of evidence, and spurious interpretations of tax laws. The list is not exhaustive. These indicators were not specifically included in the legislation. However, the courts have held that the factors are relevant in helping to weigh the different purposes to determine whether the dominant purpose of an arrangement is avoiding tax. The factors are not independent indicators that the penalty applies. 9 References Related rulings/statements IS0055: Shortfall penalty – unacceptable interpretation and unacceptable tax position (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 9 (November 2005): 26) IS0061: Shortfall penalty for taking an abusive tax position (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 1 (February 2006): 24) Subject references Avoiding tax Dominant purpose Legislative references Section 141D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Case references Accent Management Ltd v CIR (2005) 22 NZTC 19,027 (HC) Accent Management Ltd v CIR \[2007\] NZCA 230, (2007) 23 NZTC 21,323 Alesco New Zealand Ltd v CIR (2011) 25 NZTC ¶20-099 (HC) Ashton & Anor v CIR (1975) 2 NZTC 61,030 (PC) Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 115, (2009) 24 NZTC 23,188 Case X25 (2006) 22 NZTC 12,303 Case Y18 (2008) 23 NZTC 13,180 Case Z1 (2009) 24 NZTC 14,001 Case Z19 (2009) 24 NZTC 14,217 Case Z23 (2010) 24 NZTC 14,334 Case 11/2011 (2011) 25 NZTC ¶1-011 CIR v Campbell Investments (2004) 21 NZTC 18,559 (HC) CIR v Challenge Corporation Limited (1986) 8 NZTC 5,001 (CA) CIR v National Distributors Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,346 (CA) Commerce Commission v Fonterra Co-Operative Group Ltd \[2007\] NZSC 36 (SC) Erris Promotions Ltd v CIR (2003) 21 NZTC 18,330 (HC) FCT v Spotless Services Limited & Anor 96 ATC 5,201 Glenharrow Holdings Ltd v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 116, (2009) 24 NZTC 23,236 Krukziener v CIR (2010) 24 NZTC 24,563 Newton v FC of T \[1958\] AC 450 (PC) Westpac Banking Corporation v CIR (2009) 24 NZTC 23,834 (HC) Other references Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties (Government discussion document, Legislative Affairs, Inland Revenue, August 1994) Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties 2: Detailed proposals and draft legislation (Government discussion document, Legislative Affairs, Inland Revenue, April 1995) Taxpayer Compliance, Penalties, and Disputes Resolution Bill 1995: Commentary on the Bill (Legislative Affairs, Inland Revenue, September 1995)
1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 12/13 INCOME TAX — IS A TAX CREDIT ALLOWED FOR STATE INCOME TAX PAID IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA? All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about ss LJ 1, LJ 2, LJ 3, LJ 4, LJ 5, LK 1 and YA 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Question 1. Is a tax credit allowed for state income tax paid in the United States of America (United States)? Answer 2. Subpart LJ allows a tax credit for state income tax paid on United States- sourced income, provided the state income tax is of substantially the same nature as New Zealand income tax. 3. The tax credit allowed cannot be more than the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on the United States-sourced income. 4. The Double Taxation Relief (United States of America) Order 1983 (the DTA) does not apply. This is because state income taxes are not covered by the DTA. Explanation Background 5. We have been asked to clarify whether a tax credit is allowed for state income tax paid in the United States. The DTA refers to federal income tax but does not mention state income taxes. Some taxpayers have taken this to mean that a tax credit is not allowed for state income tax paid in the United States. Discussion 6. A New Zealand resident who derives foreign-sourced income is liable for New Zealand income tax on that income. However, the New Zealand resident may be entitled to a tax credit for foreign income tax paid on that income. Double Taxation Relief (United States of America) Order 1983 7. The DTA does not apply. This is because state income taxes are not covered by the DTA. However, the fact that the DTA does not cover state income taxes is irrelevant. Relief is available under subpart LJ. Application of subpart LJ 8. Tax credit relief is available under subpart LJ. Section LJ 1(2) states: Limited application of rules (2) The rules in this subpart apply only when— (a) a person resident in New Zealand derives assessable income sourced from outside New Zealand; and (b) foreign income tax is not paid in a country or territory listed in schedule 27 (Countries and types of income with unrecognised tax) to the extent to which the foreign income tax is paid on the types of income listed in the schedule. 9. Therefore, to claim a tax credit a person must:  be resident in New Zealand for income tax purposes (s YD 1 determines residency for natural persons and s YD 2 determines residency for companies);  have derived assessable income that is not sourced in New Zealand (s YD 4 lists the classes of income treated as having a New Zealand source); and  have paid foreign income tax on the assessable income. 10. Section LJ 1(2)(b) states that subpart LJ will not apply if foreign income tax is paid in a country or territory listed in sch 27. There are currently no countries or territories listed in sch 27, so this limitation has no effect. A person who meets the criteria of s LJ 1(2) is entitled to a tax credit for an amount of foreign income tax paid on the foreign-sourced income (s LJ 2(1)). 11. Section LJ 3 defines “foreign income tax” to mean “an amount of income tax of a foreign country”. The meaning of “income tax” in subpart LJ is varied by s YA 2(5): Tax of other countries (5) The term income tax, when specifically used in relation to tax of another country, whether imposed by a central, state, or local government,— (a) means a tax of substantially the same nature as income tax imposed under section BB 1 (Imposition of income tax); and (b) includes a tax, imposed as a collection mechanism for the foreign tax, that is of substantially the same nature as provisional tax, pay-as-you-earn (PAYE), resident withholding tax (RWT), or non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). 12. The meaning of “income tax” is therefore varied to include tax imposed by a central, state or local government, provided the tax is of substantially the same nature as income tax imposed under s BB 1; or a tax imposed as a collection mechanism for the foreign tax that is of substantially the same nature as provisional tax, pay-as-you-earn, resident withholding tax or non- resident withholding tax. 13. In summary, if a person satisfies the requirements of s LJ 1(2), then they are entitled to a tax credit or credits for an amount of “foreign income tax” paid under s LJ 2(1). (The number of credits will depend on the number of foreign countries and the sources or the nature of the income derived (ss LJ 4 and LJ 5).) The meaning of “income tax” in this context is modified by s YA 2(5) to mean a tax (whether imposed by a central, state or local government) that is of “substantially the same nature” as income tax. 14. Section LJ 2(2) restricts the amount of the tax credit. The tax credit allowed must not be more than the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on that foreign-sourced income, as calculated under s LJ 5. United States state income taxes 15. Most states in the United States impose a state income tax. The Commissioner’s view is that, for the most part, state income taxes will be of substantially the same nature as income tax imposed under s BB 1. 16. However, it cannot be assumed that all state income taxes are the same. Each state income tax needs to be assessed individually each tax year to determine whether it is of substantially the same nature as New Zealand income tax. The name or title of the tax is not determinative. The characteristics of the tax will need to be evaluated and compared with New Zealand income tax to establish whether it is of substantially the same nature. Tax credits relating to attributed controlled foreign company income 17. Section LK 1(1) allows a tax credit for tax paid or payable on an amount of attributed controlled foreign company income. Tax paid or payable includes “foreign income tax”. The s LJ 3 definition of “foreign income tax” also applies to subpart LK, as does s YA 2(5). To this extent, the conclusions in this item regarding s YA 2(5) apply equally to subpart LK. Conclusion 18. A tax credit for United States state income tax is allowed under subpart LJ provided the state income tax is a tax of substantially the same nature as New Zealand income tax. 19. The tax credit allowed under s LJ 2(2) cannot be more than the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on the United States-sourced income, as calculated under s LJ 5. 20. The DTA does not apply. This is because state income taxes are not covered by the DTA. However, the fact that the DTA does not cover state taxes is irrelevant.

QB 13/01: DEPRECIATION OF COMMERCIAL FIT-OUT Question Following changes in the depreciation rules for buildings, the Commissioner has been asked whether a taxpayer can re-characterise a part of a commercial building into components of commercial fit-out in order to claim depreciation on those items when those items had not been identified as separate depreciable property at the time the taxpayer acquired the property. Answer The Commissioner considers that in circumstances where taxpayers have depreciated items of commercial fit-out that were acquired with a building, as part of that building, section DB 65 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“the Act”) sets out the way these items of commercial fit-out may continue to be depreciated. Because of this it is not possible to re-characterise part of a commercial building into components of commercial fit-out. In circumstances where taxpayers have at all times depreciated items of commercial fit- out that was acquired with a building separately from the building, these items of commercial fit-out may continue to be depreciated using the most appropriate rate for the items. Where these separately identified items of commercial fit-out have historically not been depreciated using the depreciation rate most appropriate to that item, the Commissioner will consider amending the appropriate assessments, using the criteria set out in SPS 07/03 Requests to amend assessments. Explanation Background With effect from the 2011/12 income year the depreciation rate for buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more has been set at 0%. The 0% rate applies to all buildings regardless of when they were acquired. The definition of “building” was amended and a definition of “commercial fit-out” was introduced to clarify that commercial fit-out would continue to be depreciable. In the past some commercial building owners had not been depreciating the building fit- out components separately from the building. That is, the building and the fit-out has been identified as a single asset at the time of acquisition and depreciation deductions have been claimed based on the total cost of the building, without any fit-out costs being separately identified. For these taxpayers, because the depreciation rate for buildings is reduced to 0%, this rate would also apply to any fit-out that has been treated as part of the building. Inland Revenue has recently received enquiries from taxpayers seeking to retrospectively re-characterise a part of the building into various items of commercial fit- out in order to claim depreciation deductions on those items. Any retrospective re- characterisation and depreciation of fit-out would require the Commissioner to exercise her discretion under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“section 113”) to adjust the depreciation deductions in previous assessments. Section DB 65 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to be applied in these circumstances In order to claim a depreciation deduction on an item of depreciable property, a taxpayer is required to identify what the depreciable property is. In their issues paper Post- budget depreciation issues of December 2010 (“the issues paper”), officials noted that, for a commercial building, a taxpayer may have chosen to identify and depreciate the building as one single item of depreciable property and that this was likely to have occurred where taxpayers had sought to minimise tax compliance costs. Alternatively, they may have identified items of fit-out and depreciated those items separately from the cost of the building. To acknowledge that some taxpayers may not have separately identified items of commercial fit-out, section DB 65 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“section DB 65”) was enacted as a transitional rule so that these taxpayers can depreciate commercial fit-out, despite not having done so separately in the past. Section DB 65 sets specific limits for dealing with “commercial fit-out”, which is a widely defined term extending to any non-structural item “attached to a building”. The issues paper acknowledges that where an item of commercial fit-out has been acquired at the same time as the building and has always been depreciated as part of the commercial building, there may have been other ways in which taxpayers could separate out commercial fit-out from the cost of the building. However, the issues paper makes it clear that instead of allowing this to be done section DB 65 sets out the only way in which these items may now continue to be depreciated. Section DB 65 allows a taxpayer to depreciate a portion of the building’s tax book value as a pool of fit-out. This new deduction provision permits an annual deduction based on a one-off adjustment calculation that is available from the 2011/12 income year. To qualify for the section DB 65 allowance, the taxpayer must:  Own a commercial building that has a depreciation rate of 0% (i.e. the building has an EUL of 50 years or more);  The building was acquired in the 2010/11 or earlier income year;  The building had been depreciated in the 2010/11 income year and the building has not been disposed of since; and  The commercial fit-out had not been separately depreciated if the fit-out was acquired at the same time as the building. The “starting pool” is 15% of the building’s adjusted tax value as at the end of the 2010/11 income year. This starting pool is reduced by the adjusted tax value of all items of commercial fit-out that had been separately depreciated (i.e. the items of commercial fit-out that were acquired after the building was acquired, or items of commercial fit-out acquired as part of the building where the taxpayer has chosen to treat these as separate items of depreciable property). The “starting pool” is depreciated at a rate of 2% in the 2011/12 and later income years. No loss or recovery rules apply to the value of the pool when the building or fit-out is disposed of. A practical example of how section DB 65 is applied was provided in a Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) item, Clarifying that certain building fit-out is depreciable property, published in TIB Vol 23, No 1 (Feb 2011). The example is reproduced here: Company ABC acquired a warehouse on 1 April 1999 for $1 million. Items of commercial fit-out within the building were not separately identified and depreciated at the time the building was acquired. Twelve months later a refurbishment of the warehouse was completed. The refurbishment was itemised and depreciation was applied to the various items of commercial fit-out. At the end of the 2010-11 income year the adjusted tax book value of the warehouse is $640,000 and the adjusted tax book value of the associated commercial fit-out is $64,000. The starting pool value is:  (15% x 640,000) – 64,000 = $32,000 The annual deduction, assuming that the building is held for the 2011-12 income year is:  $32,000 x 2% x 12/12 = $640 Treatment of separately depreciated commercial fit-out As stated previously, the owner of a commercial building can identify items of fit-out and depreciate those items separately from the cost of the building. In this circumstance commercial building owners have the option of depreciating various items of building fit- out under the asset category “Building fit-out (When in books separately from building cost)” in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates. This asset category lists the rates and the items in a building that are commonly found in a commercial building. Section DB 65 does not apply in circumstances where commercial fit-out has always been depreciated separately from the building and taxpayers are therefore able to continue to depreciate building fit-out separately using the most appropriate depreciation rate for that fit-out. Where a taxpayer has previously used an incorrect depreciation rate or asset class to depreciate commercial fit-out that taxpayer is able to request that the Commissioner’s discretion under section 113 be exercised to issue an amended assessment that corrects the error. In exercising this discretion, the Commissioner will follow the criteria set out in SPS 07/03 Requests to amend assessments. This states that the Commissioner’s discretion will only be exercised to correct genuine errors. With respect to the depreciation of separately identified commercial fit-out, the Commissioner accepts that a genuine error will have occurred when a taxpayer has not used the most appropriate depreciation rate or asset class for that fit-out. By contrast, if taxpayers choose to take particular tax positions under tax laws where legitimate alternatives had been available and later regret that choice, no error has occurred and the Commissioner’s discretion will not be exercised. Voluntary disclosure Taxpayers who have filed a tax return that incorrectly re-characterises a commercial building into components of commercial fit-out, after the building has been depreciated as one single asset previously, should make a voluntary disclosure to the Commissioner and new assessments will be issued.
1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 13/02 INCOME TAX – DETERMINING THE “SUBSCRIPTIONS” AMOUNT FOR AN AMALGAMATED COMPANY UNDER THE AVAILABLE SUBSCRIBED CAPITAL RULES All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about ss CD 43(2)(b) and CD 43(15). Question 1. We have been asked whether the “subscriptions” amount in the available subscribed capital (ASC) formula in s CD 43 excludes consideration received for shares issued by an amalgamated company between 30 June 1994 and the date of the amalgamation through the operation of s CD 43(15)(a)(iii). Answer 2. The consideration received for shares issued by an amalgamated company between 30 June 1994 and the date of the amalgamation is not excluded from the amalgamated company’s subscriptions amount by s CD 43(15)(a)(iii). 3. Section CD 43(15)(a)(iii) operates to prevent the double-counting of an amalgamated company’s “subscriptions”. For an amalgamated company, as with any other company, it is necessary to determine the consideration received for shares issued under s CD 43(2)(b). Section CD 43(15) provides that the ASC of an amalgamated company “includes” the ASC of all amalgamating companies (except the amalgamated company under s CD 43(15)(a)(iii)). Therefore, s CD 43(15) adds an additional amount to the “subscriptions” amount of an amalgamated company determined under s CD 43(2)(b). 4. The purpose of the ASC formula is to determine the amount that shareholders have paid into a company as capital when subscribing for shares. The ASC of a company can be returned to shareholders tax-free in certain circumstances rather than being treated as a dividend. Explanation 5. This Question We’ve Been Asked clarifies the effect of s CD 43(15)(a)(iii). It has been suggested that this subparagraph might exclude the ASC of the amalgamated company from being taken into account as “subscriptions” in the ASC formula. Section CD 43(2)(b) 6. Subsections (1) and (2)(b) of s CD 43 provide: CD 43 Available subscribed capital (ASC) amount Formula for calculating amount of available subscribed capital (1) For a share (the share) in a company at any relevant time (the calculation time), the amount of available subscribed capital is calculated using the formula— 1 July 1994 balance + subscriptions – returns – look-through company returns. Definition of items in formula (2) In the formula in subsection (1),— ... (b) subscriptions, subject to subsections (6) to (21), is the total amount of consideration that the company received, after 30 June 1994 and before the 2 calculation time, for the issue of shares of the same class (the class) as the share, ignoring section HB 1 (Look-through companies are transparent): 7. Section CD 43(2)(b) provides that the subscriptions amount of a company is the total amount of consideration that the company received after 30 June 1994 and before the calculation time for the issue of shares of the same class. 8. Section CD 43(2)(b) is subject to s CD 43(15) when determining the ASC of an amalgamated company. The phrase “subject to” indicates that one provision qualifies, modifies or changes another. The phrase also indicates which provision is to prevail in the event of a conflict: C & J Clark Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioner \[1973\] 1 WLR 905; Harding v Coburn \[1976\] 2 NZLR 577; Re Tasman Pacific Airlines of NZ Ltd (in rec & liq) \[2002\] 1 NZLR 688; JF Burrows and RI Carter, Statute Law in New Zealand (4th edition, LexisNexis, Wellington, 2009) at p 440. In addition, the courts will generally favour an interpretation of the phrase “subject to” that is consistent with the scheme and purpose of the Act: Walker v Walker \[1983\] NZLR 560. Section CD 43(15) 9. Section CD 43(15)(a)(i) to (iii) provides: Subscriptions amount: amalgamated company (15) The subscriptions amount for a company that is an amalgamated company resulting from an amalgamation— (a) includes an amount, as if it were consideration received at the time of the amalgamation for the issue of the amalgamated company’s shares, equal to the available subscribed capital, at the time of the amalgamation, of all shares in the amalgamating companies that are— (i) of an equivalent class to the class; and (ii) not held directly or indirectly by an amalgamating company; and (iii) not shares in the amalgamated company: 10. Section CD 43(15) applies to a company that is an amalgamated company. All companies involved in an amalgamation are amalgamating companies. A company that exists before an amalgamation and continues as the amalgamated company is both an “amalgamated company” and an “amalgamating company”. 11. Section CD 43(15) includes an amount (as if it were consideration received at the time of the amalgamation for the issue of the amalgamated company’s shares) equal to the ASC of all shares in the amalgamating companies. This amount, however, does not include the ASC on shares in the amalgamated company by virtue of s CD 43(15)(a)(iii). A definition that uses the word “includes” is generally understood to extend the meaning of the term defined beyond that which it would normally cover: Dilworth v Commissioner of Stamps \[1899\] AC 99; CIR v Albany Warehouse Ltd (2009) 24 NZTC 23,532, at \[37\]. In this situation, the term “includes” operates to add an additional amount to the “subscriptions” amount in s CD 43(2)(b) for an amalgamated company. 12. By reading subss (2)(b) and (15) of s CD 43 together, it can be seen that the ASC of an amalgamated company equals the amount calculated under s CD 43(2)(b) plus the ASC of all the amalgamating companies (but not the amalgamated company). The ASC of all the other amalgamating companies is added to the subscriptions amount of the amalgamated company. Because the amalgamated company may also be an amalgamating company until the amalgamation occurs, s CD 43(15)(a)(iii) is necessary to prevent the subscriptions of the amalgamated company from being counted twice. 3 Conclusion 13. Accordingly, the Commissioner considers the two provisions do not conflict. Section CD 43(15) merely extends the general definition of subscriptions in s CD 43(2)(b). As a result, the ASC of an amalgamated company includes an additional amount that is equal to the ASC of all the amalgamating companies, except the amalgamated company. Therefore, while s CD 43(15)(a)(iii) appears to exclude the ASC on the shares of the amalgamated company, this subparagraph is necessary to prevent double-counting. This is because the consideration received by the amalgamated company for shares will have already been taken into account under the general definition of “subscriptions” in s CD 43(2)(b). This interpretation of the definition of “subscriptions” for an amalgamated company under subs (2)(b) and (15) of s CD 43 is consistent with the wording of the legislation and the scheme and purpose of the ASC rules. Example 14. A Co Ltd was incorporated in December 2012 and issued 1,000 shares for $1 each. B Co Ltd was incorporated in December 2012 and issued 2,000 shares for $1 each. Neither company have issued any more shares since. A Co Ltd and B Co Ltd amalgamate in March 2013. A Co Ltd remains as the amalgamated company. 15. The ASC of the amalgamated company is calculated using the following formula: 1 July 1994 balance + subscriptions – returns – look-through company returns 16. The subscriptions amount is determined under ss CD 43(2)(b) and CD 43(15). Based on the interpretation in this QWBA, the subscriptions amount equals the subscriptions of the amalgamated company under s CD 43(2)(b) plus the subscriptions of the amalgamating companies under s CD 43(15). However, because an amalgamated company can also be an amalgamating company, s CD 43(15)(a)(iii) excludes the subscriptions of the amalgamated company from being counted again under s CD 43(15). 17. The ASC of A Co Ltd would therefore be calculated as follows: 1 July 1994 balance + (subscriptions of A Co Ltd under s CD 43(2)(b) + subscriptions of the amalgamating companies (not including the amalgamated company, being A Co Ltd) under s CD 43(15)(a)) – returns – look-through company returns. 0 + (subscriptions of A Co Ltd of 1,000 + subscriptions of B Co Ltd of 2,000) – 0 – 0 = 3,000 ASC References Subject references amalgamated company amalgamating company amalgamation available subscribed capital “includes” income tax “subject to” Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007, s CD 43(1), (2)(b) and (15), s YA 1.

1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 13/03 GOODS AND SERVICES TAX – WHETHER A COMPULSORY ACQUISITION OF LAND IS A “SUPPLY BY WAY OF SALE” All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked applies in respect of ss 3A, 5(1), 8(1), 11(1)(mb), and 20(3). Question 1. We have been asked whether:  a compulsory acquisition of land under the Public Works Act 1981 (PWA 1981) is a “supply” for GST purposes; and  if so, whether it is a “supply by way of sale” such that the recipient is entitled to a second-hand goods input tax deduction under ss 3A(2) and 20(3) of the GST Act where the supplier is not registered. Answer 2. A compulsory acquisition of land under the PWA 1981 is a “supply” for GST purposes from the land owner to the Crown or local authority. Where such a supply is made by a registered person, it will generally be zero-rated under s 11(1)(mb). 3. Land compulsorily acquired from a non-registered person under the PWA 1981 will be a “supply by way of sale” for the purposes of ss 3A(2) and 20(3). The recipient (the Crown or local authority) will be entitled to an input tax deduction for the amount paid for the acquisition of that land (provided the other requirements of ss 3A(2) and 20(3) are met). 4. It is noted that, while this QWBA analyses compulsory acquisitions under the PWA 1981, the above answer also applies to compulsory acquisitions of land under the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011. Explanation Background 5. The Minister of Lands or a local authority has the power under the PWA 1981 to acquire land under an agreement with the owner of the land or, where an agreement cannot be reached, under a compulsory acquisition. Where land is compulsorily acquired under the PWA 1981, the person whose land is acquired is entitled to full compensation from the Crown or local authority. 6. Public authorities and local authorities will be registered for GST. Consequently, the recipient of any compulsorily acquired land will be a registered person. There has been confusion about whether an input tax deduction is allowed when land is compulsorily acquired. Meaning of “supply” 7. The New Zealand courts have not considered whether a supply requires an act on the part of the supplier. “Supply” has a wide meaning with potentially both active 2 and passive senses. It is, therefore, necessary to consider the context and purpose of the GST Act to determine whether “supply” was intended to be limited to situations where there was an act on the part of the supplier. The GST Act was intended to be comprehensive and as non-distortionary as possible. This purpose is consistent with compulsory acquisitions being supplies for GST purposes. 8. GST is chargeable on the supply of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person: s 8(1). 9. Under s 5(1), supply “includes all forms of supply”. In Case S84 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,526, Judge Barber considered that the effect of s 5(1) was that virtually any transaction constitutes a supply (at 7,533): Section 5(1) defines “supply” to include all forms of supply. Accordingly, virtually any transaction constitutes a supply; but a supply is only subject to GST if it is made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity (s 8). 10. At issue is whether a supply for GST purposes requires an act on the part of the supplier. If so, then a compulsory acquisition would not be a supply. 11. In Databank Systems Ltd v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,213, Davison CJ considered that in the context of s 5(1) “supply” meant “to furnish with or provide”. The definitions of “provide” and “furnish” in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary include “make available for use; supply” (provide) and “be a source of; provide” (furnish). The meaning of “supply” is, therefore, wide enough to include both active and passive senses. 12. New Zealand courts have not expressly considered whether a supply requires an act on the part of the supplier. 13. Comments made by Judge Willy in Case T22 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,124 may be taken to suggest that a compulsory acquisition of property from a taxpayer could not amount to a supply. However, that case did not involve a compulsory acquisition of property. Rather, the Government passed legislation preventing the taxpayer from operating a marron farm, which it was previously permitted to do. Subsequent to that, the Government made a payment to the taxpayer in full and final settlement to any claim related to those events. The case is, therefore, concerned with a compensation payment, rather than a compulsory acquisition of property. 14. South African and Australian authority establishes that for there to be a supply, there must be an act on the part of the supplier. These cases support the view that a compulsory acquisition of land under the Public Works Act, which occurs because the Governor-General makes a proclamation, does not involve a supply of the land: Shell's Annandale Farm (Pty) Ltd v Commissioner for South African Revenue Service (1999) 62 SATC 97; Shaw v Director of Housing (No 2) (2001) ATC 4,054. However, cases decided under other indirect tax legislation are not necessarily applicable in interpreting the New Zealand GST Act, although they may be helpful: CIR v Databank Systems Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,093; CIR v Gulf Harbour Development Ltd (2004) 21 NZTC 18,915. 15. UK legislation provides that a compulsory acquisition for which compensation is paid is a supply, but one case has suggested that even without an express provision, a compulsory acquisition would have been a supply: Landau \[1996\] BVC 2,577. 16. In Shell's Annandale Farm, Davis J acknowledged that the ordinary meaning of “supply” included a passive sense, but found that it was necessary to consider the text and purpose of the Act as a whole. He considered that in the context of the South African value-added tax legislation, a “supply” required some act on the part of the supplier. 3 17. Even where the meaning of the text of the legislation is clear, it is necessary to cross-check the plain meaning against the purpose of the legislation to comply with s 5 of the Interpretation Act 1999. The Interpretation Act 1999 makes the text and purpose the key drivers of statutory interpretation. Further, consideration of the context and purpose is essential where the meaning is not clear on the face of the legislation: Commerce Commission v Fonterra Co- operative Group Ltd \[2007\] 3 NZLR 767 (SC). As “supply” can be used in active and passive senses, it is necessary to consider contextual matters and the scheme and purpose of the New Zealand legislation to decide whether “supply” requires an act on the part of the supplier. Context and purpose 18. GST is imposed on the supply of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity by reference to the value of the supply (the consideration for the supply): ss 8(1) and 10. In CIR v Databank Systems Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,093, Richardson J commented that the definitions of the terms used in s 8(1) (“supply”, “goods”, “services”, “registered person” and “taxable activity”) breathed comprehensiveness into the legislation. Richardson J also said that a feature of the legislation in this regime compared with that in other indirect tax regimes was its breadth of coverage and limited number of exemptions. 19. “Consideration” is relevantly defined in the Act as: in relation to the supply of goods and services to any person, includes any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services, whether by that person or by any other person ... 20. For payment to be consideration for a supply, a sufficient connection must exist between the supply and the payment: CIR v NZ Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187; Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075. The supply need not be made to the person providing consideration and consideration need not be paid under a contract between the supplier and the person providing the consideration, so long as a connection exists between the supply and the payment: Turakina Maori Girls’ College Trust Board v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,032; NZ Refining Co; Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust. In determining whether the necessary relationship exists, the legal nature of the transaction and the rights and obligations of the parties need to be considered: NZ Refining Co; Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust. 21. As the definition of “consideration” contemplates that a supply need not be made under a contract (the making of which requires an act on the part of the supplier), the definition provides some support for the argument that a “supply” does not require an act on the part of the supplier. However, for a payment to be consideration there must be an element of reciprocity in the relationship between the supplier and the recipient and a sufficient connection between a supply and a payment. In the context of a compulsory acquisition, a sufficient connection exists between the transfer of the land and the payment made by the Crown or local authority for the acquisition of that land. The right to compensation arises only because the land is taken. The payment is, therefore, in response to the acquisition of the land. 22. The definition of “supplier” refers to “the person who makes the supply” of goods and services. The definition of “make” in the Concise Oxford Dictionary includes “bring about or perform; cause”. The use of the word “makes” in the definition of “supplier” indicates that “supply” in the GST Act has an active connotation. However, this factor must be weighed against other contextual matters. 4 23. Although not exactly analogous, there are examples where the GST Act deems a supply to be made although there is no act by the supplier in respect of the supply. For example, a person must pay registration fees, licence fees and road user charges to be entitled to operate a motor vehicle (or certain motor vehicles) on the road. These fees are treated as consideration for a supply of services by the New Zealand Transport Agency: s 5(6A) and (6B); see also s 5(6C), (7B), and (7C)). 24. Deeming can be used to extend the meaning of a term. However, deeming can also be used to put beyond doubt a particular meaning that might otherwise be uncertain. Therefore, it is possible that Parliament did not intend to extend the concept of supply beyond the circumstances in which these specific provisions apply. The alternative argument, which the court in Landau suggested, is that provisions deeming a supply to be made in certain circumstances were included for the avoidance of doubt and are not intended to limit the concept of “supply”. Although of limited analytical weight, the inclusion of these deeming provisions means it is not possible to argue that Parliament intended that GST would be imposed only in circumstances where a supply is voluntary. These provisions and s 5(1), which provides that “supply” includes all forms of supply, suggest that Parliament intended that “supply” should be given a wide interpretation and should encompass almost any type of transaction under which a person acquires goods or services. 25. A “transaction” can include any dealings with property (Littman v Barron (1952) 33 TC 373) and can be a unilateral activity (Greenberg v IR Commrs \[1971\] 3 All ER 136; Case K60 (1988) 10 NZTC 487). A compulsory acquisition is a transaction within that meaning, being a dealing with property involving the acquisition by the Crown or the local authority of title to land owned by another person. 26. In Glenharrow Holdings Ltd v CIR (2009) 24 NZTC 23,236, the Supreme Court noted that GST was intended to be as non-distortionary as possible, and that to that end GST was intended to be broad-based, efficient and neutral. A governing principle of the GST Act is that GST is paid by the ultimate consumer and is neutral for registered persons, who collect GST on behalf of the Crown (see L R McLean & Co Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,211). To achieve neutrality, registered persons are allowed input tax deductions for their purchases. The legislation contemplates that there will be a balancing out of or netting off of the GST components of sales and purchases made by a registered person. If a registered person obtained an input tax deduction on the acquisition of land and was not required to account for GST on the land’s disposal, the person would receive a gain that the legislation does not contemplate. Therefore, it would be inconsistent with the scheme of the legislation if a registered person from whom land was compulsorily acquired were entitled to an input tax deduction on the acquisition of the land but not required to account for GST on compensation for the land where the land was compulsorily acquired. \[Although the zero-rating rules have changed the position for supplies of land between registered persons, ultimately when the land is sold to an unregistered person, GST will be payable. In any event, it is considered that the general principle is still relevant.\] 27. It would be inconsistent with the principles of neutrality and efficiency that underlie the broad definitions of the main concepts in the GST Act (“goods”, “services”, “supply” and “taxable activity”), if a different GST outcome occurred depending on whether an agreement for sale and purchase was entered into or whether land was compulsorily acquired. Whether the land is acquired under an agreement entered into with the owner of the land or under a compulsory acquisition, land is acquired by the Crown in return for payment. 5 28. If “supply” were limited to transactions where there was an act on the part of the supplier, it would create an anomaly in that compulsory acquisitions would be outside the GST net (although a compulsory acquisition of land would have the same legal and economic effect as an agreement for the purchase of the land). Such an interpretation is not required on a literal interpretation. Further, the scheme and purpose of the legislation supports the view that the treatment should be the same. GST is intended to be imposed on the value added at every stage by which goods and services reach the ultimate consumer. Therefore, it is considered that the better view is that the GST treatment should be the same whether the supplier has taken some action that results in another person receiving goods or services or whether a person receives goods or services without there being an act by the supplier. 29. The interpretation of “supply” remains relevant in considering whether a second- hand goods deduction (which requires a supply by way of sale) would be allowable where land is acquired from a non-registered person. Supply by way of sale 30. Whether a compulsory acquisition is a “sale” depends on the context in which the term “sale” is used. The context of the GST Act is not decisive about whether a compulsory acquisition is a “supply by way of sale”. However, allowing a second- hand goods deduction is more consistent with the policy of allowing input tax deductions for second-hand goods, because it achieves GST neutrality. 31. Case law shows that whether a compulsory acquisition is a “sale” depends on the context of the legislation in which the term “sale” is used: John Hudson & Co Ltd v Kirkness (1955) 36 TC 28; Ridge Nominees Ltd v IRC \[1961\] 3 All ER 1,108. 32. In Smith v FCT (1932) 48 CLR 178 and Coburg Investment Co Pty Ltd v FCT (1960) 12 ATD 242, the court considered that a compulsory acquisition of land was a sale. In Smith, Rich J considered that the word “sale” did not have a precise meaning and that in some contexts the essence of a sale was the conversion of property into money. In Coburg Investment, the issue was whether a compulsory acquisition was a sale of land for the purpose of the equivalent of s CB 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Windeyer J considered that the provision should be read in the light of the principle that if property is acquired for the purpose of sale (rather than for the purpose of retaining it as an income- producing capital asset), the surplus received when it is realised is income. Under that principle it is irrelevant whether the realisation occurred as a result of compulsion or voluntarily. See also FCT v Salenger 88 ATC 4,449, where the court found that, where a sale is made under a contract, mutual consent is required. However, a sale is not necessarily made under a contract. 33. New Zealand case law established that a compulsory acquisition of land is not a sale for the purpose of the predecessor of s CB 6. In Public Trustee v CIR \[1961\] NZLR 1,034, Hutchison J did not consider that a wider meaning of “sale” applied in the particular context. However, Hutchison J accepted that in a suitable context a sale for income tax purposes could include a compulsory acquisition (at 1,044). Public Trustee was followed in Railway Timber Co Ltd v CIR \[1977\] 1 NZLR 655 and Duff v CIR (1979) 4 NZTC 61,420. (The legislation has since been amended so that a disposal of land for the purpose of these provisions now includes a compulsory acquisition.) 34. The fact New Zealand case law establishes that a compulsory acquisition is not a s ale for income tax purposes does not necessarily mean that “sale” should be interpreted in the same way for GST purposes. The meaning to be given to “sale” depends on the context in which it is used. It is, therefore, necessary to consider the context in which “sale” is used in s 3A(2). 6 35. A sale is a supply. Section 3A(2) refers to “a supply by way of sale”. “By way of” means “in the form of”: Concise Oxford Dictionary. A supply for GST purposes need not be made under a contract: Turakina. 36. Section 3A(3)(a)–(d), which relates to the determination of the amount of a second-hand goods input tax credit, refers to “the purchase price” as a basis for determining the amount of the input tax credit. A possible argument is that compensation paid under a compulsory acquisition cannot be described as a purchase price. Therefore, the legislation contemplates a second-hand goods input tax deduction could not be obtained for a compulsory acquisition. However, in Horn v Sunderland Corporation \[1941\] 1 All ER 480 (CA), Scott LJ considered that “purchased” was synonymous with “taken” and that the compensation paid for compulsorily acquired land was a purchase price (at 492). 37. Also, the paragraphs in s 3A(3) that refer to the purchase price are unlikely to apply where a compulsory acquisition is made. Section 3A(3)(a)–(c) applies where the supplier and the recipient are associated persons. The Crown or a local authority is unlikely to be an associated person of any person from whom land may be compulsorily acquired. Section 3A(3)(d) applies where the supply is not the only matter to which the consideration relates. This is also unlikely to be relevant in the context of a compulsory acquisition. 38. Where the supplier and recipient are not associated persons and the supply is the only matter to which the consideration relates, the amount of the input tax deduction is based on the consideration in money for the supply: s 3A(3)(e). Therefore, the amount of the input tax deduction where a compulsory acquisition is made would be based on the amount of the compensation paid for the acquisition. 39. Originally, a second-hand goods input tax deduction was allowable on a supply that was not a taxable supply. Public Information Bulletin 181 (June 1989) set out commentary on the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1989. The bulletin explains that before the amendment, a registered person could have obtained a second-hand goods input tax deduction on goods that were leased. The bulletin also explains that the words “supply by way of sale” were inserted in the definition of “input tax” in the GST Act to ensure the second-hand goods input tax deduction was not obtained where a registered person did not obtain ownership of the goods. Therefore, the limitation of the second-hand goods input tax deduction to supplies by way of sale was not intended to introduce a requirement for consent from the supplier to the supply before there could be a sale. The words “supply by way of sale” were added to ensure a second-hand goods input tax deduction could be obtained only where the recipient acquired ownership of the goods. The definition of “sale” referred to in the bulletin refers to an exchange of a commodity for money. This exchange occurs under a compulsory acquisition. 40. The allowance of an input tax deduction in respect of a compulsory acquisition of land is consistent with the policy underlying the second-hand goods input tax deduction. Allowing a second-hand goods input tax deduction recognises that as the non-registered supplier was charged GST on the acquisition of the goods, the consideration for the goods includes a notional GST component. The allowance of an input tax deduction to a registered person who purchases second-hand goods from a non-registered person achieves GST neutrality for the registered person: Glenharrow. Supplies of land between registered persons are now zero-rated. However, there are still GST consequences where land is supplied either by or to an unregistered person. Allowing a second-hand goods input tax deduction is also consistent with the treatment of land that is acquired by agreement under s 17 of the PWA 1981. 7 41. Although, it is not completely free from doubt, on balance, the Commissioner’s view is that, in the context of the GST legislation, a compulsory acquisition is a supply by way of sale. Interpretation Statement 42. The Interpretation Statement “GST treatment of court awards and out of court settlements: IS3387” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14, No 10 (October 2002) states the proposition that “\[t\]he concept of supply is active; to supply is to furnish or provide”. 43. The principle referred to above was not central to the matters considered in the Interpretation Statement. In the Commissioner’s view, the conclusions reached in the Interpretation Statement are still correct. However, to the extent that the analysis in the Interpretation Statement suggests that the concept of “supply” is always active, the Commissioner now considers that it is incorrect. Examples 44. The following examples are included to help explain the application of the law. Example 1 – unregistered landowner 45. Bob is not registered for GST. Bob owns a 400m 2 block of land. The local district council requires Bob’s land to undertake some local work. Bob does not want to sell his land to the council. The council compulsorily acquires Bob’s land under the PWA 1981 and pays him $400,000 (the market value of the land). 46. Bob is not GST registered, so there are no GST implications for him. The council is GST registered. The transfer of the land from Bob to the council is a “supply by way of sale” for the purposes of ss 3A(2) and 20(3). The council is entitled to an input tax deduction (provided the other requirements of ss 3A(2) and 20(3) are met). Example 2 – registered landowner 47. Charles carries on a taxable activity of farming and is registered for GST. Charles owns 100 hectares of land. The local council requires 100m 2 of Charles’ land to widen an adjacent road. Charles does not wish to sell his land to the council. The council compulsorily acquires Charles’ land under the PWA 1981 and pays him $40,000 (the market value of the land). 48. The transfer of the land from Charles to the council is a “supply”. The supply is of land, so it will be zero-rated under s 11(1)(mb).

1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 13/04 INCOME TAX – RETENTION MONEY All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This question we've been asked is about ss BD 3, BD 4, CA 1, CB 1 and DA 1. This item updates and replaces the item "Retention Moneys, Construction Contracts” published in Public Information Bulletin No 103, p 1 (March 1980). That item sets out when retention money due on construction projects should be returned as income and the timing of deductions for retention money payable to sub-contractors. The current relevance of this information was identified during a review of content published in Public Information Bulletins and Tax Information Bulletins before 1996. For more information about the review, please see “Review of Public Information Bulletins” in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011). This question we’ve been asked applies generally to business taxpayers for whom the payment, or the receipt, of retention money is on revenue account. This item applies to contracts generally and not only construction contracts. Question 1. A contract to construct an asset provides that the customer will withhold a set percentage from any progress payment (say 10%) as security for the contractor delivering the work free of defects or omissions. The same term is in the sub- contract between the contractor and a sub-contractor engaged on the project. 2. When does the contractor:  derive as income the retention money the customer withholds; and  incur the expenditure of the retention money the contractor withholds from payments to the sub-contractor? Answer 3. The contractor derives the retention money as income in the income year in which the works are complete and free of defects and omissions. That is the income year in which any repairs are completed and omissions rectified. That is when the income earning process is completed and an enforceable debt is created. If payment is not to be made unless the work is certified by a third party, for example, by an engineer, the retention money is derived as income when that certificate is given. The same principle applies to derivation of income by the sub-contractor. 4. The contractor also incurs the expenditure of the retention money payment to the sub-contractor in the income year in which all repairs are completed and omissions rectified, because that is when the contractor becomes definitively committed to make the payment. It is this that determines when the expense is incurred and not the due date for the payment. 5. If the repairs and rectifications must be certified by a third party, for example, by an engineer, the contractor incurs the expenditure when that certificate is given as that is when the contractor becomes definitively committed to make the payment. 2 Explanation 6. “Retention money” can be described generally as “an amount withheld for an agreed period by a purchaser or a contractee as security against the failure to fulfil a contract” (Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (6 th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2007)). In some cases, a contract may allow a customer to retain part of a contract payment until identified repairs are made or other breaches of the contract are remedied. It is common in the construction industry for contracts to provide for a retention amount, of a set percentage, to be withheld from each progress payment. These retentions give the customer some comfort that the works will be completed defect-free and to specification. 7. A contract may provide that money can be retained by a customer until a defect is remedied or other condition is satisfied – as is the case in the question and answer above. Some contracts require certification by a third party, such as an independent engineer, before retention money is payable. Alternatively, a contract may simply provide that a set percentage of each progress payment will be retained by the payer until a future date. In that case the retention money is, in effect, a form of security for the payer against defects or inadequacies in the work becoming apparent during the retention period. When is income recognised? 8. An amount of income must be allocated to an income year (s BD 3(1)), which will be the year in which it is “derived” unless that is altered by a specific timing provision in the Act (s BD 3(2)). In determining the time of derivation of income regard must be had to case law (s BD 3(3)). This is subject to an overriding rule that an amount is treated as being derived when credited to the account of a taxpayer or dealt with in some other way in their interest or on their behalf (s BD 3(4)). 9. An amount paid to a contractor, or sub-contractor, in the business of constructing assets or providing other contract services is income (ss CA 1 and CB 1). Case law has established that, with limited exceptions, business income is derived when a taxpayer has done all that is necessary to earn the income (see, for example Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Limited v FCT (1965) 114 CLR 314 (HCA); Bowcock v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,062 (HC); CIR v Molloy (1990) 12 NZTC 7,146 (HC); Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Limited v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,226 (CA)) and a debt is created (see, for example FCT v Australian Gaslight Company (1983) 83 ATC 4800 (FFedC); Gasparin v FCT 94 ATC 4,280 (FFedC); CIR v Farmer’s Trading Company Limited (1982) 5 NZTC 61,200 (CA)). 10. In HW Coyle Ltd v CIR (1980) 4 NZTC 61,558 (HC), the High Court considered the derivation of payments under a construction contract. The Court held that the accounting treatment adopted by the taxpayer did not determine the result and said, at page 61,565, that the court’s task was: ...to apply the statutory provisions of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954, now the Income Tax Act 1976, to the Objector concerned and the particular contract. 11. The court held, at page 51,568, that the retention amounts under the contract had not: ...been derived or earned and should not be included in the assessable income of the taxpayer until they are payable. 3 12. Recognition of income under building contracts was also considered in Horizon Homes Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,064 (HC), in which the High Court followed the approach taken in Coyle and, at page 11,079, said: A taxpayer is not regarded as having derived income to which he is not yet contractually entitled. 13. The core provisions have been introduced into the Income Tax Act since the Coyle and Horizon Homes decisions. However, the cases are consistent with the core provisions in focusing on the statutory tests rather than accounting treatment. When is expenditure deducted? 14. Deductions must be allocated to an income year (s BD 4(1)), which is the year the expenditure is “incurred” unless that is altered by a specific timing provision in the Act (s BD 4(2)). In determining the time of incurrence regard must be had to case law (s BD 4(3)). Case law has established that a taxpayer must have paid, agreed to pay or become definitively committed to a payment for an expense to be incurred (see, for example CIR v Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited (1995) 17 NZTC 12,351 (PC), AM Bisley & Co Ltd and Ors v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,082 (HC), HW Coyle Ltd v CIR, Case M123 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,788). 15. Section EA 3 contains a timing rule in relation to expenditure that is incurred before the services for which it is incurred are performed. This section will generally not apply to retention amounts because they represent expenditure on services already performed. Terms of contract critical 16. The correct tax treatment in each case depends on the precise terms of the contract between the parties. If, for example, a contract provides that 10% of payment for work completed to date is to be retained by the payer, and the payer is not liable to pay that amount until an engineer’s certificate is provided, then the income earning process is completed if and when the engineer’s certificate is provided. The payer will incur, ie, become definitively committed to the payment, if and when the certificate is given. 17. If, instead, a contract simply provides for 10% of a payment for work to date to be retained by the payer until a later date (ie, there is no contractual requirement for repairs to be made or an engineer’s certificate to be issued), the income is derived when the work is completed and not at the later designated payment date. Similarly, the payer will be definitively committed to the payment once the work is complete even though actual payment is deferred until a later date. 18. It may be that the practical effect of retaining an amount until an engineer’s certificate is given will be the same as retaining it for a period during which the payer can check for defects, inadequate work, etc. However, the tax position depends on the legal rights and obligations of the parties under the contract and not the practical effect of those terms. 19. It has been suggested that a customer (or head contractor) will incur the full cost of works, including all retentions, once the original works have been completed. That is, retentions are incurred even though payment of them is not required unless or until the contractor has repaired all defects and rectified all omissions. As the incurred and derived tests are different, it is argued that the customer can incur the retention payments on completion of the original works but the contractor will not derive that income until the repairs are completed and omissions rectified. The Commissioner agrees that the incurred and derived tests are different and, in some cases, this may mean that an expense is incurred before corresponding income is derived. However, if work remains to be done 4 before retentions are legally payable under the contract, the payer has not incurred that amount as the payer has not yet become definitively committed to the payment. Financial Arrangement Rules 20. Under the financial arrangement rules in subpart EW, part of a payment can be treated as interest for tax purposes. This can be the case where either goods or services are provided before payment or where payment occurs in advance of the provision of goods or services. However, as a general proposition, no interest will be implied under those rules where, essentially, the amount paid is the amount the parties would have agreed to pay if payment took place at the time services are performed, or property transferred. The rules also do not apply to certain short term agreements. The application of subpart EW to construction contracts, including retention payments, is outside the scope of this item. Examples Example 1 – Retention Pending Repair 21. Contractor contracts with Customer to construct and install a large item of industrial plant. The contract allows Customer to retain up to 5% of any progress payment until defects in work to date are rectified. Contractor’s contract with Sub-Contractor provides for retentions on the same basis. 22. A sub-component of the plant, installed by Sub-Contractor, is defective and Customer retains an amount from the 30 January progress payment. Contractor retains the same amount from its progress payment to Sub-Contractor. Sub- Contractor completes the replacement of the sub-component by 29 March. Customer pays Contractor the retention on 5 April and Contractor pays Sub- Contractor the next day. 23. Contractor derives the income in the year ending 31 March, as Contractor becomes entitled to payment on 29 March when the repair is completed. Similarly, Sub-Contractor derives the income in the same year. Contractor also incurs the expenditure in the year ending 31 March as Contractor becomes definitively committed to pay Sub-Contractor when the repair is completed. Example 2 – Requirement for Certification 24. Builder contracts with Customer to build a high-rise building. Builder must submit claims for progress payments to Engineer who then certifies the appropriate amount to be paid by Customer. Customer may retain up to 5% from any progress payment as security against any defects in the work. A retention amount is payable (as part of the next progress payment) once Engineer has certified that any defects have been remedied or (as part of the final payment) if Engineer has certified that the entire contract work has been completed. 25. Customer retains $100,000 from the 30 November 2010 progress payment, in respect of identified defects, and Builder completes the repair of those defects on 28 February 2011.  If Engineer issues the certificate on 3 March 2011, Builder derives the retention amount as income in the income year ending 31 March 2011 and Customer incurs the expenditure in that year.  If instead, Engineer is unable to issue the certificate until 1 April 2011, Builder derives the retention amount as income in the income year ending 31 March 2012 and Customer does not incur the expenditure until that later year. 5 Example 3 – Relevance of Defect Liability Period 26. Contractor contracts with Customer to build a chemical plant. The contract provides for Customer to make progress payments. The contract also provides that Customer will retain 10% of each progress payment. Fifty percent of the retention money is to be paid to Contractor on practical completion of the plant. The balance of the retention money is to be paid at the end of a defects liability period that runs to a date after practical completion. Contractor’s contract with Sub-Contractor provides for retentions on the same basis. 27. The 50% of the retention money payable on practical completion is derived as income by Contractor when practical completion occurs. That is the point at which everything that must be done to earn the money has been done. If, alternatively, the contract provides that practical completion must be certified by an engineer then the income will be derived on the date when the certificate is given. 28. The timing of derivation of the balance of the retention money will depend on the precise terms of the contract. If the contract provides that it will be paid at the end of a period that runs to a time after completion of the work (the defects liability period), then the income will be derived when the work is completed and not at the end of that period. This is because, by completing the work, Contractor has done all that is required to be done to earn the income. However, if the contract provides that the balance will be paid at the end of a defects liability period provided an engineer certifies that the works are free of defects, then the income will not be derived until that certificate is given. The giving of the certificate is something that must be done for the income to be earned. 29. The timing of incurrence by Contractor of the payment of retention money to Sub-contractor will be the same. Contractor will become definitively committed to pay the first 50% of the retention money on practical completion. However, if payment is conditional upon practical completion being certified, then the expense will be incurred if and when the certificate is given. The balance, payable at the end of the defect liability period will also be incurred on practical completion unless there is something more required (eg, certification that the works are free of defects) before payment is required. In that case, the balance will be incurred at the time the certificate is given.

1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 13/05 INCOME TAX – DEDUCTIBILITY OF A COMPANION’S TRAVEL EXPENSES All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) is about ss DA 1(1) and DA 2(2). It applies for the 2014 income year and subsequent income years. During a review of the Public Information Bulletin and Tax Information Bulletin series published before 1996, parts of the items “Deduction for Wife’s Expenses – Professional People Attending Overseas Conferences” Public Information Bulletin No 74, p 10 (June 1973) and “Overseas Travel Expense Claims” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995) were identified as no longer reflecting the Commissioner’s interpretation of the law as it relates to the deductibility of a companion’s travel expenses. The Public Information Bulletin review has now been completed, see “Update on Public Information Bulletin review” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25, No 10 (November 2013). This QWBA updates and replaces the Public Information Bulletin item. This QWBA also updates and replaces the part of the Tax Information Bulletin item dealing with claims for a companion’s or a family member’s overseas travel expenses. The Commissioner considers that the other two parts of the Tax Information Bulletin item dealing with the information that a taxpayer should supply when asked by Inland Revenue to support a claim for overseas travel expenses and the apportionment of private expenses are still correct and relevant. Question 1. In the course of carrying on a business, a taxpayer takes a business trip. A companion accompanies the taxpayer on that business trip. Can the taxpayer deduct the companion’s travel expenses? Answer 2. In most cases, the companion’s travel expenses will not be deductible. If the companion is accompanying the taxpayer simply for companionship or to attend social functions, then this expenditure will not have a sufficient nexus with the taxpayer’s business or income-earning activity. 3. However, a deduction may be permitted where the companion supports the taxpayer, to a reasonably substantial degree, in the business being undertaken. The companion does not need to be an expert in the affairs of the business, but they do need some knowledge of the business being undertaken or they must possess some special skill or expertise to be able to provide support in a material way. If these qualities are present, then the Commissioner considers a sufficient nexus will exist between the companion’s travel expenses and the taxpayer’s business or income-earning activity. 4. This answer applies to travel expenses incurred overseas and in New Zealand. Deductions for travel expenses incurred in New Zealand may be restricted by the entertainment rules (ss DD 1 – DD 11). Employers may also need to consider fringe benefit tax (FBT) if travel expenses confer a private benefit on their employees or associated persons of the employees. This QWBA does not consider the implications of the entertainment rules or the FBT rules on a companion’s travel expenses. 2 Explanation Deductibility 5. The travel expenses of a taxpayer’s companion will be deductible if the expenses satisfy the requirements of s DA 1(1), known as the general permission, and s DA 2 does not deny their deduction. Section DA 1(1) is satisfied where a sufficient nexus or relationship exists between the expenses incurred and the deriving of the taxpayer’s assessable income or the carrying on of a business by the taxpayer for the purpose of deriving assessable income. To determine whether there is a sufficient nexus, the character of the expenditure and its relevance to the taxpayer’s business must be considered. 6. Some types of expenditure will not be deductible. Section DA 2(2) prohibits a deduction for expenditure of a private or domestic nature. 7. In CIR v Haenga \[1986\] 1 NZLR 119 (CA), Richardson J noted that certain kinds of expenditure have some relationship with the earning of income in that they are necessary prerequisites (eg, travel to a place of work and childcare costs). However, Richardson J, at 127 to 128, concluded that they are not deductible: It is a matter of degree and so a question of fact to determine whether there is a “sufficient” nexus between the expenditure and what it provided or sought to provide on the one hand and the income earning process on the other so as to fall within the words of the section. That the inquiry involves a value judgment of sufficiency is implicit in the statutory scheme. The legal answer is complicated where as here the asset or advantage in respect of which expenses are incurred may serve private and income earning purposes. Thus expenses of travelling between home and work and expenses of child care have conventionally been regarded by the Courts as a private matter, a form of consumption. In as much as they are a prerequisite to the earning of income it is arguable that they are incurred in the gaining of the assessable income. But depending on one's perspective a similar argument could even be advanced to justify deduction of outlays on such basic items as essential food, clothing and shelter which may be said to maintain and enhance the physical and psychological wellbeing of the individual, and in turn his or her ability to perform his employment. In one sense then any such expenditure has a relation to the purpose of earning income, even if it is described as an ordinary living expense. But it is not to be expected that the legislature ever contemplated such an erosion of the income tax base in respect of employment income; and with careful emphasis on the character of the expenditure incurred the Courts have denied the notion that an expense properly characterised as consumption is incidental and relevant to the derivation of income merely because it is necessary in that sense (Lodge v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1972) 128 CLR 171, 175; Lunney v Commissioner of Taxation (1958) 100 CLR 478). Travel expenses 8. The deductibility of a companion’s travel expenses was the subject of two New Zealand tax cases: Case 16 (1964) 2 NZTBR 119 and Case K75 (1988) 10 NZTC 602. These cases illustrate how the nexus requirement works in practice. 9. Case 16 and Case K75 both concern the deductibility of a companion’s overseas travel expenses. In the Commissioner’s opinion, the same reasoning would apply to travel expenses incurred within New Zealand. It is the character of the expenses that is important, not whether they were incurred in New Zealand or overseas. (However, deductions for some travel expenses incurred in New Zealand may be restricted under the entertainment rules (ss DD 1–DD 11).) 10. In Case 16 the taxpayer company carried on business as a wholesale wine and spirits merchant. A was a shareholder and the managing director of the taxpayer. A’s wife B was also a shareholder and director, but not an employee. Because of B’s personal standing and business interests in Great Britain, she was able to materially assist the company to obtain a whiskey distributorship. However, in 1958 restrictions were placed on import licences, which resulted in poor sales for the taxpayer. The Great Britain whiskey distributor became dissatisfied. To try to preserve the distributorship, A and B visited the distributor. A confirmed that B’s presence was essential to the visit. She was present at every meeting, took 3 part in every business discussion and assisted in making decisions. The company sought a deduction for the travel expenditure. The Commissioner allowed a deduction for A’s travel expenses, but not for B’s. 11. The Taxation Board of Review (the board) held that B’s travel expenses had a sufficient nexus with the assessable income of the business, so were deductible. The board found that B actively and competently carried out the duties of a director. Her standing within the licensed trade in Great Britain was of particular value to the company. B was not an employee of the company, but her intimate knowledge of the business meant she was able to contribute in a material way to the business being undertaken on the trip. 12. Case K75 concerned the deductibility of travel expenditure incurred by a group of executives’ wives. The executives had undertaken several business trips accompanied by their wives. The trips involved attending various local and international conferences and seminars. The purpose of the trips was networking and information gathering (to keep up to date with new developments in the publishing world). The wives assisted their husbands with these tasks by meeting and assessing the integrity and competence of the delegates, hosting dinners for delegates and participating in discussions about the business. 13. The company sought a deduction for the wives’ travel expenses. The Commissioner refused to allow a deduction on the grounds that the travel expenses lacked sufficient nexus. 14. Judge Barber held that the expenditure was deductible. However, he considered that such expenditure would not easily satisfy the nexus test. He stated at 612: I record that I commenced this exercise from the point of view that it must be quite difficult for an objector to prove a sufficiently strong link, on the balance of probabilities, between travel expenditure for wives and an income earning process. ... wives would not usually have a sufficient knowledge or interest in the business of their husband's employer to warrant deductibility by the employer of a wife's travel expenses when accompanying her husband. 15. Judge Barber considered, at 612, that a sufficient nexus would exist where: ... the wife is travelling with the employee-executive husband to provide him with support, to a reasonably substantial degree, in undertaking the business of the employer; or, in other words, if the wife is adding in a reasonably substantial manner to the contribution which the husband would otherwise make to the business of the employer ... 16. In finding that this test was satisfied, Judge Barber noted that the wives were able to recall names of business contacts, they “ate, drank and talked” the business of the company, and they had a wide knowledge of their husbands’ goals and the issues facing the company. Judge Barber considered that the expenditure benefited the company, observing with regards to one wife in particular, at 611: True, Mrs G might not be an “expert” in the affairs of the Company; but I am satisfied that her presence overseas accompanying Mr G, was of substantial benefit to the Company, and similarly with regard to the other two wives. 17. Judge Barber noted that deductibility is not available where the presence of the wife has no connection with the business activities undertaken by the employee husband. A deduction is not allowed if the companion is travelling as part of a “junket or joy-ride” (at 613). 18. In the Commissioner’s opinion, for a companion to provide support to a “reasonably substantial degree, in undertaking the business of the employer” the companion (whether a spouse or otherwise) must have some knowledge of the business or some special skill or expertise to provide this support in a material way. Simply being supportive is not enough; that support must relate to the business being undertaken for a sufficient nexus to exist. 4 Travelling with a companion because of ill-health 19. “Overseas travel expense claims” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995) outlined situations where a taxpayer may be able to claim a companion’s travel expenses. One situation is where a taxpayer travelling on business must be accompanied because of ill-health. 20. The Commissioner no longer considers that a companion’s travel expenses would be deductible where the companion is travelling with the taxpayer because of ill- health. In such cases there is likely to be an insufficient nexus with the taxpayer’s business or income-earning activity and the expenses would likely be of a private or domestic nature. The companion might arguably be providing the taxpayer with support to a reasonably substantial degree, but that support relates to the taxpayer’s personal circumstances and not to the business being undertaken. 21. Expenses relating to a health condition are generally not deductible as business expenses. This is the position taken by the New Zealand courts in the following cases: Case E87 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,455, Case F69 (1983) 6 NZTC 59,904, Case F133 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,210, Case F117 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,125, Case F158 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,354 and Haenga. (See also “Self-employed person’s medical costs not deductible” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 1, (July 1995).) In Case F158 a taxpayer claimed a deduction for the cost of private medical treatment. The taxpayer underwent private treatment so that he was able to more quickly resume his professional work. In denying the deduction, Judge Barber noted: In a number of cases over the past year I have covered the view that, generally, expenditure required to remedy diseases or disabilities of the human body is expenditure of a private type – even though a reason for the expenditure is to enable the taxpayer to better earn income or resume the earning of income by remedying his health. ... However, not only is such expenditure not incurred in the course of gaining or producing income, in terms of sec 104 of the Act because it is incurred prior to the income earning process in order to enable the taxpayer to resume that process; but also, quite apart from the legal authorities, common sense tells us that such expenditure for surgery on parts of the human body cannot be regarded as business expenditure because it has the character or nature of private expenditure and hence is not deductible under our law by virtue of sec 106(1)(j) of the Act. The expenditure is not an overhead or functioning cost of O's legal practice; it is a health maintenance cost for O as a human being. Examples 22. The following examples explain the application of the law. In both examples, the purpose of the trip is business. If a business trip also contains a private element such as a holiday, then it may be necessary to apportion some of the costs associated with the trip. See “Overseas Travel Expense Claims” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995) for information about apportioning travel expenses. 23. Some of the travel expenses discussed below may also be a fringe benefit and be subject to fringe benefit tax (FBT). These examples do not consider FBT. Example 1: Spouse accompanying husband to overseas conference 24. Andrew is a barrister. He attends an international law conference in Japan. The purpose of the conference is to discuss new developments in the law and to network with prospective clients and colleagues. The conference is directly relevant to Andrew’s practice. 25. The organisation presenting the conference expects that attendees will bring their partners. Andrew’s wife Mary accompanies him. She meets with the other 5 attendees’ partners and accompanies Andrew to dinners and cocktail functions held as part of the conference. An overseas organisation expects Andrew to be accompanied – are Mary’s travel expenses deductible? 26. Mary’s travel expenses need to have a nexus with Andrew’s business or income- earning activity. In the Commissioner’s opinion, it is unlikely that there will be a sufficient nexus simply because an organisation expects that attendees will bring their partners. The onus will be on the taxpayer to show that this expectation has created a sufficient nexus. 27. If all Mary did was attend dinners and cocktail functions and provide companionship to Andrew, then her travel expenses would not be deductible because there would be an insufficient nexus with Andrew’s business or income- earning activity. Case K75 confirms that travel expenses will not be deductible if the person is travelling as a mere companion. Would it make a difference if Andrew was also presenting a paper at the conference, the leader of a delegation or the only accredited delegate? 28. The role Andrew takes at the conference has no bearing on the deductibility of Mary’s travel expenses. There must be a nexus between Mary’s travel expenses and Andrew’s business or income-earning activity. Mary is at the conference as a mere companion, so her travel expenses are not deductible. 29. It is also not significant that Andrew is a member of a profession. Deductibility is not related to a taxpayer’s status as a professional; it is tied to the taxpayer’s business. 30. Andrew could argue that Mary’s travel expenses are deductible because he is presenting a paper at the conference to raise his business profile and he is expected to take a partner. In such circumstances Mary’s travel expenses would be unlikely to have a sufficient nexus with Andrew’s business. It is Mary’s role and the contribution she makes, and the connection with Andrew’s business that is important. What if Andrew was the head of the international legal organisation running the conference and asked Mary to run the registration process and organise the various cocktail functions? 31. In this scenario, Mary’s travel expenses may have a sufficient nexus with Andrew’s business and be deductible. Mary is providing support to Andrew to a reasonably substantial degree with the business being undertaken. She is assisting with the conference and facilitating networking opportunities for the conference attendees, who would include potential clients for Andrew’s business. This case is analogous to Case K75, where the executives’ wives had a wide knowledge of what their husbands were trying to achieve and the wives understood and were concerned with furthering the company’s business. Would it make a difference if Andrew employed Mary full time as his bookkeeper? 32. Even if Mary were employed full time as Andrew’s bookkeeper, her travel expenses are unlikely to be deductible. Employment status alone is not enough to create a sufficient nexus. Mary’s job as a bookkeeper is an administrative one; she does not undertake legal work. The purpose of the conference is to discuss developments in the law and to network with clients and colleagues. 6 33. Mary may have knowledge of Andrew’s business, but she is not providing support to Andrew to a reasonably substantial degree in the business being undertaken. She is attending the conference as Andrew’s wife. What if Mary is a lawyer employed by Andrew as a legal researcher and attended the conference seminars with him? 34. If Mary is a lawyer employed by Andrew as a legal researcher and attends the conference seminars with him, then her travel expenses are likely to be deductible. Her travel expenses will likely have a sufficient nexus with Andrew’s business or income-earning activity. It is not Mary’s job title that determines deductibility – it is the role that Mary performs in Andrew’s business. Mary generates assessable income for Andrew’s business by undertaking legal research that Andrew uses when providing legal services to his clients. The conference that Mary is attending is about developments in the law that relate directly to Andrew’s area of practice. Mary’s attendance will be likely to assist her in her work for Andrew. Example 2: Niece accompanying aunt to overseas trade fair 35. Lucy owns a furniture-importing business. Once a year she travels to a furniture trade fair in Beijing, China. The trade fair is where she sees new designs, inspects items for quality, places orders and makes business contacts. Business is typically conducted in Mandarin. As Lucy cannot speak Mandarin she often hires an interpreter to help her conduct business. This year, Lucy decides to take her niece Alice. Alice speaks fluent Mandarin. Are Alice’s travel expenses deductible? 36. Alice’s travel expenses are likely to have a sufficient nexus with Lucy’s business or income-earning activity so would be deductible. 37. Alice is providing support to a reasonably substantial degree with the business being undertaken. Without Alice, Lucy cannot engage with her suppliers and place orders. Alice is not an expert in Lucy’s business, but she does possess a special skill or expertise (speaking fluent Mandarin) and that special skill or expertise is used to provide support to Lucy in undertaking her business.

1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 14/01 INCOME TAX – ADJUSTMENTS FOR TRADING STOCK (INCLUDING RAW MATERIALS) TAKEN FOR OWN USE OR CONSUMPTION All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This question we’ve been asked is about s GC 1. This item replaces the item “Value of produce used” published in Public Information Bulletin No 29 (February 1966), at 7, which relates to assessing a farmer for produce taken from his or her farm for own consumption. The current relevance of this item was identified during a review of Public Information Bulletins and Tax Information Bulletins published before 1996. For more information about the review, see “Review of Public Information Bulletins” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011), at 116. This QWBA applies for the 2015 and subsequent income years. The QWBA applies to the situation where the goods being taken for private use or consumption are, in relation to a sole trader’s business, trading stock of that business. This situation should be distinguished from the situation where goods of a type normally acquired as trading stock of the business are acquired for private use or consumption, and are either acquired concurrently with trading stock or from normal suppliers of trading stock (see Example 3 below). While this item refers to sole traders, the Commissioner considers the same principles apply to partners in a partnership. This item does not consider Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) or the dividend rules. Different rules may apply to employers and companies. If an employer or company were to provide trading stock for free or at a subsidised rate to an employee or shareholder for the employee’s or shareholder’s own use or consumption then FBT or dividend issues could arise. This item also does not discuss goods and services tax (GST), but if you are a GST registered person you may need to make a GST adjustment for any trading stock taken. Question 1. What is the income tax treatment when a sole trader takes trading stock (including raw materials) for own use or consumption? Answer 2. A sole trader is required to account for any items of trading stock taken for own use or consumption at the market value of the trading stock. Explanation 3. The taking of trading stock for own use or consumption means the trading stock has not otherwise been sold in the normal course of the sole trader’s business. As a result, the sole trader has not derived assessable business income from disposing of the trading stock. However, the costs incurred in acquiring, growing or manufacturing the trading stock would have been included in the sole trader’s deductible business expenses. Therefore, an adjustment to the sole trader’s assessable business income is needed to reflect the fact the sole trader has taken some trading stock. This adjustment is provided for in s GC 1. Section GC 1 applies when: 2 (1) ... a person disposes of trading stock for— (a) no consideration: (b) an amount that is less than the market value of the trading stock at the time of disposal. 4. When s GC 1 applies: (2) The person is treated as deriving an amount equal to the market value of the trading stock at the time of disposal. 5. “Trading stock” is defined in s YA 1 for the purposes of s GC 1 as: trading stock— (a) ... (b) in sections ... GC 1 to GC 3 (which relate to the sale of trading stock for inadequate consideration)— (i) includes anything produced or manufactured: (ii) includes anything acquired for the purposes of manufacture or disposal: (iii) includes livestock: (iv) includes timber or a right to take timber: (v) includes land whose disposal would produce income under any of sections CB 6 to CB 15 (which relate to income from land): (vi) includes anything for which expenditure is incurred and which would be trading stock if possession of it were taken: (vii) does not include a financial arrangement to which the financial arrangements rules or the old financial arrangements rules apply: (c) for the purposes of section GC 1 (Disposals of trading stock at below market value), has an expanded meaning as set out in section GC 1(4): (d) ... 6. This definition of “trading stock” includes not only finished and partially finished goods but also (under paragraph (ii)) raw materials. Also, the definition is extended by s GC 1(4) to include an interest in trading stock: (4) In this section, trading stock includes an interest in trading stock. 7. It is also important to note that s GC 1 requires the market value to be determined “at the time of disposal”. 8. The following questions arise in relation to trading stock taken for own use or consumption and s GC 1:  What is the “market value” of trading stock taken for own use?  Is taking trading stock a disposal?  Does the “mutuality principle” apply? These questions are discussed below. What is the “market value” of trading stock taken for own use? 9. “Market value” is a flexible concept and has not been legislatively defined, so it bears its ordinary meaning. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011) defines the ordinary meaning of “market value” as: market value  n. the amount for which something can be sold on a given market. 10. “Market value” is a term that appears throughout the Act, with its meaning determined according to the surrounding circumstances. It was considered by the 3 courts, particularly in respect of its ordinary meaning, in Hatrick v CIR \[1936\] NZLR 641 at 661: The test has been variously phrased, but in essence it calls for an enquiry as to the value at which a willing but not over anxious vendor would sell and a willing but not over anxious purchaser would buy. 11. The ordinary meaning of “market value” is the current selling value in the ordinary course of business in the relevant taxpayer’s own selling market. This is shown in Australasian Jam Co Pty Ltd v FCT (1953) 88 CLR 23 at 31, where Fullagar J said: But it is not to be supposed that the expression “market selling value” contemplates a sale on the most disadvantageous terms conceivable. It contemplates, in my opinion, a sale or sales in the ordinary course of the company's business — such sales as are in fact effected. Such expression in such provisions must always be interpreted in a common sense way with due regard to business realities ... \[Emphasis added\] 12. Accordingly, market value will be ascertained for the purposes of s GC 1 with reference to the market or markets into which the sole trader would have otherwise sold the particular trading stock in the ordinary course of their business. In instances where trading stock is sold in different markets (eg, retail and trade) the relevant market will depend on the individual circumstances of the sole trader’s business. If the trading stock is committed for sale to, or is predominately available to, a particular identifiable market, then that is the relevant market. Otherwise, trading stock available for sale in any one of several markets should be valued using a weighted average. 13. As stated, the market value at which the trading stock needs to be accounted for is the amount the particular trading stock would have fetched in the relevant market or markets in the ordinary course of the sole trader’s business. Therefore, this amount will also reflect normal business decisions to clear or exit stock lines for a variety of reasons, including seasonal factors, end of shelf-life, and fashion or technological changes. 14. Accordingly, it may be that the market value of trading stock taken for own use or consumption is at or below its cost (including having nil value). In the latter situation, the income adjustment under s GC 1 will be less than the deduction allowed for the costs of acquiring, growing or manufacturing the trading stock. 15. The High Court noted the possibility of this outcome in Foodstuffs (Wellington) Co-operative Society Ltd v CIR (2010) 24 NZTC 23,959 where the court considered whether s GD 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (a predecessor of s GC 1) applied. Simon France J in Foodstuffs considered there may be instances where the section “has no bite”: \[30\] ... The farmer could be analysed in another way — he or she has acquired trading stock for which a deduction has been claimed; if he or she chooses to destroy the stock, it is to be deemed to be done at market value. What that market value is will depend on the reason why it is destroyed. If, for example, it is destroyed because the stock is worthless, or because no buyer can be found, then presumably the market value is nil so s GD 1 has no bite. If, however, it is healthy stock the farmer chooses to use for his own provision, then s GD 1(1)(a) and (b) are applicable without needing to describe the farmer as a private transferee of his or her own trading stock. \[Emphasis added\] The view that no issue arises under the section because the trading stock has a nil market value was also accepted by the Commissioner in respect of perishable food that had passed its use-by date (Foodstuffs at \[18\]). 16. Another possible situation is where the trading stock taken for own use or consumption is raw materials of the taxpayer’s business and those raw materials are not normally sold in the course of that business (eg, where a café owner takes some raw materials from the café kitchen). The market value of the raw 4 materials cannot be readily ascertained because they are not normally sold in the course of the business. In that situation there must be some next best way of estimating the market value of the raw materials. The Commissioner accepts that in most cases the next best way of estimating market value is to look at the value at which those raw materials are being traded in an arm’s length transaction in other markets. This is likely to be the market in which the sole trader acquired the raw materials. That is, the next best way of ascertaining market value in this situation is to use the current replacement price of the raw materials. Where the raw materials are perishables or otherwise have a short useful life and are being taken shortly after acquisition, the current replacement price in many cases will often be the original cost. 17. Therefore, it is important that sole traders maintain accurate records of the quantity and market value of trading stock taken at the time of taking the trading stock to avoid difficulties in determining at a later stage the market value of the items. This is especially relevant for trading stock that is subject to fluctuations in market value (eg, livestock or the fresh produce of market gardeners). Is taking trading stock a disposal? 18. Section GC 1 applies when there is a disposal of trading stock. Ordinarily, “disposal” means the process of disposing or “to get rid of” something (see: Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12 th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011). This raises the question of whether you can dispose of something to yourself (see also the discussion of the mutuality principle from paragraph 22 below). This question is important in the context of s GC 1 as to whether there is a disposal within the meaning of s GC 1 when a sole trader simply takes trading stock rather than sells it to another party. The answer is that s GC 1 applies in these circumstances. 19. The question arose in Foodstuffs and Simon France J concluded that s GD 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 did not require “disposal” to be read narrowly and adopted a meaning for the term of simply to have “got rid” of something. His Honour stated: \[12\] The shares are trading stock, they have been disposed of, and the taxpayer received no money for them. That is the essence of the Commissioner’s argument. Prior to cancellation the shares were worth $2.3 million; the cancellation was a disposal and $2.3 million is the deemed income. \[13\] I do not consider there is any doubt that on its face cancellation of the shares falls within the concept of “disposal”. The holder of the shares has got rid of them; it has disposed of them. Nothing in the Act suggests that disposal is generally to be read narrowly. \[Emphasis added\] 20. Simon France J concluded further that there was no requirement for there to be a purchaser of the trading stock before the section could apply: \[28\] I do not see that it matters that there is not a purchaser or transferee concerning whom an equivalent adjustment is required. The purchaser is irrelevant to the need to adjust the accounts of the owner of the trading stock which has disposed of its property. The taxpayer bought the shares, chose to treat them as trading stock, chose to bring them within its “revenue account property” and claimed the deduction for the purchase price. When the taxpayer then chooses to dispose of the trading stock, there must be an adjustment to its tax position regardless of whether the method of disposal has further implications for a different taxpayer. ... \[30\] The fact that in many of these situations the transaction is analysed or rationalised in terms of creating a transferor and transferee (the farmer as trading stock owner and the same farmer as private consumer) does not mean that every s GD 1 situation must be capable of such analysis to properly come within s GD 1. \[Emphasis added\] 5 21. Also, as can be seen from the court’s reference to a farmer (Foodstuffs at \[30\] quoted above) it accepted the view that the section applied where a farmer consumes their own stock. The court considered the section applied by creating the fiction of the farmer as a sole trader and the farmer as a private person who is the nominal transferee of the livestock at market value (Foodstuffs \[17\] and \[18\]). Does the “mutuality principle” apply? 22. Another question that may arise in this context is one involving the application of the “mutuality principle”. This principle can be described as “a man could not make a profit by trading with himself”. The principle was established in the leading case of New York Insurance Company v Styles (1889) 14 App Cas 381 (HL). It has been applied in a New Zealand context in New Zealand Plumbers’ Merchants Society Ltd v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,136 (CA) at 5,139. 23. Requiring a sole trader to account for trading stock taken for own use or consumption at market value (rather than cost price) appears to require a taxpayer to account for a profit from trading with themselves. 24. However, mutuality does not apply in this context to override the clear words of the legislation that require an adjustment at market value. This issue arose in Sharkey v Wernher \[1956\] AC 58 (HL) where their Lordships approved Watson Brothers v Hornby \[1942\] 2 All ER 506, and Viscount Simonds stated (at 70): This decision \[in Watson Brothers v Hornby\], which your Lordships were told has ever since been adopted as the basis of assessment by the Revenue in similar cases, involves two things, first, that the taxpayer may in certain cases be subject to a sort of dichotomy for income tax purposes and be regarded as selling to himself in one capacity what he has produced in another, and, secondly, that he is regarded as selling what he sells at market price. \[Emphasis added\] 25. In CIR v Farmers’ Trading Company Ltd \[1982\] 1 NZLR 449 the Court of Appeal confirmed that the conclusion reached in Sharkey v Wernher represented well-settled law. The court stated (at 462): Questions as to the treatment of stock in the accounts of a trader also arise wherever there is a transfer of assets between trading account and private account. In that situation it is well settled that an assessment must be made of the value of the assets at the time they were committed to or withdrawn from the income earning activity as the case may be, and that the value must be reflected in the accounts for income tax purposes (Sharkey v. Wernher \[1956\] A.C. 58; Bernard Elsey Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1969) 121 CLR 119; and 5 NZTBR Case 49). Examples 26. The following examples use simple facts to help explain the application of the principles discussed above and the consequential tax adjustments that arise. Example 1 — Market value adjustment determined at the time of disposal 27. Peter is a livestock farmer and has a 30 June balance date. He is planning a large family gathering early in July 2015 to celebrate his daughter’s 21st birthday. As part of this planning, Peter arranges for one of his cattle beasts to be slaughtered to provide food for the celebration. This occurs on 28 June 2015. 28. “Trading stock” is defined in s YA 1 as including livestock for the purposes s GC 1. Therefore, the cattle beast is treated under s GC 1 as having been disposed of at market value on 28 June 2015. Peter must return as income in his 2015 tax return the market value of the animal at the time because he is treated for income tax purposes as having disposed of it in the ordinary course of his farming business. Even though the meat was not consumed until July 2015, the time of disposal is the date on which the animal was taken from trading stock in June 2015, and not the later date of consumption. 6 29. The market value of the animal Peter must return as income in his 2015 tax return will be the current value of the cattle beast in June 2015 in the market in which he would have sold the animal in the ordinary course of his farming business. Peter could use the market value of similar animals he had sold at the time or rely on published schedules of livestock and sale yard prices. Example 2 — Market value adjustment reflects normal business trading, raw materials and using averages for small value items 30. John owns a retail bakery. The bakery sells sweet and savoury baked goods that are prepared fresh each day. Due to the amount of time John spends at the bakery he often finds it easier and more convenient to eat or take home food items acquired as trading stock for the business. The items of trading stock are:  Freshly baked goods that would have been sold in the course of the day’s trading.  Stale and left-over baked goods that would have been unsaleable.  Ingredients that would have been used as raw materials in the bakery (eg, flour). 31. “Trading stock” is defined in s YA 1 for the purposes of s GC 1 as including anything produced or manufactured and anything acquired for the purposes of manufacture or disposal. This means all of the food items taken by John are treated as “trading stock”. 32. John is aware that he needs to make income tax adjustments for the trading stock that he takes or consumes. Accordingly, starting on 1 April 2014 he keeps a record of the food items he takes or consumes and determines their market value. He determines the market value of the items of freshly baked goods as equal to the amount they would have usually sold for in the course of his bakery business. He determines the market value of the stale and left-over goods as nil as they could not be sold in the business and would otherwise have been dumped. This value reflects normal business trading. 33. The ingredients he takes are not usually sold in the course of the bakery business. Therefore, John needs to estimate their market value. In this case, John determines that the best way to estimate this value would be to use the current replacement cost of the ingredients. He realises that this would usually mean using the amount it would cost him to replace them. However, as the ingredients are perishables taken by him shortly after their acquisition, the cost price of each item is likely to still represent their current replacement cost. Accordingly, he uses the ingredient’s cost price as his estimate of their market value. 34. John’s situation involves numerous small value items of trading stock. The need to maintain these records on an on-going basis places a significant compliance burden on him. Instead, John maintains (and retains) these records for part of an income year that is a suitably representative period. From these records he determines that, on average, the market value of all trading stock he takes or consumes in a typical week is $50. Throughout the balance of the income year the amount of trading stock John consumes or takes remains consistent with the period for which he kept records. As a result, John makes an adjustment using the average of $50 per week. He makes an adjustment in his 2015 income tax return of $2,600. 35. Subsequently, the Commissioner audits John’s 2015 income tax return. In respect of the $2,600 adjustment, she establishes that John has made an estimate of the adjustment required by s GC 1 using records for a suitably representative period and that he has retained these records with his business 7 records. The Commissioner would not seek to alter John’s estimate of the adjustment required under s GC 1 after considering the following factors:  the resources available to the Commissioner;  what the Commissioner would consider to be a typical amount for these types of adjustments;  John’s good compliance history; and  the compliance costs involved for John to now obtain actual records for the entire year. 36. The above result is based on the stated facts. The outcome would likely be different and the Commissioner would seek further evidence if:  John had not kept good records;  his previous tax compliance history had been poor;  the amount of the adjustment appeared unreasonable;  the amounts involved were significantly greater; or  the number of transactions was significantly less. Example 3 — Goods acquired for private purposes 37. The following two scenarios involving a builder and a farmer illustrate different aspects of the same point concerning whether goods have been acquired as trading stock or for private purposes. Whether goods have been acquired as trading stock or for private purposes will be a question of fact that needs to be decided on a case by case basis. The Commissioner strongly recommends that a record is kept or invoices are notated at the time of purchase where goods are acquired for private purposes through the taxpayer’s business. 38. During the 2015 income year, a builder constructs their private residence. The materials for this construction project are purchased on trade terms through the business’s normal suppliers of trading stock. The builder pays for the materials through the business bank account with the costs charged to personal drawings in their 2015 financial accounts. The costs of the materials are not included in the builder’s business purchases for the year as business expenses. 39. A farmer buys 20 steer calves for $300 each in October 2014. Two of the calves are surplus to the farming operation’s requirements and the farmer intends holding them for private consumption in the future. The two calves are identified at the time of purchase and their cost is charged to the farmer’s drawings for the 2015 income year. In May and October 2016 the farmer kills the two animals identified on purchase and puts the meat in the freezer. 40. The builder and farmer have both purchased goods to be used for private purposes. The builder has acquired building materials privately from normal suppliers of trading stock. The farmer has acquired livestock privately from a normal supplier of trading stock, concurrently with acquiring trading stock. 41. In both scenarios, there was never any intention or need for those goods to be used in their businesses. Section GC 1 has no application in this situation because in these circumstances it is clear the goods have not at any time formed part of the trading stock of the relevant business. For income tax purposes, the costs of the goods purchased privately have been correctly accounted for by being debited to the taxpayers’ current accounts as personal drawings. 8 References Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007, ss GC 1(1)–(4) and YA 1 Income Tax Act 1994, s GD 1(1) Subject references Income tax Market value Own consumption Own use Private consumption Private use Trading stock Related rulings or statements “Review of Public Information Bulletins” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011), at 116 “Value of produce used” Public Information Bulletin No 29 (February 1966), at 7 Case references Australasian Jam Co Pty Ltd v FCT (1953) 88 CLR 23 Farmers’ Trading Company Ltd; CIR v \[1982\] 1 NZLR 449 (CA) Foodstuffs (Wellington) Co-operative Society Ltd v CIR (2010) 24 NZTC 23,959 Hatrick v CIR \[1936\] NZLR 641 New York Insurance Company v Styles (1889) 14 App Cas 381 (HL) New Zealand Plumbers’ Merchants Society Ltd v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,136 (CA) Sharkey v Wernher \[1956\] AC 58 (HL) Watson Brothers v Hornby \[1942\] 2 All ER 506 Other references Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12 th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011)
1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 14/02 INCOME TAX – ENTRY OF A NEW PARTNER INTO A PARTNERSHIP – EFFECT ON CONTINUING PARTNERS All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about ss HG 2, and YA 1 definitions of “dispose” and “partner’s interests”. Question 1. We have been asked when the entry of a new partner into a partnership will have income tax consequences for continuing partners. Answer 2. A taxable event is not triggered for continuing partners if a new partner simply “steps into the shoes” of an exiting partner and the continuing partners’ interests in the assets of the partnership have not been changed. 3. However, there will be a taxable event for continuing partners if the addition of the new partner changes the continuing partners’ interests in the partnership assets. 4. Where a taxable event arises for a continuing partner, the provisions of ss HG 5 to HG 10 then apply to determine whether the continuing partner needs to account for tax. If there is a disposal, then the partner will need to apply ss HG 5 to HG 10 to determine whether there is any tax payable. These provisions are safe harbour provisions that remove the need for a partner to account for tax when the required adjustment would be below certain thresholds. Explanation 5. Under common law, the entry or exit of a partner to or from a partnership results in the dissolution of the old partnership and the formation of a new partnership. This could lead to tax consequences for continuing partners when a new partner enters a partnership, even where partnership interests are not changed. 6. In 2008 new tax rules for partnerships were introduced. These were intended to codify and clarify various aspects of the partnership rules. Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 20, No. 8 (September/October 2008) explained the new rules. The TIB contained the following statement: The introduction of a new partner into a partnership does not trigger a tax event for the existing partners. This is because the addition of a new partner would not result in a disposal of partnership property for an existing partner under s YA 1. 7. This statement could be seen as suggesting that the entry of a new partner into a partnership will never trigger a tax event for continuing partners and has created some uncertainty. We have, therefore, been asked to set out the Commissioner’s position on this issue. Partnerships are transparent 8. The Act treats partnerships as transparent. Section HG 2 gives effect to this. It deems everything done by the partnership to be done by the partners in proportion to their partnership share. Section HG 2(1) and (2) state: HG 2 Partnerships are transparent 2 Look-through in accordance with share (1) For the purposes of a partner’s liabilities and obligations under this Act in their capacity of partner of a partnership, unless the context requires otherwise,— (a) the partner is treated as carrying on an activity carried on by the partnership, and having a status, intention, and purpose of the partnership, and the partnership is treated as not carrying on the activity or having the status, intention, or purpose: (b) the partner is treated as holding property that a partnership holds, in proportion to the partner’s partnership share, and the partnership is treated as not holding the property: (c) the partner is treated as being party to an arrangement to which the partnership is a party, in proportion to the partner’s partnership share, and the partnership is treated as not being a party to the arrangement: (d) the partner is treated as doing a thing and being entitled to a thing that the partnership does or is entitled to, in proportion to the partner’s partnership share, and the partnership is treated as not doing the thing or being entitled to the thing. No streaming (2) Despite subsection (1), for a partner in their capacity of partner of a partnership, the amount of income, tax credit, rebate, gain, expenditure, or loss that they have from a particular source, or of a particular nature, is calculated by multiplying the total income, tax credit, rebate, gain, expenditure, or loss of the partners of the partnership from the particular source or of the particular nature by the partner’s partnership share in the partnership’s income. 9. “Partnership share” is defined in s YA 1: partnership share means, for a particular right, obligation, or other property, status, or thing, the share that a partner has in the partnership. 10. Section HG 2 applies “unless the context requires otherwise”. In the Commissioner’s view nothing in the context of the provisions being considered in this item suggests that s HG 2 should not apply. Also, s HG 2 applies regardless of the particular terms of the partnership agreement (although the partnership agreement may set out what the partner’s partnership share is). Consequently, where partnership assets are disposed of, the Act treats the disposal as being made by the partners. 11. An issue that arises when a new partner enters a partnership is whether there are tax consequences for the continuing partners. In particular, the issue is whether a continuing partner is treated as having disposed of partnership property when a new partner enters the partnership. When a continuing partner “disposes” of partnership property 12. Under partnership law, when a partner leaves and/or a new partner enters a partnership, the original partnership is dissolved and a new partnership is formed. This would arguably have the effect of all partners disposing of (and, subsequently, reacquiring) their interests each time a partner leaves a partnership. However, the definition of “dispose” in s YA 1 means that this does not happen. “Dispose” expressly excludes the situation where a partner’s interest is treated as disposed of by operation of law because another partner disposes of that partner’s interests (unless the partnership is finally dissolved). It is noted that this QWBA does not cover the situation where a partnership is finally dissolved. 13. “Dispose” is relevantly defined in s YA 1 as: dispose,— ... (h) for a partner,— 3 (i) includes surrendering or extinguishing some or all of their partner’s interests: (ii) does not include when their partner’s interests may be treated as disposed of by operation of law because another partner disposes of that partner’s interests, unless section HG 4 (Disposal upon final dissolution) applies 14. “Partner’s interests” as defined in s YA 1: means the relevant interests in rights and obligations and other property, status, and things that a partner has as a result of applying section HG 2 (Partnerships are transparent) 15. “Dispose” is defined inclusively. Therefore, it also carries its ordinary meaning. The ordinary meaning of “dispose” is to “get rid of” (Concise Oxford English Dictionary 12 th ed, 2011). This commonly includes disposals by way of sale or other transfer. 16. “Dispose” is also expressly defined to include “surrendering or extinguishing” some or all of a partner’s interests. Neither “surrender” nor “extinguish” is defined in the Act. “Extinguish” is relevantly defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary as “to put an end to” “to render (a right or obligation) void”. “Surrender” is relevantly defined as “give up (a person, right or possession) on compulsion or demand”. 17. The ordinary meaning of “extinguish” implies that something ceases to exist. This does not seem to fit the current situations where partnership interests continue to exist (although they are held by a different person). However, it is considered that the ordinary meaning of “surrender” is wide enough to cover situations where a partner gives up some or all of their partnership interests to a new partner. It also covers both voluntary and involuntary situations. 18. Therefore, there will be a “disposal” for a partner if they sell, transfer, or surrender some or all of their interests in the partnership property (as determined under s HG 2). As noted above, a partner is treated as holding partnership property in proportion to the partner’s partnership share. 19. For a continuing partnership, a disposal by one partner of their partner’s interest will not automatically trigger a disposal by the remaining partners (s YA 1, paragraph (h)(ii) of the definition of “disposal”). Therefore, to be a “disposal” there must be some change in the partner’s interest in the partnership property. If there is a “disposal” then the “safe harbour” provisions in ss HG 5 to HG 10 could potentially apply (see \[24\] below). 20. If a new partner purchases the partnership interests of an exiting partner, there will be an acquisition by the new partner and a disposal by the exiting partner. However, there will be no disposal by the continuing partners. This is because the continuing partners’ “partner’s interests” remain the same before and after the disposal by the exiting partner. This is illustrated by Example 1, below. 21. If a new partner purchases a share of the continuing partners’ partnership assets, then there will be a partial disposal by those continuing partners. This is because those partners will have disposed of part of their partnership interests to the new partner. This is illustrated by Example 2, below. 22. The situation is less clear when a new partner introduces additional capital to the partnership. Take for example a partnership between X and Y where the only asset is land worth $200,000. Z joins the partnership by contributing funds of $100,000. It could be argued that nothing has changed for X and Y. Prior to Z joining the partnership, they each owned a 50% share of $200,000 worth of assets. They now each have a one-third share of $300,000 worth of assets. However, the Commissioner considers that the correct view is that X and Y have each disposed of part of their share of the partnership assets. 4 23. This is because, under s HG 2, X and Y were previously deemed to own a 50% share of the land. After the entry of Z into the partnership, X and Y are each deemed to own a one-third share of the land and a one-third share of the $100,000. The effect of s HG 2 is, therefore, that X and Y have each disposed of part of their share of the land to Z. This is illustrated by Example 3, below. Consequences of disposition 24. If there is a disposal, then the partner will need to apply ss HG 5 to HG 10 to determine whether there is any tax payable. These provisions are safe harbour provisions that remove the need for a partner to account for tax when the required adjustment would be below certain thresholds. 25. The item applies to tax positions taken in the 2014-15 and later income years. Examples 26. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. Example 1 – Exiting partner disposes of interest to new partner 27. Llama Farms Ltd and Reindeer Farms Ltd each have a 50% interest in a farming partnership. There are $1 million of assets in the partnership. Wallaby Farms Ltd purchases Llama Farms Ltd’s share of the partnership for $500,000. Under the Act, Wallaby Farms Ltd is simply stepping into the shoes of Llama Farms Ltd. There are no tax consequences for Reindeer Farms Ltd because its interests in the partnership and the underlying net assets have not changed (that is, they remain at 50% of $1 million). Example 2 – Entry of new partner dilutes interests of continuing partners 28. Chris and Jo are partners who each own 50% of a forestry partnership. The forestry partnership holds assets worth $5 million. A new partner, Alex, enters the partnership, purchasing $4 million of Chris and Jo’s partnership assets. As a result, Alex’s share in the partnership becomes 80%, and Chris and Jo’s shares in the partnership have been reduced to 10% each. Applying a look-through approach (as required by s HG 2), Chris and Jo’s individual interests in the underlying partnership assets have each been reduced from $2.5 million to $500,000. 29. Chris and Jo have, therefore, both disposed of some of their “partner’s interests”, as their interests in the underlying assets of the partnership have been reduced. 30. There will be a taxable event for Chris and Jo because Chris and Jo have disposed of some of the interests in the partnership assets to Alex. Chris and Jo would then need to determine whether they should account for tax according to the provisions of ss HG 5 to HG 10. Example 3 – New partner introduces additional capital to the partnership 31. Jack and Nicky own a block of land worth $200,000. Applying the principle in s HG 2, Jack and Nicky each own 50% of the land. Their neighbour, Lisa, joins the partnership and contributes her adjoining land, worth $100,000, to the partnership. The result is that the partnership assets have increased to a total of $300,000. 32. As a result of Lisa joining the partnership, all partners now have a one-third share of the partnership, and each owns one-third of the underlying partnership assets. Applying the principle in s HG 2, Jack and Nicky have each sold part of their interest in the land that they own to Lisa, in exchange for a share of Lisa’s land. 5 There has been a disposal of the continuing partners’ underlying assets, which results in an event that will have to be considered for taxation purposes if the land is on revenue account.

1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 14/03 GST – TRANSFER OF INTEREST IN A PARTNERSHIP All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This question we've been asked is about ss 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 14, 51 and 57. This item updates and replaces Question 108 published in Public Information Bulletin No 158, p 26 (November 1986) and an item entitled “GST Treatment of the Sale of an Interest in a Taxable Activity” published in Public Information Bulletin No 164, p 31 (August 1987). Both items deal with the GST treatment of the sale of an interest in a partnership. The current relevance of this information was identified during a review of content published in Public Information Bulletins and Tax Information Bulletins before 1996. The Public Information Bulletin review has now been completed, see “Update on Public Information Bulletin review” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25, No 10 (November 2013). This item covers the situation where an interest in a partnership is transferred from one partner to another, either new or existing, partner. It does not cover the situation where a new partner receives a partnership interest in return for a contribution to the partnership capital. This item does not cover the GST consequences of a final dissolution of a partnership (including where a partnership is dissolved as the result of a partner acquiring all the interests of other partners). Question 1. Is a transfer of an interest in a partnership subject to GST? Answer 2. Most transfers of partnership interests will not be subject to GST as the supply will not be made by a registered person or, if the transferor is registered, will not be a supply made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the transferor. 3. A transfer will be subject to GST if the transferor is registered for GST and the transfer is a supply made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the transferor. In addition, the interest in the partnership must not be a “participatory security” or an “equity security”. A transfer will be an exempt supply and, therefore, not subject to GST if the partnership interest is a “participatory security” or an “equity security”. 4. Generally, a partnership interest will be a “participatory security” where entry into the partnership involves an investment of money (or money’s worth), and where the partnership has more than five partners (or a manager (or person associated with the manager) who also manages another such arrangement). 5. A partnership interest will be an “equity security” where the partnership is a body corporate (for example, a limited partnership registered under s 51 of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008). 2 Explanation 6. Section 8(1) imposes GST on supplies of goods and services made in New Zealand. “Supply” includes all forms of supply (s 5(1)) and “services” are defined as “anything which is not goods or money” (s 2). 7. To be subject to GST a supply must be made by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person. A person is a “registered person” if they are registered, or liable to be registered, under the Act (s 2). A person’s liability to be registered turns on the value of supplies they make, or expect to make, in New Zealand in a 12-month period (s 51). 8. A “taxable activity” is an activity carried on continuously or regularly by a person and which involves, or is intended to involve, the supply of goods or services (s 6(1)). An activity is not a taxable activity to the extent it involves making exempt supplies (s 6(3)(d)). 9. A partnership (which is not a limited partnership) is the “relation which subsists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view to profit” (s 4 of the Partnership Act 1908). That relationship gives rise to an unincorporated body of persons that does not have a legal personality separate from its members. For GST purposes, an “unincorporated body” in s 2 means “an unincorporated body of persons, including a partnership”. An “unincorporated body of persons” is also a separate “person” for the purposes of the Act. Therefore, a partnership is a separate “person” for GST purposes. 10. A supply is not subject to GST if it is an exempt supply (s 8(1)). “Exempt supplies” include supplies of financial services (s 14(1)(a)). “Financial services” include the “issue, allotment or transfer of ownership of an equity security or a participatory security” (s 3(1)(d)). Application of s 57 11. Section 57(2) sets out some specific rules that apply when an unincorporated body carries on a taxable activity and is registered. Subsection (2)(e) says: Subject to subsections 3 to 3B, any change of members of that body shall have no effect for the purposes of this Act. 12. It has been suggested that this wording means that a supply of an interest in a partnership has no GST effect. That is not the Commissioner’s view. The subsection refers to a change of members of a body. It is possible to have a transfer of a partnership interest without having a change of members. That will be the case when an existing partner transfers some, but not all, of their interest in a partnership to one or more of the other partners. In that case, the partnership interests have changed but the members of the partnership have not changed. 13. In the Commissioner’s view, the reference to a change of members, rather than to changes of membership interests, indicates the intended scope of the provision. For GST purposes, a registered unincorporated body, including a partnership, is treated as continuing to be the same body despite a change of members. For example, if a partnership has 25 partners and two retire and one new partner joins, the change of members does not create a new unincorporated body for GST purposes. The partnership is treated as being the same registered person before and after the change of members. It is noted that a partnership that reduces to one partner (and, therefore, is no longer a partnership at general law) will also no longer be an “unincorporated body of persons” or a partnership for GST purposes. 3 14. Section 57(2) is still relevant to the transfer of an interest in a GST-registered partnership because:  members of a partnership cannot register in relation to carrying on the taxable activity carried on by a GST-registered partnership (s 57(2)(a)),  any supply made in the course of carrying on a partnership’s taxable activity is treated as supplied by the partnership and not by the partners (s 57(2)(b)), and  any supply made by a partner in their capacity as a partner is treated as made by the partnership and not the partner (s 57(2)(c)). 15. Accordingly, if the only taxable activity a person is involved in is that carried on by a partnership, the person cannot register for GST. If a partner carries on another taxable activity in their own right, the supplies made by the partnership cannot be counted to determine whether the partner is liable to register for GST in their own right. 16. Even where a partner in a GST registered partnership is registered for GST in their own right, because they carry on some other taxable activity, a supply by them of an interest in the partnership can be liable to GST only if the partner makes that supply in the course or furtherance of that other taxable activity (and it is not an exempt supply). That is, the partnership interest is held, and then transferred, in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity carried on by the partner. This could arise in situations where the taxpayer holds the partnership interest as part of a separate taxable activity carried on by that partner in their individual capacity. Alternatively, a partner could carry on a taxable activity of buying and selling partnership interests. 17. The supply made by the partner in such cases is of a partnership interest, which is a chose in action (and, therefore, a service). The supply is not the supply of a portion of the underlying assets held by the partnership. Consequently, the nature of the underlying assets does not affect the characterisation of the supply as exempt, standard-rated, or zero-rated. For example, the transfer of an interest in a land-owning partnership would not be zero-rated under s 11(1)(mb). 18. In summary, for a partner of a GST-registered partnership:  the partner is not liable to register for GST for the activities of the partnership,  any supplies made by the partnership do not count towards determining whether the partner has to register for GST in their own right, and  if the partner is registered for GST in their own right, a transfer of an interest in a partnership will be subject to GST only if it is a supply made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the partner (ie, not the partnership taxable activity) and is not an exempt supply. 19. The two potentially relevant types of exempt supplies in the context of partnerships are “participatory securities” and “equity securities”. These are considered below.   Participatory security 20. “Participatory security” is defined in s 3(2) as: ... any interest or right to participate in any capital, assets, earnings, or other property of any person where that interest or right forms part of a contributory scheme (as defined in section 4 2 of the Securities Act 1978); ... but does not include an equity security, a debt security, money, or a cheque:   21. The Commissioner’s view is that an interest in a partnership is an “interest or right to participate in any capital, assets, earnings, or other property of any person”. 22. A partnership interest will not be an “equity security” (unless the partnership is a body corporate, for example, a limited partnership registered under s 51 of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008). A partnership interest is not a “debt security” as it is not a right to be paid money that is, or is to be, owing by any person. Further, a partnership interest is neither “money”, nor “cheques”. 23. “Contributory scheme” is defined in s 2 of the Securities Act 1978 as: Contributory scheme means any scheme or arrangement that, in substance and irrespective of the form thereof, involves the investment of money in such circumstances that— (a) the investor acquires or may acquire an interest in or right in respect of property; and (b) pursuant to the terms of investment that interest or right will or may be used or exercised in conjunction with any other interest in or right in respect of property acquired in like circumstances, whether at the same time or not;— but does not include such a scheme or arrangement if the number of investors therein does not exceed 5, and neither a manager of the scheme nor any associated person is a manager of any other such scheme or arrangement: 24. “Money” in s 2 of the Securities Act 1978 includes “money’s worth”. 25. The Commissioner’s view is that a partnership interest will be a “contributory scheme” where it involves an “investment of money” and where the partnership meets the size threshold. 26. A partnership interest will involve an investment of money where partners lay out money (or money’s worth) in the hope of return from the partnership (in the form of capital or income or both). The return could be in the form of cash, or in kind, such as the provision of services (see Culverden Retirement Village v The Registrar of Companies \[1997\] 1 NZLR 257 (PC)). 27. A partnership will meet the size threshold if it has greater than 5 partners or a manager of the arrangement (or an associated person) is a manager of another such arrangement. Equity security 28. An “equity security” is “any interest in or right to a share in the capital of a body corporate” (s 3(2)). Accordingly the supply of an interest in a partnership that is a body corporate is an exempt supply and not subject to GST. 29. A limited partnership, registered under s 51 of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008, “is a separate legal person” (ss 6 and 11 of the Limited Partnership Act 2008). A limited partnership is deemed to be a “company” for GST purposes (see s 2 of the GST Act), although it is not specifically deemed to be a body corporate. “Body corporate” is defined in Butterworths New Zealand Law Dictionary (LexisNexis, 2011) as “an association of persons regarded in law as a single legal person”. This is also consistent with the definition of “body corporate” in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (6th ed). The Commissioner’s view is, therefore, that a limited partnership is a “body corporate” for the purposes of the Act. 5 30. Whether an interest in a limited partnership established in a foreign jurisdiction is an “equity security” will depend on whether that limited partnership is treated under that foreign law as a body corporate. Examples Example 1 – New Partner Joins Partnership 31. Mary, Jane and Dave are equal partners in Sports Law, a GST-registered partnership. The partnership makes taxable supplies of around $500,000 per year. Jane carries on a part-time business as a personal trainer and makes supplies in that business of around $15,000 per year. Jane is not registered for GST. Dave owns a farm and is registered for GST for his farming activity. Mary is not registered for GST. 32. Bob, a senior employee of Sports Law, is invited to become an equal partner in the firm. Bob makes a cash payment to each of Mary, Jane and Dave. The effect of Bob joining the partnership is that Mary, Dave and Jane each transfer 1/4 of their interest in the partnership to Bob. That is a supply made by each of them. These supplies are not subject to GST because they are not supplies made by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. 33. Mary is not required to be personally registered for GST for the partnership’s taxable activity. Although Jane carries on a taxable activity, as a personal trainer, the supplies she makes in that activity are under the registration threshold. The supplies made by the partnership are not taken into account in determining whether Jane has to register. Dave is registered for GST but the supply of the partnership interest is not a supply made in the course or furtherance of his taxable activity of farming. Example 2 – Sale of Partnership Interest and Separate Property 34. Robert, Helen and Bruce carry on practice as accountants through a GST- registered partnership. As senior partner, Robert has a 50% interest in the partnership. Robert also owns the building in which the partnership business is carried on. Robert is personally registered for GST for his taxable activity of renting out commercial buildings, including the building rented to the partnership. 35. Robert decides to retire and he agrees to sell his share in the partnership to Michelle. The sale agreement also includes the sale of the practice premises to Michelle. 36. The supply of the partnership interest from Robert to Michelle is not subject to GST. Although Robert is registered for GST, he does not make the supply of the partnership interest in the course or furtherance of his taxable activity (his rental activity). The supply of the building is subject to GST. The building is not a partnership asset. The building is Robert’s separate property that he supplies to Michelle in the course of his taxable activity. As that is a supply of an interest in land, the correct GST treatment (ie, whether this supply is zero-rated) will depend on whether Michelle is registered, or liable to be registered, for GST and her intended use of the building. Example 3 – Partner Previously Carried on Partnership Activity 37. Simon bought a farm and registered for GST. After two years of farming Simon entered into partnership with two of his children, Fiona and Diane. The partnership registered for GST and Simon sold the farming business, including the land, to the partnership. This supply was zero-rated, as it included a supply of land. Simon did not deregister for GST because he had recently started a part- time pest control business. 6 38. After another two years, Simon’s son Brian returned from overseas and asked to join the partnership. By this stage Simon had decided to expand his pest control business into a full-time activity and he agreed to sell his partnership interest to Brian. 39. The sale of the partnership interest by Simon to Brian is not subject to GST. It is not a supply made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by Simon. Although Simon originally registered to carry on the taxable activity of farming the land that was subsequently farmed by the partnership, Simon is not carrying on that activity when he transfers the partnership interest to Brian. Simon carries on a taxable activity of pest control and the partnership interest is not supplied in the course or furtherance of that activity.

1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 14/04 INCOME TAX – DEPRECIATION ROLL-OVER RELIEF FOR CANTERBURY All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about s EZ 23B. Question 1. How does the formula in s EZ 23B(4) allocate the excess recovery amount when an item of affected property is replaced with one or more items of replacement property? Answer 2. The formula determines how much of the excess recovery amount is to be allocated against the cost of a particular replacement item. It does this with reference to the accumulated cost of other items of replacement property acquired before the particular replacement item (s EZ 23B(4) and (5)). This means that where only one replacement item is acquired, the cost of other items of replacement property acquired before the particular replacement item is zero. 3. Since the focus of this Question We’ve Been Asked is on the application and effect of the formula, it supplements the comprehensive analysis of s EZ 23B in “Canterbury earthquake relief measures” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 8 (October 2011) at 66–68. 4. The formula in s EZ 23B(4) applies to affected property not depreciated in a pool. Therefore, the scope of this Question We’ve Been Asked is limited to those classes of affected property not depreciated in a pool. Explanation 5. Section EZ 23B provides roll-over relief in respect of depreciation recovery income for taxpayers affected by the Canterbury earthquakes. It applies when a person receives insurance or compensation that gives rise to depreciation recovery income for items of depreciable property (called the affected property) lost or irreparably damaged in the Canterbury earthquakes (s EZ 23B(1)). Provided certain conditions are met, the amount that would be depreciation recovery income is available to be allocated against the cost of replacement items (s EZ 23B(2) and (3)). Any amount of depreciation recovery income not allocated to replacement items by the end of the 2018–19 income year at the latest is taxable as depreciation recovery income (ss EZ 23B(2B) and EZ 23B(8)). 6. This Question We’ve Been Asked clarifies the effect of the formula in s EZ 23B(4). The formula calculates the amount of the depreciation recovery income that can be allocated against the cost of the replacement property. There has been some confusion about how the formula works. The confusion appears to arise because one of the items in the formula uses the expenditure incurred in acquiring other items of replacement property instead of using the expenditure in acquiring the particular item of replacement property. This is necessary to ensure that the depreciation recovery income is not over-allocated to the particular replacement item. 7. The purpose of the depreciation roll-over relief provisions (s EZ 23B) is to provide affected taxpayers with options in relation to the potential tax liability on the 2 depreciation recovery income arising from the insurance or compensation received. In addition to the option of simply returning the depreciation recovery income, taxpayers can elect to use the depreciation roll-over relief provisions. This election gives taxpayers the further option to defer or “suspend” the recognition of the depreciation recovery income to a later income year (with the latest income year being the 2018–19 income year) or to suspend and “roll-over” the depreciation recovery income into the cost of the replacement item. 8. The formula progressively allocates the depreciation recovery amount to each item of replacement property as it is acquired (ie, on a “first-in-first-served” basis) until the total cost of the replacement item or items equals or is more than the cost of the affected class (s EZ 23B(4)). It works in the same way where multiple replacement items are acquired at the same time, because the items are treated as having been acquired in the order chosen by the person (s EZ 23B(11C)). 9. The effect of the formula is to roll-over into the cost of the replacement item or items all of the depreciation recovery arising from insurance or compensation received if the total cost of the replacement item or items equals or is more than the cost of the affected class (s EZ 23B(4)). 10. If, on the other hand, the total cost of all replacement items is less than the cost of the affected class, only a proportion of the depreciation recovery amount can be rolled-over into the cost of the replacement items. The balance of the depreciation recovered is recognised as income at or before the end of the 2018– 19 income year (s EZ 23B(2B) and EZ 23B(8)). 11. Any amount rolled-over to a replacement item reduces the adjusted tax value of the replacement item (s EZ 23B(3)(a) and EZ 23B(11)). This means that when the replacement item is eventually sold, the amount that was rolled-over to the replacement item will be fully taxable as depreciation recovery income provided the replacement item is sold for more than its adjusted tax value. The tax liability associated with disposal of the affected property has effectively been rolled forward until disposal of the replacement property. 12. If the affected property is not actually replaced, then any depreciation recovery income arising from the insurance or compensation received is brought into account as income in the earlier of:  the 2018–19 income year (s EZ 23B(8)(a));  the income year in which the person decides not to purchase more replacement property (s EZ 23B(8)(b)); or  the income year in which the person goes into liquidation or bankruptcy (s EZ 23B(8)(c)). How the formula works 13. The formula applies to the following groups or classes of affected property:  a building or grandparented structure (not depreciated in a pool) (s EZ 23B(10)(b)(i));  commercial fit-out (not depreciated in a pool) (s EZ 23B(10)(b)(ii));  other depreciable property (not depreciated in a pool) (s EZ 23B(10)(b)(iv)). 14. The following steps must be taken for each of these affected classes of depreciable property: 3 Step 1: Calculate the depreciation recovery income (called the excess recovery). Step 2: Calculate, using the formula, the amount (called the reduction amount for the purposes of this Question We’ve Been Asked) to be used for both:  allocating against the cost of the replacement item; and  reducing the amount of suspended recovery income. Step 3: Reduce the adjusted tax value of the replacement item by the reduction amount. Step 4: Reduce the suspended recovery income by the reduction amount. Repeat steps 2–4, if more than one replacement item is purchased. Step 5: Return any unallocated suspended recovery income as depreciation recovery income. Examples demonstrating how the formula works 15. The following three examples demonstrate how the formula works using the steps set out above. Examples 1 and 2 apply the formula to different scenarios where only one replacement item is acquired. Example 3 applies the formula to the situation where multiple replacement items are acquired. Example 1: Acquisition of a replacement building costing more than the destroyed building 16. Tom receives insurance proceeds of $10 million for a building destroyed in a Canterbury earthquake. The original cost of the building was $10 million and its adjusted tax value was $9 million. Tom plans to acquire a replacement building costing $12 million. 17. Because the cost of the replacement building is equal to or greater than the cost of the affected property, the whole excess recovery amount should be available to be rolled-over against the cost of the replacement building. Step 1: Calculate the excess recovery 18. The insurance proceeds exceed the building’s adjusted tax value by $1 million. Therefore, Tom has an excess recovery of $1 million. Step 2: Calculate the reduction amount 19. Tom now has to calculate the reduction amount by applying the following formula: limited replacement cost x excess affected cost 20. The limited replacement cost is the lesser of: (i) the amount by which the cost of the affected class (in this example, the destroyed building) exceeds the total expenditure in acquiring other replacement property before the replacement item; or (ii) the amount spent on the replacement item. 21. The affected cost is the total cost of the destroyed building. 4 22. No other replacement property has been acquired before the $12 million replacement building. Therefore, the amount under (i) above is: $10 million – $0 = $10 million 23. The amount spent on the replacement building under (ii) above is $12 million. 24. As the limited replacement cost is the lesser of these two amounts, the “limited replacement cost” is $10 million. The reduction amount can now be calculated using the following amounts in the above formula: $10 million x $1 million =$1 million $10 million Step 3: Reduce the adjusted tax value of the replacement item by the reduction amount 25. The reduction amount of $1 million is now available to roll-over into the adjusted tax value of the replacement building as follows: $12 million (cost of replacement property) – $1 million (the reduction amount) = $11 million (adjusted tax value) Step 4: Reduce the excess recovery by the reduction amount 26. The reduction amount of $1 million is now also available to reduce the excess recovery: $1 million (excess recovery) – $1 million (the reduction amount) = $0 27. Any amount remaining after reducing the excess recovery now becomes the suspended recovery income. Step 5: Return any unallocated suspended recovery income as depreciation recovery income 28. Since the excess recovery has been reduced to zero, Tom has no liability to return any unallocated suspended recovery income. Summary of example 1 29. In this example, the depreciation roll-over relief provisions act to: (a) fully allocate the depreciation recovery income of $1 million against the cost of the first and, in this example, the only replacement building, because its cost is greater than the cost of the destroyed building; (b) reduce the adjusted tax value of the replacement building to $11 million; (c) defer the recognition of depreciation recovery income of $1 million until the subsequent sale of the replacement building (assuming the building is sold for more than its adjusted tax value). Example 2: Acquisition of a replacement building costing less than the destroyed building 30. Kiwico Ltd receives insurance proceeds of $20 million for a building destroyed in a Canterbury earthquake. The original cost of the building was $20 million and its adjusted tax value was $18 million. Kiwico Ltd plans to acquire a replacement building costing $15 million. 5 31. Because the cost of the replacement building is less than the cost of the affected property, only some of the excess recovery amount can be allocated against the cost of the replacement building. Step 1: Calculate the excess recovery 32. The insurance proceeds exceed the building’s adjusted tax value by $2 million. Therefore, Kiwico Ltd has an excess recovery of $2 million. Step 2: Calculate the reduction amount 33. Kiwico Ltd now has to calculate the reduction amount by applying the following formula: limited replacement cost x excess affected cost 34. The limited replacement cost is the lesser of: (i) the amount by which the cost of the affected class (in this example, the destroyed building) exceeds the total expenditure in acquiring other replacement property before the replacement item; or (ii) the amount spent on the replacement item. 35. The affected cost is the total cost of the destroyed building. 36. No other replacement property has been acquired before the $15 million replacement building. Therefore, the amount under (i) above is: $20 million – $0 = $20 million 37. The amount spent on the replacement building under (ii) above is $15 million. 38. As the limited replacement cost is the lesser of these two amounts, the “limited replacement cost” is $15 million. The reduction amount can now be calculated using the following amounts in the above formula: $15 million x $2 million =$1.5 million $20 million Step 3: Reduce the adjusted tax value of the replacement item by the reduction amount 39. The reduction amount of $1.5 million is now available to roll-over into the cost of the replacement building: $15 million (cost of replacement property) – $1.5 million (the reduction amount) = $13.5 million (adjusted tax value) Step 4: Reduce the excess recovery by the reduction amount 40. The reduction amount of $1.5 million is now also available to reduce the excess recovery: $2 million (excess recovery) – $1.5 million (the reduction amount) = $500,000 41. The suspended recovery income is now the reduced amount of $500,000. 6 Step 5: Return any unallocated suspended recovery income as depreciation recovery income 42. The unallocated suspended recovery income of $500,000 must be returned as depreciation recovery income in the income year in which Kiwico Ltd decides not to acquire any more replacement property in this class, goes into liquidation, or at the end of the 2018–19 income year (whichever comes first). Summary of example 2 43. In this example, the depreciation roll-over relief provisions act to: (a) roll-over $1.5 million of the depreciation recovery income of $2 million into the cost of the replacement building; (b) reduce the adjusted tax value of the replacement building to $13.5 million; (c) defer the recognition of the suspended recovery income of $500,000 to the income year in which Kiwico Ltd decides not to acquire any more replacement property in this class, goes into liquidation, or the end of the 2018–19 income year (whichever comes first); (d) defer the recognition of the depreciation recovery income of $1.5 million until the subsequent sale of the replacement building (assuming the building is sold for more than its adjusted tax value). Example 3: Multiple replacement items 44. The following example demonstrates how the formula works where more than one item of replacement property is acquired. 45. Linda receives insurance proceeds of $1 million for plant and equipment (not previously depreciated under the pool method) destroyed in a Canterbury earthquake. The original cost of the plant and equipment was $1 million and its adjusted tax value was $700,000. Linda is not required to replace items of affected property “like for like” as long as the affected property is not a building or grandparented structure, or commercial-fit-out. She acquires the following replacement items:  Year 1: plant and equipment costing $400,000;  Year 2: an overhead crane costing $400,000;  Year 3: a digger costing $400,000;  Year 4: plant and equipment costing $10,000. Step 1: Calculate the excess recovery 46. The insurance proceeds exceed the adjusted tax value of the plant and equipment by $300,000. Therefore, Linda has an excess recovery of $300,000. Year 1 – Step 2: Calculate the reduction amount 47. Linda now has to calculate the reduction amount for year 1 by applying the following formula: limited replacement cost x excess affected cost 48. The limited replacement cost is the lesser of: 7 (i) the amount by which the cost of the affected class (in this example, the destroyed plant and equipment) exceeds the total expenditure in acquiring other replacement property before the replacement item; or (ii) the amount spent on the replacement item. 49. The affected cost is the total cost of the destroyed plant and equipment. 50. No other replacement property has been acquired before the first replacement item of plant and equipment of $400,000. Therefore, the amount under (i) above is: $1 million – $0 = $1 million 51. The amount spent on the replacement plant and equipment under (ii) above is $400,000. 52. This means the “limited replacement cost” is $400,000. The reduction amount for year 1 can now be calculated using the following amounts in the above formula: $400,000 x $300,000 = $120,000 $1 million Year 1 – Step 3: Reduce the adjusted tax value of the replacement item by the reduction amount 53. The reduction amount of $120,000 is now available to roll-over into the adjusted tax value of the replacement plant and equipment: $400,000 (cost of replacement property) – $120,000 (the reduction amount) = $280,000 (adjusted tax value) Year 1 – Step 4: Reduce the excess recovery by the reduction amount 54. The reduction amount of $120,000 is now also available to reduce the excess recovery: $300,000 (excess recovery) – $120,000 (the reduction amount) = $180,000 55. The suspended recovery income is now the reduced amount of $180,000. Year 2 – Step 2: Calculate the reduction amount 56. For year 2, Linda applies the formula as follows. 57. Total expenditure in acquiring other replacement property before the second replacement item is $400,000 (being the cost of the first replacement item of plant and equipment). Therefore, the amount under (i) above is: $1 million – $400,000 = $600,000 58. The amount spent on the replacement overhead crane in year 2 under (ii) above is $400,000. 59. This means the “limited replacement cost” is $400,000 (the lesser of $600,000 calculated under (i) and $400,000 calculated under (ii)). The reduction amount for year 2 can now be calculated using the formula: $400,000 x $300,000 = $120,000 $1 million 8 Year 2 – Step 3: Reduce the adjusted tax value of the replacement item by the reduction amount 60. The reduction amount of $120,000 is now available to roll-over into the adjusted tax value of the replacement overhead crane: $400,000 (cost of replacement property) – $120,000 (the reduction amount) = $280,000 (adjusted tax value) Year 2 – Step 4: Reduce the suspended recovery income by the reduction amount 61. The reduction amount of $120,000 is now also available to reduce the suspended recovery income: $180,000 (suspended recovery income as reduced in year 1) – $120,000 (the reduction amount) = $60,000 62. The suspended recovery income is now reduced further to $60,000. Year 3 – Step 2: Calculate the reduction amount 63. For year 3, Linda applies the formula as follows. 64. Total expenditure in acquiring other replacement property before the third replacement item is $800,000 ($400,000 for each of the plant and equipment and the overhead crane). Therefore, the amount under (i) above is: $1 million – $800,000 = $200,000 65. The amount spent on the replacement digger in year 3 under (ii) above is $400,000. 66. This means the “limited replacement cost” is $200,000 (the lesser of $200,000 calculated under (i) and $400,000 calculated under (ii)). The reduction amount for year 3 can now be calculated using the formula: $200,000 x $300,000 = $60,000 $1 million Year 3 – Step 3: Reduce the adjusted tax value of the replacement item by the reduction amount 67. The reduction amount of $60,000 is now available to roll-over into the adjusted tax value of the replacement digger: $400,000 (cost of replacement property) – $60,000 = $340,000 adjusted tax value Year 3 – Step 4: Reduce the suspended recovery income by the reduction amount 68. The reduction amount of $60,000 is now also available to reduce the suspended recovery income: $60,000 (suspended recovery income as reduced in year 2) – $60,000 = $0 69. At the end of year 3, the combined cost of the replacement items is reduced by a total of $300,000 from $1.2 million to $900,000. Therefore, the depreciation recovery income of $300,000 is fully rolled into the cost of the replacement property, which reduces the adjusted tax value for depreciation purposes. This is 9 what would be expected, because the total cost of the replacement items exceeds the cost of the affected property. Year 4 70. Because the cost of other replacement items ($1.2 million, being $400,000 in each of years 1–3) exceeds the cost of the affected property ($1 million) no further reductions are available (s EZ 23B(4)(a)). This makes sense because the full amount of the excess recovery has already been allocated against replacement items. Step 5: Return any unallocated suspended recovery income as depreciation recovery income 71. Since the suspended recovery income has been reduced to zero, Linda has no liability to return any unallocated suspended recovery income. Summary of example 3 72. In this example, the depreciation roll-over relief provisions act to: (a) fully allocate the depreciation recovery income of $300,000 against the cost of the replacement items purchased in years 1–3, on a first-in-first-served basis; (b) reduce the adjusted tax values of the replacement items from $1.2 million to $900,000. 73. The same result would be achieved had Linda purchased all the replacement items at the same time but chose to treat them in her income tax return as being acquired in the same order as in this example. Other requirements for depreciation roll-over relief 74. To qualify for the depreciation roll-over relief, the replacement asset must be:  acquired before the end of the 2018–19 income year (s EZ 23B(1)); and  depreciable property (that is not depreciable intangible property) (s EZ 23B(1)(a)(i)); and  in the same category as the affected property if the affected property is a building or grandparented structure, or commercial fit-out (s EZ 23B(7)). 75. In addition, any replacement building or grandparented structure, or commercial fit-out must be located in greater Christchurch (s EZ 23B(7)). 76. Taxpayers who wish to make use of the depreciation roll-over relief provisions must elect to do so by giving written notice to the Commissioner specifying the affected property and linking each item of replacement property with an affected class. This notice must be given by the later of 31 January 2012 or when the income tax return is filed for the income year in which the insurance pay-out can be reasonably estimated. Written notice must also be given in each subsequent year in which the depreciation recovery income is suspended (s EZ 23B(1)(f) and EZ 23B(9)). The Commissioner’s operational approach 77. The Commissioner recognises that taxpayers may have incorrectly applied the formula under s EZ 23B(4) in their calculation of the reduction amount as a result of the interpretive uncertainty discussed in this Question We’ve Been Asked. In some cases, the application of the formula has produced incorrect results because 10 of the uncertainty clarified in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 enacted on 27 February 2014 regarding when multiple items of replacement property are acquired at the same time. 78. Where, for one of the reasons set out above, the application of the formula has resulted or will result in an overpayment of income tax, taxpayers can request Inland Revenue amend their assessment under s 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The Commissioner will apply the principles set out in the Standard Practice Statement “SPS 07/03 Requests to amend assessments” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 5 (June 2007) at 8 (or any replacement) on a case by case basis to determine whether to amend assessments. 79. If, for one of the reasons set out above, the application of the formula has resulted or will result in an underpayment of income tax, the Commissioner will not actively apply her resources to seek to amend assessments. This approach applies only to the application of the formula in relation to returns filed prior to the publication of this Question We’ve Been Asked. 80. In other cases of underpayment, the Commissioner’s normal approach will apply. 81. Taxpayers should ensure that they apply the formula correctly from the date of publication of this Question We’ve Been Asked (including in respect of previous periods for which a return is yet to be filed).

1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 14/05 INCOME TAX – ASC RULES: CALCULATING THE “SUBSCRIPTIONS” AMOUNT FOR AN AMALGAMATED COMPANY WHEN THE SHARES OF AN AMALGAMATING COMPANY ARE HELD BY ANOTHER AMALGAMATING COMPANY All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about s CD 43(15)(a)(ii). Question 1. We have been asked whether s CD 43(15)(a)(ii) excludes an amount equal to the consideration received for shares issued by an amalgamating company that are directly or indirectly held by another amalgamating company from the “subscriptions” amount for an amalgamated company in the available subscribed capital (ASC) formula in s CD 43(1). Answer 2. Yes. An amount equal to the consideration received for shares issued by an amalgamating company that are held directly or indirectly by another amalgamating company is excluded from the amalgamated company’s subscriptions amount by s CD 43(15)(a)(ii). 3. For an amalgamated company, as with any other company, the “subscriptions” amount in the ASC formula is the consideration received for shares issued, under the definition of “subscriptions” in s CD 43(2)(b). Section CD 43(15) adds an additional amount to the “subscriptions” amount of an amalgamated company. Section CD 43(15) provides that the “subscriptions” amount of an amalgamated company includes an amount equal to the ASC of all shares in the amalgamating companies except:  shares in the amalgamating companies that are held (directly or indirectly) by another amalgamating company (s CD 43(15)(a)(ii)); and  shares in the amalgamated company (s CD 43(15)(a)(iii)). 4. Section CD 43(15)(a)(ii) operates to prevent the counting of the ASC of shares in an amalgamating company if those shares are held by another amalgamating company. 5. The purpose of the ASC formula is to determine the amount that shareholders have paid into a company as capital when subscribing for shares. The ASC of a company can be returned to shareholders tax-free in certain circumstances rather than being treated as a dividend. The reason for excluding the ASC of subsidiaries from this calculation is to avoid the double-counting of capital that has been introduced by the underlying shareholders. 6. This question arose following a previous QWBA (QB 13/02 Income Tax – Determining the “subscriptions” amount for an amalgamated company under the available subscribed capital rules) published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25, No 6 (July 2013): 50. This QWBA should be read in conjunction with QB 13/02. Explanation 7. This Question We’ve Been Asked clarifies the effect of s CD 43(15)(a)(ii), following the publication of QB 13/02. 2 8. It had been suggested that the conclusion reached in QB 13/02 indicated that the subscriptions amount of an amalgamated company included the ASC of the shares in all amalgamating companies (other than the amalgamated company). The purpose of this QWBA is to clarify that the ASC of an amalgamated company includes the ASC of the shares in all amalgamating companies other than those shares listed in both ss CD 43(15)(a)(ii) and (iii). Section CD 43(2)(b) 9. Sections CD 43(1) and (2) provide: CD 43 Available subscribed capital (ASC) amount Formula for calculating amount of available subscribed capital (1) For a share (the share) in a company at any relevant time (the calculation time), the amount of available subscribed capital is calculated using the formula— 1 July 1994 balance + subscriptions – returns – look-through company returns. Definition of items in formula (2) In the formula in subsection (1),— (a) 1 July 1994 balance is,— (i) if the company existed before 1 July 1994, the amount calculated under subsection (3); and (ii) in any other case, zero: (b) subscriptions, subject to subsections (6) to (21), is the total amount of consideration that the company received, after 30 June 1994 and before the calculation time, for the issue of shares of the same class (the class) as the share, ignoring section HB 1 (Look-through companies are transparent): (c) returns, subject to subsections (22) and (23), is the total amount of consideration that the company paid, after 30 June 1994 and before the calculation time, on the cancellation of shares in the relevant class and that was not a dividend because of section CD 22 or CD 24 or a corresponding provision of an earlier Act: (d) look-through company returns is the total amount of consideration that the company paid, before the calculation time, on the cancellation or buyback of shares in the relevant class while the company was a look-through company, ignoring section HB 1. 10. This QWBA only considers the “subscriptions” amount in the formula. Section CD 43(2)(b) provides that the subscriptions amount of a company is the total amount of consideration that the company received, after 30 June 1994 and before the calculation time, for the issue of shares of the same class. 11. Section CD 43(2)(b) is subject to s CD 43(15) when determining the subscriptions amount of an amalgamated company. Section CD 43(15) 12. Section CD 43(15) provides: Subscriptions amount: amalgamated company (15) The subscriptions amount for a company that is an amalgamated company resulting from an amalgamation— (a) includes an amount, as if it were consideration received at the time of the amalgamation for the issue of the amalgamated company’s shares, equal to the available subscribed capital, at the time of the amalgamation, of all shares in the amalgamating companies that are— (i) of an equivalent class to the class; and (ii) not held directly or indirectly by an amalgamating company; and (iii) not shares in the amalgamated company: 3 (b) does not include any other amount for the agreement of shareholders of an amalgamating company to the amalgamation and the resulting property acquisitions by the amalgamated company. 13. Section CD 43(15) applies to a company that is an amalgamated company. An “amalgamated company” is defined in s YA 1 as the one company that results from and continues after an amalgamation and it may be one of the amalgamating companies or a new company. “Amalgamating company” is a company that amalgamates with one or more other companies under an amalgamation. Therefore, all companies involved in an amalgamation are amalgamating companies. A company that exists before an amalgamation and continues as the amalgamated company is both the “amalgamated company” and an “amalgamating company”. 14. Section CD 43(15) includes an amount (as if it were consideration received at the time of the amalgamation for the issue of the amalgamated company’s shares) equal to the ASC of all shares of the same class in the amalgamating companies. This amount, however, does not include:  the ASC of shares in an amalgamating company that are held by an amalgamating company (s CD 43(15)(a)(ii)); and  the ASC of shares in the amalgamated company (s CD 43(15)(a)(iii)). This is because the ASC of the shares in the amalgamated company is already included in the “subscriptions” amount in s CD 43(2)(b). See QB 13/2 for further clarification of this point. 15. It is further noted that s CD 43(15)(b) provides that the subscriptions amount also does not include any amounts for the agreement of shareholders to the amalgamation and the resulting property acquisitions by the amalgamated company. 16. Under s CD 43(15)(a)(ii), the shares of any subsidiaries of the amalgamating companies (including the company that becomes the amalgamated company) are not included in the calculation of the amalgamated company’s subscriptions amount. 17. By reading ss CD 43(2)(b) and (15) together, it can be seen that the subscriptions amount of an amalgamated company equals the amount under s CD 43(2)(b) plus the ASC of the shares of all the amalgamating companies other than the amalgamated company and any amalgamating companies that are subsidiaries of other amalgamating companies. 18. The reason for excluding the ASC of subsidiaries from this calculation is to avoid the double-counting of capital that has been introduced by the underlying shareholders. This is because the underlying shareholders have only subscribed for the shares in the parent company, and so that ASC value should only be included once. Otherwise it could be possible for shareholders to create extra ASC through capitalising subsidiaries, and increasing their ASC on an amalgamation. 19. We note that this item only concerns the “subscriptions” component of the formula for calculating an amalgamated company’s ASC. Other components of the formula, such as the “returns” amount, may be relevant in certain situations (eg, where there is a cancellation of shares under s CD 43(24)). Conclusion 20. The Commissioner considers that the subscriptions amount of an amalgamated company includes the amalgamated company’s ASC, as well as an additional amount that is equal to the ASC of all shares in the amalgamating companies that are of an equivalent class, except:   Examp 21.

QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 14/06 GST – HIRE FIRM SECURITY BONDS All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Question We've Been Asked (QWBA) is about ss 2, 8 and 10. During a review of the Public Information Bulletin and Tax Information Bulletin series published before 1996, the answer to Question 11 in a series of GST questions and answers in Public Information Bulletin No 148, p 4 (May 1986) was identified as no longer reflecting the Commissioner’s interpretation of the law as it relates to GST and hire firm security bonds. The Public Information Bulletin review has now been completed, see “Update on Public Information Bulletin review” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25, No 10 (November 2013): 37. This QWBA updates and replaces the Public Information Bulletin item. Question 1. What are the GST implications of a customer paying a bond to a GST registered hirer of goods as security when the goods are hired? Answer 2. The paying of the bond has no GST effect because there are no services supplied in return for the bond. If the bond is repaid in full on the return of the goods, that remains the case. If, or to the extent, the bond is forfeited because it is applied in accordance with the agreement between the parties: • as payment of an extra hire charge, because the goods are returned late, then it is consideration for a supply and is subject to GST; • as compensation for damage to, or loss of, the goods, then it is not consideration for a supply and is not subject to GST; • for the purchase of goods or services, then it is consideration for a supply and is subject to GST; or • for a breach of a condition (eg, operating the goods in a way not permitted under the hire agreement), it is not consideration for a supply and it is not subject to GST. Explanation Background 3. In Public Information Bulletin No 148, p4 (May 1986) there was a series of GST questions and answers. Question 11 asked: “What is the treatment of deposits by way of security (bonds) taken by hire firms, which are refunded when the goods are returned in good condition at the end of the hire period?” The answer provided was: “Such deposits are not consideration for a taxable supply and are not therefore subject to GST when paid. If, however, these deposits are appropriated as a result of a contingency such as non-compliance with the bond conditions, the amount so appropriated is consideration for a taxable supply and subject to GST.” 1 4. Where a customer pays an amount as security for the return of goods (a bond) and the hire firm appropriates that amount as a result of a contingency, such as non-compliance with bond conditions, and does not supply anything in return to the customer, the Commissioner now considers there is no GST payable by the hire firm. In some scenarios this will result in a different answer to that provided in Question 11. This is because where there is no supply (as is the case in the second and last bullet points in \[2\] above) there is no GST. Taxable Supply 5. For GST to apply to a transaction, a registered person must make a supply for consideration in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity they carry on. This is the combined effect of s 8(1), which imposes GST with reference to the “value of a supply”, and s 10, which determines the value of a supply by reference to the “consideration” for the supply. “Consideration” is defined in s 2 to include: any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services, whether by that person or by any other person; but does not include any payment made by any person as an unconditional gift to any non-profit body 6. For GST to apply to a payment, it must be more than just a payment to a registered person in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity. For GST to apply, the payment must also be a payment for a supply. To determine whether a payment satisfies this test, a relevant supply must be identified. Then it must be determined whether, or at what point, a payment is made for that identified supply (see CIR v Databank Systems Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,093 (CA)). A bond 7. When a customer hires goods from a hire firm, the customer may be asked to pay a bond. If the goods are returned on time and undamaged, the bond will be refunded. If the goods are returned late, the hire firm, in accordance with the agreement between the parties, may retain some, or all, of the bond to pay additional hire charges. A hire agreement may also provide that a bond will be forfeited, in whole or in part, for a breach of another term of the hire agreement. An example of such a term is a restriction on using the hired goods in a particular way or in a particular place or damaging or losing the goods. Other agreements may simply provide that customers must forfeit their bond if there is any damage to the hired goods. In these types of situations, working out whether GST applies to the bond payment requires identifying whether there is a relevant supply and then determining whether, or at what point, a payment is made for that identified supply. Each transaction must be carefully analysed to determine whether there has been a supply. This is demonstrated in the following scenarios, which identify some types of transactions that might arise in the hire industry. Initial payment of bond 8. A hire firm may require a customer to pay a bond as security when the goods are hired. The initial payment of a bond is not for any supply. The payment arises in the context of a supply of hired goods but it is not for that supply. The bond is paid to give the hire firm an amount to resort to in case an event provided for in the agreement occurs. If the agreement is complied with, then the bond will be returned to the customer. Late return of goods 9. Where, in accordance with the agreement between the parties, the hire firm retains some, or all , of a bond to pay additional hire charges because hired goods ar e returned late, that is consideration for a supply. For example, if goods are 2 hired for two days but returned after three, the amount of the bond forfeited is consideration for the extra day’s hire of the goods. 10. In cases where previously agreed consideration is increased and a tax invoice has already been issued (and the supply is not a successive supply under s 9(3)), the supplier must provide the recipient with a debit note that meets the requirements of s 25(3)(b). If the supplier did not account for the increased amount of GST in the GST return in which the original supply was returned (as they were not then aware of that increase in consideration), the supplier must make the relevant adjustment in the GST return for the period in which it became apparent that the output tax they returned was incorrect. Damage to, or non-return of, hire goods 11. Where, in accordance with the agreement between the parties, the hire firm retains some, or all, of a bond to compensate for damage to the hired goods, that is not consideration for a supply. The amount retained is a payment of damages. The Commissioner’s view on the application of GST to damages is set out in “GST Treatment of Court Awards and Out of Court Settlements”, Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 14, No 10 (October 2002): 21. GST will not apply where the payment is compensation or damages and not consideration for a supply. 12. The same reasoning applies where a bond is forfeited because the hired goods are not returned at all. The amount the hire firm retains is damages for the loss of the goods and is not consideration for any supply made by the hire firm to the customer. 13. However, if the hire firm and the customer agree that the customer will buy the goods, then GST will apply to that sale in the ordinary way with the hire firm issuing a tax invoice to the customer and returning the GST on that sale in the return for the appropriate GST period. Breach of another term 14. A hire agreement may contain a term that restricts the use of the goods in a particular way or in a particular place and provides for the deposit to be forfeited if the term is not complied with. If the bond is forfeited for such a breach, GST will not apply. The hire firm does not supply anything for the amount forfeited. Generally, the amount will be an estimate of damage suffered because of the breach of the term. In some cases, forfeiture of the bond may be viewed as a penalty. That is relevant to the enforceability of the term but will not alter the GST treatment. 15. By contrast, the hire agreement may contain a term that does not restrict the use of the hired goods but instead provides that if the goods are used in a particular way extra charges will be incurred that will be forfeited from the bond. In this case, the hire firm is supplying something extra (ie, the use of the goods in a particular way) for the amount of the bond forfeited and, therefore, GST applies. 16. As stated above, for GST to apply, the payment must be a payment for a supply. Whether a payment is for a supply will ordinarily be determined by the terms agreed to by the parties. However, as is the case under any contract, where the true legal position does not accurately reflect the terms of the agreement (regardless of whether it is written or oral), it is the true legal position that determines whether there is a payment for a supply. In that regard nomenclature, by itself, does not determine the true legal position. Similarly, where the parties have not acted in accordance with the written terms of the hire agreement but have made an alternative agreement, it is that alternative agreement that is determinative (see Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA)). 3 Different treatment for late payment charges and penalty and default interest payments 17. It is important to note that late payment charges and payments of penalty and default interest are not the same as compensation or damages payments. There are specific sections that apply to late payment charges and payments of penalty and default interest. Under ss 5(25) and (26), a late payment charge on the payment of an account (not including a payment of penalty or default interest) will be liable for GST if the underlying supply to which that payment relates is subject to GST. Penalty or default interest imposed under a contract for the supply of goods or services is exempt from GST under s 14(3). Examples 18. The GST consequences of each of the Examples below are a result of those particular facts. This means that any additions, or variations, to the facts in the Examples may give rise to different GST consequences. 19. The hire firm in each Example is GST registered and all hire fees paid are GST inclusive. Example 1 – Goods returned late 20. Robert rented a concrete mixer from ABC Hire for two days for $50. Robert paid a bond of $200. The hire agreement provided that the bond would be repaid to Robert if he returned the mixer on time and undamaged with the hire agreement providing that ABC Hire could charge an extra amount for any additional day(s) the mixer was retained beyond the agreed hire period. 21. Robert returned the mixer one day late. ABC Hire deducted $25, for an extra day’s hire, from the bond and returned the balance of $175 to Robert. 22. The initial payment of the bond by Robert was not consideration for a supply, so ABC Hire does not have to account for GST on that payment. The $25 deducted from the bond was consideration for the supply of the mixer for an extra day, so ABC Hire must account for GST on that $25. Example 2 – Goods returned damaged 23. Ann rented tables and chairs from ABC Hire for a party she was holding in her backyard. The total rent was $300 and Ann also paid a bond of $200 against the return of the furniture on time and undamaged. The hire agreement stated that the chairs must be returned in the same condition (fair wear and tear excepted). 24. Ann returned the furniture on time but two chairs were damaged. ABC Hire estimated that the cost of repairing the chairs would be $60 and deducted that from the bond before returning the balance to Ann. 25. The initial payment of the bond by Ann was not consideration for a supply, so ABC Hire does not have to account for GST on that payment. The $60 deducted from the bond was also not consideration for a supply. That deduction was to compensate ABC Hire for damage suffered, so it is not subject to GST. Example 3 – Goods not returned 26. Helen rented a tent for a week from ABC Hire. Under the hire agreement, the rental charge for the tent was $200, with Helen also pa ying a bond of $300 to ensure the safe return of the tent. 27. When Helen did not return the tent, the manager at ABC Hire called the phone number Helen gave on the hire form. The person who answered the phone said 4 Helen used to live there but had left owing rent and without leaving a forwarding address. ABC Hire kept the bond as compensation for the loss of the tent. 28. The initial payment of the bond by Helen was not consideration for a supply, so ABC Hire does not have to account for GST on that payment. The forfeiting of the bond was also not consideration for a supply. The bond amount was taken by ABC Hire to compensate it for the loss it suffered (ie, the loss of the tent), so it is not subject to GST. Example 4 – Goods kept 29. Brian rented a vintage suit from Suit Hire Co for his school ball. Under the hire agreement, Brian paid a bond of $200 for the return of the suit on time and in the same condition (fair wear and tear excepted). Unfortunately, at the ball Brian rip ped one arm of the suit. 30. When Brian returned the suit, he was told that he would forfeit the bond because of the damage. Brian asked Suit Hire Co what it would cost to buy the suit instead. Suit Hire Co told Brian if he paid an extra $100 and forfeited the bond, the suit was his. Brian agreed. 31. In this case, Suit Hire Co relinquished its damages claim against Brian. Instead, Suit Hire Co sold the suit to Brian and applied the $200 bond towards the $300 purchase price of the suit. The initial payment of the bond by Brian was not consideration for a supply, so Suit Hire Co does not have to account for GST on that payment. However, Suit Hire Co must account for GST on the $300 sale price of the suit, which includes the $200 bond amount that was paid as part of the purchase price. Example 5 – Breach of a condition of hire 32. Jane rented a car from Holiday Rentals for a day. Under the hire agreement, the rental charge was $80 and Jane also paid a bond of $200. The hire agreement also provided that the car was not to be driven on a local beach and that the bond would be forfeited if this condition was broken. Holiday Rentals included that term because cars driven on that beach regularly fell into holes. Sometimes the car suspension was damaged as a result and often cars had to be towed out. This condition was pointed out to Jane by the Holiday Rentals’ manager when Jane signed the hire form. 33. The manager saw Jane driving the car on the beach later that day. When Jane returned the car, she was told that she had breached the hire agreement and Holiday Rentals would not be refunding the bond. 34. The initial payment of the bond by Jane was not consideration for a supply, so Holiday Rentals does not have to account for GST on that payment. The forfeiting of the bond is also not subject to GST. Under the hire agreement, Holiday Rentals did not supply anything to Jane in return for the forfeited bond, so it is not consideration for a supply.

1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 14/07 TAX ADMINISTRATION ACT 1994 – PROSCRIBED QUESTIONS All legislative references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked applies in respect of ss 91E(4)(a) and 91F(4)(a). Question 1. We have been asked whether the Commissioner may include a statement relating to a “proscribed question” in a private or product ruling. Answer 2. Yes. Including a statement relating to a “proscribed question” (such as a reference to a person’s intention) in the description of the Arrangement, or as an assumption or a condition, in a private or product ruling will not breach s 91E(4)(a) or s 91F(4)(a). Explanation 3. Section 91E(4)(a) provides that the Commissioner may not make a private ruling if: (a) the application for the ruling would require the Commissioner to determine a proscribed question ... 4. Section 91F(4)(a) contains an equivalent provision in relation to product rulings. 5. The term “proscribed question” is defined in s 3: proscribed question means— (a) whether a fact is correct or exists: (b) what is a person’s purpose or intention, for the purpose of any provision of the Income Tax Act 2007 that expressly refers to a person’s purpose or intention: (c) what is the value of a thing: (d) what is commercially acceptable practice, for the purposes of any provision of that Act that expressly refers to commercially acceptable practice 6. We have been asked whether including a statement in a description of the Arrangement, or as an assumption or a condition, in a ruling could be “determining” a proscribed question for the purposes of s 91E(4)(a). Assumptions and conditions 7. The situation in respect of assumptions and conditions about proscribed questions in a ruling is clear. 8. Sections 91EF(3) and 91FF(3) provide that the Commissioner may make assumptions about the answer to a proscribed question, and making those assumptions is not treated as determining the proscribed question for the purposes of s 91E(4)(a). 9. Similarly, ss 91EH(1B) and 91FH(1B) provide that the Commissioner may stipulate conditions about the answer to a proscribed question, and stipulating those 2 conditions is treated as not determining the proscribed question for the purposes of s 91E(4)(a). 10. The legislation is clear that the Commissioner may include an assumption or a condition in a private or product ruling that relates to a proscribed question, such as the value of a thing or a person’s intention. If the Commissioner includes an assumption or a condition in a ruling relating to a proscribed question, the applicant may be able to seek a Factual Review of the condition or assumption (for more information on Factual Reviews, go to www.ird.govt.nz (keyword: factual review)). Description of the Arrangement 11. There is no equivalent provision in respect of the answer to a proscribed question being included in the description of the Arrangement in a ruling. This omission can be interpreted in two ways. On the one hand, it could suggest that a similar outcome was intended in respect of the description of the Arrangement, but that Parliament thought clarification was necessary only in respect of conditions and assumptions. On the other hand, it could suggest that Parliament did not intend that the Commissioner include the answer to a proscribed question in the description of the Arrangement and that Parliament deliberately or implicitly contrasted those positions in the legislation. 12. With this in mind, to answer the question we must consider the meaning of the term “determine”. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th edition, 2011, Oxford University Press) contains the following definitions of the term “determine”: Determine v. 1 cause to occur in a particular way; be the decisive factor in. 2 firmly decide: she determined to tackle Stephen the next day. 3 ascertain or establish by research or calculation. 4 Mathematics specify the value, position, or form of (a mathematical or geometrical object) uniquely. 5 Law, archaic bring or come to an end 13. The term “determine”, therefore, has a variety of meanings, but the most relevant ones relate to something being decided or ascertained. 14. This is consistent with the second definition of “determine” in Osborn's Concise Law Dictionary (10th edition, 2009, Thomson, Sweet and Maxwell, edited by Mick Woodley), which states: Determine. (1) To come to an end; (2) To decide an issue or appeal. 15. Several cases have considered the meaning of the term “determine”. 16. In some of those cases, such as Town v Stevens (1899) 17 NZLR 828, the courts have found that the term “determined” means “ended”. This is meaning five from the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (quoted above). However, this interpretation cannot be relevant in the present situation, because the Commissioner will not be “ending” a proscribed question. Such an interpretation would be nonsensical in this context. 17. The Supreme Court of Victoria in City of Heidelberg v McPherson \[1964\] VicRp 102, \[1964\] VR 783 considered whether a resolution that the council of the City of Heidelberg is “of the opinion that the following works are necessary”, meant that the council had “determined” that the works were necessary. O’Bryan J stated, at 785: Now it is quite clear that in this particular matter the council is not called upon to determine any matter inter partes, it is not making a decision between two people as to who is in the right or who is in the wrong or who has rights or powers against the other: it is doing no more than making up its mind whether certain works are necessary; it is acting, in other words, in a governmental or executive capacity. I would have thought that when a 3 council says, by resolution through its councillors, that “it is of opinion that so and so”, it means quite clearly that it has made up its mind, or decided, or determined, whichever word you like to use, that these works are necessary. I do not think that this fine distinction which is made by Mr. McHugh gives a correct meaning to the words in this section. The word “”determines” in this context means no more than decides or forms the opinion. \[Emphasis added\] 18. The English Court of Appeal reached a similar conclusion in Muir v Inland Revenue Commissioners \[1966\] 3 All ER 38, where Win J stated, at 48: Whilst the matter is not really relevant if the view which I have already expressed be correct, I nevertheless desire to say that I am of the firm opinion that the word “determination” there used cannot be given the meaning, which I understood to be suggested by the submission, of “assessment”. In my opinion the context in which the word is used, and, indeed, used several times in the section, with or without the corresponding verb “determine”, is far too strong to permit of its being understood as meaning anything but a decision on a point of law declared by the commissioners. ... It is plain that there the words “determined” and “determination” are equivalent to: decided and decision, and are quite incapable of being understood to mean an assessment or the amount stated in an assessment.... \[Emphasis added\] 19. More recently, the English Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) in Young v R \[2004\] 2 All ER 63 considered whether a confiscation order had been “determined” within six months, as required by the relevant legislative provision. May LJ, delivering the decision of the court, stated, at \[56\]: We consider on reflection that the “words “determining" and “determination” connote the end of the process, that which the court eventually decides. A substantive start to a hearing within the six month period which is adjourned beyond that period does not achieve a determination within the six month period. \[Emphasis added\] 20. Based on the above cases, and consistent with the dictionary definitions, the Commissioner considers that the word “determine” in s 91E(4)(a) must mean “decide”. This interpretation seems appropriate in the context of the rulings regime, because a ruling gives the Commissioner’s decision on the application of tax laws to an Arrangement. The purpose of s 91E(4)(a) seems to be to prevent the Commissioner from being required to decide whether certain factual matters are correct. 21. Simply including a statement in the description of the Arrangement of a matter that has been advised to the Commissioner as part of an application for a binding ruling does not involve a decision being made on whether the statement is correct. Therefore, simply including a statement relating to a proscribed question (such as a reference to a person’s intention) in the description of the Arrangement cannot breach s 91E(4)(a). 22. In this regard, ss 91EJ and 91FK specifically contemplate the Commissioner relying on facts provided by the applicant for a ruling. Subsection (1) of those sections provides that the information supplied to the Commissioner is the factual basis on which the Commissioner makes a private or product ruling. Subsection (2)(a) of those sections provides that the Commissioner may inquire into the correctness of those facts before a ruling is made, but is not required to do so. Similarly, under ss 91EB(2)(a) and 91FB(2)(a), if the arrangement entered into differs materially from the arrangement described in the ruling (based on the facts provided by the applicant), the ruling does not apply. 4 References Subject references Proscribed questions Legislative references Tax Administration Act 1994, ss 3 (definition of “proscribed question”), 91E(4)(a), 91EF(3), 91EH(1B), 91EJ, 91F(4)(a), 91FF(3), 91FH(1B), 91FK.

1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 14/08 INCOME TAX — COSTS OF DEMOLISHING AN EXISTING BUILDING ON A BUILDING SITE All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Question We've Been Asked is about ss DA 1, DA 2, EE 6, EE 7, EE 31(2), EE 31(3), EE 44, EE 45(1), EE 45(2), EE 48, EE 61(3B) and YA 1, definition of “dispose”, para (f). This item applies where the building demolished and the replacement building are used in deriving assessable or excluded income, or in the course of carrying on a business to derive such income, but not where either building is a revenue account asset. This item updates and replaces the item “How costs of clearing a site are treated for tax purposes”, published in Public Information Bulletin No 45, p 9 (April/May 1968). That item explains that no income tax deduction is permitted for the costs of demolishing a building to prepare a site for construction of a new building. The item says that those costs are part of the cost of the site, are capital, and cannot be included in depreciation claimed for the new building. The current relevance of this information was identified during an ongoing review of content published in Public Information Bulletins and Tax Information Bulletins before 1996. The Public Information Bulletin review has now been completed, see “Update on Public Information Bulletin review” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25, No 10 (November 2013). Question 1. When erecting a new building on a site are the costs of demolishing an existing building on the site included as part of the cost of the new building and are the costs deductible for income tax purposes? Answer 2. The costs of demolishing the existing building are not part of the cost of the new building and are not deductible for income tax purposes as they are of a capital nature. Instead, the costs are taken into account under the depreciation rules in determining the consideration received by the taxpayer from the disposal of the demolished building. Different rules apply for temporary buildings. Explanation 3. Demolition costs are expenditure incurred by a person in removing a building from a site. Where a person removes a building themselves, rather than paying a demolition expert to do the whole job, examples of demolition costs include wages paid to staff who carry out the work, the cost of hiring equipment to carry out the work, the cost of carting demolition material from the site and tip fees for dumping that material. 4. A person is entitled to a deduction for expenditure incurred in the course of deriving their assessable or excluded income, or incurred in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving such income (s DA 1(1)) but only if, relevantly, the expenditure is not of a capital nature (ss DA 2(1) and DA 2(7)). 5. CIR v McKenzies NZ Ltd (1988) 10 NZTC 5,233 (CA) contains a discussion of the general principles for determining whether expenditure has a capital nature. In discussing BP Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia \[1965\] 3 All ER 209 (PC) the Court of Appeal in McKenzies said at 5,236: 2 Amongst the factors weighed by the Judicial Committee in BP Australia were: (a) the need or occasion which called for the expenditure; (b) whether the payments were made from fixed or circulating capital; (c) whether the payments were of a once and for all nature producing assets or advantages which were an enduring benefit; (d) how the payment would be treated on ordinary principles of commercial accounting; and (e) whether the payments were expended on the business structure of the taxpayer or whether they were part of the process by which income was earned. 6. Subsequently, in CIR v Lyttelton Port Company Limited (1997) 18 NZTC 13,273 (CA), the Court of Appeal considered whether a port company was entitled to a deduction for building demolition costs. The company did not want the buildings and had been forced to acquire them as part of a port restructure plan. The court noted there were no New Zealand cases on demolition costs and referred to the Australian cases of Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (1967) 120 CLR 240 (HCA) and Mount Isa Mines Ltd v FCT 92 ATC 4755 (HCA). The Court of Appeal considered the facts of the case before it were very similar to those in the Mount Isa case. The Court of Appeal noted that the court in Mount Isa relied on Tucker v Granada Motorway Services Ltd \[1979\] 2 All ER 801 (HL). The Court of Appeal, at 13,276, quoted the following from the speech of Lord Wilberforce in Tucker: I think that the key to the present case is to be found in those cases which have sought to identify an asset. In them it seems reasonably logical to start with the assumption that money spent on the acquisition of the asset should be regarded as capital expenditure. Extensions from this are, first, to regard money spent on getting rid of a disadvantageous asset as capital expenditure and, secondly, to regard money spent on improving the asset, or making it more advantageous, as capital expenditure. 7. The Court of Appeal then went on to say that: ...the identifiable asset test is one which has relevance to the present case. The respondent obtained a long-term benefit as the result of clearing the area of an unwanted building and improving the standard and extent of the wharf area. This benefit can only be characterised as an improvement in a capital asset. and later, at 13,276-13,277, that: Effectively, this was the disposition of a disadvantageous asset. Moreover, the demolition improved the respondent’s capital asset by providing an upgraded and additional uncluttered wharf area. ...The effect of the demolition was to enhance the assets deployed by the respondent in the production of revenue. 8. Accordingly, where a building being demolished is a capital asset, the demolition expenditure will be capital expenditure and not deductible under s DA 1(1). Expenses that are not otherwise deductible may, in some cases, be taken into account under the depreciation rules. 9. Buildings are depreciable property (ss EE 6 and EE 7). For buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more, the depreciation rate is 0% (ss EE 31(2)(d), EE 31(3)(c), EE 61(3B) and EZ 13(2)(c)). 10. Section EE 48 applies where a person has consideration from the disposal of depreciable property (s EE 44). Disposal of an asset includes destroying it (s YA 1, para (f) of definition of “dispose”). Section EE 45(1) provides that the consideration for disposal is the amount the person derives (excluding GST where they are a registered person): minus the amount (the disposal cost) that they incur in deriving the amount, to the extent to which the disposal cost- (a) is not allowed as a deduction to the person, other than as a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss; and (b) is not counted in “the amount that a person derives”. 11. The consideration can be zero or a negative amount (s EE 45(2)). Where the building (or its neighbourhood) is damaged rendering the building useless for deriving income and it is demolished, the consideration consists of any insurance, 3 indemnity or compensation received plus any consideration received for the disposal (s EE 45(8)). 12. Section EE 45 applies to the demolition costs as they are costs of disposing of a depreciable asset, the building, and the taxpayer is not allowed a deduction for the costs because of their capital nature. This means that, in calculating the consideration from the disposal of a building, the costs of the disposal are deducted from any amount a person derives from the disposal. For example, if it costs $10,000 to demolish a building and the owner sells various items from the demolished building for a total of $11,000, then the consideration from the disposal of the building will be $1,000 (ie, $11,000 - $10,000). On the other hand, if the only proceeds received are from the sale of some doors for $900, the consideration for the disposal of the building will be -$9,100 (ie, $900 - $10,000). 13. Where consideration from the disposal of depreciable property is more than the property’s adjusted tax value, a taxpayer derives assessable income. However, this is limited to the total amount of depreciation previously claimed for the asset (s EE 48(1)). 14. Generally, where the consideration received on disposal of a depreciable asset is less than its adjusted tax value, the taxpayer will have a depreciation loss (s EE 48(2)). However, under s EE 48(3), no depreciation loss on disposal can arise in respect of a building unless:  the building was rendered useless for the purpose of deriving income;  the building was demolished as a result of damage to the building or the building’s neighbourhood; and  the damage was caused by a natural event not under the control of the taxpayer, their agent or associated person and not as a result of a failure to act by the taxpayer, their agent or an associated person. 15. An example of where demolition costs may be taken into account in calculating a depreciation loss is where a building is demolished after being rendered useless for deriving income as a result of a cyclone or an earthquake. For information on changes to the depreciation and other tax provisions introduced in response to the Canterbury earthquakes see Tax Information Bulletins Vol 24, No 10, (December 2012): 23 and Vol 23, No 8, (October 2011): 65. 16. Where a building is sold cheaply for removal, rather than being demolished, any loss on that sale would also be on capital account. No deduction would be allowed for that loss because of the application of s EE 48(3). 17. Where the building demolished is a temporary building as defined in s YA 1, a person will be allowed a deduction for a loss that they incur under s DB 20. This section overrides the capital limitation. 4 References Subject references Capital expenditure Consideration from disposal of depreciable property Demolition costs Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007, ss DA 1, DA 2, EE 6, EE 7, EE 31(2), EE 31(3), EE 44, EE 45(1), EE 45(2), EE 48, EE 61(3B) and YA 1 , definition of “dispose”, para (f) Case references BP Australia Limited v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia \[1965\] 3 All ER 209 CIR v McKenzies NZ Ltd (1988) 10 NZTC 5,233 CIR v Lyttelton Port Company Limited (1997) 18 NZTC 13,273 Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (1967) 120 CLR 240 Mount Isa Mines Ltd v FCT 92 ATC 4755 Tucker v Granada Motorway Services Ltd \[1979\] 2 All ER 801
1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 14/09 INCOME TAX – MEANING OF “EXCESSIVE REMUNERATION” AND “EXCESSIVE PROFITS OR LOSSES” PAID OR ALLOCATED TO RELATIVES, PARTNERS, SHAREHOLDERS OR DIRECTORS All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) is about ss GB 23, GB 24, GB 25 and GB 25B. It explains the meaning of “excessive remuneration”, “excessive profits or losses” and “excessive amount arising from the application of the look-through company rules” when they are used in those four sections. During a review of the Public Information Bulletin and Tax Information Bulletin series published before 1996, four items were identified that deal with the issue of “excessive remuneration”. This QWBA updates and replaces:  “Wages paid to son during holidays” Public Information Bulletin No 29 (February 1966)  “Excessive remuneration paid to shareholders or relatives of shareholders” Public Information Bulletin No 115 (November 1981)  “TRA decisions – Case J53 (1987) 9 NZTC 297 or Case 94 (1987) 10 TRNZ 709 – Directors’ Fees” Public Information Bulletin No 164 (August 1987)  “Family partnerships: Commissioner’s ability to reallocate profits and losses” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). The Public Information Bulletin review has now been completed, see “Update on Public Information Bulletin review” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25, No 10 (November 2013). Question 1. When is the payment of remuneration or allocation of profits or losses considered to be excessive for the purposes of ss GB 23 to GB 25B? Answer 2. Any remuneration, profits or losses will be considered excessive where:  the amount paid is more than a reasonable reward for the services provided by a relative;  the share of partnership profits or losses exceeds the value of the contributions made by the partner;  the amount paid by a close company exceeds a reasonable reward for the services provided by a shareholder or director, or was influenced by the person’s relationship with a shareholder or director; and  the amount allocated under the LTC rules to a relative (aged under 20) who owns an effective look-through interest in an LTC exceeds a reasonable amount having regard to the value of their contributions by way of services, capital and any other relevant matters. 3. Generally, remuneration such as salary or wages incurred in deriving income is deductible. However, ss GB 23 to GB 25B are specific anti-avoidance provisions that the Commissioner can invoke where she considers that:  excessive remuneration or income has been paid to a relative (s GB 23);  a partner’s share of partnership profits or losses is excessive (s GB 23); 2  excessive remuneration has been paid by a close company to a shareholder or director, or a relative of a shareholder or director (s GB 25); a nd  excessive income is allocated under the LTC rules to a person (aged under 20) who owns an effective look-through interest in an LTC where a relative of the person also owns an effective look-through interest in the LTC (s GB 25B). 4. The purposes of these provisions are to prevent taxpayers reducing their income tax liability by allocating excessive payments to relatives and others, and to prevent the streaming of excessive losses to relatives to reduce their income tax liability. The amount considered excessive is either not deductible or reallocated. 5. Where excessive remuneration or income is paid to a relative, shareholder or director, or a partner’s share of partnership profits or losses is excessive, ss GB 23, GB 25 and GB 25B allow the Commissioner to reallocate the income or losses based on what is considered reasonable. 6. However, there are exemptions to ss GB 23 and GB 25. Section GB 23 does not apply if a genuine contract of employment or partnership satisfies the conditions set out in s GB 24. Similarly, s GB 25 does not apply if the conditions in s GB 25(3) are met. Explanation 7. Generally, remuneration such as salary or wages incurred for the purpose of deriving income is deductible. However, when excessive remuneration has been paid to a relative, shareholder or director, ss GB 23 to GB 25 allow the Commissioner to reallocate the excessive amount based on what is reasonable. Section GB 23(3) similarly allows the Commissioner to reallocate a partner’s share of partnership profits or losses when they are excessive. Section GB 25B allows the Commissioner to reallocate an excessive amount allocated to a relative who is aged under 20 under the look-through company (LTC) rules. 8. Broadly, the purpose of these provisions is to prevent taxpayers from reducing their income tax liability by allocating excessive remuneration, payments, profits or losses to relatives and others. 9. This QWBA is about the specific anti-avoidance provisions dealing with excessive remuneration and allocations of profits and losses in ss GB 23 to GB 25B. Meanings of key terms 10. Sections GB 23 to GB 25B refer to “excessive” in the context of excessive “income”, “remuneration” and “losses”. These sections also refer to the Commissioner’s ability to reallocate income or losses based on whether these amounts are “reasonable”. Section YA 1 defines the terms “income” and “loss”. The Act does not define the terms “excessive”, “remuneration” and “reasonable”. Ordinary meanings of “excessive”, “remuneration” and “reasonable” 11. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th edition, Oxford University Press, 2011) provides the following ordinary meanings of the words “excessive” “remunerate” and “reasonable”: excessive  adj. more than is necessary, normal, or desirable. remunerate  v. pay for services rendered or work done. reasonable  adj. 1 fair and sensible. ... 3 as much is appropriate or fair; moderate. 3 12. Based on the dictionary meanings, the ordinary meaning of “excessive remuneration” is “more than is necessary or normal for the services rendered or work done”. The meaning of “reasonable” is “fair and sensible” or “as much as is appropriate or fair”. The Commissioner can reallocate “excessive remuneration” based on what is “reasonable”. The Commissioner considers an amount of remuneration “reasonable” if it is appropriate or fair for the services provided. 13. This QWBA explains the Commissioner’s ability to reallocate excessive remuneration, profits or losses under ss GB 23 to GB 25B. This QWBA discusses the legislation and case law and provides examples to help readers understand the application of the law. The examples cover:  Paying excessive income or remuneration to a relative – s GB 23(1) and (2);  Allocating excessive profits or losses to a partner in a partnership – s GB 23(3);  Paying excessive remuneration to a shareholder or director (including a relative of a shareholder or director) – s GB 25; and  Allocating excessive income from an LTC to a relative aged under 20 under the LTC rules – s GB 25B. Who is a “relative”? 14. “Relative” is defined in s YA 1 . In summary, a “relative” is someone who is connected with another person by:  coming within the second degree of a blood relationship (eg, a sister and brother are within the second degree of a blood relationship; a parent and child are within the first degree);  being married (or in a civil union or de facto relationship) and including when one person is married to a person who comes within the second degree of a blood relationship with the other person (eg, a brother and his sister’s de facto partner; a daughter and her mother-in-law);  being adopted as a child by that person, or being adopted as a child by someone who comes within the first degree of relationship with that person (eg, a parent and their adopted child, or an adopted child and the son of the adopting parent);  being the trustee of a trust that a relative has benefited under or is eligible to benefit under. 15. In the definition of LTC, “relative” means a person connected with another person in a manner described in any of the first three bullet points above. Excessive income or remuneration paid to a relative – section GB 23(1) and (2) 16. Section GB 23(1) applies when a person who carries on a business or undertaking employs or engages a relative and the Commissioner considers that the remuneration paid to the relative is excessive for the services they provide. This provision also applies when the person who employs or engages is a company (other than a close company – see s GB 25(1)) and the person receiving the excessive remuneration is a relative of a director or shareholder in the company. 4 17. Section GB 23(2) similarly applies to a person (person A) who carries on a business in partnership and the partnership employs or engages a relative of person A to perform services for this business. If person A is a company, s GB 23(2) applies if the person employed or engaged is a relative of a director or shareholder of that company and the Commissioner considers that the remuneration paid to the relative is excessive. This provision also potentially applies to a person who owns an effective look-through interest for an LTC, if the LTC employs a relative of that person. 18. In summary, the focus of these provisions is on excessive remuneration paid to relatives for services rendered. Sections GB 23(1) and (2) cover situations where the person carrying on the business or undertaking is a:  natural person;  company (but not a close company);  partnership; or  LTC. 19. If excessive remuneration is paid to a relative, s GB 23(4) allows the Commissioner to reallocate the income among the parties “as the Commissioner considers reasonable”. In applying s GB 23(4) and (6), the Commissioner may take into account the nature and extent of the services the relative provides, the value of contributions made by the respective partners, and any other relevant matters. 20. However, s GB 23(1) and (2) does not apply if the contract is a “genuine contract” under s GB 24. Section GB 24(2) provides an exemption if there is a genuine contract of employment, engagement or partnership (see para \[36\] for discussion of s GB 24 as it applies to partnerships). For a contract of employment or engagement to be treated as a genuine contract under s GB 24(2), the following conditions must all be satisfied:  the contract is in writing and signed by all parties;  the person employed or engaged was aged 20 years or over when the contract was signed;  the contract is binding for at least three years;  the person employed or engaged has control over their income under the contract; and  no part of the income or share of profits derived by the relative or company (of which the relative is a shareholder or director) is a disposition for inadequate consideration. 21. The Court of Appeal considered a corresponding provision to s GB 24(2) (s 106(6) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954) in CIR v Lilburn \[1960\] NZLR 1,169. The court determined that for an employment contract to be a genuine contract of employment, it must satisfy all of the conditions stated in s GB 24(2). If the contract did not satisfy all the conditions, then it did not come within the s GB 24 exemption for a genuine contract – notwithstanding that it might be genuine in every other way. In Lilburn there was no genuine contract of employment because the contract was not binding for at least three years. 5 22. The following cases provide further guidance on when remuneration paid to a relative is excessive. Judge Barber considered the issue of excessive wages paid to a relative in Case L64 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,374. His Honour applied the equivalent to s GB 23 and refused to allow the taxpayer to deduct $100 wages paid to his five-year-old son for two weeks’ work on a building site. His Honour said that it was unreal to regard a five-year-old as providing services sufficient to justify any sort of payment. 23. In Case J24 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,140 one of the issues Judge Bathgate considered was the deductibility of wages paid to the taxpayer’s children and whether they were excessive. His Honour stated (at 1,147) that the key issue was “the nature and extent of the work done, rather than the identity of the person who does that work”. In Case J24 the amounts paid by the objector to his children would have been reasonable, if they “equated to an amount the objector would have to pay for an adult to do that same work, or to what it would have cost him, had he been paid wages for his work in his business” (at 1,148). Judge Bathgate regarded this as a commercially sound and practical method for calculating the appropriate wages. However, the taxpayer was unsuccessful in obtaining a deduction for reasons other than the wages being excessive. 24. In Case F108 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,072 one of the issues Judge Barber considered was whether the Commissioner was correct in disallowing a substantial amount of a taxpayer’s claim for a deduction for wages. The wages were paid to the 17- year-old daughter of the two principal shareholders and directors of the taxpayer company. Based on the hours worked and wages received, his Honour concluded that the $2.48 an hour the daughter was paid was a reasonable rate of pay based on the daughter’s age and the type of work she carried out. Summary of cases on excessive remuneration paid to a relative 25. The key focus is on the nature and extent of the work the relative carries out. Any remuneration paid should be based on the nature and extent of the work undertaken by the relative. Whether remuneration is reasonable may depend on the relative’s age and the type of work carried out (Case F108). The appropriate remuneration may be determined using an industry standard for doing the same type of work or calculated using a commercially acceptable method (Case J24; Case F108). It is unrealistic to claim a deduction for payments made to very young children because they are unlikely to be able to perform any useful work (Case L64). Where there is a genuine contract of employment or engagement under s GB 24(2), the Commissioner cannot reallocate any remuneration paid to the relative (Lilburn). 26. Based on these cases, the Commissioner reiterates the criteria she will consider for determining a reasonable payment for services rendered as set out in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7 No 7 (January 1996):  The nature of the services and the circumstances in which they will be or are performed.  The knowledge and skills required to carry out the services, including any particular qualifications.  The amount of payment that the person carrying out the duties would be paid by another independent employer for like services.  The locality where the duties are being performed.  The amount the taxpayer would be prepared to pay an arm’s length employee undertaking similar duties. 6 Example 1 – Wages paid to daughter and son working in family business 27. Mary and Bob operate a dairy as a family business. At the end of the 2013 income year, Mary and Bob claim a deduction for $20,000 wages paid to their children, Caroline aged 17 and David aged 5, for working in the dairy. Are the wages paid to Caroline and David deductible? 28. The Commissioner will allow a deduction for wages Mary and Bob paid to Caroline provided the wages are reasonable based on the nature and extent of the work she carried out. For example, if Caroline’s wages are consistent with the industry standard for similar work performed in a dairy, the Commissioner is likely to allow a deduction. However, the Commissioner is likely to disallow any additional amount paid on the basis that the remuneration is excessive. It is up to Mary and Bob to be able to show the Commissioner that the wages paid to Caroline are reasonable for the work that she performs. Evidence showing how the amount of Caroline’s wage was set may be useful. 29. The Commissioner will not allow a deduction for wages paid to David. The Commissioner’s view is that children as young as five are unlikely to be able to perform any useful work. Example 2 – Wages paid to daughter working in family business 30. Ted runs an accountancy business from an office in his home. He employs his 13 year-old daughter Lucy to clean his office (but not the rest of the house) and do filing every Saturday. This generally takes Lucy around four hours and she is paid $18 per hour. Ted seeks to deduct Lucy’s wages from his income. Are the wages paid to Lucy deductible? 31. In this case, Lucy is relatively young. Also, some of the work she is being paid to undertake (cleaning) and the location of the work (home) mean the work might be seen as a normal household chore. When these factors are present, the Commissioner is likely to consider the arrangement more carefully. 32. The onus is on Ted to show the Commissioner that the wages paid to Lucy are reasonable for the work she carries out. If Ted can show that $18 per hour is a reasonable amount to pay an arm’s length employee with Lucy’s knowledge and skills to undertake cleaning and filing, then he will be entitled to a deduction. Evidence showing that Lucy would be paid a similar amount for providing the same services to a third party would assist with this. As would evidence showing that Ted would have to pay a similar amount for someone else to perform the services to the same standard. Excessive profit or losses allocated to a partner in a partnership – section GB 23(3) 33. Section GB 23(3) applies when two relatives carry on business in partnership and the Commissioner considers that a partner’s share of partnership profit or losses is excessive. Section GB 23(3) also applies if one partner is a company and another partner is a relative of a director or shareholder in that company. 34. Under s GB 23(4), where the Commissioner considers that a partner’s share of partnership profits or losses is excessive, the Commissioner may allocate the profits or losses among the partners based on what the Commissioner considers reasonable. 7 35. Section GB 23(6) sets out the matters the Commissioner may take into account when applying s GB 23(3) to a partnership. These are the value of the contributions made by the respective partners, by way of services, capital or otherwise and any other relevant matters. 36. As noted above at para \[20\], s GB 24 provides an exemption to s GB 23(3) where a contract of partnership is genuine. Under s GB 24(2), a contract of partnership is treated as a genuine contract if:  the contract is in writing and signed by all partners;  all partners were aged 20 years or over when the contract was signed;  the contract is binding for at least three years (the contract may be dissolved for the reasons set out in ss 36 and 38 of the Partnership Act 1908, which provide for the dissolution of a partnership for reasons such as death, bankruptcy or dissolution by the court); and  each partner has control over their share of profits and real liability for their share of losses. 37. The courts have considered the reallocation of partnership profits or losses between partners. In Case B45 (1976) 2 NZTC 60,394, the Chairman, Lloyd Martin, considered whether the Commissioner was correct in reallocating income between partners in a farming partnership. In this case, no written contract of partnership existed. The partners were a farmer and the trustees of a family trust that farmed land in partnership. The partners owned the land as tenants-in- common in equal shares. The farmer bailed livestock to the partnership. He also worked for the partnership and received a management fee. After the management fee was deducted from the partnership’s income the profits from the partnership were allocated equally between the partners. However, the Commissioner considered that the amount allocated to the trustees was excessive. 38. In considering the allocation of partnership profits, the Chairman took into account the contributions by the partners, which included the value of land provided by the trustees, livestock bailed by the farmer, and the value of the services the farmer provided. These services were as a working partner who was responsible for the farming operation. The Chairman also noted that the farmer did not receive any payment for the bailed livestock for the first 12 months of the agreement. The Chairman disagreed with the Commissioner and concluded that after deducting a reasonable management fee for the farmer’s services and subtracting allowable deductions, it was reasonable for the balance of profits to be divided equally among the partners. This was consistent with the contributions of the partners, the partnership accounts and was in accordance with “ordinary commercial practice in the case of a partnership” (at 60,405). 39. In Case M65 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,368 the taxpayer and his wife were insurance consultants for a life assurance company. They carried on their consultancy business in a formal partnership. Relevantly, the husband declared two-thirds of the partnership commission income in his income tax return and the wife declared one-third. This was consistent with what the court concluded that the partnership agreement had intended. 40. Judge Bathgate also noted that the two-thirds and one-third allocation of profits between the husband and wife partners correctly reflected the contributions by the partners by way of services and capital. In other words, the contract of partnership was not a sham and could not be challenged in any other way as not being a genuine partnership contract. As a result, the Commissioner could not reallocate the taxpayers’ income. 8 41. In Case S2 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,012 there was no partnership agreement. The taxpayer and his wife were joint owners and partners in a rental property. From 1989 to 1992, all rental losses were allocated to the husband. However, the Commissioner reallocated the losses equally between the husband and wife. 42. The taxpayer’s accountant put forward three arguments why the husband should be able to use all of the losses. First, the husband and wife were joint owners of the rental property and they could choose how to divide the profits or losses. Secondly, on the basis that the husband and wife were partners there was no reason why they could not allocate all of the profits or losses to the husband. Finally, as an alternative, the rental losses could be allocated by using the original property investment contributions, which were 80% by the husband and 20% by the wife. 43. Judge Barber acknowledged that there was a partnership in existence in terms of s 5 of the Partnership Act 1908, which sets out rules for determining whether a partnership exists. Further, he noted that under s 27(a) of the Partnership Act 1908 there is a presumption that, in the absence of a partnership agreement, the partners are entitled to share equally. 44. However, his Honour also stated that the Income Tax Act 1976 set out the criteria for the Commissioner to consider (the equivalent to s GB 23(6)) and concluded (at 7,016): The husband and wife “could not allocate profits or losses each year solely to their best tax advantage.” Although the wife may have initially contributed 20% of the money used to fund their property investments, this was not determinative. Other factors such as a joint liability under the mortgage and subsequent contributions from the wife indicated that the husband and wife were equal owners and partners. \[Emphasis added.\] 45. Because the husband and wife were equal owners and partners, it was appropriate to share the losses equally between them. Summary of partnership cases 46. Where there is no partnership agreement, partnership profits and losses should be divided equally between the partners following the presumption under s 27(a) of the Partnership Act 1908 (Case S2). 47. When considering whether a partner’s share of profits or losses is excessive, the Commissioner may also take into account the capital contributions of the partners as shown in any agreement, including when a partner has made assets available to the partnership. This may include taking into account any payments received for the use of these assets. The Commissioner may also consider services provided by each partner, including responsibilities undertaken, special skills or expertise, work done, and time spent on partnership business (Case B45). Where there is a genuine contract of partnership under s GB 24(2), the Commissioner cannot reallocate any amounts attributed to the partners (Case M65). Example 3 – Excessive profits or losses allocated to partner 48. June and her husband Jim are partners in a partnership that owns several rental properties that have been operating at a loss. An agent manages the rental properties because June has a full-time job and Jim is retired. They do not have a partnership agreement. In June and Jim’s partnership return for the 2013 income year, the losses are allocated on the basis of 75% to June and 25% to Jim. This allows June to offset a greater proportion of the losses against her employment income, which is higher than Jim’s pension. Can the Commissioner apply section GB 23 to reallocate the losses? 9 49. Yes – the Commissioner can apply s GB 23 to reallocate the losses. Under s 27(a) of the Partnership Act 1908, there is a presumption that partners share profits and losses equally. Any different allocation between June and Jim would need to be justified based on the criteria in s GB 23(6) and the principles developed by the courts. Partners in a partnership cannot allocate profits or losses to obtain a tax advantage. As a result, the Commissioner would reallocate the losses on a 50–50 basis. 50. However, if June and Jim had a genuine contract of partnership that satisfied the conditions in s GB 24(2), the partnership’s profits and losses could be allocated in terms of that contract. Excessive remuneration paid to a shareholder or director (including a relative of a shareholder or director) – section GB 25 51. Section GB 25 applies when the Commissioner considers that a close company has paid excessive remuneration for services to a person who is a shareholder or director of the company. This provision also applies to excessive remuneration paid to a relative of a shareholder or director of the company. Where a close company pays excessive remuneration, s GB 25(2) treats the excess as a dividend paid by the company and derived by the shareholder or director. 52. However, an exemption to s GB 25 applies if the criteria in s GB 25(3) are met:  the service provider is an adult employed substantially full-time in the business of the company and who manages or administers the company;  the amount provided to the service provider is not influenced by their relationship with a shareholder or director; and  the service provider is resident in New Zealand. 53. In Case J53 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,297 (at 1,297) Judge Barber considered that determining whether remuneration was excessive required a focus on the nature and extent of the services the directors provided to the company: The directors attended to all their statutory duties as prescribed under the Companies Act. From time to time they executed company documents and prepared reports for the Statistics Department. In line with their responsibilities they met with their professional advisors at least three times a year. The husband made capital improvements to the farm, thereby increasing the company’s assets. The wife kept the day-to-day company accounts. Some of the work performed by the husband could be considered work as a lessee while other work was as a director. 54. Judge Barber’s view was that the remuneration paid to the directors was not excessive given the nature of the services they provided and responsibilities they undertook on behalf of the company. His Honour said they were entitled to be “remunerated in a fair manner” (at 1,301). 55. In Case J99 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,560, Judge Barber considered whether the Commissioner was correct in reallocating income that was paid to the wife of a shareholder-director. Both the husband and wife were shareholders, directors and employees of the taxpayer construction company. 56. In the year in question, the company allocated its net profit as shareholder salaries paying both the husband and wife a salary of $37,109 each. The Commissioner considered that the amount paid to the wife exceeded a reasonable amount for the services she provided. 10 57. Judge Barber agreed that the wife’s salary was influenced by her relationship with her shareholder-director husband and related to the profits of the company. In deciding on a reasonable salary for the wife, his Honour focused on the true worth of her services. This included comparing the husband’s and wife’s services provided to the company. The wife’s salary was reduced to $28,000 with the excess being treated as a dividend paid by the company to her. 58. In GS Mathews (Chemist) Ltd; Troon Place Investments Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,175, the main issue for the High Court was whether remuneration paid to the shareholders of two close companies (GS Mathews (Chemist) Ltd and Troon Place Investments Ltd) was excessive. One company was a retail chemist and the other a property investment company. A husband and wife owned the shares in both companies. 59. The taxpayer companies paid the husband and wife shareholders substantial remuneration for the 1990 and 1991 income years. However, during this time the husband and wife were on an extended overseas trip and had left the companies in the hands of managers. Although they were overseas, the husband and wife were involved in the management of both companies, at least to some extent, by staying in contact with their managers. The shareholders also investigated other business opportunities while overseas. 60. For GS Matthews (Chemist) Ltd, Tompkins J concluded that nothing limited the court to considering only services rendered by the shareholders during the time they were away. His Honour concluded that the remuneration paid to the shareholders was reasonable based on the results achieved by the pharmacy as a result of the business and entrepreneurial skills of the shareholders during the preceding years as well as their contributions during 1990 and 1991. 61. When considering whether remuneration paid to shareholders is excessive, the services rendered by the shareholders can be considered “in a broad and reasonable way”. This may include considering the value of a shareholder’s contribution in previous years, if it has provided an on-going benefit to the company. Previous salaries paid to shareholders may be relevant when determining whether a subsequent salary is excessive. 62. Troon Place Investments Ltd was a property investment company whose sole source of income was from rents earned from leasing commercial premises. In the 1990 and 1991 income years, it paid shareholder remuneration of $27,494 and $34,062 respectively. However, the Commissioner considered this remuneration excessive and reassessed these amounts based on an estimate of the number of hours the shareholders worked for Troon Place Investments while they were overseas. 63. Tompkins J agreed with the Commissioner’s assessment based on the hours the shareholders worked for the company while overseas. He noted that the property investment company was not in the same category as GS Mathews (Chemist) Ltd. This was because the sole source of income was rents rather than the entrepreneurial and business skills of the shareholders. Summary of shareholder and director remuneration cases 64. Remuneration paid must be based on the “true worth” of the services provided and not an arbitrary figure based on the company’s profits (Case J99). The reasonableness of fees must be based on the nature and extent of the services provided by the shareholder or director to the company (Case J53). 11 65. Remuneration must not be based on a relationship with a shareholder or director (Case J99). When determining whether remuneration paid to shareholders is excessive, the services rendered by the shareholders can be considered “in a broad and reasonable way”. This may include the value of a shareholder’s contribution in previous years if it has provided an on-going benefit to the company (GS Mathews (Chemist)). Example 4 – Excessive remuneration to shareholder or director 66. Sue and her husband Peter are 50–50 shareholders in a close company, ABC Ltd. Sue works full time in the business. Peter stays at home with the couple’s children during the week, but works 5 hours cleaning the company offices every Saturday. During the 2013 income year, ABC Ltd paid Sue and Peter a salary of $70,000 each. ABC Ltd has claimed the payment of these salaries as a deduction. Are these salaries deductible to ABC Ltd? 67. The Commissioner cannot reallocate the salaries if the conditions in s GB 25(3) are met. On the basis that both Sue and Peter are residents, Peter’s first difficulty in having the exemption apply to him is that he does not work substantially full-time in the business. In addition, Sue and Peter would need to show that the salaries paid were not influenced by their relationship to each other as shareholders (ie Peter would have to show that his salary was not influenced by his relationship to Sue as a shareholder of ABC Ltd and vice versa). Any salaries paid must be based on the value of the shareholder’s contributions to the company. In determining whether the salaries paid are influenced by Sue and Peter’s relationship to each other as shareholders the Commissioner will consider the nature and value of the services Sue and Peter provided to the company. In this case, it is likely that Peter’s salary has been influenced by his relationship with Sue, as his salary appears to be significantly out of proportion to the services that he is providing to the company. In such a case, the amount of the excess will be treated as a dividend paid by ABC Ltd to Peter. Excessive allocation of income from a look-through company to a relative aged under 20 – section GB 25B 68. Section GB 25B concerns LTCs. It is an anti-avoidance provision aimed at preventing excessive income from being diverted to owners aged under 20. Section GB 25B applies when two or more people who are relatives own look- through interests in an LTC. This provision applies when excessive income is allocated to a relative aged under 20 under the look through company rules. 69. Section HB 1(4) states that an LTC’s activity is treated as being carried on by persons holding “effective look-through interests” in the LTC. This means income and deductions are generally passed on to the LTC’s owners in proportion to their ownership interest in the LTC. Section GB 25B applies where the Commissioner considers that the application of the standard methods of calculating a look- through interest in s HB 1 results in excessive income being allocated to a relative aged under 20. Section GB 25B(2) allows the Commissioner to reallocate the owner’s effective look-through interests based on what is considered to be reasonable. When applying s GB 25B, s GB 25B(3) provides that the Commissioner may consider:  the nature and extent of the services rendered by the relative;  the value of the contributions made by the respective owners, by way of services, capital or otherwise; and  any other relevant matters. 12 Example 5 – Excessive allocation of income or deductions from a look- through company to a relative aged under 20 70. May and Adam each own 50% of the shares in an LTC. They both gift 10% of the company’s shares to Dan, their five-year-old son, who then owns 20% of the shares. As a result, they allocate 20% of the LTC’s income to Dan. Can the Commissioner reallocate the amount paid to Dan? 71. Section GB 25B(2) allows the Commissioner to reallocate effective look-through interests if income allocated to a relative aged under 20 is considered excessive. Section GB 25B(3) sets out the criteria the Commissioner may take into account when considering whether the income is excessive. These criteria are the nature and extent of the services rendered and the value of the contributions made by May, Adam and Dan by way of services, capital or otherwise. These criteria are similar to those for partnerships in s GB 23(3). The Commissioner’s view is that cases that consider partnership income where there is no contract of partnership, such as Case B45 and Case S2, assist when determining the nature and extent of the services rendered by each owner with an effective look-through interest and for valuing the contributions made by the respective owners. 72. Given that it is unlikely that Dan has provided services and he has provided no capital contributions to justify receiving 20% of the LTC’s income, the Commissioner will regard this allocation as excessive. The Commissioner can reallocate the amount paid to Dan by treating his look-through interests as being held by May and Adam. 73. For further information, see “Changes to the qualifying company rules and introduction of look-through company rules” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011). Relationship between this QWBA and Penny and Hooper case 74. The Commissioner notes that there are similarities between the subject matter considered in this QWBA and the Supreme Court decision in Penny and Hooper v CIR \[2011\] NZSC 95. The relationship between the two is explained below. 75. This QWBA is about the specific anti-avoidance provisions dealing with excessive remuneration and allocations of profits and losses in sections GB 23 to GB 25B. Penny and Hooper considered the issue of diverting personal services income. 76. The concepts of excessive remuneration and diverting personal services income both involve attempting to shift income from a key individual through whom the business earns income. For excessive remuneration, the focus is on whether the remuneration diverted to other individuals is reasonable given the services rendered by the other individuals. The specific anti-avoidance provisions may apply where the amount paid is excessive compared to the contribution to the business by the relevant individual. 13 77. In Penny and Hooper-type scenarios, the focus is on the income diverted from the key individual to associated entities, and generally through to other related individuals. The Supreme Court addressed the issue of diverting personal services income in Penny and Hooper under the general anti-avoidance provisions. For the Commissioner’s view of the general anti-avoidance provisions in ss BG 1 and GA 1 see “IS 13/01: Tax avoidance and the interpretation of sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25, No 7 (August 2013). For information about diverting personal services income, see RA 11/02: “Diverting personal services income by structuring revenue earning activities through an associated entity such as a trading trust or a company – the circumstances when Inland Revenue will consider this arrangement is tax avoidance” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 8 (October 2011). The principles in this QWBA are not intended to be applied to Penny and Hooper-type scenarios.

1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 14/10 GOODS AND SERVICES TAX – WHETHER A BINDING CONTRACT ALWAYS ESTABLISHES A TRANSACTION GIVING RISE TO A SUPPLY FOR SECTION 9(1) PURPOSES All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Question We‟ve Been Asked is about s 9(1). Question 1. We have been asked whether a binding contract always establishes a transaction giving rise to a supply for s 9(1) time of supply purposes. Answer 2. Generally such a transaction can be assumed where there is a binding contract. However, in some circumstances, the requirements for a binding contract may be satisfied but the contract will not establish there is a transaction giving rise to a supply for s 9(1) purposes. This would be the case where the making of a supply is factually or legally impossible from the outset or becomes impossible before s 9(1) can apply to determine the time of supply, or where the contract is used to commit fraud with no intention of making a supply, or found to be void, a sham, or otherwise legally ineffective. 3. No GST consequences can attach in such circumstances. Therefore, any output tax accounted for or input tax credit claimed by the parties to the contract in such circumstances would be incorrect and would require amendment under ss 113 or 113A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). 4. If the supply becomes factually or legally impossible to make after the time of supply has been triggered under s 9(1), the contract will establish a transaction giving rise to a supply for s 9(1) purposes. However, if the supply becomes factually or legally impossible to make after the time of supply under s 9(1) has been triggered, but during the same taxable period as the one in which s 9(1) was triggered, the supply cannot be attributable to that (or any other) taxable period. The supplier is therefore not required to account for output tax and the recipient is not entitled to claim an input tax credit. If however any output tax is in fact accounted for, or input tax credit claimed, by the parties to the contract in such circumstances, this would be incorrect and would require amendment under ss 113 or 113A of the TAA. 5. If the supply becomes factually or legally impossible to make in a taxable period after the one in which s 9(1) was triggered, the supplier remains obliged to account for output tax, and the recipient remains entitled to claim an input tax credit for that supply (subject to the matters discussed at para 38 below). In such circumstances, s 25 will be the appropriate section under which to make the necessary adjustments to reflect that the supply is no longer possible to make. 6. This QWBA applies from 30 September 2014. Background 7. In 2010, the Commissioner published IS 10/03: “GST: Time of supply – payments of deposits, including to a stakeholder” in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 6 2 (July 2010): 7. IS 10/03 considered the application of the time of supply rule in s 9(1) to situations involving the payment of a deposit, including payment to a stakeholder. 8. IS 10/03 concluded that a transaction giving rise to a supply must be established before s 9(1) will apply. The item confirmed that s 9(1) is a timing-only provision; it will apply to fix the time of supply only if there is a transaction giving rise to a supply. The legal arrangements entered into between the parties must be considered to determine whether a transaction giving rise to a supply exists. IS 10/03 stated that where there is a binding contract such a transaction is assumed. Where there is no contract, the existence of a transaction giving rise to a supply will be established where there are reciprocal obligations between the parties. 9. Since the publication of IS 10/03, we have been asked whether it can always be assumed there is a transaction giving rise to a supply for s 9(1) purposes where there is a binding contract. 10. A transaction giving rise to a supply may be established in other ways, but the focus of this QWBA is on binding contracts. Explanation 11. The issue for s 9(1) purposes is whether there is a transaction giving rise to a supply, rather than whether there is a contract. The legal rights and obligations entered into by the parties must be established in the light of the factual background to the transaction to determine whether there is a supply and the nature of the supply: Wilson & Horton Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325 (CA); CIR v NZ Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 (CA); Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075 (CA); CIR v Gulf Harbour Development Ltd (2004) 21 NZTC 18,915 (CA); Rotorua Regional Airport Ltd v CIR (2010) 24 NZTC 23,979 (HC). 12. Section 9(1) defines the time of supply for the purpose of determining when output tax is payable or input tax is deductible: Pine v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,570 (CA); CIR v Capital Enterprises Ltd (2002) 20 NZTC 17,511 (HC). As stated, s 9(1) is a timing-only provision; it will apply to fix the time of supply only if there is a transaction giving rise to a supply. 13. The operation of s 9(1) is triggered when the supplier issues an invoice or receives any payment (whichever is earlier) in respect of a supply. Its operation does not depend on the actual making of a supply (in terms of goods provided or services performed) but on there being a transaction giving rise to a supply. While such a transaction is required in all cases for s 9(1) to apply, establishing a transaction giving rise to a supply will be particularly relevant when the supply has not yet been made at the time the supplier issues an invoice or receives any payment in respect of that supply. 14. Where the supply has not yet been made (in terms of goods provided or services performed), there will still usually be a transaction giving rise to a supply for s 9(1) purposes where a binding contract exists under which the supplier has an obligation to make a supply: Case L67 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,391; Case N24 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,199; Rob Mitchell Builder Ltd (in liquidation) v National Bank of New Zealand Ltd (2004) 21 NZTC 18,397 (CA); Nigel Mansell Sports Co Ltd \[1991\] BVC 718. This is because a binding contract generally establishes there is a transaction giving rise to a supply for s 9(1) purposes. A binding contract is one where the requirements of a contract are satisfied. 15. However, in some circumstances, a binding contract may not establish a transaction giving rise to a supply. In other circumstances, a written document 3 that appears to be a binding contract may not, in fact, be a binding contract when considered in the light of the factual background. Such a document will also not establish a transaction giving rise to a supply. When does a binding contract not establish a transaction giving rise to a supply? 16. This question will be answered by first considering the situation where the making of a supply is factually or legally impossible from the outset. This QWBA will then consider situations where the making of a supply becomes factually or legally impossible. Finally, contracts used to commit fraud, sham and other legally ineffective contracts will be considered. The making of the supply is factually or legally impossible from the outset No binding contract 17. Whether there is a binding contract (ie, offer and acceptance, an intention to be bound and certainty as to the essential terms of the contract) is judged objectively: Wilmott v Johnson \[2003\] 1 NZLR 649 (CA); Mechenex Pacific Services Ltd v TCA Airconditioning (New Zealand) Ltd \[1991\] 2 NZLR 393 (CA). 18. While it is theoretically possible to enter into a contract to do something that is impossible (Jones v St John’s College (1870) LR 6 QB 115; Eurico S.p.A. v Philipp Brothers \[1987\] 2 Lloyd‟s Law Reports 215 (EWCACiv)), a binding contract will generally not arise in such instances. 19. A binding contract will not arise where an agreement is made to do something that is factually or legally impossible if the parties did not intend to be bound or consideration is not provided, or if the contract is void on the grounds of a common mistake of the parties: Halsbury’s Laws of England (4 th ed, Butterworth & Co (Publishers) Ltd, London, 1974) vol 9 at \[447\]; HG Beale (ed), Chitty on Contracts (30 th ed, Thomson Reuters (Legal) Ltd, London, 2008) vol 1 at \[3-023\]; Bell v Lever \[1932\] AC 161 (HL). In such circumstances, a transaction giving rise to a supply for the purposes of s 9(1) will not be established. 20. Case Z16 (2009) 24 NZTC 14,179 involved a contract for a supply that was legally impossible to make as the mortgagee did not have the right to exercise the power of sale. The High Court had previously, in separate litigation proceedings, found that the contract was void. Case Z16 confirms that a contract that is void because the supplier does not hold, and is not able to obtain, legal rights that would enable a supply to be made, does not establish a transaction giving rise to a supply for s 9(1) purposes. If this situation exists at the time of supply under s 9(1), there will be no contract establishing a transaction giving rise to a supply. Binding contract does not establish a transaction giving rise to a supply 21. It might be thought that the mere existence of a binding contract establishes a transaction giving rise to a supply, despite the supply contracted for being factually and legally impossible to make from the outset. However, as stated above, the issue is not whether there is a binding contract, but whether there is a transaction giving rise to a supply. 22. The mere existence of a binding contract for a supply that is factually or legally impossible to make from the outset will not establish a transaction giving rise to a supply for s 9(1) purposes, because: 4  In circumstances where the supply is factually or legally impossible to make from the outset, it will be clear that the supply contracted for will not be made. In such circumstances, there will be a sufficiently serious breach on the part of the supplier that would entitle the recipient to cancel the contract: ss 7(3) and 7(4) of the Contractual Remedies Act 1979. Where the supply is factually or legally impossible to make from the outset, the recipient does not have to proceed to cancel the contract before it will fail to establish a transaction giving rise to a supply for s 9(1) purposes (see the discussion of Ch’elle Properties (NZ) Ltd v CIR (2004) 21 NZTC 18,618 (HC) below). Therefore, a contract that the recipient is entitled to cancel because the supply is factually or legally impossible to make from the outset will not establish a transaction giving rise to a supply for s 9(1) purposes.  A supplier cannot be required to make a supply that is factually or legally impossible. A court will not enforce the performance of an obligation under a contract to make a supply that is factually or legally impossible: Ferguson v Wilson (1866) LR 2 Ch App 77; Forrer v Nash (1865) 35 Beav 167 (RollsCt); Hall v Vernon 34 SE 764 (W. Va. Dec 02, 1899); Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage International Ltd \[2002\] 4 All ER 689 (EWCACiv); Boyarsky v Taylor \[2008\] NSWSC 1415. This is the case even if the reason for the impossibility is the fault of the defendant: Seawell v Webster (1859) 29 LJ Ch 71. A contract for a supply that neither party has an obligation to complete will not establish a transaction giving rise to a supply for s 9(1) purposes. 23. In summary, a binding contract will generally not arise where an agreement is made to do something that is factually or legally impossible from the outset, and a transaction giving rise to a supply for s 9(1) purposes will not be established. Even if there is a binding contract, the mere existence of the binding contract will not establish a transaction giving rise to a supply for s 9(1) purposes where the supply is factually or legally impossible to make from the outset. The making of the supply becomes factually or legally impossible 24. The previous paragraphs considered whether a binding contract establishes a transaction giving rise to a supply where the supply is factually or legally impossible to make from the outset. This section considers whether a binding contract for a supply that becomes factually or legally impossible to make will establish a transaction giving rise to a supply. The answer depends on the time at which the supply becomes factually or legally impossible to make. If the contract is for a supply that becomes factually or legally impossible to make after the time of supply has been triggered under s 9(1), the contract will establish a transaction giving rise to a supply for s 9(1) purposes. Where the supply becomes factually or legally impossible to make before s 9(1) can apply to determine the time of supply, the contract will not establish a transaction giving rise to a supply. 25. An example of a supply that could potentially become factually or legally impossible to make is one where, at the time the agreement was entered into, a supplier did not own the goods agreed to be supplied or the goods agreed to be supplied did not exist. However, the mere fact that goods did not exist or that the supplier did not own goods at the time a contract was entered into, or at the time the supplier issued an invoice or received any payment, does not mean there cannot be a supply for s 9(1) purposes. A possibility may exist that a contract for a supply will not be performed, but this does not automatically mean that no supply will take place for GST purposes. Generally, parties to a contract cannot anticipate that the supply contracted for will not be made: Case N24; Rob 5 Mitchell; Bethway & Moss Ltd (1988) 8 BVC 718. Therefore, such a contract for a supply will generally establish a transaction giving rise to a supply. However, where the making of the supply becomes factually or legally impossible before s 9(1) can apply to determine the time of supply, the contract will not establish a transaction giving rise to a supply. 26. Another example of a supply that becomes factually or legally impossible to make is one where (without default by either party) an event happens after a contract is made that renders the supply in its entirety impossible to make and the contract does not provide for what is to happen if such an event occurs. In this situation the contract would terminate automatically: National Carriers Ltd v Panalpina (Northern) Ltd \[1981\] 1 All ER 161 (HL). If this situation exists before s 9(1) can apply to determine the time of supply, the contract will not establish a transaction giving rise to a supply. However, if the supply becomes factually or legally impossible to make after the time of supply has already been triggered under s 9(1), the contract will establish a transaction giving rise to a supply for s 9(1) purposes. 27. In Ch’elle Properties, certain vendor companies entered into agreements to purchase sections in a subdivision. They then on-sold these sections to Ch‟elle Properties (NZ) Ltd (Ch‟elle), who claimed input tax credits. It subsequently transpired that the agreements between the vendor companies and the original vendor were cancelled because the vendor companies had failed to settle on the stipulated date. The on-sale agreements between Ch‟elle and the vendor companies were never cancelled. Ch‟elle argued that, because the contracts between Ch‟elle and the vendor companies had not been cancelled, the “supply” giving rise to the claims for input tax credits had not been altered under s 25 and that it therefore remained entitled to the input tax credits claimed. The court, however, disagreed with this submission. Rodney Hanson J concluded that the basis on which the supply had originally taken place had been utterly changed when the vendor companies lost the legal right to acquire the land they were on- selling as a result of the cancellation of the agreements with the original vendor. This was so despite the contracts between Ch‟elle and the vendor companies not being cancelled. 28. The Commissioner considers the reason for the court‟s conclusion was that the supply had become impossible to make. The fact that the contracts between Ch‟elle and the vendor companies remained on foot did not establish that a transaction giving rise to a supply existed. 29. In summary, a binding contract for a supply that becomes factually or legally impossible to make after the time of supply has been triggered under s 9(1) will establish a transaction giving rise to a supply for s 9(1) purposes. Where the supply becomes factually or legally impossible to make before s 9(1) can apply to determine the time of supply, the contract will not establish a transaction giving rise to a supply. Contracts used to commit fraud, sham and other legally ineffective contracts 30. Where a contract is used as the means of committing a fraud and the purported supplier does not ever intend to make a supply, the contract will not establish a transaction giving rise to a supply for s 9(1) purposes: Munn v C & E Commrs \[1989\] VATTR 11; C & E Commrs v Pennystar Ltd (1996) BVC 125 (QBD). 31. A contract that is a sham or otherwise legally ineffective is not a binding contract and will not establish a transaction giving rise to a supply: Marac Life Assurance Ltd v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,086 (CA); Howard (1981) 1 BVC 1,155. For more information about the meaning of sham and other issues relating to shams, see the Commissioner‟s interpretation guideline IG 12/01: “Goods and services tax; 6 income tax – „sham‟” published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 7 (August 2012): 3. 32. In summary, a contract used to commit fraud with no intention of making a supply, a sham or other legally ineffective contract will not establish a transaction giving rise to a supply for s 9(1) purposes. How is a binding contract that does not establish a transaction giving rise to a supply treated for GST? 33. This QWBA is concerned with whether it can always be assumed there is a transaction giving rise to a supply for s 9(1) purposes where there is a binding contract. Practically, the time at which this will be most relevant is when GST is accounted for or claimed. 34. This QWBA has explained that a contract will not establish a transaction giving rise to a supply for s 9(1) purposes where the contract is:  for a supply that is factually or legally impossible to make from the outset;  for a supply that has become factually or legally impossible to make before s 9(1) can apply to determine the time of supply; or  used to commit fraud with no intention of making a supply, void, a sham or otherwise legally ineffective. 35. Section 9(1) cannot operate where the contract does not establish a transaction giving rise to a supply because there will be no supply for s 9(1) purposes. This means that any invoice issued or payment received by the supplier cannot trigger the operation of s 9(1) because the invoice is not issued, nor is payment received, “in respect of that supply”, as is required for the operation of s 9(1). Also, any purported invoice will not meet the definition of “invoice” under s 2 because, where there is no supply, the document cannot notify the recipient of an obligation to make payment. The supplier is not obliged to account for output tax, and the recipient is not entitled to claim input tax in this situation. Therefore, any output tax returned or input tax credit claimed by the parties to the contract in such circumstances would be incorrect and would require amendment under ss 113 or 113A of the TAA. (Section 113A of the TAA enables a taxpayer to correct certain minor errors in the return for the next taxable period.) How is a binding contract for a supply that becomes factually or legally impossible to make after the time of supply has been triggered under s 9(1) treated for GST? 36. If the contract is for a supply that becomes factually or legally impossible to make after the time of supply has been triggered under s 9(1), the contract will establish a transaction giving rise to a supply for s 9(1) purposes. However, if the supply becomes factually or legally impossible to make after the time of supply under s 9(1) has been triggered, but during the same taxable period as the one in which s 9(1) was triggered, no supply can be attributed to that (or any other) taxable period under s 20. (Section 20 requires a person to calculate the amount of tax payable in respect of each taxable period by deducting input tax in relation to supplies made to that person during that taxable period from the amount of output tax attributable to the taxable period.) As no supply can be attributed to any taxable period, the supplier is not required to account for output tax and the recipient is not entitled to claim an input tax credit. Therefore, any output tax accounted for or input tax credit claimed by the parties to the contract 7 in such circumstances would be incorrect and would require amendment under ss 113 or 113A of the TAA. 37. If the supply becomes factually or legally impossible to make in a taxable period after the one in which s 9(1) was triggered, the supply remains attributable to the taxable period in which s 9(1) was triggered. The supplier is therefore obliged to account for output tax, and the recipient is entitled to claim an input tax credit for that supply. Section 25 will then apply to reverse the GST consequences in the taxable period during which it becomes apparent that the output tax returned or input tax claimed is incorrect. The supplier will also be required, under s 25(3), to issue a credit note where the supplier has issued a tax invoice for that supply. 38. However, it must be noted that:  Any refund claim made is subject to the Commissioner‟s right to withhold payment of a GST refund under s 46 where the Commissioner investigates the circumstances of the return, or requests further information concerning the return. This is provided the Commissioner notifies the taxpayer of her intention to investigate, or requests further information, within 15 days of receipt of the return.  If, before the refund is paid out, it comes to the Commissioner‟s attention that the contract cannot proceed and a supply will not be made, the Commissioner is not required to ignore that fact and pay out the refund (subject to the Commissioner‟s obligation to act in accordance with s 46 as set out above and ss 89B and 89C of the TAA). This is because any refund paid out would be immediately recoverable: Case X12 (2005) 22 NZTC 12,189 and Riccarton Construction Ltd v CIR (2010) 24 NZTC 24,191 (HC). 39. The Commissioner‟s view in Question We‟ve Been Asked: “GST consequences of a cancelled contract” published in Tax information Bulletin Vol 17, No 4 (May 2005): 26 (the 2005 QWBA) could be interpreted as being inconsistent with the view expressed in this QWBA. The 2005 QWBA states that where a contract for the sale and purchase of land is cancelled after the time of supply under s 9(1) has been triggered, the supplier remains obliged to account for GST on the sale of that land and the recipient remains entitled to an input tax credit on the purchase of the land. This QWBA expresses the view that if the supply becomes factually or legally impossible to make after the time of supply under s 9(1) has been triggered, but during the same taxable period as the one in which s 9(1) was triggered, the supply cannot be attributable to that (or any other) taxable period. The supplier is therefore not required to account for output tax and the recipient is not entitled to claim an input tax credit. To the extent that the 2005 QWBA could be interpreted as being inconsistent with the view expressed in this QWBA, this QWBA should be relied on as representing the Commissioner‟s view. Examples 40. The following examples assume transactions between registered persons in the course of carrying on taxable activities. Example one: Auckland Harbour Bridge 41. Two individuals enter into an agreement for the sale and purchase of the Auckland Harbour Bridge. An invoice is issued, but no payment is due until settlement in 50 years. 42. A transaction giving rise to a supply has not been established. This is because the factual background suggests any supposed contract did not create genuine 8 legal rights and obligations. As it is general knowledge that the Bridge is in public ownership, is part of the State highway network and is unlikely to be offered for sale, it is unlikely the parties intended to be bound to make a supply that is impossible. 43. Even if there is a binding contract, the contract would not establish a transaction giving rise to a supply. As the vendor does not hold legal rights and would be unable to obtain legal rights that would enable the supply to be performed, the vendor could not be required to supply the Bridge. The purchaser would be entitled to cancel the contract. The existence of a contract under which the parties do not have reciprocal obligations involving a supply in return for payment will not establish a transaction giving rise to a supply for the purposes of s 9(1). 44. In this example an invoice can neither be issued “in respect of that supply”, as is required for the operation of s 9(1), nor can it meet the s 2 definition of “invoice”. This means that the issue of a purported invoice cannot trigger the operation of s 9(1). The vendor is not obliged to account for output tax and the purchaser is not entitled to claim an input tax credit. Should the parties incorrectly either account for output tax or claim an input tax credit in such circumstances, the assessment would require amendment under s 113 of the TAA. Example two: movie car 45. A dealer enters into contracts for the purchase and on-sale of a unique car used in a famous movie. Invoices are issued and deposits paid under each contract. At the time the contracts were entered into, unbeknown to the parties, the car had been destroyed by fire and neither of the contracts provided for what was to happen if the car could not be supplied. As a result, the contracts are void on the grounds of a common mistake. 46. In this example, neither of the contracts establishes a transaction giving rise to a supply for the purposes of s 9(1). A supply is not treated as having taken place. The issue of the purported invoices cannot trigger the operation of s 9(1) because, in these circumstances, an invoice can neither be issued “in respect of that supply”, as is required for the operation of s 9(1), nor can it meet the s 2 definition of “invoice”. Similarly, the deposit payments cannot be made “in respect of that supply”, as is required for the operation of s 9(1). Therefore, the dealer would not be entitled to an input tax credit on the purchase of the car and would not be required to account for output tax on the sale of the car. Should the dealer either account for output tax or claim an input tax credit, the assessment would require amendment under s 113. Example three: copyright issues 47. Company A grants a licence to use a patent to Company B, believing it has the right to do so. Company A issues an invoice and Company B claims an input tax credit on the purchase of the licence resulting in a GST refund. It later transpires that Company A never in fact held any rights in the patent and is unable to obtain rights, so no rights could be licenced to Company B. As it is clear that the making of the supply is impossible, neither party can be held to the contract. 48. Therefore, the contract does not establish a transaction giving rise to a supply for the purposes of section 9(1). In this example the invoice can neither be made “in respect of that supply”, as is required for the operation of s 9(1), nor can it meet the s 2 definition of “invoice”. This means that the issue of the purported invoice by Company A cannot trigger the operation of s 9(1). Therefore, Company A is not obliged to account for output tax and Company B was not entitled to an input tax credit (even if the invoice complied with all the requirements for a tax invoice under s 24). 9 49. As Company B was not entitled to claim an input tax credit, the refund has been incorrectly obtained and requires amendment under s 113 of the TAA. Example four: delayed delivery 50. A registered person enters into an agreement to purchase a number of computers and related PC hardware from Ned‟s PC Supplies. The terms of the agreement are that Ned‟s PC Supplies will order the computer equipment from its supplier and will invoice the registered person upon receipt of the equipment at its warehouse. Delivery of the equipment to the purchaser is to take place on an agreed date, with payment of the full purchase price to be made on delivery. An implied term of the contract is that Ned‟s PC Supplies will be able to supply the equipment and it is factually and legally possible to make the supply. Ned‟s PC Supplies experiences delays in obtaining the equipment and is unable to supply the equipment on the delivery date, so the purchaser decides not to go ahead with the purchase. 51. In this situation, there was a contract under which Ned‟s PC Supplies had a genuine legal obligation to supply the equipment. As a result of events that occurred after the contract was made, Ned‟s PC Supplies was unable to supply the equipment on time. The purchaser therefore had the right to, and did, cancel the contract. Since Ned‟s PC Supplies‟ breach of the contract occurred before the time of supply (because Ned‟s PC Supplies had neither issued an invoice yet, nor had it received any payment for the equipment) the contract fails to establish a transaction giving rise to a supply for the purposes of s 9(1). 52. Ned‟s PC Supplies is not obliged to account for output tax and the purchaser is not entitled to claim an input tax credit. However, should the parties mistakenly either account for output tax or claim an input tax credit in such circumstances, the assessment would require amendment under s 113 of the TAA or under s 113A of the TAA. Example five: shipping disaster 53. A registered person enters into a contract with a car dealer to buy a new car and pays a deposit. The car dealer issues a tax invoice and accounts for and pays GST on the sale of the car. The purchaser claims an input tax credit on the purchase of the car resulting in a GST refund. The car needs to be shipped to New Zealand from Japan. The car falls off the boat in rough seas on the way to New Zealand. When it becomes clear that the car has been lost at sea and will not be provided to the purchaser, the dealer notifies the purchaser and refunds the deposit to the purchaser at the same time. 54. In this example, there were genuine contractual obligations for the supply of the car at the time of supply (being the earlier of the time the deposit was paid or the tax invoice issued). Therefore, the contract establishes a transaction giving rise to a supply for the purposes of s 9(1). As it became factually impossible to make the supply after the s 9(1) time of supply, s 25 would apply to adjust the car dealer‟s GST liability in the taxable period during which it has become apparent that the car will not be supplied. The car dealer would also be required to issue a credit note to the purchaser under s 25(3). 55. Section 25 would similarly apply to reverse the refund obtained by the purchaser in the taxable period in which the dealer notified the purchaser that the car had been lost at sea. 56. However, note that if, before the refund is paid out, it comes to the Commissioner‟s attention that the contract cannot proceed and the supply will not be performed, the Commissioner is not required to ignore that fact and pay out the refund. 10 References Related rulings/statements “GST consequences of a cancelled contract”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 4 (May 2005): 26 IS 10/03: “GST: Time of supply – payments of deposits, including to a stakeholder”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 6 (July 2010): 7 IG 12/01: “Goods and services tax; income tax– „sham‟”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 7 (August 2012): 3 Subject references GST Supply Time of supply Legislative references Contractual Remedies Act 1979, ss 7(3)(c), 7(4) Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, ss 9(1), 25, 46 Tax Administration Act 1994, ss 89B, 89C, 113, 113A Case references Bell v Lever \[1932\] AC 161 (HL) Bethway & Moss Ltd (1988) 8 BVC 718 Boyarsky v Taylor \[2008\] NSWSC 1415 C & E Commrs v Pennystar Ltd (1996) BVC 125 (QBD) Case L67 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,391 Case N24 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,199 Case X12 (2005) 22 NZTC 12,189 Case Z16 (2009) 24 NZTC 14,179 Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075 (CA) Ch’elle Properties (NZ) Ltd v CIR (2004) 21 NZTC 18,618 (HC) CIR v Capital Enterprises Ltd (2002) 20 NZTC 17,511 (HC) CIR v Gulf Harbour Development Ltd (2004) 21 NZTC 18,915 (CA) CIR v NZ Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 (CA) Eurico S.p.A. v Philipp Brothers \[1987\] 2 Lloyds Law Reports 215 (EWCACiv) Ferguson v Wilson (1866) LR 2 Ch App 77 Forrer v Nash (1865) 35 Beav 167 (RollsCt) Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage International Ltd \[2002\] 4 All ER 689 (EWCACiv) Hall v Vernon 34 SE 764 (W.

1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 14/11 INCOME TAX: SCENARIOS ON TAX AVOIDANCE All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about s BG 1. Introduction 1.At a tax conference held in November 2013, there was a discussion of whether s BG 1 would apply to certain scenarios. This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) considers three of the scenarios raised at the conference. 2.In the scenarios, the arrangements and the conclusions reached are framed broadly. As the objective is to consider the application of s BG 1, the analysis proceeds on the basis that the tax effects under the specific provisions of the Act are achieved as stated. However, it should not be presumed that this would always be the case. Also, additional relevant facts or variations to the stated facts might materially affect how the arrangement operates and a different outcome under s BG 1 might arise. Accordingly, the Commissioner’s view as to whether s BG 1 applies must be understood in these terms. 3.Section BG 1 is only considered after determining whether other provisions of the Act apply or do not apply. Where it applies, s BG 1 voids a tax avoidance arrangement. Voiding an arrangement may or may not appropriately counteract the tax advantages arising under the arrangement. If not, the Commissioner is required to apply s GA 1 to ensure this outcome is achieved. 4.For a more comprehensive outline of the Commissioner’s position on the law concerning tax avoidance in New Zealand, reference should be made to the Commissioner’s Interpretation Statement: IS 13/01 Tax avoidance and the interpretation of sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (July 2013). Scenario 1 — Interest deductions where shareholder loans replaced Question 5.Whether s BG 1 applies to the following arrangement: Company A is wholly owned by a family trust. The trust has advanced to the company $1m in shareholder loans. Company A has used the shareholder loans to finance its business operations for the purpose of deriving assessable income. Company A borrows $1m from a third-party lender at arm’s-length market interest rates to repay the shareholder loans to the trust. The third-party borrowing by Company A is secured over the assets of the trust. The trust uses the repaid funds to acquire a holiday home for use by the trust’s beneficiaries. For tax purposes, Company A deducts interest incurred on the loan from the third-party lender from its business income. Scenario 1 replaced by QB 23/01 Scenario 1 replaced by QB 23/01 2 Answer 6. The Commissioner’s view is that, without more, s BG 1 would not apply to this arrangement to deny Company A interest deductions under ss DB 6 or DB 7 for the interest incurred in respect of the loan from the third-party lender. Explanation 7. Under this arrangement, Company A is replacing funds invested in its business operations by the trust with funds from the third-party lender. The objectives of the arrangement would seem to be to enable the trust to free up capital for reinvestment in other assets (the holiday home) while Company A maintains sufficient working capital in order to continue its business operations. The tax effect for Company A is that an interest deduction will be available under ss DA 1, DB 6 or DB 7 if previously the shareholder loan was interest free. Alternatively, a greater interest deduction will arise if the third-party loan bears a higher interest rate than the shareholder loan. No deduction would have been available had the trust borrowed directly to acquire the holiday home. 8. Parliament’s purpose for the general deductibility provisions is to allow expenditure incurred in carrying on a business or deriving assessable income to be deductible as long as it was not capital or private or domestic expenditure. Private or domestic expenditure is expenditure referable to living as an individual member of society or to a household or family unit. Private or domestic expenditure is not usually referable to carrying on a business or deriving assessable income. 9. However, interest deductions are treated differently in several ways, including not being subject to the limitation on deducting capital expenditure provided in s DA 2(1). The limitation on deducting private or domestic expenditure provided in s DA 2(2) still applies. Generally, for interest deductions Parliament intended interest to be deductible where the loan capital relating to that interest is used in a business or in some other way in the production of assessable income (s DB 6, Pacific Rendezvous Ltd v CIR \[1986\] 2 NZLR 567 (CA)). 10. Parliament has also distinguished between some companies and other taxpayers in respect of interest deductions. Significantly, interest incurred by some companies is deductible under s DB 7 without the need to establish a nexus between the borrowing and carrying on a business or deriving assessable income. Section DB 7 does not apply to qualifying companies, nor does it apply to interest related to tax. There are other rules relating to non-resident companies, wholly-owned groups of companies and consolidated groups. By making this significant distinction, Parliament intended to clarify the interest deductibility rules applying to companies and to reduce compliance costs by simplifying those rules. 11. Where s DB 7 does not apply, the Commissioner’s view is that the interest deductibility test is satisfied where borrowed funds are used to replace amounts invested in income-earning activities and to repay those amounts to the persons who invested them (FCT v Roberts; FCT v Smith 92 ATC 4380, see also BR Pub 10/19 Interest Deductibility – Roberts and Smith – Borrowing to replace and repay amounts invested in an income earning activity or business). 12. Accordingly, in an arrangement involving interest deductions, Parliament would expect to see, as matters of commercial and economic reality, borrowing by a company with attendant interest liabilities in circumstances where there is either compliance with s DB 7 or sufficient nexus or connection with a business or income-earning activity. Also, the interest deductions claimed should not be related to private or domestic expenditure. 3 13. Those requirements appear to be satisfied in the case of Company A. Company A has assumed a real liability in favour of the third-party lender and incurred interest as a matter of commercial and economic reality. Either Company A satisfies s DB 7 or the circumstances are such that the interest deductibility test is satisfied as the borrowed funds are used to replace amounts invested in the company’s business. 14. This conclusion is not negated by the fact that the lending is secured over the assets of the trust. The deductibility of the interest turns on the question of the use of the funds borrowed, not the nature of any security given. Similarly, how the trust then uses the funds repaid does not have a bearing on this question. The Commissioner does not consider the circumstances are such that the interest could be characterised as private or domestic expenditure subject to the private limitation. Company A is not receiving any private or domestic benefit from the expenditure. As stated, the borrowed funds are replacing funds previously invested in the company’s business operations. The commercial and economic reality is that the borrowed funds are used in the business and there is no private use of those funds. 15. Also, the types of factors mentioned by the court in Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 115 (at \[108\]), such as artificiality or contrivance, do not appear to be present in this case. If those factors were present, they could indicate that the interest deductibility requirements are not met when the arrangement is viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way. 16. Accordingly, in the Commissioner’s view, this arrangement is within Parliament’s contemplation for the interest deductibility provisions. As such, it is not a tax avoidance arrangement as it does not have tax avoidance as a purpose or effect and s BG 1 would not apply. NOTE: The Commissioner has considered a scenario dealing with interest deductions and avoidance in a previous QWBA: QB 12/11: Income Tax – look-through companies, rental properties and avoidance. In both that scenario and the scenario here, the Commissioner considers that the interest is deductible and s BG 1 does not apply. The scenario in QB 12/11 differed in that it looked at the situation when an LTC borrows funds to buy a shareholder’s private house, which the LTC then uses as a rental property. In comparison, the current scenario deals with the situation when a company that is not an LTC replaces a shareholder loan with debt. In both situations, the shareholders use the funds received from the company (in QB 12/11 as sale proceeds and in this QWBA as return of their shareholder loan) to buy a house that is not used to derive assessable income. The Commissioner has also considered a scenario dealing with loss attributing companies (LAQCs) and residential housing in Revenue Alert 07/01 The sale of private homes to loss attributing qualifying companies to generate tax deductions (October 2007). Revenue Alert 07/01 deals with the situation where a private home is sold to an LAQC and rented back by the former owners so that tax deductions can be claimed by the LAQC for outgoings that would otherwise be considered private expenditure. The Revenue Alert indicates that, generally, such an arrangement would be subject to s BG 1. A key difference between the scenario above and the Revenue Alert is that, even though rent is charged, if there were any borrowings, it would be difficult to conclude that they are used to earn income in the circumstances where the person lives in the home before and after the arrangement and the LAQC has no other income. 4 Scenario 2 – Look-through company election Question 1 17. Whether s BG 1 applies to the following arrangement:  Company B is owned equally by two family trusts. One of the trusts operates a farming business that is expected to incur losses for tax purposes in the future.  Company B is operating a profitable business and has built up significant reserves (both tax paid and untaxed).  The directors of Company B elect look-through company (LTC) status for the company and resolve to distribute all reserves as dividends once the LTC election takes effect.  The existing reserves of Company B are distributed to the shareholders in the first year after attaining LTC status. Answer – Question 1 18. The Commissioner’s view is that s BG 1 would not apply to the arrangement. Explanation – Question 1 19. The objectives of the arrangement would appear to be for Company B and its shareholders to avail themselves of options provided by the legislation. These are electing to operate as an LTC under the Act and distributing the company’s reserves. 20. The relevant tax effects of the arrangement are:  For the first year in which the company operates as an LTC, the shareholders will have income from Company B calculated according to s CB 32C (in addition to any look-through company income for that year under s CB 32B). Company B will cease to be an imputation credit account company. However, the shareholders will receive the benefit of the former balance of the company’s imputation credit account as part of the calculation in s CB 32C. The result of that calculation in the first year is that the shareholders only pay tax on the company’s existing unimputed reserves.  In future years, as an LTC under subpart HB, the profits of Company B will no longer be taxed to the company at the company tax rate of 28%. Instead, they will be taxed to the trustee shareholders and taxed at the trustee rate of 33%, unless distributed to beneficiaries.  If the profits of the company are distributed by the trustees to the beneficiaries, they will be taxed at the beneficiaries’ marginal tax rates.  As a result of the look-through nature of an LTC, in future income years, the trustee shareholder operating the farm could offset any farming losses against its share of any profits from Company B.  Once operating as an LTC, distributions of company reserves, including the existing reserves, are not subject to further tax in the hands of the shareholders. An LTC is excluded from the definition of a “company” in the Act, which means that most of the rules that apply to companies, including the rules governing the taxation of dividends, do not apply to LTCs. 5 21. The particular avoidance issue in this scenario is whether the combined tax effect of the company’s existing fully imputed reserves not being taxed at any more than the company tax rate where distributed to shareholders on a higher marginal tax rate, is within Parliament’s contemplation. 22. The purpose of the LTC rules generally is to integrate a closely-held company’s tax treatment with the tax treatment of its owners, similar to that of a partnership. In this they reflect the purpose of the qualifying company rules that they replaced. The qualifying company rules were introduced in 1992 after a review of the tax system by the Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital (the Valabh Committee). The Valabh Committee noted that the shareholders of closely-held companies had “a practical choice of operating either as a sole proprietorship, a partnership or a trust” (Taxation of Distributions from Companies (November 1990) at paragraph 2.7.1). 23. Accordingly, LTCs are transparent for tax purposes. An LTC’s income, expenses, tax credits, rebates, gains and losses are allocated to its owners. These items will generally be allocated to owners in proportion to the number of shares they have in the LTC. Any profit is taxed at the owner’s marginal tax rate. The owner can use any losses against their other income, subject to the loss limitation rule that ensures the losses claimed reflect the level of the owner’s economic loss in the LTC. The effect of the LTC rules is that shareholders can have the benefits of limited liability given by a company, as well as the ability to be taxed at the level of the owner. 24. Under the LTC regime company reserves may be distributed or drawn upon without the shareholders being taxed on the distribution. Parliament contemplated existing companies electing into the LTC regime, but the treatment of reserves under the LTC regime was not intended to apply to company reserves previously accumulated by existing companies. Because of this, a mechanism is needed to ensure tax is paid on existing company reserves when a company enters the regime. This mechanism is provided by s CB 32C. 25. Under s CB 32C the company’s existing reserves are regarded as held by the shareholders in proportion to their look-through interest and each owner is deemed to have an amount of income arising on the first day of the income year the company becomes an LTC. In the first year after the election, the shareholders of existing companies pay tax at their marginal tax rate on a one-off basis on the company’s unimputed reserves that existed at the time of the company becoming an LTC. 26. No further tax is paid by the shareholders on any subsequent distribution of reserves. This is regardless of whether any shareholders have a marginal tax rate greater than the company tax rate at the time. On the other hand, any shareholders with a marginal tax rate of less than the company tax rate will not receive any relief for tax paid by the company in excess of their marginal rate. Had the company not elected LTC status, this relief may have been provided to them in the form of excess imputation credits able to be carried forward to subsequent years and offset from future tax liabilities. 27. Effectively, this means that in the first year after the election the shareholders do not pay tax on existing fully imputed company reserves at their marginal tax rates. Had the arrangement not been entered into, the shareholders would have been required to pay tax at their marginal tax rates when these accumulated profits were distributed as dividends. The shareholders would have been required to pay further tax on fully imputed dividends because the distribution would not have then been from an LTC. As the shareholders in the arrangement are trustees, they would have had to have paid tax on any dividends that were trustee income at the higher trustee rate of 33%. 6 28. Parliament’s purpose, as expressed elsewhere in the Act and in the way the LTC regime applies to new companies or existing companies after the initial year, shows that it generally intends profits earned through a company to be taxed at a shareholder’s marginal tax rate. In this scenario, the avoidance issue is whether use of the election, the payment of tax under s CB 32C, and subsequent tax-free distributions is within Parliament’s contemplation. In particular the issue is whether it is within, or contrary to, this more general purpose of Parliament for the taxation of shareholders. 29. The Commissioner’s view is that Parliament has made an exception to its general approach of taxing company profits distributed to shareholders at the shareholders’ marginal rates in the case of the first year following an existing company electing LTC status. Parliament may have made this exception in the case of an existing company electing LTC status for reasons such as reducing complexity and compliance costs. For this provision, considering the text and context of the legislation, it can be concluded that Parliament’s purpose for shareholders of an existing company that is an LTC is for them to effectively pay a final tax at 28% on existing fully imputed company reserves so that ongoing distributions can be passed on to shareholders as they arise with no further tax effects. 30. In the Commissioner’s view, the circumstances Parliament would expect to be present where an existing company elects to enter into the LTC regime are present in this arrangement when the arrangement is viewed as a whole. As matters of commercial and economic reality, there is a closely-held company that is carrying on a business that satisfies the requirements of entering into the LTC regime. 31. The types of factors mentioned by the court in Ben Nevis (at \[108\]), such as artificiality or contrivance, do not appear to be present in this case. If those factors were present, they could indicate the LTC regime requirements are not met when the arrangement is viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way. In reality, the arrangement consists of an election for a particular tax status by a closely-held company carrying on a business that is available under the Act followed by a distribution of company reserves. 32. The Commissioner considers that this arrangement is within Parliament’s contemplation for the LTC regime. Without more, it would not seem to be a tax avoidance arrangement as it does not have tax avoidance as a purpose or effect and s BG 1 would not apply. Question 2 33. Whether s BG 1 applies to the arrangement described in Question 1 of this scenario if:  At the time of electing LTC status, Company B’s directors also contracted to sell the company’s business and decide to liquidate the company once the LTC election is effective and the sale has settled.  The sale of the business is settled and the directors pass the resolution to liquidate the company. A liquidator is appointed who distributes surplus assets to shareholders and ensures the company is removed from the register of companies. Answer – Question 2 34. The Commissioner considers that s BG 1 would potentially apply to the arrangement described in paragraph 33. 7 Explanation – Question 2 35. The arrangement for the purposes of s BG 1 in this variation of scenario 2 comprises the LTC election, sale of the business and the liquidation of Company B. It would appear the objective of this arrangement is to use the LTC regime to enhance the value obtained by the shareholders from winding up Company B. The relevant tax effect is that no dividends arise when the company winds up as an LTC. The other relevant tax effect is that the shareholders do not pay any further tax on the distribution of the company’s fully imputed reserves before the company winds up. Accordingly, the relevant purposes of Parliament for this arrangement are derived from the dividend rules for a company that winds up and the LTC regime as a whole. In comparison to the original arrangement in Question 1, the different aspects of this arrangement of the business sale and wind-up bring a different perspective to discerning Parliament’s relevant purposes. 36. An LTC is not treated as a “company” for the dividend rules so they do not apply to Company B when it is wound up. Parliament’s purpose for companies that are winding up is for certain amounts to be taxable as dividends. However, Parliament contemplates that LTCs are not subject to these provisions. Accordingly, the election of Company B into the LTC regime circumvents Parliament’s purpose for the application of the dividend rules to companies that are winding up. As will be discussed, despite the election, Company B is effectively not operating so the arrangement makes no other use of the LTC regime other than the initial election and treatment afforded an LTC upon wind-up. This is not consistent with Parliament’s purposes for the dividend rules. 37. As discussed under Question 1, the purpose of the LTC rules is to provide transparent income tax treatment to closely-held companies operating as LTCs so they could be considered as viable alternative vehicles to partnerships and sole proprietorships for the conduct of businesses or income-producing activities. The rules provide for the treatment of an LTC’s income, expenses, tax credits, rebates and losses, and distributions to shareholders. It is notable that a company only retains LTC status if it continues to meet the eligibility criteria. The benefits of the rules are intended to be accessed only by companies with certain characteristics and who continue to have those characteristics. 38. It is the Commissioner’s view that Parliament’s purpose for these rules is only given effect where a company is operating. That is, where the company has the prospect on an ongoing basis to employ capital to generate income, expenses, tax credits, rebates and losses. Also, several features of the rules anticipate the future tax treatment applicable to LTCs or their shareholders, for instance, the one-off payment of tax on reserves under s CB 32C and the one-off adjustment extinguishing losses that apply upon a company’s entry to the regime. The rules ensure the benefits of the regime are limited to LTCs and their shareholders while an LTC is operating. It would follow that Parliament’s purpose is that the entity is an operating one or has the prospect of operating when it enters and then uses the regime. 39. The Commissioner accepts arguments can be made to the contrary but considers that, on balance, all the above features of the LTC rules lead to a conclusion that Parliament’s intention is for the effects of the regime to apply over time as LTCs continue to operate and carry out transactions with tax impacts. Therefore, the Commissioner’s view is that a fact, feature or attribute Parliament would expect to see present in order to give effect to its purposes for the LTC regime is that the election and one-off payment of tax is available where the LTC is ongoing. It would be inconsistent with these purposes for an existing company to elect to become an LTC as part of the wind-up process just to take advantage of what 8 might be a more favourable tax treatment of distributions made to owners taxed at the highest marginal tax rate. 40. It is acknowledged that the regime contemplates an LTC liquidating in s HB 4(3). It also could be argued that the way LTC elections operate, particularly through s HB 13(4), quick “in-and-out” use of the regime is also contemplated and dealt with. However, the Commissioner views s HB 4(3) as a mechanical provision required to remove any doubt that liquidation is treated as a disposal of a shareholder’s owner’s interest. It should not be taken that this provision indicates Parliament’s acceptance of an LTC’s liquidation in the circumstances of Company B. Section HB 13(4) is part of provisions intended to protect the integrity of the regime. In the Commissioner’s opinion, it does not indicate Parliament’s comprehensive view of all time-related aspects of the regime. 41. In contrast to the arrangement under Question 1 of this scenario, there is effectively no operating company in this scenario, nor is there any prospect of the company operating. Instead, the objective of the arrangement is to wind up Company B. However, the manner by which the arrangement is carried out includes the step of obtaining LTC status, which is an unnecessary step in achieving that objective. It serves only to ensure the wind-up occurs in the most tax advantageous way. This would also be true even if there was an amount of time between the LTC election and the wind-up of the company. The key is whether the arrangement comprises both the wind-up of the company and an LTC election. 42. In Question 1 of this scenario the arrangement is within Parliament’s purposes for the LTC regime and, as mentioned, the Commissioner would not seek to apply s BG 1 to that scenario. However, the contrary is the case in this variation of the scenario. In the Commissioner’s view, it is strongly arguable that this arrangement is outside Parliament’s contemplation for the dividend rules, the LTC regime and how the Act should apply to a company that is winding up. If the Act is being used or circumvented in a way that does not give effect to Parliament’s purposes, even though the particular use (or non-application) is not explicitly dealt with in the legislation, s BG 1 will still apply. As such, the present arrangement is likely to be a tax avoidance arrangement as it has tax avoidance as a purpose or effect. Merely Incidental test 43. The next step is to test whether the tax avoidance purpose or effect of the arrangement is “merely incidental” to a non-tax avoidance purpose or effect (referred to as the merely incidental test). For a full analysis of the merely incidental test see paragraphs 395 to 438 of IS 13/01. 44. Section BG 1 can only apply where an arrangement fails this test. The Commissioner’s view is that the tax avoidance purpose or effect is unlikely to be merely incidental to another purpose or effect of the arrangement, such as the purpose or effect of ceasing the business operations and winding up the company. Unlike the arrangement in Question 1, electing LTC status was an unnecessary step inserted into the arrangement and the tax avoidance purpose or effect appears to have been pursued as a goal in its own right. As such, it does not seem to flow naturally from, or as a mere concomitant to, some other purpose or effect of the arrangement and the arrangement fails the merely incidental test. Reconstruction 45. If s BG 1 is to apply to this scenario, consideration would have to be given to how the Commissioner would assess the tax liabilities of the relevant taxpayers. The effect of s BG 1 is that the whole arrangement is void as against the 9 Commissioner. In this scenario, voiding the whole arrangement would not appropriately counteract the tax advantages of the arrangement and may remove legitimate tax outcomes. In the Commissioner’s opinion, an appropriate action would be for her to exercise her reconstructive power under s GA 1 to tax the sale and liquidation on the basis that Company B is not an LTC. Scenario 3 —Substituting debentures Introduction 46. This scenario involves an issue of debt by a company to its shareholders in a manner that potentially circumvents the substituting debenture rule in s FA 2(5). 47. The substituting debenture rule was originally enacted in 1940 as a specific anti-avoidance rule under very different tax policy settings. The repeal of the rule from 1 April 2015 has recently been enacted as part of Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014. Nevertheless, it is considered useful to comment on this scenario as it illustrates the application of s BG 1 where a provision’s purpose has become less clear over time. In such situations, the Commissioner considers that the text of the provision, supported by the scheme of the Act, will generally be the key determinant of Parliament’s purpose. 48. In a draft version of this QWBA circulated for public consultation, the Commissioner concluded that s BG 1 would potentially apply to the following scenario. The Commissioner now considers that s BG 1 would not apply, for the reasons set out below. Question 49. Whether s BG 1 applies to the following arrangement:  Company C is a joint venture company owned 50% by a New Zealand shareholder and 50% by an unassociated foreign shareholder.  Company C is funded by a combination of ordinary shares, non-participating redeemable shares and interest-bearing shareholder debt (which is issued in proportion to the ordinary shares).  The terms of the shareholder debt provide that on the occurrence of an insolvency-type event, the company has the option to convert the debt into shares having a net asset value equal to the face value of the loan. 1 Answer The following analysis focuses solely on the potential circumvention of the substituting debenture rule, and does not consider s BG 1 in relation to the financial arrangements rules or other tax implications of the arrangement. 50. The Commissioner’s view is that s BG 1 would not apply to this arrangement. 51. Although not discussed below, the Commissioner considers that s BG 1 may potentially apply to alternative structures that have the effect of circumventing the substituting debenture rule, such as the use of “wrap-around” debt (and similar variants), or undocumented loans. 1 The terms of the shareholder debt have been amended slightly from the scenario presented at the tax conference to avoid interpretive issues, as the purpose of the scenario is to consider the potential application of s BG 1. 10 Explanation 52. The objective of the arrangement appears to be for the shareholders to fund Company C with a combination of debt and equity. The relevant tax effects are that deductions for interest payments on the debt will not be restricted by s FA 2(5), and will therefore be deductible to Company C under s DB 7. 53. The text of s FA 2(5) suggests that Parliament’s purpose is that interest payable under a debenture should be treated as a dividend and therefore non-deductible where the debenture is issued to a shareholder and the amount of the debenture is determined by reference, inter alia, to the number of shares in the company held by the shareholder. This will often be the case where debentures are issued in proportion to shareholdings. The text also suggests that Parliament’s purpose is that the rule should not apply to a debenture that is a convertible note. 54. The legislative history indicates that the original purpose of the substituting debenture rule was to target transactions in which companies were swapping their ordinary equity for debt. However, that purpose has largely ceased to be relevant due to subsequent changes to the tax system. As a result, it is more difficult to determine a clear underlying purpose of the rule from its legislative history. Despite this, Parliament has retained the rule in its current form, and therefore it must be assumed to have a role to play. 55. It remains the case that the Act recognises a distinction between debt and equity. Interest payable in respect of debt is generally deductible, whereas distributions in the nature of dividends are not deductible. In certain instances, such as the current example, Parliament has legislated that particular debt instruments be recharacterised as equity (eg, substituting debentures, profit-related debentures, and stapled-debt securities), due to the equity-like features of those instruments. 56. The Commissioner considers that the text of the provision, supported by the scheme of the Act relating to debt and equity, is the key determinant of Parliament’s purpose in this instance. Accordingly, Parliament’s purpose in relation to the substituting debenture rule is that debt, where the amount is determined by reference to the number of shares in a company, should be reclassified as equity. 57. Convertible notes were originally excluded from the substituting debenture rule when a specific provision concerning the taxation of convertible notes was introduced into the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. The exclusion remains in s FA 2(5), as convertible notes are now intended to be dealt with under the financial arrangements rules. Accordingly, Parliament’s purpose in this respect is that the tax treatment of convertible notes should be determined under the financial arrangements rules, rather than the notes being recharacterised as equity under the substituting debenture rule. 58. In an arrangement where s FA 2(5) does not apply, Parliament would expect to see either:  debentures that as a matter of commercial and economic reality have not been issued by reference to the number of shares in the relevant company; or  debentures that are genuinely convertible notes – eg, debentures that as a matter of commercial and economic reality: o are issued by a company; o relate to money lent to the company; and o are convertible – eg, they have: 11  a realistic prospect of being converted; and  some practical effect on conversion. 59. In the current instance, Company C has issued debentures to its shareholders in proportion to their shareholdings. This strongly suggests that the amount of the debentures has been determined by reference to the number of shares in Company C. Accordingly, the key issue is whether the debentures are genuinely convertible notes. 60. In the Commissioner’s view, the debentures in this example are clearly issued by Company C in relation to money lent to it. Furthermore, the debentures appear to have a realistic prospect of being converted, as the trigger event (ie, an insolvency-type event) is a real possibility in the context of any corporate borrower. This is to be contrasted with a trigger event that may be so highly contingent that the debenture has little prospect of being converted as a matter of commercial and economic reality. 61. The Commissioner considers that Parliament would not have intended the convertible note exclusion in s FA 2(5) to apply in situations where conversion of the debentures would have no practical effect as a matter of commercial and economic reality. Both the High Court in Alesco New Zealand Ltd v CIR \[2012\] 2 NZLR 252 (HC) (at \[112\]) and the Court of Appeal in Alesco New Zealand Ltd v CIR \[2013\] NZCA 40 (CA) (at \[11\]) concluded that the convertibility feature of the notes in that arrangement had no practical effect. The High Court concluded that that aspect of the arrangement was artificial. 62. What the relevant practical effect contemplated by Parliament is may vary depending on the provision at issue. In the current instance, the Commissioner accepts that conversion of the debentures would have some practical effect, on the basis that:  Company C will be able to enjoy both solvency and cash flow benefits on conversion without having recourse to its shareholders; and  conversion is likely to affect its shareholders’ priority on a liquidation as against third-party creditors. 63. On this basis, the Commissioner considers that what Parliament would expect to see in the arrangement is in fact present. It follows that the non-application of the substituting debenture rule would be within Parliament’s purpose for that rule in this instance, and that the arrangement is not a tax avoidance arrangement in that respect. 12 References Subject references: Convertible notes Dividends Interest deductibility Look-through company election Merely incidental Winding up Reconstruction Substituting debentures Tax avoidance Tax avoidance arrangement Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007: ss BG 1, CB 32B, CB 32C, DA 1, DA 2, DB 6, DB 7, FA 2(5), GA 1, subpart HB, Case references Alesco New Zealand Ltd v CIR \[2012\] 2 NZLR 252 (HC) Alesco New Zealand Ltd v CIR \[2013\] NZCA 40 (CA) Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 115 FCT v Roberts; FCT v Smith 92 ATC 4380 Pacific Rendezvous Ltd v CIR \[1986\] 2 NZLR 567 (CA) Related rulings/statements BR Pub 10/19 Interest Deductibility – Roberts and Smith – Borrowing to replace and repay amounts invested in an income earning activity or business IS 13/01 Tax avoidance and the interpretation of sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (July 2013) QB 12/11: Income Tax – look-through companies, rental properties and avoidance Revenue Alert 07/01 The sale of private homes to loss attributing qualifying companies to generate tax deductions (October 2007) Taxation of Distributions from Companies (November 1990, Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital (Valabh Committee))
This QWBA concludes that a person cannot claim a foreign tax credit in New Zealand for any amounts withheld by their United Kingdom pension provider from a United Kingdom pension. This confirms Inland Revenue’s longstanding view. HM Revenue & Customs agrees with Inland Revenue’s view and will refund amounts incorrectly paid to them. The Commissioner has prepared an operational position Commissioner’s Operational Position on foreign tax credits for amounts withheld from United Kingdom pensions. This explains how to claim repayments from HMRC, how to stop United Kingdom pension providers making deductions and if necessary how to change past New Zealand tax returns. QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 14/12 INCOME TAX – Foreign tax credits for amounts withheld from United Kingdom pensions All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA 2007) unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about ss LJ 2(1) and LJ 3 and articles 19 and 22 of sch 1 to the Double Taxation Relief (United Kingdom) Order 1984 (including the ―principal agreement‖ 1 and the protocols) (the NZ/UK DTA). Question 1. Can a person claim a foreign tax credit in New Zealand for any amounts withheld in the United Kingdom by their United Kingdom pension provider from their United Kingdom pension payments? Answer 2. No. A person cannot claim a foreign tax credit in New Zealand for any amounts withheld in the United Kingdom by their United Kingdom pension provider from their United Kingdom pension payments. A person can only claim a foreign tax credit in New Zealand if ―foreign income tax‖ has been paid. An amount withheld from a pension payment in the United Kingdom by a United Kingdom pension provider is not ―foreign income tax‖ for the purposes of New Zealand’s tax credit rules. This is because under art 19 of the NZ/UK DTA the United Kingdom has no right to tax pensions paid to New Zealand tax residents. Explanation 3. We have been asked whether a person can claim a foreign tax credit in New Zealand for amounts withheld in the United Kingdom from their United Kingdom pension payments. This item considers the situation where:  A person with a United Kingdom pension has moved to New Zealand and become a tax resident of New Zealand. (The person is a tax resident of New Zealand under New Zealand’s domestic residence test (see s YD 1). If the person is a tax resident of both New Zealand and the 1 Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and capital gains, (signed 4 August 1983, entered into force on 1 April 1984 in New Zealand, entered into force in the United Kingdom on 16 March 1984). United Kingdom, the person may be deemed to be solely a New Zealand tax resident under the tie-breaker tests in art 4(2) of the NZ/UK DTA. For further details on New Zealand’s individual residence test and the double tax agreement tie-breaker tests see IS 14/01 Residence.)  The United Kingdom pension payments are taxable in New Zealand.  The United Kingdom pension provider withholds an amount (in the form of United Kingdom PAYE 2 ) from the pension payments because: - the person has not filled out the relevant HM Revenue & Customs’ form, or - the form has not been processed by HM Revenue & Customs and a direction to the pension provider to stop the deductions has not been issued. 4. This item does not consider the situation where:  A United Kingdom pension is exempt income under s CW 28, such as a United Kingdom state pension that is paid in accordance with an arrangement under s 70 of the Social Security Act 1964.  A lump sum withdrawal is made from a foreign superannuation scheme by a New Zealand resident or a New Zealand resident transfers an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme to a New Zealand (or Australian) superannuation scheme. Double tax agreements 5. The New Zealand Government enters into double tax agreements with other jurisdictions. A key purpose of these international treaties is to prevent double taxation of income. Once signed, these treaties need to be incorporated into New Zealand law by an Order in Council. This Order in Council incorporates the text of the treaty and any protocols to the treaty into New Zealand law. The NZ/UK DTA is part of New Zealand law by Order in Council: Double Taxation Relief (United Kingdom) Order 1984. 6. One way in which the NZ/UK DTA provides relief from double taxation is to allocate the right to tax certain income to either New Zealand or the United Kingdom. For example, the NZ/UK DTA exempts some types of income from taxation in the country where the income is sourced and allocates the taxing rights to that income to the country of residence of the person deriving the income. 7. There are a number of references to double tax agreements in the ITA 2007. Section BB 3(2) provides that under subpart BH a double tax agreement has effect in relation to income tax. Subpart BH specifically deals with double tax agreements. Section BH 1(4), as relevant, provides that: BH 1 Double tax agreements ... Overriding effect (4) Despite anything in this Act, except subsection (5), or in any other Inland Revenue Act or the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993, a double tax agreement has effect in relation to— (a) income tax: (b) any other tax imposed by this Act: 2 In the United Kingdom, pension payers are treated as employers and pensioners are treated as employees, so generally pension payments are subject to PAYE: r 11 of the Income Tax (Pay As You Earn) Regulations 2003 (UK). ... 8. A double tax agreement having ―effect in relation to income tax‖ means that the double tax agreement has an overriding effect as to income tax under the ITA 2007, including the income and tax credit parts of the ITA 2007. Therefore, the income and tax credit parts of the ITA 2007 must always be read together with the relevant articles of a double tax agreement. Where there is any inconsistency between the two, the domestic law must be read subject to the double tax agreement. 9. Article 19(1) of the NZ/UK DTA provides that the sole taxing rights for pensions lie with the country of residence: Article 19 Pensions and annuities (1) Pensions (including pensions paid under the social security legislation of a Contracting State), and similar remuneration in consideration of past employment or services, paid to a resident of a Contracting State, and any annuity paid to a resident of a Contracting State, shall be taxable only in that State. \[Emphasis added\] 10. Article 19(1) provides that a pension paid to a resident of New Zealand shall be taxable only in New Zealand. 11. While art 19 gives New Zealand the sole right to tax the pension income of its residents, it does not require New Zealand to tax such income. For the pension to be taxable in New Zealand, it must also be taxable as income under Part C of the ITA 2007. Some overseas pensions are exempt income in New Zealand and as a result are not taxable in New Zealand: s CW 28. 3 This QWBA assumes that the relevant pension is not exempt income under s CW 28 and is taxable as income in New Zealand. If the pension income is exempt income under s CW 28, then no foreign tax credit will arise. This is because a foreign tax credit can only arise for income that is taxable in New Zealand: ss LJ 2, LJ 4 and LJ 5. Foreign tax credits 12. If a person’s pension income is taxable in New Zealand, the question arises whether any foreign tax credits result for any amounts withheld in the United Kingdom from the pension payments. A foreign tax credit recognises tax that has been paid on that income in another country. A foreign tax credit can reduce the amount of tax payable on that income in New Zealand. 13. A person must have paid ―foreign income tax‖ to be entitled to a foreign tax credit: s LJ 2(1). ―Foreign income tax‖ is specifically defined in s LJ 3 for the purposes of the tax credit rules as ―an amount of income tax of a foreign country‖. In the first instance, the amounts withheld by the United Kingdom pension providers in the United Kingdom appear to be United Kingdom income tax (in the form of PAYE), so appear to be ―an amount of income tax of a foreign country‖ under s LJ 3. 14. However, as noted above, pursuant to s BH 1(4), the NZ/UK DTA has an overriding effect on the tax credit provisions in the ITA 2007. This means that the definition of ―foreign income tax‖ in s LJ 3 (which is used only for the purposes of the tax credit rules) must be read together with the NZ/UK DTA. Where there is any inconsistency between the two, New Zealand’s domestic law must be read subject to the NZ/UK DTA. Specifically, the term ―foreign income tax‖ in s LJ 3 must be read subject to the relevant articles in the NZ/UK DTA. This approach is consistent with principles of international treaty interpretation. 3 In some circumstances, a United Kingdom state pension will be exempt income under s CW 28 in New Zealand. For example, a United Kingdom state pension that is paid by the special banking method under s 70 of the Social Security Act 1964 is exempt income under s CW 28(1)(e). 15. In determining the overriding effect of the NZ/UK DTA on the tax credit provisions, the Commissioner considers that the NZ/UK DTA must be interpreted in accordance with the text of the relevant articles within the context of the NZ/UK DTA and in light of its purpose. This is because the NZ/UK DTA is an international treaty entered into by New Zealand and it must be interpreted accordingly. New Zealand is a signatory to the Vienna Convention 4 so New Zealand’s treaties have to be interpreted according to that convention. Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention provides that ―\[a\] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose‖. 16. Article 2(1)(a) of the NZ/UK DTA lists United Kingdom income tax (which includes United Kingdom PAYE) as a tax covered by the DTA. However, art 19 provides that only New Zealand has the right to tax pension income paid to a New Zealand resident. Therefore, withholding any amounts in the United Kingdom from pension payments is not in accordance with art 19 of the DTA. As a result, the Commissioner considers that any amounts withheld in the United Kingdom from pension payments paid to a New Zealand resident are not ―foreign income tax‖ under s LJ 3 for the purposes of the tax credit rules. As the amounts are not ―foreign income tax‖ under s LJ 3, no foreign tax credit can arise for such amounts under s LJ 2. Article 22 17. It might be thought that the NZ/UK DTA article dealing with foreign tax credits for the elimination of double taxation (art 22) would be relevant to this issue. However, the Commissioner does not consider that art 22 gives rise to any credit entitlements in circumstances where the NZ/UK DTA allocates sole taxing rights for certain types of income, such as in the present case. 18. Article 22 deals with the elimination of double taxation. The article sets out the agreement between New Zealand and the United Kingdom as to when New Zealand and the United Kingdom will give foreign tax credits. Article 22(2)(a) sets out the circumstances in which New Zealand agrees United Kingdom tax paid will be allowed as a credit against New Zealand tax payable on the same income. It provides: Subject to the provisions of the law of New Zealand from time to time in force relating to the allowance as a credit against New Zealand tax of tax paid in any country other than New Zealand (which shall not affect the general principle hereof), United Kingdom tax computed by reference to income from sources in the United Kingdom and paid under the law of the United Kingdom and in accordance with this Convention, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income derived by a resident of New Zealand from sources in the United Kingdom (excluding in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid), shall be allowed as a credit against the New Zealand tax computed by reference to the same income and payable in respect of that income. \[Emphasis added\] 19. In other words, art 22(2)(a) provides that:  A foreign tax credit is allowed against New Zealand tax for United Kingdom tax paid on the same income.  The allowance of the foreign tax credit is subject to New Zealand’s domestic laws (that is, as to the timing and the amount of the credit). New Zealand’s domestic law must be interpreted so as to uphold the general principle that a foreign tax credit should be available to eliminate double taxation. 4 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1155 UNTS 331 (opened for signature 23 May 1969, ratified by New Zealand on 4 August 1971).  Any foreign tax credit allowed under art 22 must be for United Kingdom tax that is paid not only under the law of the United Kingdom but also in accordance with the NZ/UK DTA. 20. As noted above, the articles in the NZ/UK DTA must be interpreted in their context and in light of the object and purpose of the NZ/UK DTA. Article 22(2)(a) expressly states that relief from double taxation only arises when United Kingdom tax is paid ―in accordance with this Convention‖ (which includes art 19). Under art 22, therefore, a foreign tax credit will only arise when the tax is paid in accordance with the other NZ/UK DTA articles. No tax is payable in the United Kingdom as New Zealand has the sole taxing rights (art 19). Therefore art 22 does not give rise to any credit entitlements. This is because under the NZ/UK DTA, as it applies to pensions, there is no double taxation to eliminate because New Zealand has been given the sole taxing rights for United Kingdom pensions paid to New Zealand residents. 21. More generally, in circumstances where New Zealand has agreed to share the taxing rights for a type of income (ie, where New Zealand does not have sole taxing rights to the income) under an article in the NZ/UK DTA then art 22 applies to provide relief from double taxation of New Zealand residents. Under art 22 New Zealand generally agrees to give a tax credit against New Zealand tax payable to the extent that the United Kingdom is entitled by an article in the NZ/UK DTA to tax that same income. If amounts are deducted in excess of what has been agreed under the NZ/UK DTA, New Zealand is not required to provide a tax credit for that excess. This is because any tax paid in the United Kingdom in excess of the level agreed in the NZ/UK DTA is not ―foreign income tax‖ for New Zealand tax credit purposes. Other arguments 22. The Commissioner is aware of possible counter-arguments that suggest a foreign tax credit might arise in these circumstances. However, the Commissioner considers that these arguments are not consistent with the overriding effect of the NZ/UK DTA under s BH 1(4), New Zealand’s domestic tax credit rules and international practice. 23. As noted above, the Commissioner acknowledges that an amount withheld from a pension payment by a United Kingdom pension provider may appear, on the face of it, to be ―foreign income tax‖. This is because there appears to be an obligation on the United Kingdom pension providers to withhold PAYE from the pensions of United Kingdom residents and the PAYE deducted is then paid to HM Revenue & Customs. However, as discussed above, the deductions are not ―foreign income tax‖ in New Zealand for the purposes of the New Zealand tax credit rules because the tax deducted is not tax imposed in accordance with the NZ/UK DTA, and the NZ/UK DTA has an overriding effect in relation to New Zealand’s domestic legislation. HM Revenue & Customs accepts that they have no right to tax United Kingdom pension income paid to New Zealand residents. To observe their agreement under art 19 of the NZ/UK DTA HM Revenue & Customs provides a domestic system for New Zealand residents to notify their United Kingdom pension providers that they are no longer United Kingdom residents and to claim repayments of PAYE deducted for periods before their change of residency notification has been processed. 24. Further, it has been suggested that the above approach results in the NZ/UK DTA removing a foreign tax credit that is available under domestic law. Such a result would appear to be inconsistent with the role of double tax agreements only to relieve double taxation and not to remove benefits provided to a taxpayer under domestic law. However, as the NZ/UK DTA has allocated the sole taxing right to New Zealand in these circumstances, the NZ/UK DTA has not denied a foreign tax credit available under domestic law. Instead, the NZ/UK DTA has determined that the income can only be taxable in New Zealand. The allocation of taxing rights is another way, different from the provision of tax credits, for double tax agreements to provide relief from double taxation. This is explained in the commentary to Arts 23A and 23B of the OECD model treaty ("Commentary on Articles 23 A and 23 B - Concerning the methods for elimination of double taxation ", in OECD, Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital 2010 (Full Version), OECD Publishing). 25. It has also been suggested that art 22 allows a foreign tax credit for any tax covered by art 2 of the DTA. However, the Commissioner considers that this argument does not take into account the fact that art 22 must be read in light of the other articles of the DTA — in this case art 19. Under art 19, pensions paid from the United Kingdom to New Zealand residents are only taxable in New Zealand. Consequently, art 22 does not give rise to any credit entitlements. 26. The Commissioner is aware of an argument that the existence of s LJ 7 suggests that a foreign tax credit is available. Section LJ 7 deals with the situation where a person has paid foreign income tax and is entitled to a tax credit but receives a refund. Essentially, it requires that the refund be taken into account in the calculation of the credit (if the credit has yet to be determined) or that the lesser of the refund amount and the foreign tax credit amount be paid to the Commissioner (if the credit has already been claimed). It has been suggested that this provision is available to taxpayers in the circumstances of this item ie, where an amount has been paid to a foreign tax authority on certain income where that authority does not have the taxing rights to that income. Further, it is suggested that the existence of s LJ 7 shows that a credit is available up to the time a refund is provided. 27. The Commissioner considers this argument is not consistent with the overriding effect of s BH 1(4). Section LJ 7 only applies to refunds of ―foreign income tax‖. As explained above, the amounts withheld from United Kingdom pension payments in the circumstances of this item do not satisfy that definition. In addition, the statutory history of s LJ 7 supports the conclusion that it was not intended to apply to such amounts. Further, New Zealand and the United Kingdom have entered into the NZ/UK DTA, which specifies the taxation rights in relation to pension payments between the two states. As a result, the context suggests that any foreign tax credit should be determined by the terms of the NZ/UK DTA. Section LJ 7 applies where the foreign tax authority has the taxing rights over the income but subsequent adjustments are made to the calculation of that foreign income tax resulting in a refund to the taxpayer. 28. Finally, the Commissioner is also aware of an argument that s LJ 1(5) operates to allow a foreign tax credit under s LJ 2 for an amount that is contrary to the NZ/UK DTA. Section LJ 1(5) deems s BH 1 (and other sections) to apply as far as applicable, and modified as necessary, for the purposes of s LJ 2, as if that section were a double tax agreement. The original purpose of the predecessor to s LJ 1(5), when the unilateral and bilateral credit rules were in distinct and separate parts of the predecessors of the ITA 2007, was to ensure that unilateral foreign tax credits were subject to the same rules as bilateral foreign tax credits. Following the consolidation of the provisions in the ITA 2007 unilateral and bilateral foreign tax credits are dealt with together and are subject to the same rules. This suggests that the original purpose for s LJ 1(5) no longer exists. However, even if s LJ 1(5) is able to be given an interpretation based on the plain meaning of its words, s LJ 1(5) itself would still need to be read together with the NZ/UK DTA. The Commissioner considers that allowing a foreign tax credit under subpart LJ would be inconsistent with s BH 1(4) and would undermine the taxing rights allocated under the NZ/UK DTA. Summary 29. In summary, a person is not entitled to a foreign tax credit for the amounts withheld in the United Kingdom from a United Kingdom pension because the amounts are not ―foreign income tax‖ under s LJ 3 for the purposes of the tax credit rules. The Commissioner considers that where a NZ/UK DTA applies the definition of ―foreign income tax‖ must be read together with the articles of the NZ/UK DTA. This means ―foreign income tax‖ is a tax that is covered by the NZ/UK DTA and paid in accordance with the articles of the NZ/UK DTA. The amounts withheld in the United Kingdom are not ―foreign income tax‖ because under art 19 of the NZ/UK DTA the United Kingdom has no right to tax pensions paid to New Zealand residents. New Zealand has not agreed under art 22 to allow a foreign tax credit for any United Kingdom tax deducted from the pensions.

Article 22 provides: Article 22 Elimination of double taxation (1) Subject to the provisions of the law of the United Kingdom regarding the allowance as a credit against United Kingdom tax of tax payable in a territory outside the United Kingdom (which shall not affect the general principle hereof): (a) New Zealand tax payable under the law of New Zealand and in accordance with this Convention whether directly or by deduction, on profits, income or chargeable gains from sources within New Zealand (excluding, in the case of a dividend, tax payable in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against any United Kingdom tax computed by reference to the same profits, income or chargeable gains by reference to which the New Zealand tax is computed. (b) In the case of a dividend paid by a company which is a resident of New Zealand to a company which is a resident of the United Kingdom and which controls directly or indirectly at least 10 percent of the voting power in the company paying the dividend, the credit shall take into account (in addition to any New Zealand tax for which credit may be allowed under the provisions of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph) the New Zealand tax payable by the company in respect of the profits out of which such dividend is paid. (2) (a) Subject to the provisions of the law of New Zealand from time to time in force relating to the allowance as a credit against New Zealand tax of tax paid in any country other than New Zealand (which shall not affect the general principle hereof), United Kingdom tax computed by reference to income from sources in the United Kingdom and paid under the law of the United Kingdom and in accordance with this Convention, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income derived by a resident of New Zealand from sources in the United Kingdom (excluding in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid), shall be allowed as a credit against the New Zealand tax computed by reference to the same income and payable in respect of that income. (b) In the event that the Government of New Zealand should impose tax on dividends received by companies which are resident in New Zealand the Contracting States will enter into negotiations in order to establish new provisions concerning the taxation of such dividends derived from sources in the United Kingdom.

(4) Where, under the provisions of Article 10, profits on which an enterprise of a Contracting State has been charged to tax in that State are also included in the profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to that enterprise of the other State if the conditions made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations had been those which would have been made or imposed between independent enterprises, the amount included in the profits of both enterprises shall be treated for the purpose of this Article as income from a source in the other State of the enterprise of the first-mentioned State and relief shall be given accordingly under the provisions of paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) of this Article. (5) Nothing in this Article shall entitle a person who is a resident of a Contracting State to credit against tax of that Contracting State of tax of the other Contracting State if the terms of the transactions giving rise to the profits on which the tax of the other State is payable are not such as might be expected in a bona fide commercial transaction and if they have as their main object, or one of their main objects, the obtaining of that credit.
1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 14/13 GOODS AND SERVICES TAX – LOTTERIES, RAFFLES, SWEEPSTAKES AND PRIZE COMPETITIONS All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GSTA) unless otherwise stated. This Question We‘ve Been Asked (QWBA) is about ss 2(1) ―prize competition‖, 3A, 5(10), 5(11), 9(2)(e), 10(14), 10(15), 20(3), 20(3C) and 20(3K). Question 1. What are the GST implications of conducting a lottery, raffle, sweepstake or prize competition? Answer 2. A person who is GST registered (or is liable to be GST registered) needs to account for GST on a ny lottery, raffle, sweepstake or prize competition they conduct. GST must be calculated on the amount paid by the participants in the lottery, raffle, sweepstake or prize competition, less the amount of all prizes paid or payable in money. 3. An unincorporated body of persons or an association of people formed for non- commercial purposes can be the conductor of a lottery, raffle, sweepstake or prize competition. This could include an unincorporated body or association conducting a lottery, raffle, sweepstake or prize competition on behalf of a school, kindergarten or other community group. For lotteries, raffles and sweepstakes, GST needs to be accounted for in the GST period that the first drawing or determination of the result of the lottery, raffle or sweepstake commences. (Although unlikely to apply in many cases, there is an exception to this special rule where the lottery, raffle or sweepstake is an instant game played by means of a gaming machine. In this limited situation GST is accounted for under the normal GST time of supply rules.) For prize competitions, GST needs to be accounted for in the GST period that the first drawing or determination of the prize competition commences. 4. Claiming input tax reduces the total amount of GST payable. Input tax can be claimed for any GST component of the cost of goods or services that are purchased and used for the making of a taxable supply of gambling or prize competition services. Conducting a lottery, raffle, sweepstake or prize competition is a taxable supply of gambling or prize competition services. If the goods or services are only partly used for making taxable supplies, then an apportionment may be necessary. A special input tax rule applies to non-profit bodies and ensures that a non-profit body can claim input tax on all acquired goods and services that relate to non- exempt supplies. ̳Non-profit body‘ is defined in s 2 and a charity will often be a non- profit body for GST purposes. 5. This item covers similar content to BR Pub 07/11 ―GST—Lottery operators and promoters‖ Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 1 (February 2008): 6, which expired on 21 December 2012. This item replaces ―Cash prizes in sporting competitions - GST implications for organising club‖ Tax Information Bulletin Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001): 52. 2 Explanation Background 6. The subject matter covered in this QWBA was previously covered in BR Pub 07/11 ―GST - Lottery operators and promoters‖, which expired on 21 December 2012, and the QWBA ―Cash prizes in sporting competitions – GST implications for organising club‖, issued May 2001. Legislative changes relating to prize competitions have resulted in the 2001 QWBA no longer being correct. These legislative changes apply from 17 July 2013. Under the new legislative provisions, cash prize amounts are now allowed to be deducted when calculating the consideration for the supply of prize competition services. Consequently, the amount of GST payable is reduced. 7. This item does not apply to racing betting or sports betting that are covered under specific GST rules in ss 5(8) and 10(12). What is the nature of the supply? 8. If a person conducts a lottery, raffle, sweepstake or prize competition, they are making a supply of services, which may have GST implications. 9. Under s 5(10), a supply of gambling or prize competition services occurs where a person pays money to participate. Section 5(10) states that: 5 Meaning of term supply ... (10) For the purposes of this Act, an amount of money paid by a person to participate in gambling (including a New Zealand lottery) or in a prize competition is treated as a payment for a supply of services by the following: (a) for gambling, by the person, society, licensed promoter, or organiser who under the Gambling Act 2003 conducts the gambling: (b) for a prize competition, by the person who conducts the prize competition. 10. Note that s 14(1)(b) exempts a supply of donated goods and services by a non-profit body from GST. It states: 14 Exempt supplies (1) The following supplies of goods and services shall be exempt from tax: ... (b) the supply by any non-profit body of any donated goods and services: 11. However, as mentioned above, conducting a lottery, raffle or sweepstake is a supply of gambling services and conducting a prize competition is a supply of prize competition services. It is the gambling or prize competition services that the participants are paying for, not the ultimate prizes. Therefore, even where donated goods or services are given as prizes in a lottery, raffle, sweepstake or prize competition conducted by a non-profit body, the nature of the relevant supply is still the supply of gambling or prize competition services under s 5(10). 12. Section 5(11) provides the following definitions for the purposes of s 5(10): (11) For the purposes of subsection (10)— (a) the terms gambling, New Zealand lottery, licensed promoter, and society have the meanings set out in section 4(1) of the Gambling Act 2003: (b) the term organiser means the New Zealand Lotteries Commission continued by section 236 of the Gambling Act 2003. 13. Section 2(1) provides the following definition of ―prize competition‖ for the GSTA: prize competition means a scheme or competition— 3 (a) for which direct or indirect consideration is paid to a person for conducting the scheme or competition; and (b) that distributes prizes of money or in which participants seek to win money; and (c) for which the result is determined— (i) by the performance of the participant of an activity of a kind that may be performed more readily by a participant possessing or exercising some knowledge or skill; or (ii) partly by chance and partly by the performance of an activity as described in subparagraph (i), whether or not it may also be performed successfully by chance: 14. As a result, a supply of gambling or prize competition services occurs if a person pays an amount in money:  to participate in ―gambling‖, as defined in s 4(1) of the Gambling Act 2003 (including a ―New Zealand lottery‖ run by the New Zealand Lotteries Commission), or  to participate in a ―prize competition‖, as defined in s 2(1). What is “gambling” under the Gambling Act 2003? 15. ―Gambling‖ is defined in s 4(1) of the Gambling Act 2003 as follows: 4 Interpretation (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,— ... gambling— (a) means paying or staking consideration, directly or indirectly, on the outcome of something seeking to win money when the outcome depends wholly or partly on chance; and (b) includes a sales promotion scheme; and (c) includes bookmaking; and (d) includes betting, paying, or staking consideration on the outcome of a sporting event; but (e) does not include an act, behaviour, or transaction that is declared not to be gambling by regulations made under section 368. No regulations under s 368 of the Gambling Act 2003 are relevant to this QWBA. 16. The above definition shows that in order for something to be ―gambling‖ in terms of s 4(1) of the Gambling Act 2003, there is a requirement of seeking to win money. For the Gambling Act, ―money‖ is defined as including ―money‘s worth, whether or not convertible into money‖. Therefore money‘s worth, in this context, is anything that is of some value, even if it cannot be converted into money. This means that things like vouchers for goods or services and other non-cash prizes (including any donated prizes) are treated as ―money‖ under the Gambling Act. It also means that lotteries and raffles that offer non-cash prizes are within the definition of ―gambling‖. Is participating in a “lottery”, “raffle” or “sweepstake” within the definition of “gambling”? 17. The definition of ―gambling‖ in s 4(1) of the Gambling Act 2003 does not expressly include a lottery, raffle or sweepstake. However, the Commissioner considers that lotteries, raffles and sweepstakes fall within the definition of ―gambling‖ and are therefore subject to s 5(10)(a) of the GSTA. 18. Section 4(1) of the Gambling Act 2003 defines the term ―lottery‖ as specifically including raffles and sweepstakes, stating that: 4 4 Interpretation (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,— ... lottery— (a) means a scheme or device involving multiple participants for which— (i) a person pays consideration to participate, directly or indirectly; and (ii) prizes of money are distributed according to a draw that takes place after all participants have entered; and (b) includes lotto, raffles, and sweepstakes 19. The terms ―raffle‖ and ―sweepstake‖ are not defined in the Gambling Act 2003. The ordinary meanings of ―raffle‖ and ―sweepstake‖ in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12 th edition, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011) are (relevantly): raffle 1 n. a lottery with goods as prizes. ... sweepstake (also sweepstakes)  n. a form of gambling, especially on sporting events, in which all the stakes are divided among the winners. 20. Lotteries, raffles and sweepstakes all involve paying or staking consideration on the outcome of something seeking to win money (including money‘s worth) when the outcome depends wholly or partly on chance. This means that lotteries, raffles and sweepstakes fall within the definition of ―gambling‖ in s 4(1)(a) of the Gambling Act 2003. Given that sweepstakes are also particularly associated with staking consideration on the outcome of sporting events, sweepstakes may also fall within para (d) of the definition of ―gambling‖ in s 4(1) of the Gambling Act 2003. 21. As a result, a supply will be deemed to occur under s 5(10)(a) of the GSTA if a person pays money to participate in a lottery, raffle or sweepstake. If the supplier of such gambling services is a GST registered person (which includes a person who is liable to be GST registered), they will need to account for GST for the supply of those services. What is a prize competition? 22. With application from 17 July 2013, s 10 of the GSTA was amended so that a person conducting a prize competition is able to deduct cash prizes from the total proceeds received for a prize competition when determining the consideration made for that supply. Before this amendment, cash prizes could only be deducted in relation to gambling and not prize competitions. 23. Consequently, ss 5 and 9 of the GSTA were amended to include references to prize competitions and a definition of ―prize competition‖ for the GSTA was also included in s 2(1) (see \[13\] above). 24. For GST purposes, ―prize competition‖ includes competitions where the participant pays to enter and is competing for a cash prize and where the result is determined either solely by the performance of participants of a particular kind of activity or partly by chance and partly by the performance of participants of a particular kind of activity. This means that participants may possess or exercise some knowledge or skill that relates to the activity, for example amateur sporting competitions. The Gambling Act 2003 also contains a narrower definition of ―prize competition‖ in s 4(1) of the Gambling Act 2003. However, this definition is not relevant for determining the GST consequences of running a prize competition. 25. A supply is deemed to occur under s 5(10)(b) of the GSTA if a person pays money to participate in a prize competition. If the supplier of such services is a GST registered 5 person (which includes a person who is liable to be GST registered), they will need to account for GST on that supply. Who is the supplier? 26. It is necessary to determine who is making the supply of gambling or prize competition services. Whether there are GST obligations will depend on whether the supplier is GST registered (or required to be). For information about who is required to register for GST see currently: http://www.ird.govt.nz/gst/gst- registering/register-who/. Generally, you must register for GST if your turnover (sales from taxable activities) was over $60,000 for the last 12 months or is expected to go over $60,000 for the next 12 months. 27. Section 5(10)(a) states that the supplier of gambling services is ―the person, society, licensed promoter, or organiser who under the Gambling Act 2003 conducts the gambling‖. Section 5(10)(b) states that the supplier of prize competition services is ―the person who conducts the prize competition‖. 28. ―Person‖ is defined in s 2(1) of the GSTA as including ―a company, an unincorporated body of persons, a public authority, and a local authority‖. Section 5(11) states that ―society‖ has the meaning set out in s 4(1) of the Gambling Act 2003, which is ―an association of persons established and conducted entirely for purposes other than commercial purposes‖. 29. Therefore, community organisations, schools, kindergartens, etc, which may operate as unincorporated bodies or non-profit associations, can be suppliers of gambling or prize competition services for GST purposes. In the case of state schools, often it will be the Board of Trustees or, if one exists, the Parent Teacher Association (being a separate entity from the Board of Trustees) that is running the raffle, lottery, sweepstake or prize competition, so they are the supplier of the gambling or prize competition services for GST purposes. If such an organisation is a GST registered person (which includes a person who is liable to be registered), they need to account for GST on any lotteries, raffles, sweepstakes or prize competitions they conduct. 30. There may be other people involved in the running of a lottery, raffle or sweepstake who are ―conducting gambling‖ under the broad definition of that term in the Gambling Act 2003 (eg, anyone selling tickets, distributing prizes or otherwise involved in organising, supervising or running the lottery, raffle or sweepstake). However, for GST purposes the supplier is the person or organisation conducting the gambling that people are paying to participate in. This is the person or organisation ultimately running the lottery, raffle or sweepstake (ie, the person or organisation on whose behalf the tickets are being sold). What is the time of supply? 31. The time of supply of the gambling or prize competition services must be established because this determines when GST needs to be accounted for. 32. Section 9(2)(e) deems the time of supply for gambling services (lotteries, raffles or sweepstakes) generally to be the date on which the first drawing or determination of the result commences and the time of supply for prize competition services to be the date on which the first drawing or determination of the prize competition commences. Section 9(2)(e) states that: 9 Time of supply ... (2) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1) of this section, a supply of goods and services shall be deemed to take place— ... (e) if the supply is made under section 5(10),— 6 (i) for an amount of money paid by a person to participate in gambling (including a New Zealand lottery), on the date on which the first drawing or determination of a result commences, but this subparagraph does not apply to an instant game that is a New Zealand lottery or gambling played by means of a gaming machine as defined in section 4(1) of the Gambling Act 2003: (ii) for an amount of money paid by a person to participate in a prize competition on the date on which the first drawing or determination of the prize competition commences: 33. Although unlikely to occur very often in the context of lotteries, raffles or sweepstakes, there is an exception to the special time of supply rule above. The exception is where the lottery, raffle or sweepstake is an instant game played by means of a gaming machine. In this limited situation GST is accounted for under the normal GST time of supply rules. The terms ―gaming machine‖ and ―instant game‖ are defined in s 4(1) of the Gambling Act 2003. Generally a gaming machine is any machine or device that is adapted or designed, and constructed for use in gambling. An example of a gaming machine is a pokie machine. An instant game means gambling when a winning ticket or the money or other reward that the winning ticket bears is determined before, or simultaneously with, the sale of tickets, randomly or wholly by chance. Examples of an instant game are a scratch and win game or mystery envelopes. What is the consideration for the supply? 34. GST needs to be returned on the amount of consideration for a supply. The GSTA specifies what the amount of consideration for a supply of gambling or prize competition services will be. 35. Under ss 10(14)(a) and (b), the consideration for the supply of gambling or prize competition services is the total of all amounts received from the participants in the gambling or prize competition, less any prizes paid and payable in money. Section 10(14) states as follows: 10 Value of supply of goods and services (1) For the purposes of this Act the following provisions of this section shall apply for determining the value of any supply of goods and services. ... (14) If a supply of services is treated as having been made under section 5(10), the consideration for the supply is calculated using the formula— amounts received - prizes where— (a) amounts received is the total of all amounts in money received in relation to the supply— (i) for gambling, by the person, society, licensed promoter, or organiser who under the Gambling Act 2003 conducts the gambling: (ii) for a prize competition, by the person who conducts the prize competition: (b) prizes is the total amount of all prizes paid and payable in money in relation to the supply. 36. If the prizes in a lottery, raffle, sweepstake or prize competition are non-cash prizes, then the consideration for the supply is simply the amounts received from the participants to participate in the lottery, raffle, sweepstake or prize competition. In other words, the consideration for the supply is only reduced for cash prizes. What input tax can a supplier claim? 37. Input tax deductions reduce the total amount of GST payable. Input tax can be claimed for any GST component of the cost of goods or services that are acquired and used for the making of a taxable supply: ss 3A and 20(3). As seen, conducting a 7 lottery, raffle, sweepstake or prize competition is a taxable supply of gambling or prize competition services. 38. If non-cash prizes in a lottery, raffle, sweepstake or prize competition are purchased by the supplier, then an input tax deduction may be available for any GST component of the cost of those prizes. However, if non-cash prizes in a lottery, raffle, sweepstake or prize competition are donated goods or services, then no input tax deduction is available to the supplier as no GST component was paid for the prize. 39. If the goods or services acquired are only partly used for making taxable supplies, then an apportionment may be necessary: s 20(3C). 40. A special input tax rule applies to non-profit bodies allowing a non-profit body to claim input tax on goods or services acquired that are used for other than making taxable supplies (see s 20(3K)). This rule does not apply to the extent that the goods or services are used for making exempt supplies. What are the practical implications for a person running a raffle, lottery, sweepstake or prize competition? 41. Running a raffle, lottery, sweepstake or prize competition has a number of GST implications. There may be a requirement to register for GST if the value of supplies (including the gambling or prize competition supplies) made by the person running the raffle, lottery, sweepstake or prize competition exceeds the GST registration threshold (currently $60,000): see s 51. 42. Where the organisation running the raffle, lottery, sweepstake or prize competition is GST registered GST will need to be paid on the value of the total amount of tickets sold or fees paid, less any cash prizes paid or payable. This may mean that an organisation‘s accounting system requires a separate account for lottery and raffle proceeds, to ensure that these funds are treated as being subject to GST, as opposed to other fundraising funds which may be treated as GST-exempt. As discussed above, input tax credits may be claimed on costs associated with running a raffle, lottery, sweepstake or prize competition. 43. There may potentially be tax invoicing requirements (see s 24). However, if the consideration for the supply does not exceed $50, a tax invoice is not required to be provided (s 24(5)). 44. This QWBA does not address the requirements under the Gambling Act 2003 that need to be satisfied. For information on the relevant rules for running a gambling activity, and whether a licence is needed, refer to: http://www.dia.govt.nz/gambling . Examples 45. The following examples explain the application of the GST provisions. Example 1 – Fundraising raffle 46. The Sunnytown pre-school is a community-based, not-for-profit organisation and is GST registered. 47. As part of its annual fundraising the pre-school runs a raffle, selling tickets for $2 each. The raffle prizes include a family ferry voucher (donated by a ferry company), $100 cash, a massage voucher (donated by the local day-spa) and a basket of grocery items (purchased by the pre-school). The raffle is drawn at the end of term 4. 48. The raffle is a ―lottery‖ and, therefore, ―gambling‖ for the purposes of the GSTA. The pre-school, in conducting the raffle, is a supplier of gambling services for GST 8 purposes. As the pre-school is GST registered, it must account for GST on this fundraiser. 49. The time of supply is the date at the end of term 4 on which the raffle is drawn. GST on the raffle must be accounted for in the GST return for the GST period in which that date falls. 50. The consideration for the raffle is the total amount received from ticket sales, minus the $100 paid as a cash prize. Input tax can be claimed for the basket of grocery items purchased by the pre-school. No input tax can be claimed for the donated prizes (ie, the ferry voucher and the massage voucher). Example 2 - Sweepstake 51. The Canterville Working Men‘s Club is GST registered. Every year it runs a sweepstake for the Melbourne Cup. Participants pay to enter the sweepstake and are randomly allocated a horse. The total amount paid by participants is divided among the participants who were allocated the horses that placed 1 st , 2 nd and 3 rd . 52. The sweepstake is a ―lottery‖ and, therefore, ―gambling‖ for the purposes of the GSTA. The Canterville Working Men‘s Club, in conducting the sweepstake, is a supplier of gambling services for GST purposes. As the club is GST registered, it must account for GST on the sweepstake. 53. The time of supply is the date of the Melbourne Cup, as the determination of the result commences on that day. GST on the sweepstake must be accounted for in the GST period in which that date falls. 54. The consideration for the supply is the total amount received from participants, less the total amount paid out in prizes in money. As all of the money paid by participants is paid out in prizes, there is no consideration for the supply of gambling services by the Canterville Working Men‘s Club for the sweepstake. This means that the club is not required to account for any GST on the sweepstake. Example 3 – Skill only prize competition 55. The Somes Bowling Club is a GST registered amateur sports club. People pay a membership fee to be members of the club and use the facilities. The club organises a Christmas Gala bowls competition on 14 December 2013. Members pay $10 and non-members $20 to compete. The winners in the different categories are awarded cash prizes totalling $150 on the day of the competition. 56. The Christmas Gala bowls competition is a prize competition. People pay consideration to participate. The Somes Bowling Club, in conducting the competition, is a supplier of prize competition services for GST purposes. As the club is GST registered, it must account for GST on the competition. 57. The time of supply is 14 December 2013, the date on which the prize competition is determined. GST on the prize competition must be accounted for in the GST period in which that date falls. 58. The prize competition was conducted after 17 July 2013 – being the date when the new legislative provisions relating to prize competitions took effect. As such, the club is allowed to deduct the $150 of cash prizes from the total fees received for the competition when calculating the consideration for the prize competition. 9 References Related rulings/statements BR Pub 07/11 ―GST—lottery operators and promoters‖, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 1 (February 2008): 6 ―Cash prizes in sporting competitions – GST implications for organising club‖, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001): 52 Subject references GST, lottery, raffle, sweepstake, prize competitions Legislative references Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 – ss 2(1), 3A, 5(10), 5(11), 9(2)(e), 10(14), 10(15), 20(3), 20(3C) and 20(3K) Gambling Act 2003 – s 4(1) Other references Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12 th edition, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011)
1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 14/14 GOODS AND SERVICES TAX – LATE RETURN CHARGES (INCLUDING LIBRARY FINES AND PARKING OVERSTAY CHARGES) All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) is about ss 2, 8 and 10. During a review of the Public Information Bulletin and Tax Information Bulletin series published before 1996, the answer to Question 8 (in a series of GST questions and answers) in Public Information Bulletin No 148 (May 1986): 3 was identified as an item that should be updated. The review has now been completed, see “Update on Public Information Bulletin review” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25, No 10 (November 2013): 37. This QWBA updates and replaces the part of the Public Information Bulletin item that concerns library fines and vehicle parking fines (also known as parking overstay charges). For ease of reference, this QWBA refers to these fines collectively as “late return charges”. The analysis in this item also applies more broadly to all charges imposed for the late return of a borrowed item (ie, not just to library fines and vehicle parking fines). Question 1. Is a late return charge subject to GST? Answer 2. A late return charge will be subject to GST if it is consideration for a taxable supply. Whether the charge is consideration for a taxable supply will depend on whether a sufficient nexus or reciprocity exists between the charge and the supply. This will be determined from the legal arrangements entered into. 3. In most cases, a late return charge will be subject to GST. This is because the legal arrangements between the parties will characterise the charge as additional consideration for the supply of the borrowed item. 4. However, in some cases, the legal arrangements between the parties may characterise the late return charge as a payment of damages or a penalty for a breach of the legal arrangements. In these cases, the charge will not be subject to GST because it will not be consideration for a taxable supply. Explanation Background 5. Public Information Bulletin No 148 (May 1986): 3 contained a series of questions and answers on GST. Question 8 asked, “Are vehicle parking fines and library fines etc. subject to GST?”. The answer was: Yes – they are consideration for the provision of goods and services. However, Court fines are not subject to GST because they are not paid as consideration for the supply of goods and services. Rather they are penalties imposed by Statute as punishment for criminal activities. 6. Late return charges are charges imposed for the late return of a borrowed item such as a library book or a DVD. These charges are sometimes referred to as “overdue fines”. Car-park operators impose similar charges on drivers who 2 overstay in a parking space. These charges all share similar features. For ease of reference, we refer to them collectively as “late return charges”. 7. Late return charges are different from late payment charges. Late payment charges are amounts businesses charge for the late payment of an account. Under s 5(25) and (26), a late payment charge will be subject to GST if the underlying supply to which that payment relates is subject to GST. GST treatment of late return charges 8. The Commissioner considers the law in this area to be well settled. The late return charge is either consideration for a supply or not. The Commissioner has set out the principles to be applied in “GST Treatment of Court Awards and Out of Court Settlements” Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 14, No 10 (October 2002): 21 and “GST – Hire Firm Security Bonds” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 7 (August 2014): 131. This QWBA simply applies these principles to different fact scenarios. Taxable supply 9. Section 8(1) imposes GST on the supply of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person. GST is charged on the value of that supply. The value of a supply is the “consideration” paid for the supply (ss 2(1) “consideration” and 10). 10. Therefore, the first step is to identify a supply, if any, for which the late return charge could be consideration. The next step is to determine whether the late return charge is consideration for that supply (see CIR v Databank Systems Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,093 (CA)). 11. When analysing transactions for GST purposes, the focus is on the legal rights and obligations created by the parties. The economic substance of the transaction is not relevant, and the nomenclature used is not decisive. The important question is whether a sufficient nexus or reciprocity exists between the supply of the goods or services and the consideration (see CIR v NZ Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 (CA), Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR \[1999\] 2 NZLR 388 (CA); Gulf Harbour Developments Ltd (2004) 21 NZTC 18,915 (CA); Rotorua Regional Airport v CIR (2010) 24 NZTC 23,979). Characterisation of late return charges 12. To determine the correct GST treatment of a late return charge it is necessary to examine the legal arrangements entered into between the parties. The late return charge can be characterised in at least two ways: as consideration for a taxable supply or as a payment for a breach of contract. Consideration for a taxable supply 13. In most cases, a charge imposed under a contract for the late return of a borrowed item will be characterised as consideration for the supply of the borrowed item. A sufficient nexus will exist between the supply of the borrowed item and the charge imposed for its late return. 14. This was the decision reached by the United Kingdom VAT Tribunal in Leigh t/a Moor Lane Video (1990) 5 BVC 757 and by the Tax Court of Canada in Acme Video Inc v R \[1995\] GSTC 49. In both cases, the issue was whether a late return charge imposed for the late return of video films was subject to value- added tax (VAT) or GST. In Leigh, the contract described the charge as “compensation not exceeding £2.50 for each day or part of a day after it was due”. The fine was the same amount as the nightly hire rate. In Acme, the contract provided that “the hirer agrees to pay all additional rental or surcharges” 3 that may be due as a result \[of the late return\]”. In both cases, the courts held that the late return charges were liable to VAT/GST as consideration for the supply of the borrowed item. 15. In some cases, the initial supply of the item will be for no consideration (a library book, for example). In the Commissioner’s opinion, this will not affect the GST treatment of the late return charge. Payment for a breach of contract 16. A charge imposed under a contract for breaching the terms of that contract will not be subject to GST. This is because the charge is imposed for the breach rather than as consideration for a supply. In this situation, the charge will not have a sufficient nexus or reciprocity with the supply (see NZ Refining Co Ltd, and Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust). 17. Depending on the terms of the contract, a charge for a breach of contract could be described as liquidated damages (an amount agreed to be paid for a breach of contract) or as a penalty (a punishment for a breach of contract). While the distinction between liquidated damages and penalties is important for contract law purposes, it is not significant for GST purposes; neither payment will be subject to GST. Examples 18. The following examples help to explain how the law applies to particular situations. 19. The GST consequences of each example are a result of the particular facts. Any additions or variations to the facts may give rise to different GST consequences. Example 1 – consideration for a supply 20. Oscar joins the Central Library. He signs a membership agreement and agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions outlined in the agreement. Oscar takes out a book on quantum physics. The library terms and conditions state that this book can be borrowed for 28 days without charge. After that time, fines will be charged for each day that the book remains overdue. Regarding “overdue fines”, the membership agreement notes: Membership agreement – terms and conditions All Central Library members agree to be bound by the library fees and charges. Fines accrue each day the book/item is overdue. Details of overdue fines are posted on the Central Library website and must be paid when the item is returned. 21. The Central Library website contains a list of overdue fines. An overdue fine of 60c per day, per item is imposed for all books once the 28-day borrowing period has expired. Oscar returns the book 10 days late and has to pay a $6 fine. The fine is subject to GST because it is consideration for the supply of the book. The fact that it is called a fine does not affect its character as consideration for the supply. It is also not determinative that the initial supply of the library book was a supply for no consideration. Example 2 – further consideration for a supply 22. Louis joins a DVD library. He signs a membership agreement and agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of hire. Regarding the late return of DVDs, the agreement states: 4 The member agrees: a. To return the film by the agreed date. If the film is not returned by the agreed date, the member shall be required to pay an additional hire charge of $7 per day until the film is returned, capped at $35. 23. Louis hires a new release DVD. The hire period for new releases is one night. Louis returns the DVD three days late. The DVD library makes Louis pay the additional hire charge of $21. The additional hire charge is subject to GST because it is consideration for the supply of the DVD. Example 3 – further consideration for a supply 24. Tim parks his car in Cinema car park. Cinema car park is a “pay and display” car park. Tim purchases a ticket from one of the machines, guessing that he will need to pay for four hours. The hourly rate is $3, so Tim pays $12 for four hours. Tim is attending a screening of a new movie and hopes to catch up with friends afterwards. The terms and conditions of parking are printed on various signs around the car park. They state: Cinema car park is, by this sign, offering space for public parking. You accept this offer by parking here. All requirements of notice and acceptance are hereby waived by Cinema car park. If you park, but do not display a valid unexpired ticket, you will be charged a further $50 per day for parking. If you park here Cinema car park considers you to have accepted its offer of a parking space. Do not park here if you do not agree to these terms. 25. Tim is two hours late returning to his car. By this time, Cinema car park has issued him with a $50 charge for failing to display a valid unexpired ticket. The charge is subject to GST. The terms of the agreement are clear; the onus is on Tim to purchase a ticket for the time actually needed. By failing to purchase a ticket for the time actually needed, he is contractually bound to pay the additional charge of $50 for parking his car. The payment is further consideration for the taxable supply of the car park space. Example 4 – payment for a breach of contract 26. Alisha parks her car in the Centre car park. The car park is operated as a “pay and display” car park. Alisha purchases a ticket from one of the machines. She estimates it will take her two hours to complete her shopping. The hourly rate is $5, so Alisha pays $10 for two hours. The terms and conditions of parking are printed on the back of the ticket. They note: If your vehicle does not clearly display a valid unexpired prepaid ticket then you will be parking without our consent and in breach of the terms and conditions of this agreement. As a consequence of this breach we may issue you with a parking violation notice requiring you to pay a fine of $100. You will have 28 days to pay this fine. We may also have your car towed at your own risk and expense. 27. Unfortunately for Alisha she underestimates the time it takes to complete her shopping. She returns to the car park half an hour late and discovers Centre has issued her with a parking violation notice requiring her to pay a fine of $100. 28. The charge is not subject to GST because it is a payment for breaching the contract and not consideration for the taxable supply of the parking space. No nexus or reciprocity exists between the charge and the supply of the parking space. This conclusion is supported by the fact the charge imposed bears no relationship to the actual amount that would have been payable for the extra half-hour hire of the parking space. The charge is the same whether Alisha is half an hour late, 3 hours late or 10 hours late. The charge has the characteristics of a penalty. 5 References Related rulings/statements “GST – Hire Firm Security Bonds” Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 26, No 7 (August 2014): 131 “GST Treatment of Court Awards and Out of Court Settlements” Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 14, No 10 (October 2002): 21 Subject references Consideration Fine GST Late return charge Library Parking overstay charge Penalty Taxable supply Legislative references Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, ss 2, 8 and 10 Case references Acme Video Inc v R \[1995\] GSTC 49 (TCC) Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR \[1999\] 2 NZLR 388 (CA) CIR v Databank Systems Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,093 (CA) CIR v NZ Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 (CA) Gulf Harbour Developments Ltd (2004) 21 NZTC 18,915 (CA) Leigh t/a Moor Lane Video (1990) 5 BVC 757 (UK VAT Tribunal) Rotorua Regional Airport v CIR (2010) 24 NZTC 23,979
QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 15/01 Income tax: tax avoidance and debt capitalisation All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about s BG 1. Introduction 1. At a tax conference held in November 2013 there was a discussion of whether s BG 1 would apply to certain scenarios. This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) considers one of those scenarios concerning debt capitalisation. Three other scenarios were the subject of an earlier QWBA: QB 14/11 Income Tax – scenarios on tax avoidance, published in October 2014. 2. In the scenario, the arrangement and the conclusion reached are framed broadly. The objective is to consider the application of the general anti-avoidance provision of s BG 1. Accordingly, the analysis of the scenario proceeds on the basis that the tax effects under the specific provisions of the Act are achieved as stated. Also, the specific anti-avoidance provision of s GB 21 is not considered. However, it should not be presumed that this would always be the case. Also, except where shown below, additional relevant facts or variations to the stated facts might materially affect how the arrangement operates and a different outcome under s BG 1 might arise. Accordingly, the Commissioner’s view as to whether s BG 1 applies must be understood in these terms. 3. Section BG 1 is only considered after determining whether other provisions of the Act apply or do not apply. Where it applies, s BG 1 voids a tax avoidance arrangement. Voiding an arrangement may or may not appropriately counteract the tax advantages arising under the arrangement. If not, the Commissioner is required to apply s GA 1 to ensure this outcome is achieved. 4. For a more comprehensive outline of the Commissioner’s position on the law concerning tax avoidance in New Zealand, reference should be made to the Commissioner’s Interpretation Statement: IS 13/01 Tax avoidance and the interpretation of sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (July 2013). Question 5. Whether s BG 1 applies in the following circumstances:  A New Zealand resident individual is the sole shareholder of Company D.  Company D is a qualifying company in the following financial position: Company D Shareholder (natural person) Shares $100 (100%) Loan $700 2 Cash 200 Total Assets $200 Shareholder loan 700\* Share capital 100 Accumulated deficit (600) Total Equity and Liabilities $200 \* The shareholder loan is a “financial arrangement” for the purposes of the financial arrangements rules (FA rules) of subpart EW of the Act and is not part of a wider financial arrangement. 6. Under an arrangement the shareholder and Company D agree that:  Company D will issue additional shares;  the shareholder will subscribe $500 for the shares;  the shareholder’s indebtedness to Company D for the share subscription of $500 will be offset against the shareholder loan; and  the company will repay the $200 balance of the loan in cash. Answer 7. The Commissioner’s view is that s BG 1 would potentially apply to this arrangement. Explanation 8. The apparent objective of this arrangement is to eliminate the loan owed by Company D to its shareholder in circumstances where Company D issues further shares to that shareholder. Tax effects 9. The tax effect of the loan ending is that s EW 29(3) requires Company D and the shareholder to each perform a base price adjustment (BPA) under s EW 31 in the income year the loan is eliminated. 10. The BPA is calculated using the formula in s EW 31(5): consideration — income + expenditure + amount remitted 11. In this scenario, it can be assumed that the income and expenditure items in the BPA formula are zero. The amount remitted item will also be zero for Company D as it is the borrower and unable to remit the debt. The relevant item in the BPA formula for present purposes is “consideration”. 12. “Consideration” is relevantly defined as— ... all consideration that has been paid, and all consideration that is or will be payable to the person for or under the financial arrangement, minus all consideration that has been paid, and all consideration that is or will be payable, by the person for or under the financial arrangement. 13. The consideration paid to Company D is the original amount of the loan of $700. The consideration paid by Company D is the sum of the $200 paid in cash and the $500 offset against the loan balance. Therefore, Company D’s BPA calculation is: 3 ($700 – ($200 + $500)) – $0 + $0 + $0 = $0. 14. The tax effect of the arrangement for Company D is that no income or deduction will arise under the BPA as the calculation returns neither a positive nor a negative figure. 15. Similarly, the tax effect for the shareholder is that there is no income or deduction arising under the BPA as the shareholder’s BPA calculation is: (($200 + $500) – $700) – $0 + $0 + $0 = $0. Parliament’s purposes 16. Parliament’s purposes for the FA rules is to require income and expenditure under financial arrangements to be recognised by the parties on an accrued basis over the term of the arrangement and to require them to disregard any distinction between capital and revenue amounts. The FA rules provide the tax outcomes for each of the parties to a financial arrangement. In this scenario, this will be the shareholder and Company D. 17. The Court of Appeal in Alesco New Zealand Ltd v CIR \[2013\] NZCA 40 also noted that the financial arrangements rules recognise the economic effect of a transaction. The court stated as follows: \[71\] In our judgment, the financial arrangements rules were intended to give effect to the reality of income and expenditure – that is, real economic benefits and costs. They were designed to recognise the economic effect of a transaction, not its legal or accounting form or treatment. The question is whether the taxpayer has “truly incurred the cost as intended by Parliament”. \[Emphasis added\] 18. One issue that arises is whether the parties to a financial arrangement are looked at in combination as a single economic unit. The Commissioner considers that reaching a view on this issue must be derived from the provision in question. While the FA rules are concerned with the overall economic effects of a transaction, in the Commissioner’s view, this requires looking at each of the parties involved in isolation. Aside from company consolidation and amalgamation rules, there is no indication Parliament contemplated that the parties should be considered from the perspective of a single economic unit when it comes to the BPA. This conclusion regarding Parliament’s purpose for the FA rules does not mean that where other provisions of the Act are in question Parliament may have contemplated a single economic unit perspective was appropriate. 19. Parliament’s specific purpose for the BPA is for it to apply as a “wash-up” mechanism which operates when a financial arrangement matures or is disposed of. It operates to account for any gains or losses that have not already been treated as income and expenditure during the life of the financial arrangement. The BPA ensures that for each financial arrangement, all income is returned and all expenditure is deducted. 20. One situation where the BPA applies as a “wash-up” mechanism relevant to this scenario is where ultimately a financial arrangement is not repaid in full. In that case, the BPA formula item “consideration” will be positive for a borrower on account of the consideration received by them being greater that the consideration paid by them. Leaving aside any effect of the other items in the formula (income, expenditure and amount remitted), this would lead to a positive BPA figure. Under s EW 31(3) a positive BPA is income to the borrower (often referred to where there is a debt remission as “remission income”). In the present scenario, had the shareholder of Company D forgiven $500 of the loan instead of subscribing for additional shares, Company D would have had remission income of $500 calculated under the BPA as follows: ($700 – $200) – $0 + $0 + $0 = $500. 4 21. As a qualifying company, if Company D did not pay the tax on the remission income, the shareholder would have to meet the liability on account of the company (although nothing turns on the company being a qualifying company in terms of the application of s BG 1). Facts, features or attributes 22. For the FA rules, a fact, feature or attribute Parliament would have expected to see present in an arrangement bringing a financial arrangement to an end is that there has been a discharge in economic terms of the obligations of each of the parties under the arrangement. That is, the borrower has borne the economic cost of repaying the loan and the lender has received an economic benefit. 23. This means that, on the maturity of a financial arrangement Parliament would expect that the consideration paid or payable by a person actually equalled the consideration received or receivable by another person in an economic sense. 24. Where this does not occur, Parliament therefore intended that income will arise for a borrower where an obligation under a financial arrangement, including principal, is forgiven or otherwise unpaid. This is intended to reflect that the borrower has made an economic gain, or has economically had an increase in wealth, by virtue of not having to repay an amount which they would otherwise be required to pay. Extrinsic material 25. This view is supported by extrinsic materials including the Final Report of the Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital (The Valabh Committee, October 1992). The committee proposed that debts remitted should be deemed to be repaid in full so that no remission income should arise. However, this proposal was rejected by the Government. In the foreword to that report, the Ministers of Finance and Revenue stated that this proposal was “inconsistent with \[Government’s\] revenue strategy” (at \[16\]). 26. In a subsequent discussion document, The Taxation of Financial Arrangements: A Discussion Document on Proposed Changes to the Accrual Rules, December 1997 (the discussion document), the asymmetrical tax results arising from retaining the debt remission and bad debt rules were stated to be “an inevitable consequence of maintaining a capital-revenue boundary” (at \[11.5\]). The discussion document also referred to provisions that ignore remission income in the context of consolidated groups as a “substantial concession to the general rule” (at \[11.32\]). Commercial and economic reality of the arrangement 27. Next it is necessary to analyse the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement to see whether the facts, features or attributes Parliament would expect to be present (or absent) to give effect to its purpose are present. In the present scenario this requires ensuring Company D has in reality discharged its obligations under the loan when viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way. If so, the tax effects of the arrangement will be within Parliament’s contemplation for the FA rules. 28. Company D has discharged its obligations under the loan to the extent of the $200 cash it has paid to the shareholder and this amount is correctly treated as an item of consideration paid in its BPA calculation. Also, on the face of it, it is accepted that consideration for BPA purposes need not be cash but can be money’s worth, such as where mutual obligations have been offset. This has occurred in this arrangement to the extent of the $500 share subscription. A financial arrangement is defined in s EW 3(2) in terms of an arrangement 5 involving “money” being provided or received as consideration. The definition of “money” in s YA 1 specifically includes money’s worth, whether or not convertible into money, and s EW 31 includes within the BPA calculation all consideration paid to or by the person. 29. However, a s BG 1 enquiry is not limited to the legal form of the arrangement. The whole of the arrangement is examined to establish its commercial and economic reality. Given the section at issue, the avoidance inquiry examines whether the loan is in reality repaid, as Parliament would expect where there is no remission income. Therefore, the arrangement is examined to see whether Company D repays the loan in a commercially and economically real sense, and whether the shareholder is repaid in a commercially and economically real sense. 30. In the scenario, there is no actual or economic cost to Company D in issuing shares to the existing shareholder. It has not suffered the full economic cost of repaying the loan. The shareholder, in turn, has not received an economic benefit. There is no change to the shareholder’s interest in the company so the shareholder will not receive a “gain” in value from the receipt of the shares commensurate with the face value ascribed to them by the parties. Company D will simply have more shares on issue, and, the existing shareholder will hold more shares in a company in which they already owned all of the shares. The shareholder effectively finances the repayment of $500 of the loan themselves. There is an element of artificiality and contrivance in this aspect of the arrangement. 31. Accordingly, the parties have not given or received full repayment of the loan when viewed in commercial and economic terms. In commercial and economic reality, the effect of the arrangement is that from Company D’s perspective it discharges its obligations under the loan thereby eliminating a liability for $700 without it suffering any economic loss or expending money or money’s worth beyond the $200 paid. This conclusion does not turn on the fact that Company D is insolvent. 32. When looking at the financial consequences of the arrangement it should be borne in mind that the relevant provision at issue is s EW 31 and the BPA outcome arising for Company D. Parliament’s relevant purpose is concerned with a single taxpayer and whether that taxpayer has remission income. As stated at paragraph 18, except for consolidated groups, there is no relevant Parliamentary purpose that provides for the parties to the financial arrangement to be looked at as if they were a single economic unit when determining if remission income has arisen. The FA rules apply to individual taxpayers. When viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way the conclusion is that the loan has, in reality, been remitted by the shareholder to the extent of $500. 33. The Commissioner also considers the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement would be the same even if the shareholder had subscribed for the shares in cash for $500 and Company D had fully repaid the loan in cash. Applying the Parliamentary contemplation test 34. Accordingly, it is the Commissioner’s view that the arrangement does not appear to exhibit the necessary facts, features or attributes that Parliament would have expected to see present to give effect to its purposes for the FA rules and the BPA in particular. Again, in the Commissioner’s view, this means the arrangement could be outside Parliament’s purposes for the FA rules as it circumvents remission income arising under the BPA. While the Commissioner accepts that arguments could be made to the contrary, on balance, it is considered that the arrangement has tax avoidance as a purpose or effect. 6 35. It has been suggested that the above conclusion is inconsistent with the view of the High Court in AMP Life Ltd v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,940 (HC), where McGechan J commented (at \[129\]) that a debt capitalisation on its own would not be a tax avoidance arrangement. However, in the Commissioner’s view, his Honour’s comment does not necessarily reflect a considered judicial view on the issue of debt capitalisation in the context of tax avoidance. The BPA and debt remission income were not at issue in the case, and McGechan J was responding to the arguments before him concerning whether there was actually an “arrangement”. The Commissioner also notes that the case was heard and decided prior to the Parliamentary contemplation test being set out authoritatively by the Supreme Court in Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 115. There is no indication that when making his comments concerning debt capitalisation at \[129\] McGechan J was directly considering what Parliament contemplated for the FA rules in the present context. Merely Incidental test 36. The next step is to test whether the tax avoidance purpose or effect of the arrangement is merely incidental to a non-tax avoidance purpose or effect. If so, s BG 1 will not apply to the arrangement, even though the arrangement has a tax avoidance purpose or effect. A “merely incidental” tax avoidance purpose or effect is something which follows from or is necessarily and concomitantly linked to, without contrivance, some other purpose or effect. 37. Sometimes, quite general purposes are put forward to explain arrangements, and there is a question how to treat such purposes in the context of the merely incidental test. General purposes that can potentially be achieved in several different ways will not explain the particular structure of the arrangement. Section BG 1, including the merely incidental test, is applied to the specific arrangement entered into. In the present context, the elimination of the shareholder loan or the alleviation of the company’s insolvency would be insufficient to explain the particular arrangement and to establish that the tax avoidance purpose or effect is merely incidental to these purposes or effects. This is the situation given the limited facts of the arrangement in this scenario. The tax avoidance purpose or effect appears to be either the sole or the main purpose or effect of the arrangement. Accordingly, the tax avoidance purpose or effect is unlikely to be merely incidental to another purpose or effect of the arrangement and the arrangement in the scenario fails the merely incidental test. 38. However, the Commissioner accepts that in a particular case it may be possible for any tax avoidance purpose or effect of an arrangement involving debt capitalisation to be merely incidental to some non-tax avoidance purpose or effect. If so, s BG 1 would not apply. For this to be the case, the non-tax avoidance purposes or effects would need to explain the involvement of a debt capitalisation within the particular structure of the arrangement. An example may be where a regulatory body imposes a certain approach to the restoration of solvency to a subsidiary. Reconstruction 39. If s BG 1 is to apply to give rise to remission income for Company D, it might be thought that there should be a corresponding deduction for the shareholder as part of a reconstruction under s GA 1. However, Parliament has made a deliberate choice for the FA rules that sometimes it will produce an asymmetrical result. An asymmetrical result can arise where the lender is not entitled to a deduction. For instance, had the shareholder in this scenario remitted the $500, the shareholder would not have a negative BPA (a negative BPA is a deduction under s EW 31(4)). This is because the BPA formula item “amount remitted” would include any amount not included in the item “consideration” on account of 7 the amount being remitted by the shareholder. This would give a BPA calculation of: ($200 – $700) – $0 + $0 + $500 = $0. 40. For the shareholder to obtain a deduction for remitting the financial arrangement they would need to satisfy the bad debt rules in s DB 31. Relevant to the present scenario, if the parties are associated (as they are here) no bad debt deduction is permitted (s DB 31(3)). To be consistent with this, it would follow that any application of s BG 1 in this scenario would not result in the shareholder being provided with a $500 deduction as a consequential adjustment under s GA 1. Factual variations 41. This arrangement can be contrasted with the situation where there is an issue of shares to a third party by a solvent company. In that case, it is more likely that the shares issued as consideration will have an economic effect. The existing shareholders of a company would suffer a dilution of their investment. The third party would obtain an equity interest in the company and there may be a change in the effective ownership of the company. This type of situation is more likely to have been contemplated by Parliament as one where no remission income arises under the BPA (although this would need to be considered on a case-by-case basis). 42. Given the above, it might be asked whether the fact that the company is solvent is relevant in the third-party lender situation. The question is answered by considering what facts, features and attributes Parliament would expect to see present. Parliament would expect that a lender receives repayment in a commercially and economically real way. In some situations, depending on the facts, shares in an insolvent company may have some value to a third-party lender. Examples could be where there is the prospect of the company regaining solvency or it has some valuable assets. In most other situations, shares in an insolvent company will not have any value to a third-party lender and so will not constitute repayment of a loan in a real sense. 8 References Subject references: Base price adjustment Consideration Debt capitalisation Debt remission Financial arrangement Merely incidental Tax avoidance Tax avoidance arrangement Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007: ss BG 1, EW 3, EW 29, EW 31, GA 1, s YA 1 definition of “money” Case references AMP Life v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,940 (HC) Alesco New Zealand Ltd v CIR \[2013\] NZCA 40 Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 115 Related rulings/statements IS 13/01 Tax avoidance and the interpretation of sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (July 2013) Other references: Final Report of the Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital (The Valabh Committee, October 1992) The Taxation of Financial Arrangements: A Discussion Document on Proposed Changes to the Accrual Rules, (December 1997)
1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 15/02 INCOME TAX – MAJOR DEVELOPMENT OR DIVISION – WHAT IS “SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURE” FOR SECTION CB 13 PURPOSES? All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about s CB 13. Question 1. What expenditure is taken into account for s CB 13 purposes, and when will such expenditure be regarded as “significant”? Answer 2. Expenditure on the following is taken into account for s CB 13 purposes:  channelling, contouring, drainage, earthworks, kerbing, levelling and roading;  other physical developmental work that is customarily found in major projects involving development of land for commercial, industrial or residential purposes (for example, paving, retaining, sewage piping, power cabling, demolition and site clearing); and  other non-physical developmental work that is customarily found in major projects involving development of land for commercial, industrial or residential purposes (for example, preparation of zoning applications, the drawing of engineering plans and specifications, and the provision of estimates). 3. The following is not taken into account for s CB 13 purposes:  non-developmental work;  the value of a person’s time, effort or use of their machinery or other equipment in undertaking the development work; and  future expenditure not yet incurred on the undertaking or scheme. 4. Whether expenditure on the undertaking or scheme is significant for s CB 13 purposes requires consideration of:  the amount of the expenditure in absolute terms;  the amount of the expenditure relative to the pre and post development value of the land; and  the context of the project. 5. Whether the total amount of relevant expenditure is “significant” for s CB 13 purposes will be a matter of fact and degree in the circumstances of any given case, bearing in mind that the focus of the provision is major projects. 6. This item qualifies IG0010 “Work of a minor nature” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 1 (February 2005): 5 in one respect. IG0010 is regarded as incorrect to the extent that it suggests that only physical work can be “development” work. On this point, see further from \[23\]. 2 Explanation 7. An amount is income of a person under s CB 13 (provided the amount is not income under any of ss CB 6 to CB 12 and CB 14) if it is derived by them from disposing of land in circumstances where:  an undertaking or scheme (not necessarily in the nature of a business) is carried on by the person (or by someone for them);  the undertaking or scheme involves the development of the land or the division of the land into lots; and  the development or division work involves significant expenditure on channelling, contouring, drainage, earthworks, kerbing, levelling, roading, or any other amenity, service, or work customarily undertaken or provided in major projects involving the development of land for commercial, industrial, or residential purposes. 8. There are a number of exclusions from s CB 13: the residential exclusions (s CB 17), the business exclusion (s CB 20), the farm land exclusion (s CB 21) and the investment exclusion (s CB 23). This item does not cover the application of the exclusions. 9. Normally a person is allowed a deduction for expenditure they incur as the cost of revenue account property (s DB 23). However, when a person derives income under s CB 13, s DB 27 allows a deduction for the value of the land at the time the undertaking or scheme commenced. As a result, when s CB 13 applies, the increase in the value of the land from the time the undertaking or scheme is commenced until the land is disposed of is taxed. 10. The question we have been asked requires consideration of:  what expenditure is taken into account for s CB 13 purposes; and  when expenditure will be “significant” for s CB 13 purposes. Legislation 11. Section CB 13 provides (relevantly) as follows: CB 13 Disposal: amount from major development or division and not already in income Income (1) An amount that a person derives from disposing of land is income of the person if— (a) the amount is not income under any of sections CB 6 to CB 12 and CB 14; and (b) the amount is derived in the following circumstances: (i) an undertaking or scheme, which is not necessarily in the nature of a business, is carried on; and (ii) the undertaking or scheme involves the development of the land or the division of the land into lots; and (iii) the person, or another person for them, carries on development or division work on or relating to the land; and (iv) the development or division work involves significant expenditure on channelling, contouring, drainage, earthworks, kerbing, levelling, roading, or any other amenity, service, or work customarily undertaken or provided in major projects involving the development of land for commercial, industrial, or residential purposes. ... \[Emphasis added\] 3 Application of the legislation 12. As can be seen, s CB 13(1)(b)(iv) is the relevant paragraph of the provision here. That paragraph requires that the development or division work involves significant expenditure on:  channelling, contouring, drainage, earthworks, kerbing, levelling, roading, or  any other amenity, service, or work customarily undertaken or provided in major projects involving the development of land for commercial, industrial, or residential purposes. 13. The following discussion considers the issue of what expenditure is taken into account for s CB 13 purposes, followed by the issue of when expenditure will be “significant” for s CB 13 purposes. What expenditure is taken into account for s CB 13 purposes? 14. The first issue raised is what expenditure is taken into account for s CB 13 purposes. A number of sub-issues arise from this question, namely:  Is the “any other amenity, service, or work ...” category limited to things of the same type as the specifically listed works? If so, what things will be in that category?  Is it only work found solely in major projects that is relevant, or is work that is found in both major and non-major projects included?  Does the work have to be undertaken or provided in the context of an industrial, commercial or residential development?  Is a person’s time and the use of their own machinery taken into account?  Is intended future expenditure on the undertaking or scheme taken into account? These are considered in turn below. Is the “any other amenity, service, or work ...” category limited to things of the same type as the specifically listed works? If so, what things will be in that category? 15. As can be seen at \[11\], some specific works are referred to in s CB 13(1)(b)(iv) – channelling, contouring, drainage, earthworks, kerbing, levelling, roading. All of the works in this specific list involve physical development work on the land. However, the provision then includes the more general phrase “or any other amenity, service, or work customarily undertaken or provided in major projects involving the development of land for commercial, industrial, or residential purposes”. The first issue for consideration is what is included within that phrase. 16. The ejusdem generis principle of statutory interpretation may assist with this issue. The ejusdem generis principle directs that “if the specific words in the list are of the same class, the general word following them is construed as also being limited to that class” (J F Burrows and R I Carter, Statute Law in New Zealand (4th ed, LexisNexis, Wellington, 2009) at 233). 17. Nothing suggests that s CB 13(1)(b)(iv) should not be read in line with the ejusdem generis principle 1 . Applying this principle means that the wide words (“any other amenity, service or work ...”) in s CB 13(1)(b)(iv) should be read as limited to works within the same class as the specifically listed works. 1 See Skycity Auckland Ltd v The Gambling Commission \[2007\] NZCA 407, \[2008\] 2 NZLR 182 on the requirements that must be satisfied for the principle to be applied. 4 18. However, there are different possible interpretations of what class the list of specific words form. “Channelling, contouring, drainage, earthworks, kerbing, levelling and roading” could be seen as all being works that are:  physical development work on the land; or  developmental work, as opposed to things that are purely division work. 19. The Commissioner considers the better view is that the class of specific works in s CB 13(1)(b)(iv) should be regarded as being developmental works, as opposed to purely divisional. The Commissioner does not consider that the class of works is limited to physical developmental works. In particular, the Commissioner notes that s CB 13 refers to work on or relating to the land. This suggests that developmental work other than physical developmental work on the land was intended to be included in the significant expenditure determination. Similarly, the fact that s CB 13 refers to any other “service” (and to a lesser extent “amenity”) in addition to any other “work” on or relating to the land suggests that non-physical developmental work should be included. 20. Accordingly, applying the ejusdem generis principle would mean that the wider “or any other amenity, service or work ...” words would encompass other physical developmental work not already listed (such as paving, retaining, sewage piping, power cabling, demolition and site clearing) and other developmental work that is not physical work on the land (such as preparation of a zoning application, the drawing of engineering plans and specifications, and the provision of estimates). The application of the ejusdem generis principle would exclude from consideration any work that was purely division work on or relating to the land (such as surveying that is related to the division of the land, as opposed to surveying related to development of the land, and the preparation and deposit of subdivision, unit title or flats plans). 21. The Commissioner notes that in the two relevant cases on what is now s CB 13, Aubrey v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,765 (HC) and Mee v CIR (1988) 10 NZTC 5,073 (HC), survey costs were taken into account. However, the taxpayer in Aubrey had accepted that these costs were to be included. In Mee, the taxpayer submitted that the survey costs should not be taken into account, based on observations of Ongley J in Wellington v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,101 (HC) (a case concerning what is now s CB 12). In that case, Ongley J had expressed the view that “development or division work” in what is now s CB 13 encompassed only things that were developmental in nature. In Mee, Hardie Boys J, while noting the decision in Aubrey, indicated that he tended to share Ongley J’s view. Hardie Boys J did not need to decide whether survey fees should be included in the context of the Mee case, as the outcome would not have differed. For the reasons discussed above, the Commissioner considers that expenditure for work that is purely division work should not be taken into account. 22. It is noted that “development” in the context of s CB 13 means development in the sense of the preparation of the land for an intended use. It does not include the construction or erection of buildings (Dobson v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,025 (HC)). Qualification to IG0010 “Work of a minor nature” 23. IG0010 “Work of a minor nature” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 1 (February 2005): 5, at 9-10, states that development work entails some form of physical work being undertaken in relation to the land. The Commissioner no longer considers that statement to be correct. Smith v CIR (No 2) (1989) 11 NZTC 6,018 (CA) makes it clear that development work does not have to be physical work. As McMullin J stated at \[6,024-6,025\]: 5 What then is meant by the words “development or division into lots”. There is a degree of overlapping in that phrase. Some development work may not be division work and vice versa, but generally speaking the two will go hand in hand. “Division” is not defined in the Land and Income Tax Act or the Local Government Act 1974 which deals with the subdivision of land. “Development” is also not defined. This rather suggests that the framers of the tax legislation intended that the phrase “development or division” is not to be narrowly construed when considered in relation to an undertaking or scheme. By declining to define “development or division work” sec 88AA(d) leaves the exact nature of the work wide open. Development work frequently involves physical work on the land itself but need not necessarily do so. In their concession that the letting of the sewage contract in October 1971 was capable of construction as a development work, counsel for the appellant rightly recognised that a contractual step which anticipates physical work but itself falls short of it may be development work. In my view development work on a subdivision of land may cover a range of activities including, in appropriate cases, the preparation of a zoning application without which the subdivision and resulting sales at a profit could never be achieved, the drawing of engineering plans and specifications for roads, the provision of estimates, the preparation of subdivisional plans, the letting of the necessary contracts and the resulting physical work involving the construction of roads, rights of way and culverts. \[Emphasis added\] 24. Similarly, Bisson J stated at \[6,026\]: If he \[counsel for the taxpayer\] accepts as a matter of law that legal work can be division work in a scheme involving division into lots, there can be no justification as a matter of law and logic for not accepting legal work as development work in a scheme involving development. This would also be the case if the scheme involved both development and division into lots of the land in question. 25. On the basis of this Court of Appeal authority, the Commissioner considers that IG0010 incorrectly suggests that only physical work can be “development” work. IG0010 no longer represents the Commissioner’s view in this regard. Is work found in both major and non-major projects included? 26. It has been suggested that only categories of work that are found in major projects but not also in minor projects are relevant for s CB 13 purposes. This view is based on the fact that the focus of s CB 13 is major projects, and the list of specific works in the section is intended to distinguish s CB 13 from s CB 12. It has been suggested that to include categories of work that are also found in minor projects would undermine this distinction. 27. The Commissioner does not agree that only categories of work found in major projects, not those found in both major and minor projects, are included in the significant expenditure determination. The categories of work specified in s CB 13 are not things that are exclusive to major projects. Earthworks, drainage, contouring, channelling, levelling, etc may be undertaken in both minor and major projects. What is telling, in terms of whether s CB 13 applies, is whether the expenditure on all of the work included in the provision is significant. If the expenditure on such work is significant, that means the project is sufficiently major to attract the application of s CB 13. Does the work have to be undertaken or provided in the context of an industrial, commercial or residential development? 28. For s CB 13 to apply, the amenity, service or work does not need to be undertaken in the context of a commercial, industrial or residential development. The amenity, service or work only needs to be of a type customarily undertaken or provided in major projects involving the development of land for commercial, industrial or residential purposes. 29. It has been suggested that to be relevant for s CB 13 purposes the level of expenditure on any of the specific works listed in s CB 13 must be such as one would customarily find in major projects involving development for industrial, commercial or residential purposes. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the 6 expenditure on any of the specific works will only be included if the work undertaken is of a kind or scale that might occur in major projects involving development for industrial, commercial or residential purposes. 30. All of the specific works mentioned in s CB 13 are customarily undertaken or provided in major commercial, industrial or residential development projects. The expenditure on, or scale of, such work does not need to be what would customarily be found in such major projects. Rather, all of the expenditure on such works is relevant, together with any expenditure on work that falls within the “catch-all” wider words in the provision (which must be work customarily undertaken in major projects involving development for commercial, industrial or residential purposes, as the specifically listed items are). It is necessary to ascertain whether the totality of this expenditure is significant. The Commissioner’s view is that the expenditure on work in any particular category does not need to be significant, or at a level one might customarily find in major commercial, industrial or residential developments, to be included in the significant expenditure evaluation. Does a person’s time, effort and use of their own machinery need to be taken into account? 31. In both Aubrey and Mee, the court considered that the taxpayers’ time (and the taxpayer’s family’s time in Aubrey) was relevant in assessing whether the expenditure was significant. In both cases, the use of the taxpayer’s own machinery was also considered to be relevant. In Aubrey, Tompkins J noted that the expenditure of time and the use of machinery could not be quantified in monetary terms, but were nonetheless relevant. In Mee, Hardie Boys J made a monetary allowance (which equated to $306) for the taxpayer’s time and the use of his machinery. 32. The Commissioner does not consider that a taxpayer’s (or other person’s) time, effort or use of their machinery or other equipment is a relevant consideration for s CB 13 purposes. If it were intended that non-monetary expenditure be taken into account, the provision could simply have stipulated that it applied where the development or division involved major or significant work on the specified activities (or any other work, etc). The fact that s CB 13 requires that “the development or division work involves significant expenditure” (emphasis added) suggests that “expenditure” was meant to mean something other than simply work or the use of energy or other resources. The Commissioner considers that “expenditure” in s CB 13 should be read in the sense it is generally used in taxing statutes—an outlay of a monetary sum. Whether the expenditure needs to be incurred at the time an amount is derived from any given disposition of land is discussed below. 33. Although the taxpayer’s labour (or the unpaid labour of others) is not relevant for determining whether there was significant expenditure, any expenditure on labour, including payments to working owners / working partners etc for services performed, should be taken into account for s CB 13 purposes. 34. Although the use of a taxpayer’s machinery is not relevant for determining whether there was significant expenditure, there may be some associated expenditure that is relevant, for example, the cost of fuel used in the machinery, as this is monetary expenditure. Similarly, expenditure on the purchase or hire of machinery or other equipment would be relevant. In the case of the purchase of machinery or equipment, it may be appropriate to apportion the expenditure to reflect the use related to the undertaking or scheme. 7 Is future expenditure not yet incurred on the undertaking or scheme taken into account? 35. Another issue sometimes raised is whether intended future expenditure on the undertaking or scheme should be taken into account, or just expenditure that has been incurred at the time an amount is derived from the disposition of the land in question. 36. Section CB 13 is concerned with the development or division work of the undertaking or scheme, not just that carried out in relation to a particular piece of land involved in the undertaking or scheme. Some of the development or division work may be yet to occur at the time an amount is derived from the disposition of a particular piece of land. The provision’s focus being on the work of the undertaking or scheme may arguably suggest that intended future expenditure on development or division work that is part of the undertaking or scheme should be taken into account. However, the wording of s CB 13 does not make clear whether all of the expenditure related to the undertaking or scheme should be taken into account, even if it has not been incurred at the time an amount is derived from the disposal of some of the land. 37. Prior to the Income Tax Act being rewritten for improved clarity (which was done progressively from 1994), s CD 1(2)(g) of the Income Tax Act 1994 (as it then was) referred to development or division work (being work involving significant expenditure on the specified things) that “has been carried on or carried out”. This earlier wording of the provision tends to indicate that what should be taken into account is only expenditure that had been incurred at the time an amount is derived from the disposal of the land in question. 38. Section YA 3 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and s ZA 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 set out transitional provisions relating to the rewrite of the Act, and they stipulate that the rewritten provisions were intended to have the same effect as the corresponding provisions in the ITA 1994 and ITA 2004 respectively (unless the subject of an identified policy change, or subsequently amended). 39. What is now s CB 13 was not specified in Schedule 22A of the ITA 2004, and is not listed in Schedule 51 of the ITA 2007. Therefore, the provision was not the subject of any intended policy change as part of the rewrite, and it was intended to have the same effect as the corresponding provision in the ITA 1994. As is clear from the provision as it was in the ITA 1994, the development or division work had to have been carried on or carried out at the time an amount is derived from the sale or disposition in question. 40. The Commissioner therefore considers that intended future expenditure on the undertaking or scheme should not be taken into account; only expenditure that has been incurred at the time an amount is derived from the disposition of the land in question is relevant to whether that amount is income under s CB 13. When will expenditure be “significant” for s CB 13 purposes? 41. The second of the two main issues arising is when expenditure will be regarded as “significant” for s CB 13 purposes. As noted above, the question is whether the totality of the relevant expenditure is significant, not the expenditure in any given category. 42. In Aubrey, Tompkins J noted that the circumstances of a particular case will determine whether expenditure is significant, and that it is a matter of fact and degree. 43. The taxpayer in Aubrey had some coastal farm land. There was a settlement of some 50-60 families who resided on part of the land in consideration for a small amount of rent. The taxpayer decided to subdivide off that part of the farm land. 8 He prepared (and the county council approved) a scheme plan for 105 residential sections on approximately 17 acres, together with roadways, access ways and an esplanade reserve. The work that was required to effect the subdivision included: the grassing of sand to prevent erosion, the installation of stormwater drainage, some roading, the boxing and concreting of manholes, and the electricity (which had been brought to the area prior to the subdivision) being extended. 44. The total cost of materials supplied and work done by contractors was $20,280 (in 1967 dollars). This included surveyor’s costs, insurance and legal expenses. The taxpayer also undertook some work himself. The county engineer at the time described the county’s conditions of approval as very low by the then current standards. The roads were not sealed, there was no kerbing, channelling, water or sewerage, and the depth of metal required on the roadway was minimal. 45. In finding that the expenditure in Aubrey was significant and that s CB 13 therefore applied, Tompkins J commented at \[61,770\]: In weighing up whether the work involved expenditure that was significant, I have had regard to the size of the resulting subdivision (105 sections), the nature and extent of the physical work carried out as described in the evidence, the value of the land that resulted from the expenditure ($168,000), and the circumstances and location of the subdivision and the standards considered appropriate. In doing so I have not found it helpful to use dictionary definitions to translate “significant expenditure” into other words. I prefer to consider those words in their plain and ordinary meaning. Having done so, I am satisfied that the expenditure was significant in the contexts to which I have referred. It resulted in the completion of a relatively large subdivision. That involved some considerable roading and the formation of rights of way. It also required the provision of stormwater drainage. Ignoring the expenditure of time and equipment by the objector, $20,280 is 12% of the resulting value of the land. It would be a considerably higher proportion of the pre subdivision value. In my opinion, viewed in relation to a seaside holiday subdivision requiring only modest subdivisional standards, an expenditure in 1967 of $20,280 or in 1983 of $109,620 (both increased by the value of the objector's work and machinery) can hardly be regarded as insignificant. 46. The fact that Tompkins J had regard to the context of the subdivision (in particular the modest standards imposed on it) has been criticised by some 2 . However, the Commissioner agrees with Tompkins J’s point that expenditure at the level it was, in the context of a development project that did not have very high standards imposed on it, emphasises the significant nature of the expenditure. That is, the expenditure in absolute and relative terms was even more starkly significant when one considered that the development project did not have very high standards imposed on it. With lower than typical standards one would expect lower expenditure in absolute and relative terms than what was incurred by the taxpayer in Aubrey. The Commissioner agrees that the context can be informative as to how significant the expenditure is. 47. The present-day regulatory context, including the existence of the Resource Management Act 1991, may mean that, in absolute terms, the expenditure on an undertaking or scheme of development is higher (accounting for inflation) than it would have been historically. The existence of higher regulatory standards may also mean that expenditure relative to at least the pre-development value of the land may be less likely to be regarded as significant than such relativities might have suggested historically, when such standards were not imposed. However, the increased costs associated with the current regulatory environment would, generally speaking, be expected to be reflected in property values. As such, expenditure relative to post-development values may not be significantly altered by higher current day regulatory standards. It may be that the context in which some expenditure related to regulatory requirements arises is a relevant consideration for s CB 13 purposes. For example, if someone had to deal with a 2 See, for example, John Prebble, Taxation of Property Transactions (Butterworths NZ Ltd, Wellington, 1986) at \[§12.6\]. 9 particularly litigious party in the Environment Court and the development costs were therefore more than would usually arise for a similar development project, that might be a relevant contextual consideration in assessing whether the overall expenditure was significant. 48. The other case that concerned whether expenditure was significant for s CB 13 purposes is Mee. The taxpayer in that case had been farming a property in Queenstown. A 2-hectare strip of the land was unsuitable for farming, so the taxpayer decided to subdivide it into 22 sections for sale. The road adjacent to the land was unsealed at the time, and there was no water or sewerage reticulation. The local authority consented to the subdivision subject to some conditions. The taxpayer had to enter into a contract to pay the council half of the estimated costs of additional roading being formed and the length of the road that fronted the subdivision being sealed. Further, the taxpayer had to enter into a contract to pay $580 per section towards the cost of providing water and sewerage services to the sections (which the council would install in the future as necessary). The taxpayer also had to create access ways to some of the sections, provide storm water drainage and provide necessary easements. 49. Hardie Boys J accepted that the payment to the council for the future roading, water and sewerage should not be taken into account in this case. This was because that work, if and when ultimately done, would not be “carried on or carried out by or on behalf of the taxpayer on or in relation to the land”. 50. It is noted that the payments to the council in Mee were to cover the cost of the work if and when the council deemed it necessary in the future. In a situation where a taxpayer paid a council or other authority for some services or work being provided, that expenditure would be relevant for s CB 13 purposes. 51. Other council contributions such as development contributions for additional community and network infrastructure would not be taken into account for the purposes of s CB 13. Such contributions typically go towards the cost of public infrastructure that is needed to meet the additional demands arising from the population growth in an area— for example transport, open space reserves, and community facilities. Similarly to the local authority fees in Mee, such contributions would not be for work to be done on behalf of the taxpayer. 52. In Mee, Hardie Boys J considered that, at most, the relevant costs were: the survey fees ($2,647), the valuation fees ($617), the cost of pipes and gravel for the formation of the access ways ($180), and an allowance for the use of the taxpayers’ machinery and for the value of the time he spent on physical work on the land ($306)—a total of $3,750. \[As discussed above, the Commissioner considers that division costs should not be taken into account, and neither should the taxpayer’s labour or the use of their machinery. Hardie Boys J included the survey fees, but noted that he tended to think they should not be taken into account. However, he did not need to decide the matter in Mee as the outcome did not turn on this.\] 53. Hardie Boys J found that the expenditure of $3,750 was not significant in terms of what is now s CB 13, noting that the statutory emphasis was on major projects. He considered the amount of expenditure in absolute terms, and also relative to the number of sections, and to the value of the land pre and post division. Hardie Boys J commented as follows at \[5,077\]: In Aubrey, Tompkins J considered that the decision as to whether the relevant expenditure was significant in terms of para (e) had to be based inter alia on its relativity to the nature of the subdivision and the value of the completed project. It must always be a matter of fact and degree in the individual case, but nonetheless it must be remembered that the statutory emphasis is on “major projects”. I therefore doubt that expenditure of $3,750 (even in 1974 terms) could in any circumstances be regarded as significant. It plainly is not so when it is related to the other information that is available here. Divided amongst 22 sections, it amounts 10 to $170 per section. The land as a block before subdivision was valued at $185,000 as at August 1973. The relevant expenditure was some 2% of that. By April 1977 14 sections had been sold, the average net proceeds being a little over $12,000. The expenditure per section was thus 1.4% of the average price. On any approach, the expenditure cannot in my opinion be regarded as significant. 54. The Commissioner considers that, on the basis of Aubrey and Mee, it is clear that whether expenditure is “significant” for s CB 13 purposes will be a matter of fact and degree in the circumstances of any given case. 55. In terms of how much expenditure will be regarded as “significant” for s CB 13 purposes, it must be borne in mind that the statutory emphasis is, as noted by Hardie Boys J in Mee, on major projects. The provision’s focus on major projects colours the level of expenditure that will be regarded as “significant”. That said, the Commissioner considers that the extent of the expenditure still needs to be considered. There is no “threshold question” of whether a project is “major”; the amount of the expenditure is what determines whether a project is sufficiently major to fall within s CB 13. 56. Section CB 12 also provides some indication as to what significant may mean in s CB 13. Undertakings or schemes that involve development or division work that is not minor will be caught by s CB 12 if commenced within 10 years of acquisition of the land in question. The different levels of work or expenditure required to fall within ss CB 12 and CB 13 further indicate that “significant” in s CB 13 was intended to be reasonably high, and what is not significant in terms of the provision is therefore reasonably high too. 57. Consideration of the amount of the expenditure relative to the pre and post development value of the land indicates how substantial the project is, and therefore whether the expenditure should be regarded as significant for s CB 13 purposes. It may well be that the amount of expenditure in absolute terms is sufficiently high that it could only be regarded as significant, even though in relative terms it would not seem significant. Similarly, it may well be that the expenditure in relative terms appears significant, but when considered in absolute terms, and in the context of the project, it would not be regarded as significant. 58. It is impossible to draw definitive lines in terms of absolute amounts or relative percentages of expenditure to land value. Whether expenditure is significant for s CB 13 purposes will be a matter of fact and degree in the circumstances of any given case. 59. The nature and extent of the physical work carried out as part of the undertaking or scheme would indicate whether the project was a major one. However, s CB 13 is concerned with whether the expenditure is significant. The Commissioner considers that the nature and extent of the physical work is not instructive in that regard. That said, if the extent of the physical work carried on is suggestive of the project being a major one, typically that will go hand in hand with associated significant expenditure. However, this will not necessarily be the case— for example, where someone undertakes extensive physical development work on their land themselves without incurring a great deal of expenditure. Examples 60. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the “significant expenditure” requirement of s CB 13. They do not consider any of the other requirements of s CB 13, including the requirement in s CB 13(1)(a) that the amount derived on the disposition is not income under any of ss CB 6 to CB 12 and CB 14. The examples also do not consider the potential application of any of the exclusions to s CB 13, or of any other potentially applicable provisions. 11 Example 1 – Significant expenditure and progressive sales during a project 61. The G Family Trust owned some land near Hamilton, which had been farmed by the G family for three generations. None of the G family children wished to take over the farm, so the trust decided to subdivide the land into 18 equal-sized lifestyle blocks. Carrying out the scheme involved expenditure of approximately $200,000 on earthworks and metalling related to the creation of rights of way to the subdivided blocks. Approximately $100,000 was incurred on surveying and legal expenses related to the delineation of the boundaries of the new blocks. The land was valued at $1.4m prior to the subdivision, and the 18 lots sold for a total of $2.3m. The first three lots were sold (for a total of $350,000) early on in the course of the project, as they did not require the rights of way for access. At the time the sales of those lots settled, only $10,000 had been incurred on the earthworks. By the time the remaining lots were sold, all of the work had been completed. 62. The relevant expenditure for s CB 13 purposes totals $200,000— being the expenditure on the earthworks and metalling related to the creation of the rights of way. The expenditure on the survey and legal fees related to the delineation of the boundaries is not relevant expenditure for s CB 13 purposes, as it is not developmental work. 63. When the sales of the first three lots settled, $10,000 of relevant expenditure had been incurred on the undertaking or scheme. That amount of expenditure cannot be regarded as significant for s CB 13 purposes when considered relative to the value of the land, and the absolute amount of the relevant expenditure being only $10,000 is not sufficiently substantial to indicate that s CB 13 should apply to the sales of those lots irrespective of the relativities. The amounts derived on the sales of those three lots are therefore not income under s CB 13. 64. By the time the remaining 15 lots were sold, all of the $200,000 of relevant expenditure on the undertaking or scheme had been incurred. Prior to the commencement of the undertaking or scheme, the land was valued at $1.4m, and it sold for a total of $2.3m. The expenditure was therefore approximately 14.3% of the pre-development value of the land and approximately 8.7% of the post- development value of the land. The relevant expenditure as a percentage of the pre and post development value of the land is significant for s CB 13 purposes. Further, the absolute amount of the relevant expenditure of $200,000 is not sufficiently small to indicate that s CB 13 should not apply to the sales of the last 15 lots irrespective of the relativities. The amounts derived on the sales of those 15 lots are therefore income under s CB 13. The G Family Trust is able to claim a deduction under s DB 27 for the value of that portion of the land at the time the undertaking or scheme commenced. Example 2 – Significant expenditure and the context of the project 65. Yasmin and Alex owned a house on a 2000m 2 semi-rural section. Yasmin and Alex decide to build a flat on the front part of the section before selling it. The property is on a hill, so the project included excavation, levelling, and construction of a retaining wall. In addition, water and sewage pipes to the new dwelling were laid, and a driveway paved. The development work, including relevant council consents, the drawing up of the plans for the preparation of the site, and all of the physical work, cost a total of approximately $60,000. The property was valued at $550,000 prior to the work, and sold for $1,000,000. 66. As noted, the total cost of the development work was $60,000. The cost of construction of the new dwelling is not relevant, as that work is not “development” work for the purposes of s CB 13, as it is not work in preparing the land for an intended use. 12 67. The relevant expenditure was therefore approximately 10.9% of the pre- development value of the land, and approximately 6% of the post-development value of the land. When considered relative to the pre-development value of the land, the expenditure appears to be significant. The absolute amount of the relevant expenditure being $60,000 is not by itself sufficiently small to indicate that s CB 13 should not apply to the sale of the land irrespective of the relativities. However, when the expenditure is considered in the context of it being for a relatively modest project on a single residential block, it is not regarded as significant for s CB 13 purposes. The amount derived on the sale of the property is therefore not income under s CB 13. Example 3 – Significant expenditure and absolute amounts 68. Kaching Ltd owns a piece of industrial-zoned land in Auckland. Kaching Ltd decides it is timely to develop and sell the land. Kaching Ltd decides to develop a shopping complex on the land, which, prior to the development, was valued at approximately $30m. 69. Kaching Ltd applied to have the land re-zoned for high-density commercial use, undertook master planning for the development, and commissioned a geotechnical report, an infrastructure report, an architectural plan and an archaeological assessment. Kaching Ltd engaged contractors to level the land, lay the water and sewerage pipes and install driveways, a carpark and associated kerbing. The shopping complex was then constructed, and Kaching Ltd is in negotiations with interested purchasers. Expenditure on the works, excluding the construction of the complex, totalled $1.25m. 70. All of the $1.25m expenditure is relevant for s CB 13 purposes, as it is all developmental in nature. 71. The expenditure was therefore approximately 4.2% of the pre-development value of the land. When considered relative to the pre-development value of the land, the expenditure does not appear overly significant. However, the absolute amount of the expenditure ($1.25m) is sufficiently substantial for the expenditure to be regarded as significant for s CB 13 purposes, despite the amount relative to the value of the land not seeming overly significant on its own. This conclusion is further bolstered when the expenditure is considered in the context of it being incurred as part of a major commercial development. The amount derived on the sale of the property will therefore be income under s CB 13. Kaching Ltd will be able to claim a deduction under s DB 27 for the value of the land at the time the undertaking or scheme commenced. 13 References Related rulings/statements IG0010 “Work of a minor nature” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 1 (February 2005): 5 Subject references Income Tax, undertakings or schemes involving development of land or division of land into lots, significant expenditure, major projects involving development of land Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007, ss CB 13, DB 27, ZA 3, and Schedule 51 Income Tax Act 2004, s YA 3 and Schedule 22A Income Tax Act 1994, s CD 1(2)(g) Case references Aubrey v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,765 (HC) Dobson v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,025 (HC) Mee v CIR (1988) 10 NZTC 5,073 (HC) Skycity Auckland Ltd v The Gambling Commission \[2007\] NZCA 407, \[2008\] 2 NZLR 182 Smith v CIR (No 2) (1989) 11 NZTC 6,018 (CA) Wellington v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,101 (HC) Other references J F Burrows and R I Carter, Statute Law in New Zealand (4th ed, LexisNexis, Wellington, 2009) John Prebble, Taxation of Property Transactions (Butterworths NZ Ltd, Wellington, 1986)
1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 15/03 INCOME TAX – CHANGING TO A DIFFERENT DEPRECIATION RATE FOR AN ITEM OF DEPRECIABLE PROPERTY All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) is about subpart EE (the depreciation rules). Question 1. Can the depreciation rate that a taxpayer uses to depreciate an item of depreciable property change? Answer 2. Yes; the annual depreciation rate that a taxpayer uses to depreciate an item of depreciable property can change in limited circumstances. This is when the depreciation rate used is not or is no longer the depreciation rate that applies to the taxpayer’s particular item of depreciable property. This is the case in the following circumstances:  There is a change in legislation that means a different depreciation rate applies to the item.  The taxpayer changes from using a special rate to using the economic or provisional rate that applies to their item.  The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (Commissioner) sets a new depreciation rate that applies to the item of depreciable property.  The taxpayer has been using an incorrect depreciation rate.  The depreciation rate is no longer applicable due to a change in circumstances (for example, a change in the way the item is used by the taxpayer). Glossary 3. The following terms are used in this QWBA: “Asset class” is the description of a kind of item(s) of depreciable property set out in a depreciation determination for a specific industry or asset category in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates. “Depreciation rate” is a rate set by the Commissioner for a certain kind of item(s) issued in a depreciation determination or a rate for depreciation purposes set in a legislative provision. “Depreciation Determinations” are determinations issued by the Commissioner under ss 91AAF or 91AAG of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). They set out the description of the kind of item(s) in the item asset class the depreciation determination applies to, the estimated useful life of the item(s), and the depreciation rate(s) to be used. 2 Background 4. We have been asked if the depreciation rate a taxpayer is using for an item of depreciable property can change. This issue has been raised particularly because of the change to the depreciation rate for most buildings to 0% from the 2011/12 income year. This change has caused some taxpayers to review the asset classes and depreciation rates they are using for their items of depreciable property. In some cases this review has resulted in taxpayers finding another asset class and depreciation rate that better describes their item of depreciable property. Taxpayers have asked the Commissioner whether they can change to that other depreciation rate. This QWBA answers that question. Sometimes a change of rate situation arises as a consequence of an item of depreciable property being incorrectly identified, this QWBA does not address how items of depreciable property are identified. Guidance on this issue can be found in the items discussed below at \[7\]. 5. Taxpayers have also asked about the role of s DB 65 in this context. Section DB 65 was inserted into the Income Tax Act 2007 because of the changes to the building depreciation rate. The section is a transitional rule that allows a deduction for commercial fit-out that has previously been depreciated as part of a building rather than as a separate item. Circumstances covered by s DB 65 are not dealt with in this item, as they are specifically dealt with in s DB 65 and not under the depreciation regime. The Commissioner has published guidance on how s DB 65 applies in Question We’ve Been Asked QB 13/01: Depreciation of commercial fit-out, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25, No 5 (June 2013): 24. Identifying the item of depreciable property 6. This QWBA focuses on the circumstances in which a taxpayer already using a depreciation rate for an item of depreciable property can change that depreciation rate. This means the taxpayer has already identified the item of depreciable property that is being depreciated. 7. Sometimes the issue of changing depreciation rates arises when a taxpayer has identified an item of depreciable property incorrectly, for example by identifying the item as a separate item of depreciable property when it is, in fact, part of another item. Identifying an item of depreciable property correctly is an important preliminary step to finding the correct depreciation rate. The Commissioner has published some guidance on how to identify the relevant item of depreciable property in Interpretation Statement IS 10/01 “Residential Rental Properties— Depreciation of Items of Depreciable Property”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 4 (May 2010): 16, and in Interpretation Statement IS 12/03 “Income Tax – Deductibility of Repairs and Maintenance Expenditure – General Principles”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 7 (August 2012): 68. This QWBA does not provide guidance on how to identify the item of depreciable property correctly. 8. Where a taxpayer has established that they have incorrectly identified their item of depreciable property, this will also often mean that the incorrect depreciation rate has been used. A taxpayer using an incorrect depreciation rate is one of the circumstances considered in this QWBA. 3 Explanation One applicable rate 9. To depreciate an item of depreciable property, a taxpayer has to use a depreciation rate provided in the legislation or set by the Commissioner in a depreciation determination. 1 Some depreciation rates (for example for certain buildings, aircrafts or motor vehicles) are set out in the legislation (see ss EE 29, EE 31, EZ 13 and, EZ 14). However, most depreciation rates are set by the Commissioner by issuing a depreciation determination. There are three types of depreciation rates: economic rates, provisional rates and special rates. Economic rates are the most common depreciation rates and are often referred to as ‘general rates’. Provisional rates are often issued prior to an economic rate being issued and may be issued generally or for a particular taxpayer. The mechanism by which the Commissioner sets depreciation rates is found in subpart EE of the Act and the TAA 2 . Economic rates and provisional rates are listed in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates. Special rates are specific to an item(s) of depreciable property and are issued to a particular taxpayer. Special rates are not listed in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates. 10. Given the wide range of items of depreciable property, it is not administratively possible to set a specific rate for every single item. The Act allows the Commissioner to set the same depreciation rate for similar or the same kind of items (see ss EE 27(4)(c), EE 28(3)(c) and EE 30(3)(c) and ss 91AAF and 91AAG of the TAA). The Commissioner does this by issuing a determination that sets a depreciation rate for the kind of item described in a particular asset class in either an industry or asset category. Given this, some kinds of items are described in a general way. 11. There are no legislative constraints on how the Commissioner describes the “kind of item” of an asset class in an industry or asset category to which the determination relates. However, depreciation rates are based on the estimated useful life (EUL) (see s EE 63) of the item or kinds of items (unless it is fixed life intangible property, when it is based on the property’s legal life). An item’s EUL is a key element in deciding whether kinds of items are similar or the same and should be grouped under one description of a kind of item(s) with the same depreciation rate. 12. The depreciation rules require a taxpayer to use the depreciation rate that applies to their item of depreciable property. The Act contemplates only one depreciation rate applies to the item of depreciable property. Section EE 16(3) suggests this with the words “the annual rate ... that applies to the item”. Similarly, ss EE 27, EE 28 and EE 30 all refer to “setting the economic depreciation rate that applies to a kind of item of depreciable property” (or “to items of a kind of depreciable property” in s EE 30). 13. A question arises as to how to work out what depreciation rate applies to an item of depreciable property. To find the depreciation rate, taxpayers must identify their item and then find the item description that most accurately describes the taxpayer’s item of depreciable property. This is done by looking at the asset 1 The Act also allows most low value items to be depreciated as part of a pool using the pool method under ss EE 20 to EE 24. An item of depreciable property once it is added to a pool is then depreciated as part of the pool under the pool’s depreciation rate. 2 Economic rates are set under s 91AAF of the TAA. A provisional rate is a temporary depreciation rate set by the Commissioner where there is no existing economic rate that applies to an item of depreciable property (apart from a default rate). These rates are set under s 91AAG of the TAA. Special depreciation rates are applied for by specific taxpayers who are using an item of depreciable property in a ‘special’ way, resulting in the Commissioner setting a special depreciation rate for that item. These rates are also set under s 91AAG of the TAA. 4 class descriptions in the industry and asset categories in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates. The depreciation rate for the identified kind of item is the rate that then applies. This is sometimes described as the ‘most applicable rate’. Generally if there is an asset class description (other than a default asset class description) in the appropriate industry category that applies to the item of depreciable property, the depreciation rate for that asset class will be the applicable rate for the item of depreciable property and there is no need to look at the asset categories. 14. Often more than one asset class description may seem to fit an item of depreciable property - for example, the description in a default rate asset class 3 and the description in a more specific asset class may both describe the taxpayer’s item or the description in an asset class listed in an industry category and the description in an asset class listed in an asset category may both describe the taxpayer’s item. In this case the Commissioner’s view is that the depreciation rate for the item in the more specific asset class is the applicable rate. This is because the asset class description must be the description that most accurately describes the taxpayer’s item of depreciable property. The asset class description in a more specific asset class will generally be a more specific description and therefore more accurate than the default asset class description. Further, the asset class descriptions in the industry categories are generally more specific than the asset class descriptions in the asset categories. When determining the most accurate description for the item, the nature of the item and how the item is used by the taxpayer will be relevant considerations. 15. Depreciation is claimed on the basis of the “annual rate”. “Annual rate” is defined in s EE 61 to mean “the annual depreciation rate applying to an item of depreciable property that a person owns”. This means that determining the most applicable rate is an annual enquiry. In many cases this enquiry will be straightforward because the applicable rate for an item of depreciable property will not change from year to year. One way to assist with this annual enquiry would be to check new depreciation determinations issued by the Commissioner to see whether there are any new depreciation rates that apply to the taxpayer’s items of depreciable property. Depreciation determinations can be found here: http://www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/determinations/depreciation/ Changing the depreciation rate 16. The Act does not provide any general mechanism for changing depreciation rates. The Act only provides a legislative mechanism to change the depreciation rate a taxpayer uses for an item of depreciable property in very specific circumstances (for example, s EE 36, which is discussed below). 17. However, the Commissioner considers changing the depreciation rate for an item of depreciable property is required outside these prescribed situations but only where the depreciation rate does not apply, or no longer applies, to the item. There are two broad categories of circumstances where the depreciation rate used for an item of depreciable property must change. The first category is where the rate change is provided for in the legislation. These circumstances are:  There is a change in legislation that means a different depreciation rate applies to the item.  The taxpayer changes from using a special rate to using the economic or provisional rate that applies to their item. 3 A “default rate” is a rate for kinds of items of a very general description. It is the rate a taxpayer reverts to when no more specific option is provided. A “default rate” often has the term “default class” in the description in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates. 5 18. The second category is where the depreciation rate used is not, or is no longer, the one that applies to the item of depreciable property. This follows from the ‘one applicable rate’ principle that there is one depreciation rate that applies to an item of depreciable property and that rate needs to be the rate with the asset class description that most accurately describes the item of depreciable property. The Commissioner considers that the depreciation rate needs to change in the following circumstances:  The Commissioner sets a new depreciation rate that applies to the item of depreciable property.  The taxpayer has been using an incorrect depreciation rate.  The depreciation rate set is no longer applicable due to a change in circumstances. 19. All of the above circumstances are discussed further below. When does the new rate apply? 20. If it has been established that a taxpayer is required to change the depreciation rate they are using for an item of depreciable property, the question arises as to when the new rate will apply from. Depending on the circumstances that lead to the rate change, the change may be prospective or retrospective. 21. In most circumstances covered in this QWBA a change of asset class and depreciation rate will only be prospective, meaning that the taxpayer applies the new depreciation rate to the adjusted tax value of the item of depreciable property going forward. This is because the circumstances leading to the depreciation rate change are likely to occur prospectively or have prospective effect, such as the Commissioner issuing a new depreciation rate that applies to the item from a certain date. 22. Where a taxpayer has used an incorrect depreciation rate, if the requirements of s 113A (Correction of minor errors in subsequent returns) of the TAA are met, the taxpayer is able to correct the error in their next income tax return. If the requirements of s 113A are not met, the taxpayer can make a voluntary disclosure or apply separately to the Commissioner under s 113 of the TAA to change the depreciation rate retrospectively. Section 113(1) of the TAA provides: 113 Commissioner may at any time amend assessments (1) Subject to sections 89N and 113D, the Commissioner may from time to time, and at any time, amend an assessment as the Commissioner thinks necessary in order to ensure its correctness, notwithstanding that tax already assessed may have been paid. 23. Section 113(1) of the TAA provides the Commissioner with the discretion to amend assessments to ensure their correctness. Standard practice statement SPS 07/03 “Requests to amend assessments”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 5 (June 2007):8 4 sets out the current practice for the exercise of this discretion under s 113. 24. The following parts of this QWBA outline in more detail the different circumstances when a depreciation rate change for an item of depreciable property may arise. 4 This SPS is currently under review by the Commissioner. 6 There is a change in legislation that means a different depreciation rate applies to the item 25. Sometimes the depreciation rate for certain items of depreciable property is provided in the legislation rather than in a depreciation determination. Where legislative changes provide for such a statutory depreciation rate being introduced or altered, the taxpayer must change the depreciation rate they use if the new statutory depreciation rate applies to their item of depreciable property. In these circumstances, the change is clearly intended by Parliament and required by the legislation. Generally such legislative provisions will set out when the rate change applies from. 26. For example, ss EE 31, EZ 13 and EZ 14 have been amended to provide that buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more will have a depreciation rate of 0%. Until the 2011/12 income year, taxpayers could depreciate their building at a rate set by the Commissioner in the relevant depreciation determination (generally 2% per annum). The new 0% rate is a statutory rate and, with effect from the 2011/12 income year, it overrides the rates for asset classes of these buildings previously set by determination issued by the Commissioner. The taxpayer changes from using a special depreciation rate to using the economic or provisional depreciation rate 27. There are two situations when a taxpayer may change from using a special depreciation rate to using the economic or provisional rate that applies to their item. 28. The first situation is provided for in s EE 36. This section provides that a taxpayer may change from using a special rate that applies to their item of depreciable property to using the applicable economic or provisional rate. This is subject to s EE 36(2) which prevents a taxpayer from changing rates to defer deductions for an item’s depreciation loss. 29. The second situation is when the circumstances that applied when a special rate was issued change materially or no longer exist, such as the item is no longer being used in a special way. A taxpayer may then be required to change from using the special rate to using the economic or provisional rate that applies to the item of depreciable property. Under s 91AAI of the TAA, the Commissioner may revoke a special rate determination where the circumstances that applied when the special rate was issued subsequently change. The Commissioner may issue a new determination at a different special rate or issue no new determination. Section 91AAI(3) states that the taxpayer has to use the economic rate or an applicable provisional rate if the Commissioner revokes the special rate determination without issuing a new special rate. 30. The Commissioner notes that there may also be situations where the opposite may occur. That is, a taxpayer already using the applicable economic or provisional rate for their item of depreciable property changes to using a newly issued special rate. However, generally a special rate will apply from when an item of depreciable property starts being depreciated. The Commissioner sets a new depreciation rate that applies to the item of depreciable property 31. Sometimes the Commissioner sets a new depreciation rate for a kind of item(s) that more accurately describes the taxpayer’s item of property. As a result, the new depreciation rate is the rate that applies to the item of depreciable property. This may happen, for example, when the Commissioner sets a new provisional or economic rate for a more specific kind of item(s). The Commissioner considers 7 that the applicable depreciation rate for the particular item changes under these circumstances. 32. There are different reasons why the Commissioner may set a new depreciation rate. A taxpayer can apply for a special or provisional rate under s 91AAG of the TAA if certain requirements are met. 5 A taxpayer who applies for and is granted a special or provisional depreciation determination for their specific item of depreciable property is able to use the special or provisional rate set in this determination to depreciate their item from the time the determination is stated to apply. As mentioned above, generally a taxpayer will apply for a special or provisional rate before they start depreciating their item. This means that they will use the special or provisional rate the Commissioner has issued from when they start depreciating their item. 33. The Commissioner also has an on-going power to issue depreciation determinations setting new depreciation rates (see ss EE 27, EE 28, EE 30 and,, EZ 23, and s 91AAF of the TAA). Sometimes depreciation determinations state that they apply only to items acquired on or from a certain date. However, the Commissioner may issue an economic or provisional rate that applies to an item of depreciable property that the taxpayer may already have been depreciating using an existing depreciation rate. This situation may often arise where the taxpayer is using an existing default rate and the Commissioner subsequently issues a determination with a more specific asset class description and depreciation rate that applies to the taxpayer’s item of depreciable property. 34. As stated earlier, the applicable depreciation rate is the rate for the kind of item (i.e. asset class) that most accurately describes the taxpayer’s item of depreciable property. When the Commissioner sets an asset class and depreciation rate that more accurately describes a taxpayer’s item of depreciable property, it is consistent with the purpose of the depreciation regime that the taxpayer should use this more accurate asset class and depreciation rate. This is because the new asset class and associated depreciation rate is more likely to be based on a more accurate EUL for the taxpayer’s specific item of depreciable property. However, s 91AAF(3) of the TAA ensures that where the Commissioner sets a lower economic rate it cannot apply to an item that is already being depreciated using a higher applicable economic rate. This provision provides taxpayers protection from being required to change to the less favourable applicable depreciation rate. Example 1: 35. Johan owns a printing machine that uses integrated technology and consists of a screen printing base and a multiple-head inkjet print head he uses in his printing business. He uses the diminishing value rate of 16% for “Printing machines (screen)” in the industry category “Printing and photographic” to depreciate his printing machine. In May 2013, the Commissioner issues a general depreciation rate for “Printing machines (automated inkjet flatbed)” with an EUL of 10 years and a diminishing value rate of 20% applying from the 2013/2014 income year. This new asset class applies to Johan’s type of printer. 36. Both asset class descriptions: “Printing machines (screen)” and “Printing machines (automated inkjet flatbed)”, describe Johan’s printing machine. However, the description “Printing machines (automated inkjet flatbed)” more accurately describes Johan’s printing machine. From the 2013/2014 income year the new depreciation rate for “Printing machines (automated inkjet flatbed)” is 5 A special rate cannot be set for a building, an item of excluded depreciable property, or an item of special excluded depreciable property (see s EE 35(2)). 8 the applicable depreciation rate for Johan’s printing machine. Johan needs to use this depreciation rate to depreciate his printer from the 2014 income year. Example 2: 37. In the 2011 income year, Glamping Ltd, a tour operator, buys a yurt as a portable shelter for their glamping tours. The yurt is a circular tent with a waterproof poly- cotton canvas for the cover and a frame of cedar wood. The company depreciates the yurt using the straight-line rate of 30% for “Tents” in the industry category “Leisure”. In 2013, the Commissioner sets a general depreciation rate for “Yurts”, added to the "Leisure" industry category, with a straight-line rate of 17.5%. Glamping Ltd would like to know if the depreciation rate changes for their yurt. 38. Section 91AAF(3) of the TAA ensures that where the Commissioner sets a lower economic rate it cannot apply to an item that is already depreciated using a higher applicable economic rate. The Commissioner issued the determination setting the general economic rate to apply to “Yurts” which will apply for the 2013/14 and later income years. The depreciation rate does not change for Glamping Ltd’s yurt. If Glamping Ltd acquired any further yurts during or after the 2013/14 year, Glamping Ltd should use the new depreciation rate of 17.5% for those new yurts. The taxpayer has been using an incorrect depreciation rate 39. Sometimes a taxpayer has chosen an incorrect depreciation rate to depreciate their item. This could occur because the wrong rate has been selected in error or the item has been incorrectly identified. As set out above, in the Commissioner’s view the depreciation rate for the asset class description that most accurately describes the taxpayer’s item is the depreciation rate that applies to that item. If a taxpayer does not use the depreciation rate for the asset class that most accurately describes the taxpayer’s item of depreciable property, they are using an incorrect depreciation rate. 40. A taxpayer who has used an incorrect depreciation rate for their item of depreciable property needs to change to the correct applicable depreciation rate. Example 3: 41. Rose purchases a croissant machine for her French bakery. Like some of her other machines she depreciates the new croissant machine using a straight line rate of 8.5% for “Bakery machinery and equipment (default class)” in the “Bakeries” industry category. Rose has been depreciating the machine for three years when she discovers that there is an asset description “Croissant machines” with a straight-line rate of 10.5% in the “Bakeries” industry category in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates. Rose would like to know if she can change to depreciate her croissant machine at 10.5% for “Croissant machines”. 42. Rose has used an incorrect depreciation rate, because she has not used the depreciation rate for the asset class description that most accurately describes her croissant machine. Rose needs to change to the correct depreciation rate and depreciate her croissant machine under “Croissant machines” with a straight-line rate of 10.5%. Rose has calculated that the net tax effect of using the wrong depreciation rate for her croissant machine amounts to less than $500 each year for the three income years she has been claiming depreciation for the machine. Applying s 113A of the TAA, Rose corrects this minor error in her current return and adjusts the depreciation rate and her fixed asset schedule accordingly. 43. If the annual net tax effect of using the wrong depreciation rate had been over $500, then Rose could have made a s 113 request to the Commissioner to have 9 her previous year’s assessments corrected for the under-claimed depreciation amounts. In this situation, the Commissioner would exercise her s 113 discretion to correct the relevant assessments. Alternatively Rose could include this adjustment in any wider voluntary disclosure that she has made. Example 4: 44. Carl buys a motor vehicle that is used to transport goods for his business. He depreciates his vehicle using a straight-line rate of 13.5% for “Motor vehicles— class NA (for transporting light goods, gross vehicle mass up to 3.5 tonnes)”. In a later income year, he discovers that his vehicle in fact has a gross vehicle mass of more than 3.5 tonnes. There is the description for “Motor vehicles—class NB (for transporting medium goods, gross vehicle mass over 3.5 tonnes but not over 12 tonnes)” with a straight-line rate of 10.5% in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates. Carl now wants to know what he should do. 45. Carl has chosen a depreciation rate for his motor vehicle that does not apply and is incorrect. This is because the description “Motor vehicles—class NA (for transporting light goods, gross vehicle mass up to 3.5 tonnes)” does not accurately describe his motor vehicle with a gross vehicle mass of more than 3.5 tonnes. Carl needs to change to the correct applicable depreciation rate for “Motor vehicles—class NB (for transporting medium goods, gross vehicle mass over 3.5 tonnes but not over 12 tonnes)” with a straight line depreciation rate of 10.5%. Carl has calculated that the net tax effect of using the wrong depreciation rate for his motor vehicle amounts to more than $500 for each income year that he has been claiming depreciation for the motor vehicle. Therefore Carl is unable to apply s 113A of the TAA. 46. Carl makes a request to the Commissioner to exercise her discretion under s 113 of the TAA to amend previous assessments. This request by Carl is made in writing. Carl could also have made a voluntary disclosure. The request seeks to correct on an annual basis the net over-claimed depreciation amount resulting from Carl using the incorrect depreciation rate. The net over-claimed depreciation amount is the difference between the depreciation Carl has claimed using the wrong depreciation rate and the depreciation Carl should have claimed using the correct depreciation rate. The Commissioner considers this request applying her current practice set out in SPS 07/03 “Requests to amend assessments”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 5 (June 2007):8. In this situation the Commissioner has agreed to the retrospective change in rates and the assessments have been amended accordingly. Carl adjusts his depreciation schedule to take account of the effect of this change in rates. The depreciation rate is no longer the applicable rate due to a change in circumstances 47. A taxpayer may change the way they use an item of depreciable property or circumstances may change while an item is being depreciated. As previously outlined, depreciation is claimed on the basis of the annual rate, so that determining the applicable rate for an item of depreciable property is an annual enquiry. If circumstances do change, then the most applicable depreciation rate for the item may also change. Example 5: 48. ABC Constructions Ltd has equipment for its own use within the company, but it also has other equipment that is available for hire. It depreciates a forklift that is hired out short term using the rate for “Forklift trucks (8 tonnes and over used for short-term hire of 1 month or less only)” with a straight-line rate of 17.5%. The forklift will not be available to be hired in future income years, as it is going to be 10 used for the business on a construction project from the 2013/2014 income year onwards. 49. ABC Constructions Ltd must use the applicable depreciation rate for their forklift for each income year. From the 2013/2014 income year the forklift is not used for hire anymore and the depreciation rate that applies is therefore the rate for “Forklift trucks (8 tonnes and over)” with a straight-line rate of 10.5%. ABC Constructions Ltd needs to use this depreciation rate to depreciate the forklift from the 2013/2014 income year.

1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 15/04 INCOME TAX – WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE DISPOSAL OF LAND THAT IS PART OF AN UNDERTAKING OR SCHEME INVOLVING DEVELOPMENT OR DIVISION WILL NOT GIVE RISE TO INCOME, EVEN IF NO EXCLUSION APPLIES All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about ss CB 12 and CB 13. Question 1. If an undertaking or scheme involving development or division of land is carried on by or for a person and the undertaking or scheme:  was begun within 10 years of the person acquiring the land, and involves more than minor work (s CB 12); or  involves significant expenditure on the types of work specified in s CB 13, is it possible that the amount derived on the disposal of some of the land is not income, even if none of the statutory exclusions from s CB 12 or s CB 13 apply? Answer 2. Yes, it is possible that the disposal of land that is part of an undertaking or scheme involving development or division of land will not give rise to income under s CB 12 or s CB 13, even if none of the exclusions apply. 3. In many circumstances that are outside of the intended scope of ss CB 12 and CB 13 there will be an applicable exclusion. Therefore, in practice the need to satisfy the Commissioner that the provision should not apply, for the reasons discussed in this QWBA, may not arise. However it has been an area of uncertainty on which guidance has been sought, and arises from time to time. 4. If land is involved in an undertaking or scheme of development of land or division of land into lots, the amount derived on the disposal of the land might be income under s CB 12 or s CB 13 (the criteria of those provisions are set out below). There are exclusions 1 to those provisions that could be applicable. 5. But even if none of those exclusions apply (the situation we have been asked about), it is still possible that the disposal of some of the land will not give rise to income under s CB 12 or s CB 13. The Commissioner will accept that s CB 12 or s CB 13 does not apply to the disposal of any given part of the land if the taxpayer can provide satisfactory evidence that the undertaking or scheme was not carried on with a view to the disposal of that land. The Commissioner would expect to see evidence that there had been some other demonstrable plan in relation to the land in question. 6. The types of things that may be relevant in establishing that an undertaking or scheme was not carried on with a view to the disposal of the land in question include:  the details of the development or subdivision plans, resource consent applications etc;  any contracts or agreements entered into;  evidence as to the intended use of particular parts of the land; 1 These are: the residential exclusion (s CB 17), the business exclusion (s CB 20), the farm land exclusion (s CB 21) and the investment exclusion (s CB 23). 2  whether the taxpayer apportioned costs relating to the development or division work between land they had a view to disposal of and land they are claiming they did not;  what ultimately happened in respect of the land in question; and  the reason(s) for the ultimate disposal of the land in question. 7. It should be emphasised that if an undertaking or scheme meeting the criteria in s CB 12 or s CB 13 is carried on, it does not matter when the disposal of land occurs. The mere passage of time will not, without other supporting evidence, necessarily be sufficient to show that the undertaking or scheme was not carried on with a view to the disposal of the land in question. 8. It should also be noted that it is only necessary that an undertaking or scheme meeting the relevant criteria has been carried on, it does not need to have been carried out (ie, brought to fruition). If an undertaking or scheme meeting the relevant criteria was carried on but was subsequently abandoned, the ultimate disposal of the land will still be caught by the relevant provision unless an exclusion applies or the taxpayer can establish that the undertaking or scheme was not carried on with a view to disposal of the land in question. Division of land 9. In the case of an undertaking or scheme of division of land into lots, the undertaking or scheme necessarily involves the whole original block. If the undertaking or scheme was not carried on with a view to disposal of some of the land, the taxpayer would need to show that when the land in question is ultimately sold. Development of land without division 10. If there has been development work but no division work, it does not matter if part of the block of land was not itself physically subject to the development work. It is not possible to contend that only the part of the block that was physically subject to the development work was involved in the undertaking or scheme of development. If an undertaking or scheme involving development work on a block was carried on, all of the land is involved in the undertaking or scheme. Development and division of land 11. Similarly, where there has been an undertaking or scheme involving development work on some of a block of land, followed by the division off of part of the block, all of the original piece of land is regarded as involved in the undertaking or scheme. The undertaking or scheme may not have been carried on with a view to disposal of all of the land, but all of the land remains involved in the undertaking or scheme. In order to fall outside the relevant provision (presuming no exclusion applies) the taxpayer would need to show, at the time any particular part of the land is ultimately sold, that the undertaking or scheme was never carried on with a view to the disposal of that land. A subsequent undertaking or scheme 12. Of course, if an undertaking or scheme involving development or division of land was not carried on with a view to the disposal of some of the land, the owner could still potentially derive income under s CB 12 or s CB 13 in relation to that land. It may be that there was a subsequent undertaking or scheme meeting the criteria in s CB 12 or CB 13. Where that is the case, the amount derived on disposal of that land would be income, subject to any exclusion applying or the 3 taxpayer being able to satisfy the Commissioner that the subsequent undertaking or scheme was also not carried on with a view to disposal of the land in question. 13. On the other hand, it may be that land is involved in an undertaking or scheme meeting the criteria in s CB 12 or s CB 13 and then that land is subsequently involved in another undertaking or scheme involving development or division that is outside of the parameters of s CB 12 or s CB 13. This would not preclude the disposal of that land from giving rise to income. If land is involved in an undertaking or scheme of division that falls within either s CB 12 or s CB 13, it does not matter when the land is sold (as noted above) or if the land is subsequently developed or divided further. Qualification to IG0010 “Work of a minor nature” 14. This item qualifies IG0010 “Work of a minor nature” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 1 (February 2005) in one respect. IG0010 is regarded as incorrect in stating that when any of the lots resulting from a boundary adjustment are disposed of, any amount derived on the disposition will necessarily be income under s CB 12 2 . On this point, see further from \[95\]. Explanation 15. An amount is income of a person under s CB 12 if it is derived by them from disposing of land in circumstances where:  an undertaking or scheme (not necessarily in the nature of a business) is carried on by the person (or by someone for them),  the undertaking or scheme involves the development of the land or the division of the land into lots,  the development or division work is not minor, and  the undertaking or scheme was commenced within 10 years of the person acquiring the land. 16. An amount is income of a person under s CB 13 3 if it is derived by them from disposing of land in circumstances where:  an undertaking or scheme (not necessarily in the nature of a business) is carried on by the person (or by someone for them),  the undertaking or scheme involves the development of the land or the division of the land into lots, and  the development or division work involves significant expenditure on certain specified activities 4 . 17. In a situation where land has been divided, some of the land may be sold, while some is retained by the owner. The question we have been asked requires consideration of whether this retained land is effectively “tainted” by the division work, such that the amount derived on the eventual disposal of that land will be income if none of the exclusions apply. 18. In a situation where land has been developed but not divided, the issue is whether it is possible that the amount derived when the land is ultimately sold is not income, even if none of the exclusions apply. 2 Provided that the other requirements of s CB 12 are satisfied, and no exclusions are applicable. 3 Provided the amount is not income under any of ss CB 6 to CB 12 or s CB 14. 4 These are: channelling, contouring, drainage, earthworks, kerbing, levelling, roading, or any other amenity, service, or work customarily undertaken or provided in major projects involving the development of land for commercial, industrial, or residential purposes. 4 19. This has been a somewhat contentious issue over the years. On one hand, some have taken the view that if the criteria set out in the bullet points at \[15\] or \[16\] above have been satisfied, the disposal of all of the land, whenever that occurs, will be income unless one of the exclusions listed in s CB 12(2) or s CB 13(2) applies. On the other hand, some have taken the view that ss CB 12 and CB 13 are limited to disposals of land that was part of an undertaking or scheme involving development or division carried on with a view to the disposal of the land in question. 20. From a practical point of view, in many situations the issue will simply not arise, because one of the exclusions will be applicable. The exclusions from ss CB 12 and CB 13 are: the residential exclusions (s CB 17), the business exclusion (s CB 20), the farm land exclusion (s CB 21) and the investment exclusion (s CB 23). Those provisions are set out in the appendix at the end of this item, but their application is not discussed in this item. 21. In situations where none of the exclusions can be relied on, the Commissioner accepts that there may be circumstances where the disposal of any given piece of land is nonetheless not taxable under s CB 12 or s CB 13. Legislation 22. Sections CB 12 and CB 13 provide as follows: CB 12 Disposal: schemes for development or division begun within 10 years Income (1) An amount that a person derives from disposing of land is income of the person if the amount is derived in the following circumstances: (a) an undertaking or scheme, which is not necessarily in the nature of a business, is carried on; and (b) the undertaking or scheme involves the development of the land or the division of the land into lots; and (c) the person, or another person for them, carries on development or division work on or relating to the land; and (d) the development or division work is not minor; and (e) the undertaking or scheme was begun within 10 years of the date on which the person acquired the land. Exclusions (2) Subsection (1) is overridden by the exclusions for residential land in section CB 17, for business premises in section CB 20, for farm land in section CB 21, and for investment land in section CB 23. CB 13 Disposal: amount from major development or division and not already in income Income (1) An amount that a person derives from disposing of land is income of the person if— (a) the amount is not income under any of sections CB 6 to CB 12 and CB 14; and (b) the amount is derived in the following circumstances: (i) an undertaking or scheme, which is not necessarily in the nature of a business, is carried on; and (ii) the undertaking or scheme involves the development of the land or the division of the land into lots; and (iii) the person, or another person for them, carries on development or division work on or relating to the land; and (iv) the development or division work involves significant expenditure on channelling, contouring, drainage, earthworks, kerbing, levelling, roading, or any other amenity, service, or work customarily undertaken or provided 5 in major projects involving the development of land for commercial, industrial, or residential purposes. Exclusions (2) Subsection (1) is overridden by the exclusions for residential land in section CB 17, for business premises in section CB 20, for farm land in section CB 21, and for investment land in section CB 23. Relationship with section DB 27 (3) Section DB 27 (Amount from major development or division and not already in income) deals with a deduction for the value of the land. 23. Section CB 23B provides as follows: CB 23B Land partially sold or sold with other land Sections CB 6 to CB 23 apply to an amount derived from the disposal of land if the land is— (a) part of the land to which the relevant section applies: (b) the whole of the land to which the relevant section applies: (c) disposed of together with other land. Application of the legislation 24. To determine whether the proceeds of disposal of any particular piece of land are taxable because of an undertaking or scheme of development or division, it is necessary to consider whether the disposal occurs in the circumstances detailed in s CB 12 or s CB 13. In relation to the question we have been asked, that requires considering whether the disposal relates to an undertaking or scheme involving the development of the land or the division of the land into lots having been carried on (s CB 12(1)(a) and (b) and s CB 13(1)(b)(i) and (ii)). 25. This is the crucial requirement in terms of the question asked. This QWBA does not consider the other requirements of ss CB 12 and CB 13 – most notably whether development or division work is of a minor nature 5 (s CB 12(1)(d)) or involves significant expenditure on the activities specified in s CB 13(1)(b)(iv). 26. The following discussion considers what “land” is referred to in each part of the provisions, whether there has been an “undertaking or scheme” carried on, and what land is part of an undertaking or scheme involving development or division. The discussion then considers the circumstances in which it is considered that the disposal of land that was part of such an undertaking or scheme will not give rise to income under s CB 12 or s CB 13. “The land” 27. As can be seen at \[22\], “land” is referred to in the opening words of s CB 12 and also in paras (b), (c) and (e) of subs (1). Similarly, “land” is referred to in the opening words of s CB 13 and also in the subparas (ii) and (iii) of para (b). 28. To determine whether the amount derived on the disposition of a particular piece of land falls within the relevant provision, it is necessary to identify the “land” referred to in each part of the provision. 29. The opening words of ss CB 12 and CB 13 refer to an amount that a person derives from disposing of land. Logically, the land referred to here must be the land disposed of – the land the disposal of which may or may not trigger a tax liability. 30. On the face of it, the subsequent references to “the land” in ss CB 12 and CB 13 would appear also to be the land disposed of (as the phrase used is “the land” 5 On that, see IG0010 “Work of a minor nature” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 1 (February 2005) at 5. 6 which suggests “the land” previously referred to – ie, in the opening words of those provisions). 31. However, the Commissioner considers that those subsequent references to land should be read as referring to the land involved in the undertaking or scheme. This is supported by Lowe v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,006 (CA), and is consistent with the existence of s CB 23B 6 . 32. In applying s CB 12 or s CB 13, the land involved in an undertaking or scheme involving development or division must, therefore, be identified. Undertaking or scheme What is an undertaking or scheme? 33. In Vuleta v CIR \[1962\] NZLR 325 (SC), the Supreme Court considered the provision in the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 which included in assessable income (amongst other things) profits from the carrying on or carrying out of any “undertaking or scheme” entered into or devised for the purpose of making a profit 7 . Henry J accepted the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary meaning of the term “scheme”, being (at 329): a plan, design or programme of action, hence a plan of action devised in order to attain some end; a project, an enterprise. 34. This broad definition has been approved in a number of land subdivision cases, including Wellington v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,101 (HC) and O’Toole v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,045 (HC). 35. In Lowe v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,006 (CA), Richardson J noted that there is an element of vagueness and elasticity inherent in both the words “undertaking” and “scheme”, and in the composite expression, but considered that “scheme” connotes a plan or purpose which is coherent and has some unity of conception, and similarly an undertaking is a project or enterprise organised and directed to an end result. See also Smith v CIR (No 2) (1989) 11 NZTC 6,018 (CA). 36. Although an undertaking or scheme is a project, plan, programme of action or enterprise directed to an end result, that does not mean that the end result cannot be to do different things with different parts of the land. One can have devised an undertaking or scheme involving division of land in order to sell some of it and retain some of it for other purposes (Wellington). 37. Not a great deal is necessarily required for there to be an undertaking or scheme involving development or division, as noted by Richardson J in Lowe. And in Smith v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,045 (HC) Williamson J held that there could be an undertaking or scheme despite the fact no physical work had taken place and no contractual commitment had been entered into within the ten-year period. 38. Further, the details do not have to have been settled for there to be an undertaking or scheme capable of being carried out. Also, some details may be later modified without that making the original scheme a new scheme altogether (Cross v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,101 (CA)). When does an undertaking or scheme commence? 39. The time at which an undertaking or scheme is commenced is relevant to both ss CB 12 and CB 13. Section CB 12 will only apply if the undertaking or scheme was begun within 10 years of the date on which the person acquired the land. And the commencement date of an undertaking or scheme is relevant in the 6 Which recognises that the land disposed of in any given year may be only part of the land involved in the undertaking or scheme, to which the relevant section applies. 7 That part of the provision is now s CB 3. 7 context of s CB 13 because a deduction is allowed for the value of the land at that time (s DB 27). 40. The date of commencement is when the first step in carrying out the scheme takes place; when there is some act done that sets it in train (Cross v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,054 (HC), Cross (CA), Smith (No 2) (CA)). It is a question of fact in any given case as to whether the undertaking or scheme has moved beyond conception to having been put into operation. 41. There could be a variety of things that indicate that an undertaking or scheme has been commenced, for example applying for local authority consent, assent or direction to proceed being given to persons engaged to carry the work out in whole or in part, some physical activity on the land, entering into a contract or arrangement by which the undertaking or scheme is put into operation (Cross (HC), Cross (CA)). In Smith (No 2) (CA), it was held that the hearing of an application for planning approval by way of specified departure, which preceded any contract-letting or other steps, marked the commencement of the undertaking or scheme. In that case, Cooke P noted that it was possible that the making or notifying of a planning application could itself potentially be enough. 42. It is clear from the case law that there must be some overt act done for the purpose of implementing the undertaking or scheme. Having completed preparation of an undertaking or scheme does not necessarily lead to its immediate commencement; the undertaking or scheme may be put on hold, or the preparatory work may result in a decision not to proceed with the undertaking or scheme. For an undertaking or scheme to have been commenced there must have been some act done for the purpose of carrying it out (Cross (HC), Cross (CA), Smith (No 2) (CA)). 43. The fact that an undertaking or scheme may need to be modified (for example as a result of local authority requirements) or may even have to be abandoned, does not mean that it was not commenced (Cross (HC)). Neither s CB 12 nor s CB 13 require that the undertaking or scheme is carried out (ie, completed), just that it is carried on. If an undertaking or scheme meeting the criteria in s CB 12 or s CB 13 was commenced, the fact that it may subsequently be modified, or abandoned altogether, will not mean that the ultimate disposal will not be taxable under the relevant provision. What land is involved in an undertaking or scheme of development or division? 44. With an undertaking or scheme involving development, it may be that only part of a particular block of land is developed. However, the Commissioner considers that if there has been development work but no division work, it does not matter if part of the block of land was not itself physically subject to the development work. The Commissioner does not consider it correct to regard only the part of the block that was physically subject to the development work as being involved in the undertaking or scheme of development. 45. The Commissioner considers that “the land” referred to in paras (b), (c) and (e) of s CB 12(1) 8 is the physical land within the title (or titles) that are involved in the undertaking or scheme. If any of the land comprised in a particular title is developed, there has been development of “the land” involved in the undertaking or scheme. This accords with the fact that “land” is defined in s YA 1 (relevantly) as including any estate or interest in land. Estates and interests in land relate to physical land comprised in titles. There is nothing in the definition of “land” in s YA 1 that suggests “land” might mean something less than an estate or interest in a particular title, or, in the case of the provisions concerning physical work on 8 And similarly in subparas (ii) and (iii) of s CB 13(1)(b). 8 land (such as ss CB 12 and CB 13), anything less than all of the physical land comprised in a particular title. 46. In the Commissioner’s view, i f an undertaking or scheme involving development work on a block was carried on, all of the land is involved in the undertaking or scheme. If s CB 12 or s CB 13 applies, the entire amount derived on the disposal of the block will be income. 47. Similarly, where there has been an undertaking or scheme involving development work on some of a block of land, followed by the division off of that part of the block, all of the original piece of land is regarded as involved in the undertaking or scheme. The undertaking or scheme may not have been carried on with a view to disposal of all of the land, but all of the land remains involved in the undertaking or scheme. In order to fall outside the relevant provision (presuming no exclusion applies) the taxpayer would need to show, at the time any particular part of the land is ultimately sold, that the undertaking or scheme was never carried on with a view to the disposal of that land (see further from \[53\]). 48. In the case of an undertaking or scheme of division of land into lots, the undertaking or scheme necessarily involves the whole original block. There is no question that there is a project or plan to divide the whole piece of land into lots. 49. An undertaking or scheme of development or division may involve land in more than one block (or certificate of title). 50. In terms of considering whether the development or division work is more than minor (s CB 12(1)(d)) or involves significant expenditure on the relevant activities (s CB 13(1)(b)(iv)), all of the development or division work that is part of the undertaking or scheme is considered. When will an amount derived on the disposal of land involved in an undertaking or scheme of development or division not be income? Does an exclusion apply? 51. As noted above, there are a number of exclusions from ss CB 12 and CB 13. These are: two residential exclusions (ss CB 17(1) and CB 17(2)), a business exclusion (s CB 20), a farm land exclusion (s CB 21), and an investment exclusion (s CB 23). If any of these exclusions apply, the amount derived on the disposal of the land in question will not be income under s CB 12 or s CB 13. This item does not consider the application of the exclusions. The situation we have been asked about is where none of the exclusions apply. Can the taxpayer show that the undertaking or scheme was not carried on with a view to disposal of the land in question? 52. Even if none of the exclusions apply, the Commissioner accepts that there may be circumstances where the amount derived on the disposal of land involved in an undertaking or scheme of development or division within the parameters of s CB 12(a) – (e) or s CB 13(b)(i) – (iv) does not give rise to income under s CB 12 or s CB 13. 53. For an amount derived from the disposal of land to be income under s CB 12 or s CB 13 the amount must be derived in the circumstances detailed in the relevant provision. That is, the land must be disposed of in the circumstances of an undertaking or scheme (meeting the relevant criteria) having been carried on. The Commissioner accepts that if a taxpayer can satisfactorily show that the undertaking or scheme was not carried on with a view to the disposal of some of the land, the amount derived on the ultimate disposal of that land is not derived in the circumstances of the undertaking or scheme having been carried on. In 9 that situation there is no correlation between what the undertaking or scheme was about, so far as that land is concerned, and the disposal of that land. 54. This does not mean that any given disposal needs to in fact occur as part of the undertaking or scheme (though in many cases there will be no question that it has). As noted above, the undertaking or scheme meeting the relevant criteria only needs to have been carried on, it does not need to have been carried out (ie, brought to fruition). As noted by Hardie Boys J in Cross (HC), the fact that an undertaking or scheme may be abandoned does not mean that it was not commenced. Neither s CB 12 nor s CB 13 require that the undertaking or scheme is carried out (ie, completed). This was perhaps even clearer on the original wording of the predecessor provision to ss CB 12 and CB 13, which referred to undertakings or schemes that had been “carried on or carried out” (emphasis added). The removal of the words “or carried out” does not lead to a different conclusion – those words were not required, as any undertaking or scheme that was carried out would necessarily have also been carried on. 55. If an undertaking or scheme meeting the relevant criteria was carried on (whether or not it was carried through to completion), the disposal (whenever it occurs) of any part of the land will prima facie be caught by the relevant provision. It is only where an exclusion applies or where the taxpayer can establish to the Commissioner’s satisfaction that the undertaking or scheme was not carried on with a view to disposal of the part of the land in question that the amount derived will be income under the provision. 56. Of course, if an undertaking or scheme involving development or division of land was not carried on with a view to the disposal of some of the land, the owner could still potentially derive income under s CB 12 or s CB 13 in relation to that land. It may be that there was a subsequent undertaking or scheme meeting the criteria in s CB 12 or CB 13. Where that is the case, the amount derived on disposal of that land would be income (subject to any exclusion applying or the taxpayer being able to satisfy the Commissioner that the subsequent undertaking or scheme was also not carried on with a view to disposal of the land in question). 57. On the other hand, it may be that land is involved in an undertaking or scheme meeting the criteria in s CB 12 or s CB 13 and then subsequently involved in another undertaking or scheme involving development or division that is outside of the parameters of s CB 12 or s CB 13. This would not preclude the disposal of that land from giving rise to income. If land is involved in an undertaking or scheme of division that falls within either s CB 12 or s CB 13, it does not matter when the land is sold (as noted above) or if the land is subsequently developed or divided further. 58. The Commissioner considers that this approach is consistent with what can be ascertained about the purpose behind ss CB 12 and CB 13 (discussed from \[60\]). The Commissioner also considers that overall the case law supports this reading of the provisions – in particular Church v CIR (1992) 14 NZTC 9,196 (HC), Cross (HC) and O’Toole, and to a lesser extent Paul Stephens Construction Limited v CIR (1990) 12 NZTC 7,192 (HC). The relevant case law is discussed from \[68\]. 59. The Commissioner does not consider this approach to be in conflict with s CB 23B. As noted above, s CB 23B provides that ss CB 6 to CB 23 will apply to an amount derived on the disposal of land if the land is all or part of the land to which the relevant section applies, or disposed of together with other land (see \[23\]). Section CB 23B ensures that the land that falls within the scope of the relevant taxing provision cannot escape taxation because it is divided and sold in parts, or sold together with other land. If a taxpayer can show that an undertaking or scheme within the parameters of s CB 12 or CB 13 was not carried on with a view to disposal of some of the land, the Commissioner accepts that s CB 12 or CB 13 10 will not apply to the disposal of that land. That is, that part of the land will not be within the scope of the relevant taxing provision. As such, when that particular land is sold, s CB 23B will not apply to bring the disposal to tax under the operative provision because the land cannot be regarded as “part of the land to which the relevant section applies”. It was part of the land involved in the undertaking or scheme, but not part of the land to which the relevant section applies. The purpose of the provisions 60. It is acknowledged that different conclusions may be drawn about the intended scope of ss CB 12 and CB 13. On balance, the Commissioner considers the better view is that the provisions were not intended to operate to the extent that an undertaking or scheme involving development or division was not carried on with a view to disposal. The following discussion briefly discusses what the history to the provisions, and the legislative context, suggests about their intended purpose, and why the Commissioner thinks the above is the better view. 61. The provisions were first introduced in 1973 as s 88AA(1)(d) and (e) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. There were originally two exclusions from these provisions – one is now the residential exclusion in s CB 17(2), and the other is now the farm land exclusion in s CB 21. Section 88AA(1)(d) and (e) were introduced to give effect to the October 1967 recommendation of the Taxation Review Committee (the Ross Committee) that the legislation ought to catch undertakings or schemes aimed at making a profit but entered into or devised after the purchase of the land. 9 There is no indication from the Parliamentary debates that it was intended that the new provision would go further than the Ross Committee recommendation and extend to all land that was involved in an undertaking or scheme involving development or division, whether or not the undertaking or scheme was essentially carried on with disposal in mind. 62. This apparent intention is supported by an Inland Revenue information release 10 published at the time the provisions were introduced. The information release indicates that it was not intended that the provision would catch land that had been the subject of development or division if the work was part of an undertaking or scheme that was carried on for the taxpayer’s own use – such as for a home or investment (it is noted that there was no investment exclusion at the time). 63. After the decision of Anzamco Ltd (in liq) v CIR (1983) 6 NZTC 61,522 (HC), additional exclusions from what is now s CB 12 were introduced. These were later extended to s CB 13. Though not contemporaneous with the introduction of what are now ss CB 12 and CB 13, Inland Revenue’s commentary on the new exclusions at the time the legislation enacting them was introduced made it clear that Inland Revenue understood that the original intention was that what is now s CB 12 would only apply where land was developed or divided as part of an undertaking or scheme for the purpose of the subsequent disposal of the land 11 . 64. It could be argued that the original exclusions from what are now ss CB 12 and CB 13 were intended to be exhaustive. However, the original exclusions (concerning the division of land that the person used themselves either as residential property or as farm land) appear to have simply been aimed at clarifying the situation in relation to scenarios raised during the Parliamentary debates on the Bill that introduced the provisions. Those exclusions were not in 9 See: Hansard (14 September 1973) 386 NZPD 3653 and 3680 – 3681. 10 “Taxation of profits or gains from sales of land – Section 9 of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1973 – Section 88AA of Principal Act” (November 1973). 11 See “Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1983” (Public Information Bulletin No 126, May 1984). 11 the Bill when it was originally introduced, but were added subsequently by way of a supplementary order paper. 65. The scenarios covered by the exclusions suggest that Parliament was not concerned with division of land owned and used by a taxpayer for farming or residential purposes, in order to maximise the amount derived on disposal (provided that in the case of farm land it would still be used for farming purposes). Nor does it appear from the scope of the original exclusions that Parliament was concerned with development or division for some reason other than disposal. The scope of the exclusions arguably indicates that the intention was to tax profits of people specifically attempting to make a profit out of the need for urban expansion, though not necessarily in the business of development or division. This is consistent with comments made in Lowe about the history of the provisions. 66. It has been suggested that the post-Anzamco legislative response shows that Inland Revenue conceded that the court applied what is now s CB 12 correctly. The Commissioner does not consider that this is the only inference that can be drawn from the post-Anzamco legislative response. Rather, it is considered that the addition of further exclusions was aimed at ensuring such a situation would not arise again. 67. While it is not entirely free from doubt, for the above reasons, the Commissioner considers that the apparent purpose behind ss CB 12 and CB 13 is consistent with an undertaking or scheme only giving rise to income under the provisions if it was carried on with a view to disposal of the land in question. The case law 68. As noted above, the Commissioner also considers that overall the case law supports this construction of ss CB 12 and CB 13. There have been a number of cases that have considered ss CB 12 and CB 13, but they suggest different approaches to the issue at hand. Many of the cases discussed do not directly touch on the issue, however there may nonetheless be some inferences that can be drawn from the facts of those cases and from some of the comments made by the judges in those cases. On balance, the Commissioner considers that case law lends greater support to the view adopted. The following discussion summarises what the Commissioner considers can be taken from the relevant cases, including those which support interpreting ss CB 12 and CB 13 as applying more broadly. Church 69. In Church, the High Court had to consider whether the amounts derived on the sales of two pieces of land were income under a predecessor to s CB 12. The taxpayer had purchased a block of land in August 1961. There were a number of subdivisions of the land over the years, some within the 10-year period after the taxpayer’s acquisition of the land. The question for consideration was whether the taxpayer had formulated a scheme, before August 1971, that the disputed sales in 1983 and 1984 were part of. 70. Temm J considered that the sales in question were not part of a continuing scheme that commenced within the relevant 10-year period. The approach of the court in Church indicates that the fact that land was involved in an undertaking or scheme of development or division falling within s CB 12 (or s CB 13) does not necessarily mean that amounts derived on the sale of all of the land will be income. The amounts derived on the sales of land at issue in Church were not income because those pieces of land were not sold as part of any undertaking or scheme involving development or division commenced in the relevant timeframe (though there clearly were such undertakings or schemes). 12 71. If any more than minor subdivision of land within 10 years of acquisition had the effect of making the ultimate sales of all of the land taxable, regardless of whether the taxpayer had a view to the disposal of all of the land at the time the undertaking or scheme involving development or division was carried on, there would have been no question that the sales of the land in question in this case would have been taxed. The fact that the court held the sales not to be taxed under what is now s CB 12, but rather enquired as to whether the sales were part of a scheme formulated within the relevant 10-year period, indicates that the existence of a scheme of division meeting the criteria of the provision will not necessarily result in the ultimate sales of all of the land that was within the original block giving rise to income. The court’s approach suggests that there needs to be some connection between the scheme and the sale of the land. Cross 72. In Cross ( HC), the taxpayers had subdivided half of a block of land over a number of years in accordance with five successive subdivisional plans. This involved significant expenditure on work of the type specified in what is now s CB 13. The taxpayers had argued in the High Court that there were three separate undertakings or schemes, and so therefore three separate commencement dates for valuation purposes 12 . The commencement date of an undertaking or scheme is relevant in the context of s CB 13 because a deduction is allowed for the value of the land at that time (s DB 27). However, Hardie Boys J of the High Court held that on the evidence there was one scheme which was planned and implemented progressively. 73. The implication that may be drawn from Cross (HC), and the possibility (implicitly accepted by the court) that there had been three separate schemes, is that it is necessary to identify which scheme the disposal of any particular piece of land relates to. This would have been relevant for valuation purposes in Cross, had there been held to be more than one scheme, but is consistent with the approach of the court in Church that the disposal must relate to an undertaking or scheme falling within the relevant provision. 74. Had there been held to be three schemes in this case, it appears the court would have accepted that the deduction for the value of the land allowed in relation to the second and third schemes would be the value of the land at the date of commencement of each of those schemes. If the existence of an earlier scheme involving the division of part of a block of land was considered sufficient to bring all of the land that was part of the original block within the scope of the provision, the deduction could only be for the value of the land as at the date the original scheme was commenced. The value of the land at the time a subsequent division scheme was commenced would be irrelevant, because it would be the earlier scheme that gave rise to the tax liability on the eventual disposal of all of the land. The fact that the court apparently accepted the possibility that there may have been multiple schemes (rather than one scheme implemented in stages), and the attendant proposition that this would mean different commencement dates for valuation purposes, suggests that the existence of a scheme meeting the criteria set out at \[15\] (s CB 12) and \[16\] (s CB 13) will not necessarily give rise to a tax liability for all of the land when it is eventually sold. O’Toole 75. A few years after acquiring some farm land, the taxpayers in O’Toole had the land surveyed in order to establish its true boundaries, because they had struck some difficulties with the owner of neighbouring land. The surveyor they engaged advised them that he thought the Town and Country Planning Act was going to change, and as such he suggested that the taxpayers have the whole farm 12 This argument was not pursued in the Court of Appeal. 13 subdivided into blocks at that time. The taxpayers agreed with this suggestion, as they had decided to sell off some land in a few blocks to pay off their mortgage to the vendor, which was due in 1975. 76. In considering whether there was an undertaking or scheme for the purposes of what is now s CB 12, Davison CJ in the High Court commented that: The objectors entered into a project or enterprise directed towards the subdivision of their land into lots with the view to sale of those lots at a profit. The scheme existed in the plan or purpose to sell off the lots not reserved by the objectors for their own use in order to realise the maximum available profit. \[Emphasis added\] 77. Davison CJ had earlier cited the broad dictionary definition of “scheme” referred to by Henry J in Vuleta with apparent approval. The Commissioner therefore considers that Davison CJ was not suggesting that an undertaking or scheme can be confined to part of a block of land. Rather, the Commissioner considers it is implicit in the judgment that Davison CJ considered that though all of the land was involved in the scheme of division, the provision was not concerned with that part of the land that the taxpayers retained for their own purposes, but rather just with the land that the taxpayers had a view to disposing of. Paul Stephens Construction 78. In Paul Stephens Construction, the taxpayer had two adjacent sections (lots 66 and 67), which were deemed to have been acquired at different times. The sections were subdivided within 10 years of the deemed acquisition of lot 67, but more than 10 years after the deemed acquisition of lot 66. One of the resulting lots (lot 2) comprised some land which had formerly been in lot 66 and some which had formerly been in lot 67. 79. It was held that the taxpayer’s assessable income from the sale of lot 2 was limited to the profit relating to the part of that lot which had formerly been in lot 67. 80. Paul Stephens Construction is less relevant to the issue at hand, as there was no question about the undertaking or scheme of division in this case being carried on with a view to the disposal of all of the land. However it does provide some support for the view that the disposal must relate to the undertaking or scheme. Paul Stephens Construction indicates that the s CB 12 (or s CB 13) criteria must be considered in relation to each piece of land sold, as not all of the land will necessarily meet the criteria. The Commissioner considers that one of the criteria of ss CB 12 and CB 13 is that the amount must be derived in the circumstances of an undertaking or scheme having been carried on. As noted above, the Commissioner accepts that if a taxpayer can satisfactorily show that the undertaking or scheme was not carried on with a view to the disposal of some of the land, the amount derived on the ultimate disposal of that land is not derived in the circumstances of the undertaking or scheme having been carried on. Anzamco 81. On the other hand, Anzamco supports the view that for the purposes of ss CB 12 and CB 13 the undertaking or scheme does not need to involve anything other than development or division (ie, it is irrelevant whether the undertaking or scheme was carried on with a view to the disposal of the land). 82. In Anzamco, the taxpayer company developed land over a number of years as a holiday resort or “ranch”, for the use of its shareholders. The land was always intended to be kept by the shareholders and their descendants. However, after the death of one of the major shareholders, it transpired that none of his family, nor the families of the other major shareholders, were interested in taking over 14 the ranch. In the end, the taxpayer decided to sell the land, some 13 years after its purchase. 83. Barker J held that what is now s CB 12 applied, and the proceeds of the sale were income. Barker J did not read the provision as requiring that the eventual sale of the land be related to the undertaking or scheme. The approach taken suggests that if ever an undertaking or scheme meeting the relevant criteria had been carried on in relation to land, the profits or gains on any subsequent sale would be assessable income, and what was in mind when the undertaking or scheme was carried on is irrelevant. 84. As discussed above, additional exclusions were introduced after Anzamco to directly reverse the effect of this decision. Case J37 85. Similarly, Case J37 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,219 supports the view that it is irrelevant whether the undertaking or scheme was carried on with a view to retaining rather than disposing of some of the land. 86. The finding in Case J37 that what is now s CB 12 applied to the sale of one of the lots created by the subdivision (lot 5) is consistent with the view that disposal, or having a view to potential future disposal, does not need to be part of the undertaking or scheme. Although the other four lots created in the subdivision in this case were to be sold, that was not the position in relation to lot 5. Moore DJ did note that the situation in relation to lot 5 was “somewhat equivocal”, as it was the “residual lot”, but he nonetheless concluded that the proceeds derived on its sale fell within what is now s CB 12, even though unlike the other four lots it was not created with future disposal in mind. Wellington 87. Wellington may likewise be read as supporting the view that it is irrelevant whether the undertaking or scheme was carried on with a view to retaining rather than disposing of some of the land. 88. Ongley J seemed to accept that the taxpayers had set aside the part of the land that became lots 6, 7 and 8 for their own residential purposes. Ongley J commented that the proceeds from the sales of lots 7 and 8 would fall within what is now s CB 12 unless the residential exclusion applied – which he held was the case. This may be seem as indicating planning to retain rather than dispose of land does not preclude s CB 12 from applying; that the only way to escape taxation under the provision is by way of an exclusion. However, it is noted that there were various plans prepared before the subdivision in this case, and it is unclear why the taxpayers would have divided the land they resided on into three lots if they did not have a view to the sale of some or all of those lots. As it was, there was an exclusion available to the taxpayers, and in the circumstances of the case it is perhaps understandable that Ongley J considered the exclusion to be the only way in which the sales of the lots at issue would not be taxable. Lowe 89. Lowe is sometimes referred to as suggesting that “residual” or “retained” land will be “tainted” by an undertaking or scheme of subdivision. The Commissioner does not consider that Lowe is relevant to the issue. 90. In Lowe, the entirety of the block in question was subdivided and sold. The taxpayer made a technical interpretive argument in relation to the wording of what is now s CB 12. The argument was that if a lot sold in any given year was not adjacent to another lot also sold that year, and no development work had been carried out on the lot sold, it could not be “that land” (as the reference in 15 the provision then was). In other words, it was submitted that there could not be an undertaking or scheme of development or division involving the land sold if the particular lot had not been itself developed or divided into lots, or was not adjacent to another part of the original block that was also sold in the year (so they could be said to have been divided from each other). The court did not accept that argument. 91. There was no dispute on the facts in Lowe that all of the land was involved in and sold as part of the undertaking or scheme of division. In his judgment, McMullin J stated that “\[i\]t is sufficient for the purposes of the section if the developmental or surveying work was done on the total subdivisional area of which any lot or lots sold formed part”. This statement has sometimes been taken as indicating that the sale of any land which was part of a lot that was divided will fall within s CB 12 (the criteria being met) unless an exclusion applies. That is, that the eventual sale of all of the land in the original block will be taxed, even if the sale of some of that land was not contemplated when the undertaking or scheme of division was carried on. The Commissioner does not consider that the above statement should be read as suggesting that all of the land is necessarily “tainted” by the undertaking or scheme, and the ultimate sales will therefore all be subject to tax. McMullin J’s comment relates specifically to the technical “that land” argument that the taxpayer made. It should not be taken more broadly. What approach do the cases suggest? 92. On one hand, Church, Cross (HC) and O’Toole may provide implicit support for the view that ss CB 12 and CB 13 should be read as not extending to amounts derived on the disposal of land if it can be shown that the undertaking or scheme was not carried on with a view to the disposal of the land in question. Paul Stephens Construction could also be regarded as providing some implicit support for this view. On the other hand, Anzamco, Case J37 and Wellington support the view that if there has been an undertaking or scheme involving development or division, the disposal of all of the land will give rise to tax under s CB 12 or s CB 13 13 unless an exclusion applies (ie, it is irrelevant whether it can be shown that the taxpayer did not have the disposal of some of the land in mind when they were carrying on the undertaking or scheme). 93. All of the relevant cases are High Court or Taxation Review Authority, and the inferences that may be drawn from them are conflicting. However, it is noted that Anzamco was decided in 1983 and Wellington in 1981, both before O’Toole (1985), Cross (HC) (1985), Paul Stephens Construction (1990) and Church (1992), and Case J37 was decided in 1987, before Cross (HC), Paul Stephens Construction and Church. It is also noted, as discussed above, that the result in Anzamco was regarded as being contrary to the original legislative intent, and so additional exclusions were introduced after that decision, to directly reverse its effect. In the circumstances, the Commissioner considers it appropriate to take direction from the legislative intent, and that it is preferable to follow the authorities which take an approach that is consistent with that – most of which were decided after Anzamco in any event. 94. In the Commissioner’s view, the approach that the courts in the preferred authorities have taken, either expressly or implicitly, is that ss CB 12 and CB 13 will not apply to the disposal of any given piece of land if it can be established that an undertaking or scheme that the land was involved in was not carried on with a view to the disposal of that land. It is considered that the wording of the provisions can legitimately bear such a construction, and that it is consistent with the purpose of the legislation. 13 Presuming the other criteria are satisfied. 16 Boundary adjustments 95. IG0010 “Work of a minor nature” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 1 (February 2005) at 5 states that a boundary adjustment will amount to a “division into lots” for the purposes of what is now s CB 12. IG0010 then states (at 10): ... It is therefore the Commissioner’s view that, if a lot of land owned by a person is altered by transferring a part of the lot to, and including it in the title for other adjoining land owned by, another person there is a division into lots of the first-mentioned lot. ... if the boundaries between adjoining lots of land owned by the same person are altered, there is a division into lots of the land comprised of those adjoining lots; and if any of the resulting lots is sold or otherwise disposed of any amount derived on the sale or other disposition will be gross income under section CD 1(2)(f) if the other requirements of section CD 1(2)(f) are satisfied. \[Emphasis added\] 96. Although a boundary adjustment will amount to a division into lots, whether amounts derived on the disposal of any of the resulting lots will be income under s CB 12 depends on whether the undertaking or scheme involving the boundary adjustment 14 was carried on with a view to the disposal of the land in question. IG0010 no longer represents the Commissioner’s position to the extent that it suggests otherwise. Examples 97. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law set out above. Example 1 Diagram 1 98. In 2002, Sam and Fiona bought a four acre block of land in Gisborne, where they planned to build their dream home and keep some chickens and perhaps a couple of cows. In 2003, part-way through the build, before they had moved in, they decided they did not wish to maintain such a large piece of land. Accordingly, between 2003 and 2004 they subdivided off and sold three one-acre sections (lots “B”, “C” and “D” in Diagram 1). This subdivision involved work of more than a minor nature. In late 2004, Fiona’s mother became terminally ill and Sam and Fiona and their 3 children moved to Wellington to care for her (Sam was able to get a contract there). Sam and Fiona envisaged that they would move back to Gisborne in a relatively short time. Fiona’s mother passed away in 2006. By this stage, the family were well settled in Wellington, and enjoying life there, so they decided to stay. They sold the remaining one-acre section (lot “A”) on which they had built the house. 99. The proceeds from the sale of lots “B”, “C” and “D” would be income under s CB 12. There was an undertaking or scheme involving the division of the entire original block into lots, and there is no suggestion that Sam and Fiona did not carry on the undertaking or scheme with a view to the sale of lots “B”, “C” and “D”. The undertaking or scheme was begun within 10 years of acquisition of the land, and the division work was not minor. Neither of the residential exclusions 14 Or some other undertaking or scheme of development or division. B A C D 17 apply. The exclusion in s CB 17(1) does not apply because the division was not for use in and for the purposes of Sam, Fiona or their family residing on the land. The exclusion in s CB 17(2) does not apply because the area of the original block of land exceeded 4,500 square metres, and in addition it was not occupied by Sam, Fiona or their family as residential land before it was divided. 100. The result would be the same irrespective of the number of lots divided off for sale (ie, even if the land to be sold was divided off in one lot, rather than three), provided that the other requirements of s CB 12 were met – including that the division work was more than minor. 101. The proceeds from the sale of the one-acre section with the house on it (lot “A”) would not be income under s CB 12. Although there was an undertaking or scheme involving the division of the entire original block into lots, the undertaking or scheme was not carried on with a view to the sale of lot “A”. Rather, lot “A” was subsequently sold for reasons unrelated to the undertaking or scheme of division. Example 2 102. For the purposes of this example, it is presumed that there are no applicable exclusions. In particular, it is presumed that the farm land exclusion in s CB 21 would not apply because none of the land sold was capable of being worked as an economic unit as a farming or agricultural business. Diagram 2 Diagram 3 103. Mr Webster had owned lot “A” in Diagram 2, situated on the outskirts of Dunedin, since 1972, and had farmed that land from the time he acquired it. In 1997, Mr Webster purchased an adjoining block (lot “B” in Diagram 2) when it became available, as he intended to extend his farming activities in partnership with his B A 10 15 14 13 12 11 4 1 2 3 5 6 8 9 7 17 18 16 19 20 21 22 23 24 B2 A2 25 26 18 son upon his son’s return from the UK in a few years. However, by 2001 Mr Webster’s son had decided to remain in the UK, rather than return to New Zealand. 104. In light of sharply appreciating property values, and given that he was unable to farm all of the land on his own, Mr Webster decided to subdivide some of the land for residential sections (lots 1 – 26 in Diagram 3) and retain an area of what had been lot “A” (lot “A2” in Diagram 3) which he would continue farming, and an area of what had been lot “B” (lot “B2” in Diagram 3), which was never considered suitable for residential subdivision due to subsidence risks. Although not suitable for residential subdivision, lot “B2” would be able to be farmed, and Mr Webster intended to do so. The combined area of lots “A2” and “B2” was similar to that of original lot “A”, which Mr Webster had been able to farm on his own. 105. From 2002 to 2005 the land to be subdivided (lots 1 – 26) was subdivided and most of it (lots 1 – 22) was sold as residential sections. However, over the course of the subdivision it became clear that, in addition to lot “B2”, which had always been known to have substantial subsidence risks, four of the newly formed residential lots (lots 23 to 26) also had subsidence issues. Accordingly, lots 23 to 26 were not sold as residential sections, as originally planned. 106. In 2010, Mr Webster found a purchaser for lots 23 to 26 who wished to use the land for alpaca farming. However, the purchaser was only keen to buy lots 23 to 26 if he could also buy the adjoining lot “B2”, and he made an attractive offer to do so. Given the appeal of the offer, and Mr Webster’s declining health (and therefore inability to continue farming such a large area on his own for much longer), Mr Webster agreed to sell lot “B2” together with lots 23 to 26. 107. The land comprising the roads in the subdivision was transferred to the Council for nil consideration, as part of the consent process for the subdivision. 108. The proceeds from the sale of the residential sections situated on the land purchased in 1997 (lot “B” in Diagram 2) (lots 6 – 10 and 17 – 22) would be income under s CB 12. There was an undertaking or scheme involving the division of the entire original lots “A” and “B” into lots, and this division work was not minor. There is no suggestion that the undertaking or scheme was not carried on with a view to the sale of lots 6 – 10 and 17 – 22, and the undertaking or scheme was begun within 10 years of Mr Webster’s acquisition of the land contained in those lots. 109. The proceeds from the sale of the residential sections situated on the land Mr Webster had owned since 1972 (lot “A” in Diagram 2) (lots 1 – 5 and 11 – 16) would not be income under s CB 12. Although the undertaking or scheme involved the division of the entire original lots “A” and “B” into lots, it was not begun within 10 years of Mr Webster’s acquisition of the land in the original lot “A”. The proceeds from the sale of those sections (lots 1 – 5 and 11 – 16), however, may be income under s CB 13 if the work on, or relating to, all of the original lots “A” and “B” involved significant expenditure of the type referred to in s CB 13(1)(b)(iv). 110. The proceeds on the sale of lot “B2” would not be income under s CB 12. There was an undertaking or scheme involving the division of the entire original lots “A” and “B” into lots, and this division work was not minor. However, the undertaking or scheme was not carried on with a view to the sale of lot “B2”. Lot “B2” was subsequently sold for reasons unrelated to the undertaking or scheme of division. It was known from the planning stages of the undertaking or scheme of division that lot “B2” was not suitable for residential subdivision, and Mr Webster had intended to keep and farm that section. He ended up selling it some 19 five years after the sale of the residential sections, due to his declining health, and the fact that the purchaser interested in buying lots 23 to 26 was only interested if he could also buy lot “B2”, and he made an attractive offer to do so. 111. The proceeds from the sale of lots 23 and 24 would be income under s CB 12. There was an undertaking or scheme involving the division of the entire original lots “A” and “B” into lots, and this division work was not minor. The undertaking or scheme was begun within 10 years of acquisition of the land contained in lots 23 and 24. There is no suggestion that the undertaking or scheme was not carried on with a view to the sale of lots 23 and 24. It is irrelevant that those lots could not ultimately be sold as residential sections as originally anticipated, and that it took some years for Mr Webster to find a purchaser for those sections. 112. The proceeds from the sale of lots 25 and 26 would not be income under s CB 12. Although the undertaking or scheme involved the division of the entire original lots “A” and “B” into lots, it was not begun within 10 years of Mr Webster’s acquisition of the land in the original lot “A”. However, the proceeds from the sale of those sections (lots 25 and 26) may be income under s CB 13 if the work on, or relating to, all of the original lots “A” and “B” involved significant expenditure of the type referred to in s CB 13(1)(b)(iv). 113. There was no amount derived on the disposition of the land comprising the roads and so there is no income to tax under either s CB 12 or s CB 13 for that land.

QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 15/05 INCOME TAX – INSURANCE – TERM LIFE INSURANCE POLICY TAKEN OUT BY EMPLOYEE WITH EMPLOYER PAYING THE PREMIUMS ON EMPLOYEE’S BEHALF All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about ss CA 1, CE 1 (1), CE 5, CX 4, DA 1, DA 2, RD 2, RD 3, RD 5(2) and the definition of “salary or wages” in s YA 1. Question 1. What is the income tax treatment of a term life insurance policy that is: • taken out by an employee ( the employee is the policy holder), and • the premiums are paid by the employer on the employee’s behalf? Answer 2. The employer will generally be entitled to a deduction for the premiums paid. 3. The amount of the premiums will be treated as salary or wages and, therefore, subject to PAYE. 4. Lump sums paid out under a term life insurance policy will not be taxable income of the employee (or the employee’s estate). Explanation 5. Inland Revenue recently undertook a review of all Public Information Bulletins (see http://www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/pib-review/). During that review two items on the income tax treatment of insurance in an employment context were identified as being out of date. The two items are “Staff insurance schemes” (Public Information Bulletin No 70 (December 1972): 11) and “Life and accident insurance policies” (Public Information Bulletin No 106 (July 1980): 2). Those PIBs covered a number of different scenarios. We intend to replace the PIBs with a series of Questions We’ve Been Asked (QWBAs) c overing common scenarios. 6. This QWBA considers the situation where an employee takes out a term life insurance policy and the employer pays the premiums. It does not cover the situation where an employer takes out a life insurance policy for the employee’s benefit. 7. Term life insurance pays out the sum insured (as a lump sum) if the life insured dies during the term of the policy. Deductibility of premiums 8. A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent that it is incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable (or excluded) income (s DA 1). Section DA 2 sets out some limitations on deductibility. For example, expenditure that is capital in nature, or expenditure incurred in deriving exempt income, is not deductible (s DA 2 (1) and (3)). 9. In most cases, s alary and wage costs will be deductible because they will satisfy the nexus test in s DA 1 and none of the general limitations will apply. The payment of a life insurance premium for an employee is a business cost just like salary or wages. Therefore, provided the costs of an employee’s salary or wages are deductible, the costs of paying the insurance premiums will be too. Amount of premium paid taxable in the hands of the employee 10. An employee’s income includes “expenditure on account” of that employee (s CE 1(1)(b)). Expenditure on account of an employee means a payment made by an employer relating to expenditure incurred by an employee (or to be incurred by an employee) (s CE 5 (1)). This is subject to certain exceptions (in s CE 5(3)), none of which are relevant here. In particular, the exclusion in s CE 5(3)(a) will not apply as the expenditure would not be deductible to the employee in the absence of the employment limitation (being a payment made to secure a capital benefit). The exclusions in s CE 5(3)(f)–(i) are not relevant as they only apply when the employer takes out the insurance policy. 11. In the situation covered by this QWBA, the employee has a legal obligation to the insurance company to pay the insurance premiums. Therefore, the amount of the insurance premiums has been incurred by the employee. The employer is paying the premiums to the insurance company. Therefore, the payment of the insurance premiums is expenditure on account of the employee and is the employee’s income. 12. A payment of expenditure on account of an employee is part of the employee’s “salary or wages” (s RD 5(2)). A payment of salary or wages is a “PAYE income payment” (s RD 3). Therefore, the PAYE rules apply and the amounts are subject to PAYE. The amount of the premiums needs to be grossed up before PAYE is calculated. That is, the amount of the premium paid is the amount net of tax. 13. As the payment of the premium is assessable income to the employee, the fringe benefit tax rules will not apply (s CX 4). 14. There are also potential other implications of having the gross amounts of the premiums included in an employee’s salary or wages. For example, there are various other circumstances where obligations, eligibility, or entitlements may be calculated based on an employee’s salary or wages (for example Kiwisaver and Working for Families Tax Credits). Income tax treatment of proceeds 15. The proceeds received by an employee (or their estate) under a term life insurance policy are not income. An amount is income if it comes within a provision of Part C of the Act (s CA 1(1)). There are no specific provisions that tax payments under term life insurance policies. 16. An amount is also income if it is income under ordinary concepts (s CA 1(2)). A lump sum payment under a life insurance policy is not income under ordinary concepts. Example 17. The following example i s included to assist in explaining the application of the law. 18. Sally takes out a term life insurance policy with XYZ Insurance Ltd (XYZ). The sum insured is payable to Sally’s family in the event of her death. Sally’s employer, Flamingo Plumbing Ltd (FPL), pays the premiums to XYZ on Sally’s behalf. FPL and Sally want to know the income tax implications of this. 19. FPL is allowed a deduction for the amounts of premium paid to XYZ. The amounts of premium paid will be treated as part of Sally’s salary or wages. These amounts are, therefore, subject to PAYE. Any lump sum paid out under the policy to Sally (or her estate) will not be subject to income tax.

Term (or temporary) life insurance pays out the sum insured (as a lump sum) if the life insured dies during the term of the policy. Deductibility of premiums 9. A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent that it is incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable (or excluded) income (s DA 1). Section DA 2 sets out some limitations on deductibility. For example, expenditure that is capital in nature, or expenditure incurred in deriving exempt income, is not deductible (s DA 2 (1) and (3)). 10. In most cases, salary and wage costs will be deductible because they will satisfy the nexus test in s DA 1 and none of the general limitations will apply. The payment of a life insurance premium for the benefit of an employee (or their family) is a business cost just like the employee’s salary or wages. Therefore, provided the costs of an employee’s salary or wages are deductible, the costs of paying the insurance premiums will be too. When amount of premium subject to PAYE 11. An employee’s income includes “expenditure on account” of that employee (s CE 1(1)(b)), as defined in s CE 5. Section CE 5(2) expressly includes premiums paid by an employer who takes out certain life insurance policies for the benefit of an employee of their family members: CE 5 Meaning of expenditure on account of an employee ... Inclusion (2) Expenditure on account of an employee includes a premium that an employer pays on a life insurance policy taken out for the benefit of the employee, or their spouse, civil union partner, de facto partner, or their child. This subsection is overridden by subsection (3)(f) to (i). 12. Section CE 5(3)(f) –(i) exclude premiums under certain policies from being expenditure on account of an employee under s CE 5(2). The potentially relevant exclusions are: CE 5 Meaning of expenditure on account of an employee ... Exclusions (3) Expenditure on account of an employee does not include— ... (f) a premium that an employer pays on a life insurance policy taken out for the benefit of the employee, or their spouse, civil union partner, de facto partner, or their child, if— (i) the premium cannot be refunded to, or converted to cash by, the employee or an associated person; and (ii) the only benefits that are payable under the policy are those payable on the death of the employee, or their spouse, civil union partner, de facto partner, or their child, or those payable because of accident, disease, or sickness of the employee, or their spouse, civil union partner, de facto partner, or their child: (g) a premium that an employer that is a close company pays on a life insurance policy taken out for the benefit of the employee, or their spouse, civil union partner, de facto partner, or their child, to the extent to which the expenditure is treated as a dividend under subpart CD (Income from equity): (h) a premium that an employer pays on a life insurance policy taken out for the benefit of the employee, or their spouse, civil union partner, de facto partner, or their child, if the policy is, or is included in, a superannuation category 1 scheme, a superannuation category 2 scheme, or a superannuation category 3 scheme: (i) a premium that an employer pays on a life insurance policy taken out for the benefit of the employee, or their spouse, civil union partner, de facto partner, or their child, if the policy is held by or for the trustees of a superannuation category 3 scheme: ... 13. Paragraph (g) applies where a close company (being the employer) pays a premium on a life insurance policy to the extent that it is treated as a dividend under subpart CD. The treatment of these policies is not considered in this item. Similarly, paragraphs (h) and (i) apply to life insurances policies that are, or are included in, or are held by or for the trustees in, certain superannuation schemes. This item does not consider the treatment of these policies. 14. Paragraph (f) excludes from “expenditure on account of an employee” premiums on life insurance policies where: • the premium cannot be refunded to, or converted to cash by, the employee or an associated person; and • the only benefits payable are those payable on the death of the employee (or relevant family member), or those payable because of accident, disease, or sickness of the employee (or relevant family member). 15. In the case of a term life policy taken out by an employer, an employee (or associate) will have no ability to have the premium refunded or converted to cash. Further, the only insurance benefit payable under this term life policy is a benefit payable on death. Consequently, para (f) will apply to exclude the premiums from being “expenditure on account of an employee”. 16. As the payment of the premium by the employer is not expenditure on account of an employee and is not assessable income of the employee, it is necessary to consider whether FBT applies (s CX 4). When amount of premium subject to FBT 17. Under s CX 2, a “ fringe benefit” is a benefit that is provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment and comes within one of ss CX 6, CX 9, CX 10, or CX 12–CX 16, or is an unclassified benefit under s CX 37. Some benefits are also excluded from being fringe benefits by specific provisions in subpart CX . None of those exclusions are relevant here. 18. It is the provision of the policy rather than any payment under the policy that is the relevant “benefit” for FBT purposes. The provision of a life insurance policy is an economic benefit to an employee as they received cover under the policy without the need to pay for it themselves. 19. Section CX 16 specifically includes certain life insurance policies as fringe benefits. It applies when an employer pays a “specified insurance premium”. The potentially relevant definition of “specified insurance premium” is set out in s CX 16(4): CX 16 Contributions to life or health insurance ... Life insurance (4) The first kind of policy referred to in subsection (3) is a policy of insurance on the life of the employee or their spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner, or on their joint lives, or on the life of their child, to which all the following apply: (a) for policies other than whole of life policies, the minimum term is— (i) 10 years; or (ii) 5 years, for a policy whose maturity date is no earlier than the date on which a life assured reaches 60 years of age; and (b) the only benefits payable earlier than 10 years from the start of the policy or its maturity date, whichever is earlier, are— (i) benefits payable for the death of a life assured; or (ii) additional benefits payable for an accident to a life assured or disease or sickness of a life assured; and (c) the policy— (i) provides for a payment on the death of a life assured of a benefit that is not a return of premiums, is substantially capital, and is not materially less than the total benefit payable under the policy otherwise than for death; or (ii) is a policy on the life of a person who, because of ill health or physical disability, is unable to effect a policy of the kind described in subparagraph (i) at ordinary rates; or (iii) is a deferred life assurance policy on the life of a child. 20. If a term life insurance policy meets the requirements of s CX 16(4) it will be subject to FBT under s CX 16(1). However, many term life policies will not meet the requirements of s CX 16. Group insurance policies, for example, will often not meet the minimum term requirements set out in s CX 16(4)(a). 21. If a term life policy does not meet the requirements of s CX 16, it will be an unclassified benefit under s CX 37. Section CX 37 applies to benefits that an employer provides to an employee in connection with their employment that are not covered or excluded by a more specific provision. Section CX 16 applies to “specified insurance premiums”. When the predecessor to s CX 16 was enacted, there were different rates of FBT for different types of benefits. Relevantly, specified insurance premiums were subject to FBT at a lower rate than other benefits. Therefore, historically, specified insurance premiums were subject to FBT under a predecessor to s CX 16 while other insurance premiums were subject to FBT under a predecessor to s CX 37. The FBT rules have maintained this distinction, although, there are now few differences between applying s CX 16 and s CX 37. 22. There are no provisions in subpart CX that would exclude a term life insurance policy from being subject to FBT. Therefore, a term life insurance policy will be subject to FBT either under s CX 16 or CX 37. 23. Where an employer provides a fringe benefit to a person associated with an employee, s GB 32 treats the benefit as if it were provided by the employer to the employee. This is subject to the shareholder-employee exemption in s GB 32(2) and the look-through company exemption in s GB 32(2B). Therefore, premiums paid on term life insurance policies taken out by an employer for the benefit of an employee’s spouse, civil union partner, de facto partner or child will also be subject to FBT. Operational matters 24. It is possible that some employers may have been incorrectly applying s CX 16 rather than s CX 37 to term life insurance policies that they have provided for employees. 25. If employers have previously returned FBT on term life insurance policies under s CX 16 rather than s CX 37, the Commissioner will not be seeking to amend those previous FBT returns. However, employers must use the correct provision for any FBT returns filed for the period beginning 1 April 2015 onwards. 26. Any applications by taxpayers to have their FBT returns amended under s 113 will be considered by the Commissioner on a case by case basis. Income tax treatment of proceeds 27. The proceeds received by an employee (or their estate) under a term life insurance policy are not income. An amount is income if it comes within a provision of Part C of the Act (s CA 1(1)). There are no specific provisions that tax payments under term life insurance policies. 28. An amount is also income if it is income under ordinary concepts (s CA 1(2)). A lump sum payment under a life insurance policy is not income under ordinary concepts. Example 29. The following example i s included to assist in explaining the application of the law. 30. Red Herring Fishing Ltd (RHF) takes out a term life insurance policy for one of its employees, Jared Stone. The policy is for a term of two years. The only benefit payable under the policy is if death occurs during the policy term. In such a case, the sum insured is paid to the employee’s estate. RHF pays the premiums, which are non-refundable. RHF and Jared want to know the income tax implications of this arrangement. 31. RHF is allowed a deduction for the amounts of premium paid. The amounts of premium paid are not subject to PAYE. Also, they are not subject to s CX 16(4). However, they are “unclassified benefits” and, therefore, subject to FBT under s CX 37. Any lump sum paid out under the policy will not be subject to income tax.

1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 15/07 TAX ADMINISTRATION ACT 1994 – MEANING OF “DUE AND PAYABLE” UNDER SECTION 91E(4)(d)(i) Legislative references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about s 91E(4)(d)(i). Question 1. We have been asked when a tax, duty or levy will be considered to be “due and payable” under s 91E(4)(d)(i). Answer 2. A tax, duty or levy (tax type) becomes due and payable on the due date for payment of the relevant tax type and tax period. 3. Therefore, under s 91E(4)(d)(i) the Commissioner may not make a private ruling on a matter, unless the application is received before the due date for payment of the relevant tax type for the tax period to which the matter relates. For income tax generally, this is the due date for terminal tax payments for an income year (and does not include any provisional tax). For other types of tax (such as GST, PAYE, RWT and NRWT) this is the due date for payment of tax for the relevant period in respect of which the Commissioner has been asked to rule. Explanation 4. The Commissioner’s ability to make private rulings is provided in s 91E. Section 91E(4) sets out when the Commissioner may not make a private ruling. Relevantly, s 91E(4)(d)(i) provides: (4) The Commissioner may not make a private ruling if— ... (d) the matter on which the ruling is sought— (i) concerns a tax (excluding provisional tax), duty, or levy that is due and payable, unless the application is received before the tax (excluding provisional tax), duty, or levy is due and payable; or ... 5. Relevantly, the Commissioner may not make a private ruling if the matter on which the ruling is sought concerns a tax type that is due and payable (unless the application is received before the relevant tax type becomes due and payable). 6. The taxation laws in respect of which binding rulings may be made are contained in s 91C. For the purposes of s 91E(4)(d)(i), the matter on which a private ruling is sought must concern a tax type imposed by a taxation law included in s 91C. The ability to rule under s 91E(4)(d)(i) must be considered in respect of the relevant tax type and for the relevant tax period on which the Commissioner has been asked to rule. The question that arises is what “due and payable” means, as this term is not defined in the tax legislation. 7. The Commissioner notes that s 91E(4)(d)(i) specifically excludes provisional tax. Any due dates for payment of any provisional tax are not taken into account when determining whether any income tax is due and payable. 8. The term “tax payable” is defined in s 120C, for the purposes of Part 7 - Interest, as meaning: 2 At any time, means the amount of tax payable in respect of a tax liability by that time, determined in accordance with the tax laws; and includes an amount of tax that must be withheld or deducted under a tax law and paid to the Commissioner. 9. However, the conjunction between “due” and “payable” in s 91E(4)(d)(i) indicates that not only must the particular tax type be payable, it must also be due to be paid. Generally, there is a period of time between when a tax becomes payable and when it must be paid. This allows taxpayers time to calculate the amount and prepare the relevant tax return. 10. The term “due date” is defined in s 3(1). Unless the context otherwise requires, “due date” means: due date means the last day on which a taxpayer is able— (a) to pay tax; or (b) to provide a tax return; or (c) to provide a tax form; or (d) to do any other thing under a tax law,— before being liable to pay a penalty or (in the case of paragraph (a)) interest under Part 7: 11. The “due date” is the last day on which a taxpayer is able to pay tax, provide a tax return or tax form, or do any other thing under a tax law before being liable for a penalty or interest under Part 7. 12. For the purposes of s 91E(4)(d)(i), a matter will concern a tax type that is “due and payable” on the due date for payment of that tax type for the relevant period in respect of which the Commissioner has been asked to rule. 13. However, there is no requirement that an actual amount of tax is payable or quantified before s 91E(4)(d)(i) will apply. The Commissioner considers it sufficient that the relevant due date for payment of a particular tax type (for a tax period) has passed, regardless of whether an amount of tax is actually payable. The relevant question is whether, if any tax was payable in respect of a particular tax type and period on which the Commissioner has been asked to rule, the relevant due date for payment of that tax type for that tax period has passed. What this means is that, where there is the potential that a tax liability could exist in respect of the matter on which a ruling is sought, the Commissioner is not required to first determine whether there is, in fact, a tax liability or how much it would be. The question of whether the Commissioner is precluded from ruling under s 91E(4)(d)(i) must be resolved at the beginning of the rulings process before considering the relevant tax issues. 14. In addition, s 91E(4)(f) precludes the Commissioner from making a private ruling if an assessment has already been made. The Commissioner considers that s 91E(4)(d)(i) operates to extend this rule to include situations where a taxpayer has not filed a tax return and/or an assessment has not been made by the relevant due date for payment of the tax type concerned. Therefore, whether or not an assessment has been made, as long as the relevant due date for payment of the particular tax type for the relevant period has passed, the Commissioner may not issue a private ruling. 15. The Commissioner’s inability to make a private ruling in such a situation is aligned with the purpose of the binding rulings regime. Section 91A states: Binding Rulings 91A Purpose of this Part The purpose of this Part is to— (a) provide taxpayers with certainty about the way the Commissioner will apply taxation laws; and 3 (b) help them to meet their obligations under those laws,— by enabling the Commissioner to issue rulings that will bind the Commissioner on the application of those laws. The Part also recognises the importance of collecting the taxes imposed by Parliament and the need for full and accurate disclosure by taxpayers who seek to obtain binding rulings. 16. The binding rulings regime enables taxpayers to obtain certainty about how the Commissioner will apply tax laws and helps taxpayers comply with their tax obligations. However, by the relevant due date, a taxpayer will already have been required to file their tax return and make an assessment on that tax type for that period. 17. Once a self-assessment has been made regarding a tax type and for a relevant period, the disputes resolution process is available to the taxpayer should there be any disagreement with that assessment. There is a clear legislative policy that the binding rulings regime should not overlap with the disputes resolution process. The answer to this question we’ve been asked is consistent with the purpose of the binding rulings regime and the disputes resolution process. Conclusion 18. Section 91E(4)(d)(i) applies where the tax type that the matter concerns is due and payable for the relevant period. A tax will be due and payable on the due date for payment of that tax type and tax period (excluding, in the case of income tax, any provisional tax payments). Consequently, unless the application is received before that due date (whether or not a tax liability actually exists), the Commissioner may not issue a private ruling on that matter. Examples 19. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. Example 1: Income Tax 20. Company A has a standard 31 March balance date and is linked to a tax agent. Company A’s terminal tax date is 7 April. Company A is required to pay provisional tax. 21. On 31 October Company A applies for a private ruling on the deductibility of an amount of expenditure incurred in the previous tax year. Company A’s tax return is not due until the following 31 March (so s 91E(4)(f) does not apply). Further, the relevant due date for payment of Company A’s terminal tax is 7 April of that following year. Because the ruling application is received by the Commissioner before Company A’s terminal tax date for income tax, s 91E(4)(d)(i) will not apply. Any provisional tax liabilities are not relevant for these purposes (as they are excluded by s 91E(4)(d)(i)). Example 2: Income Tax 22. Individual X decides to apply for a private ruling on whether an amount received two years ago from the sale of a property was of a capital or revenue nature. Individual X did not have a tax agent at that time and did not file a tax return (so the exclusion in s 91E(4)(f) does not apply). Individual X submits that the amount is a capital receipt, and so considers that no amount is due and payable. However, the Commissioner will not make a ruling in this situation because there is the potential for a tax liability to exist that was due and payable before the application was received. 4 Example 3: Goods and Services Tax 23. Company B is registered for GST and applies for a private ruling on whether a supply that occurred in the taxable period ending 30 September was zero rated. The due date for payment is 28 October. 24. The Commissioner receives the application on 15 October, at which point Company B has not yet filed its GST return and made its assessment. As the application is received before the due date for payment (and before an assessment has been made), the Commissioner is able to make a private ruling. Example 4: Resident Withholding Tax 25. Company C withholds less than $500 per month of RWT on interest paid and so is eligible to pay the RWT withheld to the Commissioner in two instalments for the tax year. The instalments are due by 20 October and 20 April the following year. 26. Company C applies for a private ruling on various matters, including the RWT withheld from interest during the first instalment period of 1 April to 30 September. The Commissioner receives the application on 12 October. As this is before the due date of 20 October, the Commissioner is able to make a private ruling on the RWT withheld. 27. If the application was received on 21 October, the Commissioner would not be able to make a private ruling in respect of the RWT for the first instalment period, but could make a private ruling in respect of the second instalment period.

QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 15/08 INCOME TAX – TAX TREATMENT OF ALLOWANCES PAID TO CHAINSAW OPERATORS All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about ss CE 1 and CW 17. This item replaces the items “Allowances for Chain Saw Operators” (Public Information Bulletin No 89, January 1977) and “Chainsaw Reimbursing Allowances” (Public Information Bulletin No 175, July 1988). They were identified as being out of date and needing to be replaced during a review of Public Information Bulletins and Tax Information Bulletins published before 1996. For more information about the review, see “Review of Public Information Bulletins” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011), at 116. Question 1. Can an employer pay a tax-free allowance to an employee for using a chainsaw in their work? Answer 2. Yes, but only to the extent that the allowance is a reimbursing allowance for expenses the employee incurs or is likely to incur in using their own or their employer’s chainsaw for work. Any amount paid to the employee over the reimbursing allowance is taxable to the employee as employment income and subject to PAYE. Explanation What is an allowance? 3. An allowance is a payment of an agreed amount by an employer to an employee. It is paid either on a regular basis (such as daily or weekly) or when certain events happen. It is taxable to the employee as employment income under s CE 1(1)(a) unless an exemption applies. 4. There are two main types of allowances, namely benefit allowances and reimbursing allowances. Benefit allowances are taxable to the employee as employment income under s CE 1(1)(a) and subject to PAYE. However, reimbursing allowances may be exempt from income tax under the general exemption in s CW 17. What is a reimbursing allowance? 5. A reimbursing allowance is an allowance paid by an employer to an employee for operating expenses that an employee incurs or is likely to incur in connection with their employment. 6. A reimbursing allowance is not an exact reimbursement of expenditure. Operating expenses are expenses that the employee would be allowed a deduction for if the employment limitation did not exist (s CW 17(2)). Under s CW 17(2B) the expenditure will be treated as incurred in connection with an employee’s employment if it is a necessary expense incurred in doing the job from which they earn income. 7. For a chainsaw reimbursing allowance to be paid tax-free to an employee under s CW 17(2), the employee must incur, in connection with their employment, operating expenses on a chainsaw: • owned and operated by the employee in their work; or • owned by the employer and operated by the employee in their work. The Commissioner acknowledges that it is unlikely that an employee will incur operating expenses on their employer’s chainsaw in practice. Where the employee does not incur operating expenses on their employer’s chainsaw, they cannot receive a chainsaw reimbursing allowance tax-free. What is a benefit allowance? 8. A benefit allowance is an allowance paid by an employer to compensate an employee for the conditions of their service, such as using a dangerous piece of equipment or working in a dangerous or dirty environment or in a remote location. Unlike a reimbursing allowance, a benefit allowance is taxable to the employee as employment income under s CE 1(1)(a) and subject to PAYE. 9. If the allowance paid is a mixture of a reimbursing allowance and a benefit allowance, then only that part of the total allowance that is a reimbursing allowance can be paid tax-free. What types of expenses can a chainsaw reimbursing allowance cover? 10. A chainsaw reimbursing allowance can cover operating expenses such as interest, insurance, repairs and maintenance costs (including labour and parts), bars and consumables (such as chains, petrol, two-stroke oil and chain oil). 11. In setting the allowance amount, the employer can estimate the total amount of expenditure an employee is likely to incur in using their chainsaw at work. Section CW 17(3) allows employers to make a “reasonable estimate” of the amount of expenditure likely to be incurred by an employee or a group of employees. 12. A reasonable estimate is one that has some basis. For example, the estimate might be based on actual historical data, industry standard information or employee survey information. Employers must retain sufficient information about how the estimate was calculated to substantiate the allowance amount. Employers should review their estimates periodically to ensure they remain “reasonable”. Can an amount for depreciation be paid as part of a chainsaw reimbursing allowance? 13. An employee who buys their own chainsaw cannot be reimbursed tax-free for the purchase price of the chainsaw because the expenditure is of a capital nature. However, under s CW 17(4), a chainsaw reimbursing allowance can include an amount for the depreciation of the chainsaw where the employee owns the chainsaw. The depreciation amount included in a chainsaw reimbursing allowance is not meant to be an exact reimbursement of the cost of the chainsaw. It is supposed to be a reasonable estimate of the depreciation loss likely to be suffered by an employee from using their chainsaw at work. Employers can therefore factor into the chainsaw reimbursing allowance paid to their employees an estimated amount representing the depreciation loss likely to be suffered by the employees using their own chainsaws in their employer’s business. This estimated amount should be based on the depreciation rates for chainsaws set by the Commissioner. 14. The depreciation rate for chainsaws of professional loggers (such as cross- cutters) is 100%. This means that the full cost of the chainsaw can be written off as depreciation and factored into the amount of the chainsaw reimbursing allowance for professional loggers annually. 15. The Commissioner understands that the forestry industry is far more mechanised today than in the past. The industry is increasingly using mechanised harvesters, static de-limbers and the like. This means that the use of chainsaws has become less prevalent, and the number of professional loggers has decreased as a result. The depreciation rate for chainsaws of forestry workers other than professional loggers, as well as of arborists and other employees using their chainsaws for work, is 67% (for both the straight line and diminishing value calculations). This means that a proportion (up to 67%) of the cost of the chainsaw can annually be factored into the chainsaw reimbursing allowance paid to such workers to compensate for the depreciation of the chainsaw. 16. An amount for the depreciation of a chainsaw can be included in the chainsaw reimbursing allowance because depreciation is an operating charge that employees are likely to incur in connection with their employment in using their chainsaws at work. To the extent that any amount paid for depreciation of a chainsaw exceeds the amount allowed under the Act, it cannot be paid tax-free under s CW 17. This is because it will be reimbursing expenditure of a capital nature. It is therefore subject to the capital limitation and would not be deductible to the employee. What happens when the employee only uses the chainsaw some of the time or not at all? 17. For a chainsaw reimbursing allowance to be tax-free under s CW 17, it must be a reasonable estimate of the operating costs an employee is likely to incur in using their chainsaw for work. For professional loggers, such as cross-cutters, those costs are likely to be greater than for other employees who use their chainsaws at work, such as arborists. These other employees might also incur some operating costs, although these costs are expected to be less than professional loggers’ costs. In the case of those employees who are required to bring a chainsaw to work but do not use it regularly (or do not use it at all) , such as machine operators, the level of costs that can be legitimately reimbursed with a chainsaw reimbursing allowance will be much less. This is because, apart from depreciation, these employees are likely to incur minimal expenses (if any) in using their chainsaw at work. 18. If all these employees (eg, cross-cutter, arborist, machine operator) are paid the same level of chainsaw reimbursing allowance, the whole allowance may be tax- free to the cross-cutter, but will be split between a reimbursing allowance (tax- free) and a benefit allowance (taxable to the employee as employment income) for the others. 19. Any chainsaw allowance paid to an employee who neither owns nor uses a chainsaw at work at all is taxable to the employee as employment income and subject to PAYE. This is because the exemption in s CW 17 does not apply. What about other reimbursing allowances paid to forestry workers? 20. The principles discussed above relating to the tax treatment of allowances also apply to other allowances that might be paid in the forestry sector. Examples 21. The following examples are included to assist in explaining how the law applies. Example 1 – Chainsaw reimbursing allowance 22. Ian is employed by Big Trees Logging Ltd as a cross-cutter. Ian provides his own chainsaw that he uses for work purposes on a daily basis. Big Trees Logging Ltd pays Ian a daily chainsaw allowance for the use of his chainsaw at work. In arriving at the amount of the allowance, Big Trees Logging Ltd estimates the GST inclusive amount of expenditure likely to be incurred by its cross-cutters, including reasonable estimates of: • depreciation (using a depreciation rate of 100%); • interest; • insurance; • repairs and maintenance (labour and parts); • bars and chains; and • consumables. 23. The reasonable estimates of these items of expenditure take into account the size and expected usage of Ian’s chainsaw, and are in line with industry standard costings. This daily chainsaw allowance is exempt and not taxable to Ian because it reimburses Ian for expenditure that would be deductible to him if the employment limitation did not exist. 24. If Ian is required to provide a spare chainsaw, Big Trees Logging Ltd can also pay Ian a daily chainsaw allowance for providing the spare chainsaw. However, the reasonable estimate of expenditure Ian is likely to incur for the spare chainsaw will be much less than for Ian’s first chainsaw. This is because Ian’s expenses on the second chainsaw are likely to be minimal. Example 2 – Chainsaw not used for work 25. Todd is also employed by Big Trees Logging Ltd as a machine operator. He is required to bring his chainsaw to work every day but, unlike Ian, Todd seldom uses the chainsaw for his work. Big Trees Logging Ltd pays Todd the same daily chainsaw allowance as that paid to Ian in example 1. 26. Todd cannot be paid the same allowance as Ian tax-free as it is not a reasonable estimate of the costs Todd is likely to incur for the use of his chainsaw. Any amount paid to Todd over a reasonable reimbursement amount will be taxable to Todd as employment income and subject to PAYE. Example 3 – Chainsaw not owned by employee 27. Graham is employed as an arborist. He is required to use a chainsaw on a daily basis for his work. His employer supplies the chainsaw and pays for all consumables and outgoings, including spare parts and repairs and maintenance costs for the chainsaw. 28. Any chainsaw allowance paid to Graham is not an allowance paid to reimburse Graham f or any expenditure because he is not likely to incur any expenditure for the use of the chainsaw. It is therefore taxable to Graham as employment income and subject to PAYE because the exemption in s CW 17 does not apply. Example 4 – Chainsaw owned by employee but employer pays for some outgoings 29. Chris is employed as a tree-feller. She is required to use her own chainsaw for work on a daily basis, but her employer pays for the fuel, two-stroke oil and chain oil for the chainsaw. 30. In setting the level of the chainsaw allowance, Chris’s employer needs to consider what expenses Chris is likely to incur for the use of her chainsaw. If her employer includes the cost of the fuel and chain oil in the allowance paid to Chris, the amount representing these costs is a benefit allowance, as Chris will not incur these expenses in using her chainsaw. To the extent that the allowance provides a benefit to Chris, t he allowance will be taxable to her as employment income and subject to PAYE. Example 5 – Chainsaw reimbursing and benefit allowance 31. Nikau is employed as a cross-cutter and uses his chainsaw for work in his employer’s business on a daily basis. In addition to his salary, Nikau’s employer pays Nikau a daily chainsaw allowance. The amount of the allowance includes a reasonable estimate of the operating costs Nikau is likely to incur in using his chainsaw at work, a depreciation amount using a depreciation rate of 100% and an amount to compensate Nikau for working in a dangerous outside environment. 32. The part of the total daily allowance paid to compensate Nikau for working in a dangerous outside environment is a benefit allowance. It is not an allowance paid to reimburse Nikau for any expenditure. It is therefore taxable to Nikau as employment income and his employer should deduct PAYE from that amount. The balance of the allowance paid to Nikau, being a reimbursement allowance, is exempt and not taxable to Nikau.

QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 15/09 INCOME TAX – INSURANCE – PERSONAL SICKNESS AND ACCIDENT INSURANCE TAKEN OUT BY EMPLOYEE WITH EMPLOYER PAYING THE PREMIUMS ON EMPLOYEE’S BEHALF All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Thi s Question We’ve Been Asked is about ss CA 1, CA 2(2), CE 1(1), CE 5, CE 11, CW 34, CX 4, DA 1, DA 2, RD 2, RD 3, RD 5(2) and the definition of “salary or wages” in s YA 1. 1.Thi s Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) considers the income tax treatment of personal sickness or accident insurance policies. Some personal sickness or accident insurance policies include elements of income protection insurance. There are specific provisions in the Act that apply only to income protection insurance, so income protection insurance may have a different tax treatment to other personal sickness or accident insurance. 2.This QWBA does not consider the treatment of payments to or from sickness, accident, or death benefits funds. 3.This QWBA also does not consider the treatment of weekly compensation purchased under s 223 of the Accident Compensation Act 2001. Question 4.What is the income tax treatment of a personal sickness or accident insurance policy that is: •taken out by an employee (the employee is the policy holder), and •the premiums are paid by the employer on the employee’s behalf? Answer 5.The employer will generally be entitled to a deduction for the premiums paid. 6.The amount of the premiums paid for income protection insurance will not be subject to PAYE. The amount of premiums paid for other personal sickness or accident insurance policies will be treated as salary or wages and, therefore, subject to PAYE. Fringe Benefit Tax will not apply because the policy belongs to the employee. 7.Amounts paid out (or that an employee is otherwise entitled to) under income protection insurance policies will be income under s CE 11. Amounts paid out (or that an employee is otherwise entitled to) under other personal sickness or accident policies will be income only if they are income under ordinary concepts (s CA 1(2)). Amounts that are not income under ordinary concepts will not be subject to tax. 8.Amounts that are income under s CE 11 or s CA 1(2) will be exempt income if they are payments: •made to a person because they (or another person) are incapacitated for work; and either opaid by a friendly society (s CW 34(2)(a)); or onot calculated according to a loss of earnings (s CW 34(2)(c)). 9.If the payment does not meet these criteria, it will be assessable income. 1 WITHDRAWN – replaced by QB 18/04 Explanation 10. Inland Revenue recently undertook a review of all Public Information Bulletins (see http://www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/pib-review/). During that review two items on the income tax treatment of insurance in an employment context were identified as being out of date. The two items are “Staff insurance schemes” (Public Information Bulletin No 70 (December 1972): 11) and “Life and accident insurance policies” (Public Information Bulletin No 106 (July 1980): 2). Those PIBs covered a number of different scenarios. We intend to replace the PIBs with a series of QWBAs covering common scenarios. 11. This QWBA considers the situation where an employee takes out a personal sickness or accident insurance policy and the employer pays the premiums. It does not cover the situation where an employer takes out a sickness or accident insurance policy for the employee’s benefit (see QB 15/10 for discussion of that situation). 12. There are many different types of insurance policies that could be sickness or accident insurance (or could include an element of personal sickness or accident insurance). These include medical insurance, income protection insurance, accident insurance, and trauma or critical illness policies. Pay-outs under these insurance policies can be periodic or lump sum and can be calculated in a variety of ways. 13. Where only part of a policy comes within a particular definition, it may be necessary to apportion premiums between different types of insurance. Similarly where a pay- out under a policy is made for more than one thing, apportionment of the receipt may be required. Deductibility of premiums for employer 14. A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent that it is incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable ( and/or excluded) income (s DA 1). Section DA 2 sets out some limitations on deductibility. For example, expenditure that is capital in nature, or expenditure incurred in deriving exempt income, is not deductible (s DA 2 (1) and (3)). 15. In most cases, s alary and wage costs will be deductible because they will satisfy the nexus test in s DA 1 and none of the general limitations will apply. The payment of a sickness or accident insurance premium for an employee that is paid in connection with the employee’s employment is a business cost just like salary or wages. Therefore, provided the costs of an employee’s salary or wages are deductible, the costs of paying the insurance premiums will be too. Whether amount of premium paid is taxable in the hands of the employee 16. An employee’s income includes “expenditure on account” of that employee (s CE 1(1)(b)). Expenditure on account of an employee means a payment made by an employer relating to expenditure incurred by an employee (or to be incurred by an employee) (s CE 5 (1)). This is subject to certain exceptions (in s CE 5(3)). 17. The only potentially relevant exclusion in this context is s CE 5(3)(j) . Section CE 5(3)(j) applies to premiums for income protection insurance that an employer is liable to make a contribution towards for the benefit of an employee. Where a personal sickness or accident policy is also (or also includes) income protection insurance, s CE 5(3)(j) may be relevant. 18. In the situation covered by this QWBA, the employee has a legal obligation to the insurance company to pay the insurance premiums. Therefore, the amount of the insurance premiums is incurred by the employee. The employer is paying the premiums to the insurance company. Therefore, the payment of the insurance 2 premiums meets the definition of expenditure on account of the employee under s CE 5(1). 19. To the extent that the premium paid is: • for “income protection insurance”; and • the employer has a liability to pay ( or make a contribution towards) that premium, then the payment of the premium will not be expenditure on account of the employee. Premiums paid for income protection insurance are not subject to PAYE (ss CE 5(3)(j)). 20. In all other cases the payment of the premium will be expenditure on account of the employee. A payment of expenditure on account of an employee is part of the employee’s “salary or wages” (s RD 5(2)). A payment of salary or wages is a “PAYE income payment” (s RD 3). Therefore, the PAYE rules apply and the amounts are subject to PAYE. The amount of the premiums needs to be grossed up before PAYE is calculated. That is, the amount of the premium paid is the amount net of tax. 21. As the payment of the premium is assessable income to the employee, the FBT rules will not apply (s CX 4). 22. There are also other potential implications of having the gross amounts of the premiums included in an employee’s salary or wages. For example, there are various other circumstances where obligations, eligibility, or entitlements may be calculated based on an employee’s salary or wages (for example KiwiSaver and Working for Families Tax Credits). Treatment of proceeds to the employee 23. Whether a payment made under an insurance policy is taxable will depend on what it is paid for. Some payments will not be income (under a specific provision or ordinary concepts) and, therefore, will not be taxable. Payments that are “income” may be either taxable or exempt income depending on the circumstances. The following discussion is intended to assist with determining how a payment under an insurance policy should be treated. Is the payment to the employee income? 24. If a personal sickness or accident insurance policy is (or includes) income protection insurance, s CE 11 may apply. Payments made under a policy of income protection insurance where an employer is liable to pay or contribute to the premiums are income to the employee under s CE 11. 25. There are no specific provisions that apply to make payments under other personal sickness or accident insurance policies income. Therefore, payments under these insurance policies will be income only if they are income under ordinary concepts (s CA 1(2)). 26. Whether a payment under an insurance policy is income or not will depend on the relationship between the payer and the recipient and the purpose of the payment (Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176). Where a payment is made to replace income which the recipient would otherwise have earned or where the purpose of the payments is to provide the recipient with amounts to meet their living expenses, the payments are likely to be income. Payments that are regular or recurring are much more likely to be income (Reid). However, a one-off payment may still be income (FCT v Hyteco Hiring Pty Ltd 92 ATC 4,694). 27. Therefore, the payments that are most likely to be income are payments that are intended to compensate an insured person for lost income (whether periodic, or lump 3 sum) and other regular or periodic payments intended to help the insured person meet their living expenses. Other lump sum and reimbursing payments are unlikely to be income (for example, a lump sum payment made to compensate a person for the loss of a limb, or a payment reimbursing medical expenses). 28. Payments that are not “income” (either under s CE 11 or s CA 1(2)) will not be taxable. If a payment is “income”, it is necessary to consider whether it is assessable income or exempt income. Is the payment exempt income of the employee? 29. The relevant exemption provision is s CW 34. A payment of income made under a policy of personal sickness or accident insurance will be exempt under s CW 34 if: • it is made to a person because they (or another person) are incapacitated for work; and either o the payment is made by a friendly society; or o the payment is not calculated according to loss of earnings. 30. If the payment does not meet these criteria, it will be assessable income. 31. The following diagram sets out the process for determining how an amount paid out under a policy should be treated. Each payment needs to be considered separately. As noted above, where a single payment is made for more than one thing, apportionment may be required: 4 Treatment of payment made to a person under a policy of personal sickness or accident insurance Examples 32. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. Example 1 – Income Protection Insurance 33. Joan takes out an income protection insurance policy for herself. Joan’s employment contract contains a clause that, if Joan takes out an income protection insurance policy, her employer will pay the premiums. Joan’s policy provides that, if Joan is unable to work due to sickness or accident, she will be paid 75% of her lost earnings. Joan and her employer want to know the income tax implications of this. 34. Joan’s employer is allowed a deduction for the amounts of premium paid to the insurer. There is no PAYE payable on the amount of premiums as they are excluded from being “expenditure on account” under s CE 5(3)(j). If Joan becomes unable to work and her policy pays out, these amounts will be Joan’s assessable income. The payments will not be exempt under s CW 34 as they will be calculated according to the earnings that Joan has lost. 5 Example 2 – Accident Insurance 35. Dennis takes out an accident insurance policy and, as part of his remuneration package, his employer agrees to pay the premiums. Under the policy Dennis will receive a fixed lump sum payment on the occurrence of certain specified events if caused by an accident. Dennis’ accident insurance policy will also reimburse medical expenses incurred as a result of an accident up to a maximum of $50,000. Dennis’ employer is allowed a deduction for the premiums and Dennis is subject to PAYE on the amounts of the premiums paid. 36. The following year Dennis has an accident while using his axe at home and loses a toe. His policy pays out a fixed amount of $1,000 for the loss of his toe and also reimburses Dennis $10,000 for his medical expenses. Dennis wants to know whether to include these amounts in his income. 37. The sum for the loss of his toe and the reimbursements of Dennis’ medical expenses are not income. The amounts are not income under ordinary concepts. They are not periodic or regular payments. Also, they are not paid to compensate Dennis for lost income nor are they payments on which Dennis can rely for his living expenses.

1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 15/10 INCOME TAX – INSURANCE – PERSONAL SICKNESS AND ACCIDENT INSURANCE TAKEN OUT BY EMPLOYER FOR THE BENEFIT OF AN EMPLOYEE All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about ss CA 1, CA 2(2), CE 1(1), CE 5, CE 11, CW 34, CX 2, CX 16, CX 31, CX 37, DA 1, DA 2 and GB 32. 1.This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) considers the income tax treatment of personal sickness or accident insurance policies. Some personal sickness or accident insurance policies include elements of income protection insurance. There are specific provisions in the Act that apply only to income protection insurance, so income protection insurance may have a different tax treatment to other personal sickness or accident insurance. 2.This QWBA does not consider the treatment of payments to or from sickness, accident, or death benefits funds. 3.This QWBA also does not consider the treatment of weekly compensation purchased under s 223 of the Accident Compensation Act 2001. Question 4.What is the income tax treatment of a personal sickness or accident insurance policy that is taken out by an employer where an employee (or their spouse, civil union partner, de facto partner or child) is the beneficiary? Answer 5.The employer will generally be entitled to a deduction for the premiums paid. 6.The premiums paid will be subject to FBT unless they are premiums paid for income protection insurance where: the employer has a liability to pay (or contribute to) the premiums; and a pay-out under the insurance policy would be assessable income of the employee. 7.Amounts paid out (or that an employee is otherwise entitled to) under income protection insurance policies will be the employee’s income under s CE 11. Amounts paid out (or that an employee is otherwise entitled to) under other personal sickness or accident insurance policies will be income only if they are income under ordinary concepts (s CA 1(2)). Amounts that are not income under ordinary concepts will not be subject to tax. 8.Amounts that are income under s CE 11 or s CA 1(2) will be exempt income if they are payments: made to a person because they (or another person) are incapacitated for work; and either opaid by a friendly society (s CW 34(2)(a)); or onot calculated according to a loss of earnings (s CW 34(2)(c)). 9.If the payment does not meet these criteria, it will be assessable income. WITHDRAWN – replaced by QB 18/05 2 10. This item applies to both individual personal sickness or accident insurance policies and group policies where the employees (or associates) are the beneficiaries of the policy. Explanation 11. Inland Revenue recently undertook a review of all Public Information Bulletins (see http://www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/pib-review/). During that review, two items on the income tax treatment of insurance in an employment context were identified as being out of date. The two items are “Staff insurance schemes” (Public Information Bulletin No 70 (December 1972): 11) and “Life and accident insurance policies” (Public Information Bulletin No 106 (July 1980): 2). Those PIBs covered a number of different scenarios. We intend to replace the PIBs with a series of Questions We’ve Been Asked (QWBAs) covering common scenarios. 12. This QWBA considers the situation where a personal sickness or accident insurance policy is taken out by an employer for the benefit of an employee. See QB 15/09 for discussion of situations where the employee takes out the policy and the employer pays the premiums. 13. There are many different types of insurance policies that could be sickness or accident insurance (or could include an element of personal sickness or accident insurance). These include medical insurance, income protection insurance, accident insurance, and trauma or critical illness policies. Pay-outs under these insurance policies can be periodic or lump sum and can be calculated in a variety of ways. 14. Where only part of a policy comes within a particular definition, it may be necessary to apportion premiums between different types of insurance. Similarly where a pay-out under a policy is made for more than one thing, apportionment of the receipt may be required. Deductibility of premiums for employer 15. A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent that it is incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable (and/or excluded) income (s DA 1). Section DA 2 sets out some limitations on deductibility. For example, expenditure that is capital in nature, or expenditure incurred in deriving exempt income, is not deductible (s DA 2(1) and (3)). 16. In most cases, salary and wage costs will be deductible because they will satisfy the nexus test in s DA 1 and none of the general limitations will apply. The payment of a sickness or accident insurance premium for an employee that is paid in connection with the employee’s employment is a business cost just like salary or wages. Therefore, provided the costs of an employee’s salary or wages are deductible, the costs of paying the insurance premiums will be too. When amount of premium is subject to FBT 17. Under s CX 2, a “fringe benefit” is a “benefit” that is provided by an employer to an employee in connection with their employment (s CX 2(1)(a)) and comes under s CX 2(1)(b) within either one of ss CX 6, CX 9, CX 10, or CX 12 to CX 16 (specified benefits) or is an unclassified benefit under s CX 37. Some benefits are also excluded from being fringe benefits by specific provisions in subpart CX (see s CX 2(1)(c)). 18. The Commissioner’s view is that the provision of an accident or sickness insurance policy where the employee is a beneficiary is a “benefit” to the employee. It provides an economic advantage to the employee as it gives the 3 employee benefits (coverage under the policy) to which they would otherwise not be entitled. Provided the benefit is provided to an employee in connection with their employment, s CX 2(1)(a) is satisfied. It is, therefore, necessary to consider whether the policy is a specified benefit under one of ss CX 6, CX 9, CX 10, or CX 12 to CX 16, or whether an unclassified benefit arises (s CX 37). It is also necessary to consider whether any exclusion could apply. 19. The only potentially relevant specific provision is s CX 16. Section CX 16 applies when an employer pays a “specified insurance premium” or makes a contribution to the insurance fund of a friendly society for the benefit of an employee (s CX 16(1)). The potentially relevant definition of “specified insurance premium” is set out in s CX 16(6): CX 16 Contributions to life or health insurance ... Health insurance (6) The third kind of policy referred to in subsection (3) is a policy of insurance under which the benefits are payable only for— (a) an accident, whether fatal or not, to the employee, their spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner, or their child; or (b) disease or sickness of the employee, their spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner, or their child. 20. A sickness or accident insurance policy will come within s CX 16 where the only benefits payable under the policy are for accident, disease or sickness. If a sickness or accident insurance policy fits within s CX 16(6), then s CX 2(1)(b) will be satisfied. 21. If a sickness or accident insurance policy does not come within s CX 16, it will be an unclassified benefit under s CX 37 (as long as there is no specific provision in subpart CX excluding it). Section CX 37 applies to benefits that an employer provides to an employee in connection with their employment that are not covered and are not excluded by a more specific provision. 22. Where an employer provides a fringe benefit to a person associated with an employee, s GB 32 may treat the benefit as if it were provided by the employer to the employee. This is subject to the shareholder-employee exemption in s GB 32(2) and the look-through company exemption in s GB 32(2B). Therefore, premiums paid on policies of personal sickness and accident insurance taken out by an employer for the benefit of an employee’s spouse, civil union partner, de facto partner or child will also be subject to FBT. Exclusion from FBT 23. The only potentially relevant exclusion is s CX 31. Section CX 31 provides: An employer who satisfies a liability to pay, or contribute to the payment of, a premium for income protection insurance for the benefit of an employee does not provide a fringe benefit to the employee if a payment of the insurance to the employee would be assessable income of the employee. 24. Section CX 31 will exclude from FBT such income protection insurance:  provided by an employer;  for the benefit of an employee;  where the employer satisfies a liability to pay (or contribute to) the premiums; and  a pay-out under the insurance policy would be assessable income of the employee (this requirement is considered below). 4 25. Where a personal sickness or accident policy is also (or also includes) income protection insurance and all of the above requirements are met, the provision of the income protection insurance will not be a fringe benefit. In all other cases, FBT will apply. Treatment of proceeds to the employee 26. Whether a payment made under an insurance policy is taxable will depend on what it is paid for. Some payments will not be income (under a specific provision or ordinary concepts) and, therefore, will not be taxable. Payments that are “income” may be either assessable or exempt income depending on the circumstances. The following discussion is intended to assist with determining how a payment under an insurance policy should be treated. Is the payment to the employee income? 27. If a personal sickness or accident insurance policy is (or includes) income protection insurance, s CE 11 may apply. Payments made under a policy of income protection insurance where an employer is liable to pay or contribute to the premiums are income to the employee under s CE 11. 28. There are no specific provisions that apply to make payments under other personal sickness or accident insurance policies income. Therefore, payments under these policies will be income only if they are income under ordinary concepts (s CA 1(2)). 29. Whether a payment under an insurance policy is income or not will depend on the relationship between the payer and the recipient and the purpose of the payment (Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176). Where a payment is made to replace income which the recipient would otherwise have earned or where the purpose of the payments is to provide the recipient with amounts to meet their living expenses, the payments are likely to be income. Payments that are regular or recurring are much more likely to be income (Reid). However, a one-off payment may still be income (FCT v Hyteco Hiring Pty Ltd 92 ATC 4,694). 30. Therefore, the payments that are most likely to be income are payments that are intended to compensate an insured person for lost income (whether periodic, or lump sum) and other regular or periodic payments intended to help the insured person meet their living expenses. Other lump sum and reimbursing payments are unlikely to be income (for example, a lump sum payment made for the loss of a limb, or a payment reimbursing medical expenses). 31. Payments that are not “income” (either under s CE 11 or s CA 1(2)) will not be taxable. If a payment is “income”, it is necessary to consider whether it is assessable income or exempt income. Is the payment exempt income of the employee? 32. The relevant exemption provision is s CW 34. A payment of income made under a policy of personal sickness or accident insurance will be exempt under s CW 34 if:  It is made to a person because they (or another person) are incapacitated for work; and either o the payment is made by a friendly society; or o the payment is not calculated according to a loss of earnings. 33. If the payment does not meet these criteria, it will be assessable income. 34. The following diagram sets out the process for determining how an amount paid out under a policy should be treated. Each payment needs to be considered 5 separately. As noted above, where a single payment is made for more than one thing, apportionment may be required: Treatment of payment made to a person under a policy of personal sickness or accident insurance Example 35. The following example is included to assist in explaining the application of the law. 36. Keith’s employer takes out medical insurance policies for each of its senior staff. The policies pay out various amounts if the insured person contracts a disease or becomes sick. Keith’s employer is allowed a deduction for the premiums. The premiums are subject to FBT because a fringe benefit arises under s CX 16(6). 37. Keith contracts influenza and is hospitalised. Keith receives a $10,000 payment as a reimbursement of his hospital expenses. Keith wants to know whether to include the $10,000 in his income. 38. The $10,000 is not income. The amount is not income under ordinary concepts. It is a one-off payment. Also, it is not paid to compensate Keith for lost income. 6 References Related rulings/statements “Life and accident insurance policies” Public Information Bulletin No 106 (July 1980): 2 “Staff insurance schemes” Public Information Bulletin No 70 (December 1972): 11 Subject references Expenditure on account of an employee FBT Fringe benefit Income protection insurance Life insurance Personal sickness or accident insurance Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007, ss CA 1, CE 1(1), CE 5, CE 11, CX 2, CX 16, CX 31, CX 37, DA 1, DA 2, GB 32, RD 3, RD 5(2) and the definitions of “expenditure on account of an employee” and “salary or wages” in s YA 1 Case references FCT v Hyteco Hiring Pty Ltd 92 ATC 4,694 Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176
1 QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 15/11 INCOME TAX – SCENARIOS ON TAX AVOIDANCE – 2015 All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about s BG 1. Introduction 1.At a tax conference in 2014, a panel discussed whether s BG 1 would apply to certain scenarios. Inland Revenue was invited to provide comment on the scenarios and did so as part of that panel discussion. Given that discussion, and the view that the scenarios would be of interest to a wider audience, the scenarios have been used as the basis of this Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA). This QWBA follows the publication of two QWBAs concerning s BG 1 and different scenarios discussed at an earlier tax conference in 2013: QB 14/11: “Income tax – scenarios on tax avoidance” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 11 (December 2014): 3 and QB 15/01: “Income tax – tax avoidance and debt capitalisation” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 3 (April 2015): 25. 2.The Commissioner’s view as to whether s BG 1 applies in these scenarios must be understood in the following terms. First, the conclusions reached are limited to the arrangements set out below. Additional relevant facts or variations to the stated facts might materially affect how the arrangements operate and different outcomes under s BG 1 could arise. Next, as the objective is to consider the application of s BG 1, the analysis proceeds on the basis that the tax effects under the specific provisions of the Act are achieved as stated. Finally, the implications of any relevant specific anti-avoidance provisions are not considered. 3. Section BG 1 is only considered after determining whether other provisions of the Act apply or do not apply. Where it applies, s BG 1 voids a tax avoidance arrangement. Voiding an arrangement may or may not appropriately counteract the tax advantages arising under the arrangement. If it does not appropriately counteract the tax advantages, the Commissioner is required to apply s GA 1 to ensure this outcome is achieved. 4.The explanations in this QWBA apply the approach to s BG 1 set out in the Commissioner’s Interpretation Statement IS 13/01: “Tax avoidance and the interpretation of sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25, No 7 (August 2013): 4. SCENARIO 1 – USE OF A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP Arrangement 5.This scenario concerns an arrangement involving three New Zealand resident companies: Company A, a tax loss company; Profit Co, a wholly-owned subsidiary company of Company A that is operating a profitable business; and Company B, a company that is unassociated with Company A and Profit Co. 6.The arrangement: Replaced by QB 23/01 and QB 23/02 Scenario 1 replaced by QB 23/02 2 Companies A and B establish a limited partnership (LP), registered under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. Companies A and B make equal contributions to the capital of the partnership and agree to each receive a 50% share of partnership profits and losses. Profit Co sells its business operations to the LP at the open market value of those operations. 7.The following diagram shows the situation before and after the arrangement: Question 8.Does s BG 1 apply to this arrangement? Answer 9.No. The Commissioner’s view is that, without more, s BG 1 would not apply to this arrangement. Explanation The arrangement’s objectives and tax effects 10.The objective of the arrangement is for Company B to take a financial interest in the business of Profit Co. 11.The tax effects of the arrangement are: Profit Co no longer derives business income. The LP derives business income. The LP is transparent for tax purposes with Companies A and B each deriving 50% of the LP’s income. Company A can offset its share of LP income against its tax losses. Business Profit Co Company A 100% Before Business After Limited Partnership Company B Company A 50% 50% Profit Co 100% Business sold 3 Company A’s ability to group tax losses with Profit Co under subpart IC is unaffected. 12.These tax effects arise under the following specific provisions: s CB 1 (Amounts derived from business) core provisions: s BC 4 (Net income and net loss); s BC 5 (Taxable income) subpart IA (General rules for tax losses) subpart IC (Grouping tax losses) subpart HG (Joint venturers, partners, and partnerships). 13.There may also be tax effects arising from the sale of the business (eg, depreciation recovered), although these are not of significance to the subsequent s BG 1 analysis. Parliament’s purposes for the provisions at issue Business income 14.Parliament intends that amounts a person derives from a business are treated as income and taxed. This is made clear by Parliament explicitly legislating s CB 1 to ensure this is the case. As stated by Richardson J of a predecessor of s CB 1 in AA Finance Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,383 (CA), “\[a\] gain made in the ordinary course of carrying on the business is thus stamped with an income character” (at 11,391). Losses 15.Parliament contemplates taxpayers incurring losses where their annual total deduction is more than their annual gross income (s BC 4(3)). It contemplates the net loss is dealt with in certain ways. A net loss is dealt with under Part I (Treatment of tax losses) and it may be offset from future income, made available to another person or dealt with in certain other ways (s BC 4(4)). A person’s taxable income for a tax year is determined after subtracting any available tax losses under Part I (s BC 5). 16.Generally, Part I provides that a person’s tax loss for a tax year is the sum of their loss balance brought forward, current year net loss and certain other amounts (eg, unused imputation credits) (s IA 2). Any tax losses not able to be offset against current income can be carried forward to subsequent income years and offset (s IA 4). 17.However, Parliament has also provided specific restrictions for companies (s IA 5). These restrictions require a minimum of 49% continuity of voting interests to be held by the same group of people from when the losses are incurred to when they are ultimately offset against income. That is, within some limits, Parliament generally expects the same group of people with a financial interest in the company when the losses are incurred get to enjoy the benefit of those losses being offset against income in the future. 18.Similarly, where a tax loss is to be made available to another person and the parties are companies, Parliament expects a 66% commonality of shareholding to exist between the profit and loss companies from the start of the period when the loss was incurred to the end of the year of offset (subpart IC). 4 Limited partnerships 19.The primary objective of the limited partnership rules is to facilitate sustainable growth in New Zealand’s investment capital sectors, such as venture capital, by providing a legal and tax structure recognised and accepted by investors (see “New legislation – Taxation (Limited Partnerships) Act 2008” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 8 (September/October 2008): 4). 20.A limited partnership under the Act means a limited partnership registered under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. It includes an overseas limited partnership, but does not include a “listed limited partnership” or a “foreign corporate limited partnership” (s YA 1 definition of “limited partnership”). 21.Generally, limited partnerships are treated as transparent for tax purposes (s HG 2). For the purposes of calculating partners’ obligations and liabilities, the partners are treated as carrying on the partnership’s activities and having the status, intention and purpose of the partnership (s HG 2(1)). Any income, expenses, tax credits, rebates, gains and losses arising for the partnership flow through to the partners in proportion to their interest in the partnership (s HG 2(2)). There are rules concerning the entry and exit of partners (ss HG 3 to HG 10). There are also rules placed on limited partners that ensure the partners’ tax losses are restricted if the amount of the loss exceeds the tax book value of their investment (s HG 11). Facts, features and attributes 22.To give effect to its purposes for these provisions, Parliament would expect to see the following facts, features or attributes, as matters of commercial and economic reality: The formation of a partnership relationship between Companies A and B. The registration of the partnership as a limited partnership under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. Companies A and B contributing equally to the capital of the LP as agreed between them. The disposal of Profit Co’s business to the LP, with the consequences that Profit Co no longer conducts the business and ceases to derive business income. The LP acquiring the business of Profit Co at its open market value, with the consequences that the LP conducts the business and commences deriving business income. Companies A and B sharing equally in the profits or losses of the LP, returning these as income or losses in their respective tax returns each year the arrangement remains operative. A minimum of 49% continuity of shareholding in the group of persons holding voting interests in Company A from the beginning of the year in which the company’s tax losses were incurred until the end of any year in which they are offset against LP income. A minimum of 66% commonality of shareholding between the group of persons holding voting interests in Company A and Profit Co from the time Company A incurred the tax losses until the end of any year in which they are offset against any future income of Profit Co. 5 The commercial reality and economic effects of the arrangement 23.The next step is to consider the commercial reality and economic effects of the arrangement. This is undertaken to determine whether the required facts, features and attributes are present in the arrangement. If so, Parliament’s purposes for the relevant provisions are being upheld. 24.The commercial and economic reality of the current arrangement is that: Companies A and B contribute equally to the formation of a registered limited partnership from which they return equal shares of income and losses for tax purposes. There is an arm’s-length sale of Profit Co’s business to the LP. The LP, and not Profit Co, conducts the business and derives business income. There is no change in the composition of the group of persons holding voting interests in Company A or Profit Co. Applying the Parliamentary contemplation test 25.In the Commissioner’s opinion, the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement accords with its legal form. There are real economic consequences to the parties that reflect that form and there are no indications of artificiality or contrivance or other factors that might suggest this was not the case. In reality, a limited partnership has been formed through which a third-party investor, Company B, has contributed capital to take an interest in an actual and existing profitable business. The nature and extent of the financial consequences for the parties is consistent with this arm’s-length investment by Company B. Accordingly, Company B’s investment through a limited partnership is consistent with Parliament’s purposes that limited partnerships are used as investment vehicles. 26.For its part, Company A divests itself of half of its interests in the business and suffers the economic burden of no longer having full access to the profits of the business. It does, however, continue to have the ability to offset losses against half of those profits when those profits are received in the form of LP income. This is because there has been no change in shareholding in Company A that could have meant the company was not able to offset its losses against its share of the LP income or any future income of Profit Co. Therefore, the arrangement does not defeat Parliament’s general expectation that the group of people with a financial interest in a company when losses are incurred should also enjoy the benefit of those losses being offset against income in the future. 27.In short, all of the facts, features or attributes Parliament would expect to see present in an arrangement to give effect to its purposes for the specific provisions are present in the current arrangement. Also, there are no facts, features or attributes present in, or absent from, the arrangement that are inconsistent with those expectations. 28.It may be thought that the step of selling the business to the LP was included in the arrangement for tax reasons. That is, to invest in the business activity of Profit Co, Company B could have bought shares in that company. Had this been the arrangement instead, one of the tax effects of this alternative arrangement would have been to breach the loss grouping provisions of the Act. Company A would then have been unable to offset its losses against any of the profits generated by the business activity. 6 29.However, applying the Parliamentary contemplation test requires determining the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement actually entered into. It does not involve identifying an arrangement, or one of several arrangements, that is economically equivalent to the arrangement entered into. The latter approach is sometimes referred to as using economic equivalence. It is not the correct approach for determining the economic and commercial reality of an arrangement (see the Commissioner’s comments in IS 13/01 at \[377\]). 30.In addition, the Supreme Court in Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 115 (at \[111\]) considered that taxpayers have the freedom to structure transactions to their best tax advantage. They cannot, however, do so in a way that is proscribed by the general anti-avoidance provision. That is, provided taxpayers make use of the provisions of the Act in a way intended by Parliament, they have freedom to choose how they structure their arrangements (see also Penny v CIR \[2011\] NZSC 95 at \[49\]). Accordingly, there is no general requirement for the parties in this scenario to adopt an alternative, less tax-favourable, arrangement. 31.As determined above, the arrangement in this scenario is not considered to contravene Parliament’s purposes for the specific provisions in question. Conclusion on tax avoidance 32.In the Commissioner’s opinion, without more, the factual situation in this scenario is not one to which s BG 1 would apply. That is, the arrangement does not have a tax avoidance purpose or effect. SCENARIO 2 – INTEREST DEDUCTIONS AND USE OF A PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT ENTITY Arrangement 33.This scenario concerns the following arrangement: An individual taxpayer, with income that places them on the top marginal tax rate of 33%, borrows funds for a fixed term of 2 years from Bank A and incurs interest at a fixed rate of 5% per annum. Under the conditions of the loan, the taxpayer must apply the borrowed funds to acquire an investor interest in a multi-rate portfolio investment entity (PIE) sponsored by Bank A with any PIE income retained by the bank in satisfaction of the taxpayer’s interest obligations under the loan. Bank A’s lending is secured over the taxpayer’s investor interest in the PIE. The taxpayer notifies the PIE to apply an investor rate of 28%. Under its investment policy, the multi-rate PIE must invest all funds in New Zealand dollar interest-bearing 2-year deposits with Bank A. It derives a fixed pre-tax return of 4.9% per annum. In their annual tax return, the taxpayer deducts the interest expense incurred on the borrowed funds (as calculated under the financial arrangements rules) against their other income. 34.The interest rates and their margin in this arrangement are those provided to the Commissioner at the tax conference. Other facts implicit in the scenario presented at the conference concerning the rates being fixed, the duration of the arrangement and the terms of the loan have been explicitly added. Scenario 2 replaced by QB 23/01 7 35. The Commissioner understands that the arrangement as presented may not be realistic or reflect what might occur in practice. Despite this, the arrangement does provide an opportunity to examine how s BG 1 may apply in this context. Question 36. Does s BG 1 apply to this arrangement? Answer 37. Yes. The Commissioner’s view is that s BG 1 would apply to this arrangement. Explanation The arrangement’s objectives and tax effects 38. The objective of the arrangement is to provide the taxpayer with investment income. 39. The tax effects of the arrangement for the taxpayer are that they:  derive excluded income from the PIE, on which a final tax has been levied at their notified investor rate of 28%, and  obtain a deduction for interest expenditure, which is offset against income taxed at a marginal tax rate of 33%. 40. The relevant provisions of the Act are the PIE rules in subpart HM, ss CP 1 and CX 56 and the provisions governing the deductibility of interest (ie, the general permission in s DA 1 and s DB 6). Parliament’s purpose for the provisions at issue The PIE rules 41. A PIE is an entity that makes investments on behalf of one or more investors where the entity has chosen to become a PIE (ss HM 2(1) and HM 71). An aim of the rules is for PIEs to be taxed on collective investment income on a similar basis to individual investors. For instance, PIEs are not taxed on realised gains on shares in New Zealand resident companies, similar to the treatment of most individual investors (s CX 55). 42. Upon becoming a PIE, entities must choose to become a particular type of PIE (s HM 2(2)). The PIE featured in the arrangement has chosen to become a “multi-rate PIE”. A multi-rate PIE is liable for tax on the proceeds of investments attributed to natural person investors calculated at different tax rates, being those rates applicable for each investor (s HM 6(1)). In this way, a multi-rate PIE’s total tax liability is intended to resemble the total tax liability the group of investors would have had if the investors had made the investments separately. 43. It is also intended that investors receive an after-tax economic return that they would receive if they personally made similar investments to those made by the PIE (s HM 6(2)). However, Parliament also contemplates that some investors could pay less tax if they invested through a PIE than if they invested personally because the maximum prescribed investor rate (PIR) for a natural person investor is 28%, which is less than the top personal tax rate. Therefore, investors’ returns may only resemble what they would receive if investing personally. 44. Generally, natural person investors in multi-rate PIEs have no further tax liability on income for which the PIE has a tax liability (s HM 6(1)). This is provided the investor has notified the PIE of the correct rate at which tax is to be paid on their 8 investment proceeds (the PIR). The rate is usually based on the investor’s income in previous years (s HM 56, sch 6). The investor’s income attributed from a multi-rate PIE is excluded income of the investor (ss CP 1 and CX 56). Excluded income is not included in the investor’s assessable income (s BD 1). In most cases, this means that the tax paid by the PIE at the investor’s PIR is a final tax on the PIE income. 45. One of the purposes of the rules was to remove inconsistencies between the tax treatment of investments made personally by investors and those made as part of a collective investment vehicle that disadvantaged the latter. It was considered important that investors’ decisions were not distorted by different tax treatments for income from investments that were similar in nature. 46. Also, the timing of the introduction of the PIE rules was linked to the introduction of the KiwiSaver scheme and Parliament’s wider purposes of encouraging a long-term retirement savings habit amongst New Zealanders. These measures were expected to result in a rise in taxpayer participation in collective investment vehicles (see Taxation of investment income (A Government discussion document, Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, June 2005) at \[1.13\] and the First Reading of the KiwiSaver Bill, Hon Dr Michael Cullen, Minister of Finance (2 March 2006) 626 NZPD 1673. Interest deductibility 47. The purpose of the Act is to impose tax on net income (s AA 1), which is the amount remaining after deducting from income all deductions allowed under the Act (s BC 4). Generally, deductions are available because Parliament is concerned with taxing a gain, being the balance of proceeds over the costs of generating income. 48. Accordingly, a taxpayer is allowed a deduction for interest expenditure provided it is incurred in deriving their assessable or excluded income or in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable or excluded income (s DA 1). Deductions for interest are not precluded merely because the interest might be regarded as being of a capital nature (s DB 6). By allowing interest deductions, Parliament clearly contemplates borrowed capital being applied to a purpose that has a connection or nexus with an income-earning activity. In allowing losses to be carried forward, Parliament also contemplates that a return will not always arise from a taxpayer’s activities in a particular income year and that in some cases deductions, such as for interest expenditure, will exceed income. Facts, features and attributes 49. To give effect to its purposes for these provisions, Parliament would expect to see the following facts, features or attributes, as matters of commercial and economic reality:  An entity acting as a collective investment vehicle for one or more investors.  The entity has chosen to become a PIE and meets all the requirements of being a multi-rate PIE under the Act.  Income earned by the PIE is attributed to investors based on their investor interests, on which tax is paid by the PIE at the investors’ notified investor rates.  The PIE’s tax liability resembles the total tax liability the group of investors would have if the investors were to make the investments separately. 9  The investors’ after-tax economic return from their interest in the PIE resembles the return that would arise if the investors had invested personally in similar investments to those made by the PIE.  Borrowed funds on which interest accrues have been applied in connection with an income-earning activity.  The PIE is part of the investors’ savings and investment activities. The commercial reality and economic effects of the arrangement 50. The next step is to consider the commercial reality and economic effects of the current arrangement. This is undertaken to determine whether the required facts, features and attributes are present in the arrangement. If so, Parliament’s purposes for the relevant provisions are being upheld. 51. It is accepted that in this arrangement there exists, as matters of commercial and economic reality, the following facts, features and attributes:  An entity is acting as a collective investment vehicle for one or more investors, including the taxpayer.  The entity has chosen to be a multi-rate PIE and meets all the requirements of being a multi-rate PIE under the Act.  Income earned by the PIE is attributed to the taxpayer based on their investor interest and on which tax is paid by the PIE at the taxpayer’s notified investor rate.  The PIE’s tax liability resembles the total tax liability the group of investors would have if the investors were to make the investments separately.  The taxpayer’s after-tax economic return from the interest in the PIE resembles the return that would arise if they had invested personally in similar investments to those made by the PIE. 52. However, Parliament would also expect to see present, as matters of commercial and economic reality, the following facts, features and attributes:  The borrowed funds on which the interest accrued and claimed by the taxpayer as a deduction have been applied in connection with an income-earning activity.  The PIE is part of the taxpayer’s savings and investment activities. 53. Ascertaining whether these facts, features or attributes are present as matters of commercial and economic reality must take into account the whole of the arrangement. Viewed as a whole, the arrangement involves circular movements of funds. Amounts lent by the bank to the investor must be re-invested with the bank via the PIE. Similarly, interest income paid by the bank must be applied in satisfaction of the investor’s interest obligation to the bank. The circular movement of money in an arrangement is often an indicator of tax avoidance, as it can lead to the effective neutralisation or distortion of economic outcomes. This, in turn, may mean that the expected facts, features or attributes are not, in reality, present. 54. The economic consequences that arise as a result of the circularity in the present arrangement are that the taxpayer’s interest income on the PIE investment is wholly applied in satisfaction of their interest obligation to the bank, with the remainder being funded by the tax system (see para 56 below). In reality, borrowing usually requires undertaking risk. The commercial and economic reality of the current arrangement, however, is that the usual risks associated 10 with borrowing are absent. Also, the circular nature of the arrangement means that typical commercial constraints do not apply and the arrangement could be scaled-up to any level of borrowing and investing. 55. The result is that the financial consequences of the arrangement are neutralised or distorted and unlike those expected of an arrangement involving borrowing and investing. It follows that, as a matter of commercial and economic reality, there is no real borrowing or application of funds to an income-earning activity. It also follows that, as a matter of commercial and economic reality, the involvement of the PIE is not part of the taxpayer’s savings and investment activities. 56. Furthermore, as mentioned, the taxpayer’s interest obligations under the loan not satisfied by the PIE income are funded by the tax system. This is the result of the arrangement as a whole being pre-tax negative and post-tax positive. That is, the arrangement makes a gross loss of 0.1% because the interest rate on the loan of 5.0% is greater than the PIE income of 4.9%. In comparison, the arrangement is post-tax positive and produces a net return of 0.178%. This is because the PIE income is subject to tax at 28% with the interest expense able to be offset against non-PIE income that would have been subject to tax at the higher rate of 33% 1 . This aspect of the arrangement means that, even if it is accepted that the arrangement involves borrowing and investing as matters of commercial and economic reality (which it is not), any net investment return arises from the tax system and not the investment itself. This also leads to a conclusion that there is no real savings or investment activity as contemplated by Parliament. 57. While the fact that an arrangement may be pre-tax negative and post-tax positive is not decisive of itself, it is relevant here as this aspect of the arrangement is fixed for the duration of the arrangement. This is because of the fixed nature of the terms and interest rates applying to the borrowing and to the PIE investment. It is also because the nature of the PIE’s investment in fixed interest deposits precludes any other economic gains arising from the arrangement. This can be contrasted with other arrangements where either the pre-tax negative investment return is the result of unforeseen events or there is the prospect of other economic gains arising. 58. In summary, there is on the face of it, borrowing with a connection with an income-earning activity of savings and investment. In commercial and economic reality, however, there is no real borrowing or application of funds to an income-earning activity. It follows there can, in reality, be no savings and investment activity. The pre-tax negative, post-tax positive aspect of the arrangement also leads to this latter conclusion. Applying the Parliamentary contemplation test 59. Applying the Parliamentary contemplation test requires reaching a view on whether the arrangement, when viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, makes use of the Act in a manner that is consistent with Parliament’s purpose. This is done in light of the relevant Parliamentary purposes and the facts, features and attributes that have been identified. 60. The Commissioner accepts that Parliament contemplated taxpayers investing through a PIE to secure the tax advantage of the maximum PIR of 28%. For instance, the current arrangement can be contrasted with a situation where a 1 The post-tax positive return is calculated as follows: (4.9% x (1–0.28)) – (5.0% x (1–0.33)) = 0.178%. 11 taxpayer on the highest marginal tax rate withdrew existing investment funds from a non-PIE investment to invest in a PIE (see Example 2, IS 13/01 at 98-101). In that situation the involvement of a PIE is still part of the taxpayer’s savings and investment activities because there is an actual investment being made. Therefore, arrangements strongly influenced by tax outcomes are not necessarily tax avoidance arrangements subject to s BG 1. 61. When the current arrangement is viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, it was accepted that certain facts, features and attributes are present (see para 51). However, as the previous discussion shows, key facts, features or attributes that Parliament would expect to be present are absent from the current arrangement. These are the borrowing’s connection to an income-earning activity in a real sense and the involvement of the PIE as part of the taxpayer’s savings and investment activities. 62. Overall, the arrangement lacks key facts, features and attributes Parliament would expect to see present to give effect to its purposes for the interest deductibility and PIE rules. This means the arrangement is outside Parliament’s purposes for those rules and has a tax avoidance purpose or effect. The merely incidental test 63. Because the arrangement has a tax avoidance purpose or effect, the next step is to test whether the tax avoidance purpose or effect is merely incidental to a non-tax avoidance purpose or effect. In that case, s BG 1 will not apply even though the arrangement has a tax avoidance purpose or effect. A “merely incidental” tax avoidance purpose or effect is something that follows from, or is necessarily and concomitantly linked to, without contrivance, some other purpose or effect. 64. The purposes or effects of the arrangement could be seen as being concerned with the generation of investment income, which, in turn, relates to the savings and investment activities of the taxpayer. However, this is too general a purpose or effect to explain why the arrangement was structured in the manner it was, particularly using borrowing and a multi-rate PIE. General purposes that can potentially be achieved in several different ways will not explain the particular structure of the arrangement. Consequently, the existence of such a purpose will not be sufficient to establish that a tax avoidance purpose or effect is merely incidental to it. 65. Also, it appears that the only purpose or effect of the arrangement is to generate a return from the tax system, which is a tax avoidance purpose or effect. Therefore the tax avoidance purpose or effect cannot be merely incidental to any other purpose or effect. Conclusion on tax avoidance 66. Accordingly, the Commissioner considers that the merely incidental test does not prevent the arrangement being considered a tax avoidance arrangement and subject to s BG 1. Reconstruction 67. Where s BG 1 applies, the arrangement is void as against the Commissioner. The next question to consider is whether this adequately counteracts the tax advantage gained by the taxpayer from the arrangement. If not, the Commissioner must consider using the powers provided by s GA 1 to reconstruct the arrangement to ensure this occurs. The Commissioner has a broad discretion 12 as to how to reconstruct an arrangement and in some scenarios there may be more than one approach possible. 68.In this scenario, voiding the arrangement would mean both the PIE income and interest deductions would be disregarded for tax purposes. However, the tax effects of these two aspects of the arrangement, while creating an overall tax advantage for the taxpayer, are, in practice, spread between the taxpayer and the PIE. This means reconstructing the arrangement may be appropriate provided it restored the arrangement’s pre-tax economic outcome, so that it results in a negative return. One straightforward approach to achieving this would be to limit the taxpayer’s interest deductions so that the tax benefit arising from them at the 33% marginal tax rate matches the tax already paid by the PIE at the 28% PIR. This approach would adequately counteract the tax advantage by making tax a neutral factor in the arrangement. SCENARIO 3 – USE OF A DISCRETIONARY TRUST Arrangement 69.This scenario concerns an arrangement where trustees of a trust pay or vest income in an income year to a single beneficiary and the beneficiary is either: an individual adult beneficiary who is taxed on the beneficiary income at the lowest marginal tax rate, or a corporate beneficiary (that may or may not be solvent) with total tax losses available in that year equal to, or greater than, the beneficiary income, or a corporate beneficiary, where the beneficiary income is a dividend from a foreign company and exempt income of the beneficiary under s CW 9. 70.The only additional facts present are as follows. The trust was validly established and, in undertaking the arrangement, the trustees have fully complied with the terms of the trust deed and with their obligations under general trust law to distribute income to the beneficiaries. The terms of the trust deed do not require the trustees to distribute any or all of the income derived each year. The trustees also have the discretion to choose the beneficiaries or class of beneficiaries that are to receive trust property. All beneficiaries of the trust are existing beneficiaries of the trust and New Zealand tax residents. For tax purposes, the trust is classified as a complying trust under s HC 9. That is, the trust is an ordinary New Zealand domestic trust with New Zealand resident settlors and trustees. Question 71.Does s BG 1 apply to this arrangement? Answer 72.No. The Commissioner’s view is that, without more, s BG 1 would not apply to the arrangement. Variations to the facts that may lead the Commissioner to reach a different view are discussed from para 92. Explanation The arrangement’s objectives and tax effects Scenario 3 replaced by QB 23/02 13 73. The objective of the arrangement is to vest income in, or pay income to a beneficiary taking into account the beneficiary’s tax position. 74. The tax effect of the arrangement is that the income derived by the trustees and vested in or paid to the beneficiary is not trustee income and not subject to tax at the trustee tax rate of 33%. 75. Instead, the tax effect is that the income is beneficiary income and:  in the case of the individual, is taxed at a rate of tax that is less than the trustee tax rate;  in the case of the loss company, is not taxed because of the availability to the beneficiary of sufficient tax losses to offset against the income;  in the case of the dividend from a foreign company paid or vested to a corporate beneficiary, is not taxed because the income retains its identity as foreign dividends and is exempt income of the beneficiary under s CW 9. 76. The relevant provisions of the Act are the trust rules in subpart HC relating to beneficiary income and the core provisions in Part B. Parliament’s purposes for the provisions at issue Beneficiary income 77. Subpart HC provides rules for the taxation of trusts, including the taxation of beneficiary income. Income derived by a trustee is treated as trustee income and taxed at the rate of 33% unless it is distributed as beneficiary income. Beneficiary income is taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate (s HC 5). An amount derived by a person is income if it is beneficiary income under s HC 6 (s CV 13(a)). 78. Under s HC 6, for income to be distributed as beneficiary income it must be income derived by a trustee that:  “vests absolutely in interest” in a beneficiary in the income year, or  is “paid” to a beneficiary either in the income year or within a certain period after the end of the income year (ie, within six months of the end of the income year or the earlier of when the trust tax return is filed or is due). 79. Accordingly, beneficiary income can arise in two ways—where it vests absolutely in interest in the beneficiary or where it is paid to the beneficiary (although there is some overlap between the two). 80. Beneficiary income is discussed in the Commissioner’s Interpretation Statement IS 12/02: “Income Tax – Whether income deemed to arise under tax law, but not trust law, can give rise to beneficiary income” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 7 (August 2012): 49. In summary, the discussion concludes that, in relation to beneficiary income:  The phrase “vests absolutely in interest” is a trust law concept and is not defined in the Act.  “Vested” means indefeasibly vested, in the sense of finally and absolutely vested, so that the beneficiary obtains an immediate right of present or future possession of the income.  The income must exist at the time of vesting. While the amount vested need not be received by the beneficiary until some time in the future, the income must exist rather than be future income or merely an expectancy. 14  The mechanisms by which an amount can vest absolutely in interest in a beneficiary include: o a provision of the trust deed that vests the income in the beneficiary, without the need for a trustee resolution; o a resolution of the trustees vesting the income in the beneficiary; o a payment to, or a credit to an account of, the beneficiary in the income year (or within a certain period after the end of the year).  An amount will be “paid” if it is actually paid, distributed, credited or dealt with in the beneficiary’s interest or on their behalf. A declaration or resolution by a trustee allocating income to a beneficiary will be sufficient for an amount to be “paid”. 81. Accordingly, income need not be physically paid to a beneficiary (such as with a physical transfer of funds to an account) for a beneficiary to derive beneficiary income. It is sufficient for an amount to be credited to a beneficiary, or dealt with in the beneficiary’s interest or on their behalf in some other way. Discretionary trusts and allocating beneficiary income 82. Subpart HC is silent on how trustees of discretionary trusts that are classified as complying trusts should determine who receives beneficiary income or the amount of that income. Parliament has generally left it to general trust law to determine this aspect of trust taxation. However, once trustees make decisions within the constraints of the general trust law, Parliament has indicated its expectations as to the tax consequences that arise. It can be seen that in some areas Parliament has placed practical limitations on the trustees in terms of amounts allocated to beneficiaries. For example, where beneficiary income includes imputation tax credits trustees are effectively prevented by s LE 5 from streaming the credits to one beneficiary. Section LE 5 limits the imputation credit available to a beneficiary by pro-rating the credits over all distributions made to all beneficiaries in the relevant income year. Similarly, in certain circumstances trustees are effectively prevented by s HC 35 from distributing beneficiary income of more than $1,000 in an income year to a beneficiary that is a minor as amounts in excess of that are taxed at the trustee tax rate. 83. Under trust law, where a trust instrument provides trustees with a discretion to choose which beneficiaries should receive trust property, the trustees are entitled to prefer some beneficiaries over others. The House of Lords’ decision in Gartside v IRC \[1968\] 1 All ER 121 made it clear the objects of a discretionary trust have no proprietary interest in the trust property or its income. Their rights are restricted to a right to be considered for nomination as a beneficiary by the trustees and a right to compel proper administration of the trust. Gartside also confirmed that the trustees of a discretionary trust owe fiduciary duties to discretionary beneficiaries. The beneficiaries have a right that would attract the protection of a court of equity to ensure the trustees carry out their duties fairly, reasonably or properly. This means trustees of a trust must not exercise their discretion without properly considering all relevant matters as directed by the trust deed and general trust law. 84. Parliament’s purposes for trustee and beneficiary income can be found in a combination of general trust law, Part B and subpart HC of the Act. From this, it can be concluded that neither the general trust law nor the Act prevents trustees of a discretionary trust taking into account the tax consequences arising for a beneficiary if they were to receive beneficiary income. These tax consequences arise in the context of the core provisions of the Act from which income tax obligations and entitlements are determined, taking into account such things as 15 tax rates, credits and deductions. Parliament contemplated that tax rates, credits and deductions apply to the income actually derived by the taxpayer. Income derived by a taxpayer could include beneficiary income. In other circumstances, the Act provides for tax losses to arise and for these to be offset against income actually derived by taxpayers. Also, s HC 22 shows that Parliament contemplates that, in some contexts in relation to non-complying trusts, taxpayers deriving beneficiary income may also have tax losses. Facts, features and attributes 85. Given the above aspects of the trust rules, Parliament would contemplate that the facts, features and attributes present in an arrangement involving beneficiary income would include:  A valid trust exists, where the trustees act in accordance with the trust deed and general trust law: o The necessary prerequisites to the formation of a trust are met, including the certainty of:  an intention to establish a trust,  the trust assets being unambiguously defined, and  the beneficiaries being able to be ascertained. o The trustees are holding and dealing with trust property, including deriving income from the trust property, on behalf of beneficiaries in accordance with the trust deed and general trust law.  Income derived by the trustees is paid or vested as beneficiary income to beneficiaries.  The beneficiaries receiving distributions of income are eligible to benefit under the trust. That is, they are, in reality, beneficiaries of the trust.  The beneficiaries receive the distributions of income. That is, they benefit in some way, either immediately or from future possession of the income so that, in reality, there is a distribution of income to them.  The core provisions of the Act, including the rules concerning income, exempt income, basic tax rates and tax losses, apply according to the individual circumstances of the beneficiary. The commercial reality and economic effects of the arrangement 86. The next step is to consider the commercial reality and economic effects of the arrangement. This is undertaken to determine whether the required facts, features and attributes are present in the arrangement. If so, Parliament’s purposes for the relevant provisions are being upheld. 87. In this scenario there is a validly established trust. The distributions of beneficiary income have been undertaken in compliance with the trust deed, general trust law requirements and subpart HC of the Act. The facts, features and attributes Parliament would expect are present as matters of commercial and economic reality. There is no suggestion the beneficiaries are not, in reality, entitled under the trust, or that they will not benefit from the distribution of income to them. Further, on the simple facts of this arrangement, there are no facts, features and attributes present in, or absent from, the arrangement that mean the arrangement is outside Parliament’s purposes for the provisions of the Act other than subpart HC. 16 88. In effect, the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement is the same as its legal form – a distribution of income to beneficiaries as beneficiary income. Applying the Parliamentary contemplation test 89. The relevant facts, features and attributes contemplated by Parliament to be present in an arrangement involving beneficiary income are present in this arrangement as matters of commercial and economic reality. In these circumstances, the conclusion reached from applying the Parliamentary contemplation test is that the arrangement in this scenario is not a tax avoidance arrangement. This means that s BG 1 would not apply to the scenario. 90. The Commissioner considers this is the correct conclusion despite the clear implication that the trustees’ choices in this scenario were significantly influenced by tax considerations. The Supreme Court in Ben Nevis considered that taxpayers could structure their arrangements to their best tax advantage, provided the use of the provisions is within what Parliament would have contemplated (at \[111\]). Where the use of the provisions is outside what Parliament would have contemplated for them it is appropriate for s BG 1 to apply. Accordingly, arrangements strongly influenced by tax outcomes are not necessarily tax avoidance arrangements subject to s BG 1. Such influences on arrangements would be relevant to whether tax outcomes were merely incidental, but this only becomes important if the arrangement is a tax avoidance arrangement in the first instance. Note that, prior to Ben Nevis, Richardson J recognised this for trusts in CIR v Challenge Corporation Ltd \[1986\] 2 NZLR 513 (CA) at 548-549: ... but it was obviously never intended that the use of trusts, which in New Zealand practice in the vast majority of cases is substantially influenced by tax considerations, should be automatically voided under its provisions. Conclusion on tax avoidance 91. From a commercial and economic reality perspective, the arrangement in this scenario results in the relevant trust provisions and other provisions of the Act applying as Parliament would expect. In those circumstances, it is appropriate that s BG 1 should not apply to the arrangement. Factual variations 92. While the Commissioner considers s BG 1 does not apply on the simple facts of the arrangement in this scenario, there may be arrangements involving distributions of beneficiary income where the Commissioner may reach a different conclusion. Factual variations in relation to Parliament’s purposes for the trust rules 93. Different facts may call into question whether Parliament’s purposes for the trust rules are being given effect. As mentioned above, the facts, features and attributes that need to be present to give effect to Parliament’s purposes for the taxation of beneficiary income include the existence of a beneficiary of the trust and of a distribution to that beneficiary. On some facts, it will be arguable that no distribution of income to a beneficiary of the trust was made from a commercial or economic perspective. That is, where it is arguable that, in commercial and economic reality, either:  the beneficiary was not a beneficiary of the trust, or  no distribution of income was made to the beneficiary. 17 94. Consideration would need to be given to various facts, including (but not limited to):  the timing and pattern of the addition or removal of beneficiaries;  how and when the income was distributed (eg, whether authorised distributions are paid in cash or credited to beneficiaries’ current accounts);  any facts indicating that, in commercial and economic reality, parties other than the trustees or the beneficiaries nominated to receive distributions obtain the use and benefit of the income;  any facts indicating that, in commercial and economic reality, there is no realistic prospect of the beneficiaries ever benefiting from the income allocated to them. 95. On their own there may be nothing inherently wrong with any one of these factors. For instance, the fact that in any income year the trustees have resolved to pay beneficiary distributions by credit to account and retain the funds for use within the trust would not, on its own, indicate Parliament’s purposes for the distribution of beneficiary income were not being given effect. However, in some cases, a combination of the above facts may raise doubts as to whether, in commercial and economic reality, the trustees have made a distribution of income to a beneficiary. 96. Although argued under provisions other than the trust rules, Krukziener v CIR (No 3) (2010) 24 NZTC 24,563 (HC) is an example of where, in the context of s BG 1, a court clearly considered that the commercial and economic reality of an arrangement was that the use and benefit of income distributed by trustees was enjoyed by a person other than the beneficiaries nominated to receive the distributions. Factual variations in relation to Parliament’s purposes for other provisions 97. Another situation where the Commissioner may reach a different conclusion is where an arrangement is contrary to Parliament’s purposes for provisions of the Act, other than the trust rules. It is not possible to be specific about such arrangements due to the range of arrangements and other provisions of the Act that could arise. It is likely that, unlike the current scenario, such arrangements would involve additional entities and steps that contribute to the potential for these arrangements to be regarded as tax avoidance arrangements. 98. Regardless, the same approach to applying s BG 1 outlined above would apply. This approach commences with discerning Parliament’s purposes for the relevant provision or provisions of the Act. It then requires determining the facts, features and attributes Parliament would expect to be present (or absent). Finally, the arrangement is examined and a decision is reached on whether the requisite facts, features and attributes are present as matters of commercial and economic reality. If not, the arrangement is likely to be a tax avoidance arrangement unless the tax avoidance purpose or effect is merely incidental to a non-tax avoidance purpose or effect of the arrangement. 18 References Subject references Beneficiary income Interest deductions Limited partnerships Merely incidental Portfolio Investment Entity Reconstruction Tax avoidance Tax avoidance arrangement Trustee income Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007: ss AA 1, BC 4, BC 5, CB 1, CP 1, CV 13(a), CX 55, CX 56, DA 1, DB 6, BG 1, GA 1, subparts HC, HG, HM, IA and IC, s LE 5, s YA 1 definition “limited partnership”.

QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 15/12 DEPRECIATION TREATMENT FOR “BUILDINGS WITH PREFABRICATED STRESSED-SKIN INSULATION PANELS” All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked provides guidance for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue staff on which buildings the Commissioner considers come within the asset class “Buildings with prefabricated stressed-skin insulation panels” in the “Buildings and Structures” asset category in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates. Question 1. What buildings come within the asset class “Buildings with prefabricated stressed-skin insulation panels”? Answer 2. The asset class “Buildings with prefabricated stressed-skin insulation panels” (also known as “sandwich panels”) includes buildings 1 where:  the sandwich panels form a core part of the structural framework of the building (meaning the building is constructed solely of interlocking sandwich panels without a steel frame construction); or  the structural framework of the building is steel and: o can be categorised as a shade-roof structure (being one where the sheet metal cladding of the warehouse provides shade and weather proofing to the insulation); or o the exterior cladding is predominantly made using sandwich panels (ie, no less than 75% of the external cladding). 3. Examples of buildings that potentially fall within this asset class are coolstores, abattoirs or meat processing facilities, and fish processing facilities. Background 4. The “Buildings with prefabricated stressed-skin insulation panels” asset class appears in the “Building and Structures” asset category in the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates (“Depreciation Table”) and has a depreciation rate of 4.5% diminishing value (DV) or 3% straight line value, based on an estimated useful life (EUL) of 33.3 years. 5. A prefabricated stressed-skin insulation panel comprises a foam core sandwiched between two “skins”. The core is most commonly made from polyurethane or styrene foam and is both durable and light weight. The “skin” is most commonly made from stainless steel, aluminium or plain galvanised steel. These are often referred to as “sandwich panels”. 6. There has been some debate on what type of building comes within the asset class. In particular, whether buildings that are only partially built using insulation panels come within the asset class. 1 For the meaning of the term “building” in the context of the depreciation provisions, please refer to Interpretation Statement IS 10/02: “Meaning of ‘building’ in the depreciation provisions” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 5 (June 2010): 24). Buildings “with” prefabricated stressed-skin insulation panels 7. Under the asset category “Buildings and Structures” in the Depreciation Table is an asset class “Buildings with prefabricated stressed-skin insulation panels”. 8. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines “with” as “accompanied by, in the same direction, or possession; having, or the material used for a purpose”. 2 Therefore, applying the dictionary definition of “with”, the building should either be accompanied by prefabricated stressed-skin insulation panels or it must be constructed by means of prefabricated stressed-skin panels. 9. The building asset classes for depreciation purposes are described either by the structural/construction method used or by the activity the structure houses. The asset class “with prefabricated stressed-skin insulation panels” is a reference to an element of the construction, rather than to an activity that is being carried on within the structure. 3 Therefore, the Commissioner considers that “with” prefabricated stressed-skin insulation panels refers to a building being constructed “by means of” these panels. Framing structure and cladding 10. In the asset categories contained in Determination DEP 1: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 1 (DEP 1), there are two further distinctions in the building asset class descriptions: those that describe the framing structure (for example, buildings with steel or timber and steel framing or buildings with reinforced concrete framing), and those that refer to the cladding (for example, shade-houses glass, shade-houses PVC). 11. The Commissioner’s view is that the prefabricated stressed-skin insulation panels asset class could include either the building’s cladding or the framing structure. Buildings made from mixed cladding materials 12. In some instances the exterior cladding of a building may be constructed from mixed materials. For example, a coolstore, where part of the building is made from sandwich panels and part of the building, housing a small administration room, is built from concrete blocks. Alternatively, a building that has steel framing and concrete walls may have a small coolstore facility made of sandwich panels as part of the building. 13. Where the exterior cladding of a building is made from mixed construction materials, the Commissioner will take into account the overall percentage of the different materials used. If, overall, 75% or more of the exterior cladding/external walls of the building is made from sandwich panels, the Commissioner considers that the building comes within the prefabricated stressed-skin insulation building asset class. Example: Coolstores 14. Since the 1970s, the use of structural sandwich panels has been a cost-efficient construction method for coolstores where hygienic food storage is required. 15. Coolstores operate from 0°C to 10°C and are used to hold product at temperatures in this range. The form that a coolstore takes is determined by the storage regulations, and handling, hygiene and client requirements. The 2 Concise Oxford English Dictionary, Oxford University Press 2006. 3 Other building asset classes refer to activities they house, for example, chemical works, fertiliser buildings, etc. predominant type of coolstore built in New Zealand since the late 1960s has been a single-storey, rectangular shaped building, generally with a maximum storage height of approximately 7.6 metres. 4 16. Steel is the predominant material used in the framing of coolstore structures due to its economy and resilience in low temperature environments. Typically, a coolstore building was constructed as a weather enclosure and the insulated coolstore created by lining the inside of the warehouse with sandwich panels to form an insulated “box”. These are known as shade-roof structures, where the sheet metal cladding of the warehouse provides a shade and weather roof to the insulation. 17. As manufacturing techniques and sandwich panel quality improved, sandwich panels were increasingly used as unprotected cladding against external weather environments. In these circumstances, the insulated panels were increasingly used as a structural element, weather cladding and insulation. 18. When the Depreciation Table was introduced in 1993, the predominant form of coolstore was the shade roof structure lined with insulation panels. However, as manufacturing techniques have evolved and sandwich panels have improved, the need for sheet metal cladding has been reduced to the extent that the exterior cladding and roof of coolstores are now constructed predominantly of sandwich panels. Changing a depreciation rate 19. In limited circumstances a taxpayer can change the depreciation rate that they use to depreciate an item of depreciable property. For example, where the taxpayer has been using an incorrect rate. 20. For further guidance on changing to a different depreciation rate please refer to QB 15/03: Income tax – changing to a different depreciation rate for an item of depreciable property (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 4 (May 2015): 30). 4 IPENZ Practice Note 15 – Coldstore Engineering in New Zealand at \[4\] and \[7\]
