1 Report Date: 21 July 2022 Security Level: To: Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern, Prime Minister / Minister for Child Poverty Reduction Hon Grant Robertson, Minister of Finance Hon Kelvin Davis, Minister for Children Hon Carmel Sepuloni, Minister for Social Development and Employment Hon David Parker, Minister of Revenue Working for Families Review: Evidence and Options Purpose of the report 1 As part of the Working for Families (WFF) review, this report provides you with: • A summary of available evidence on tax credits in New Zealand and overseas, and an assessment of the issues with WFF (Part A, beginning at page 10). • High-level options to address some of the key issues identified, and advice on some of the key considerations and trade-offs that should be taken into account when considering the options (Part B, beginning at page 17). Executive summary 2 As part of the Review, officials have brought together a range of evidence and analysis on issues relevant to WFF (see Appendix One). Overall, we have concluded that New Zealand’s model of tax credits is not an outlier, and we face similar issues to other countries that use tax credits, in terms of balancing objectives such as income adequacy and making work pay. Within current fiscal constraints, the broad structure and targeting of WFF is largely fit-for-purpose, and generally effectively balances different objectives. However, improvements are needed to address identified issues with the design of the system. 3 In addition to an ongoing need to improve the adequacy of incomes for families both on benefit and in work, there are issues with the design of our tax credits that mean that some groups see little return from working more. Our Appendix A Document 1 2 abatement settings mean that multiple payments across the tax and benefit system withdraw at the same time, and the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC) in particular has serious design issues. Receipt of the various payments also occurs across a complex ‘benefit-work interface’ that impacts not just on people’s experience of the system but also on outcomes. 4 Officials have identified several options under each ‘theme’ for the review: • Theme One: Improvements to the structure and design of in-work tax credits to help make work pay (beginning at page 17). • Theme Two: Improvements in the early years to assist with the costs of children and support preferences around work and caring for children (beginning at page 29). • Theme Three: Administrative and operational improvements to improve client experience and reduce debt (beginning at page 34). Theme One: Improvements to the structure and design of in-work tax credits to help make work pay 5 Officials have provided advice on five options that improve the design of the in- work payments, which all involve removing or replacing the MFTC. • Option one (‘a single in-work payment’) proposes a significant structural change by introducing a single and more targeted in-work payment that combines the MFTC and In-Work Tax Credit (IWTC). • Option two (‘an alternative MFTC’) proposes a smaller-scale change that largely keeps existing settings but replaces the MFTC with a similar, more flexible, payment for sole parents that abates gradually. • Option three (‘IWTC phase-in’) phases in the IWTC more gradually and allows beneficiaries to receive the payment while on benefit. • Option four (‘change benefit abatement settings’) retains the off-benefit rule for the IWTC and increases benefit abatement thresholds to better support families in part-time work. • Option five (‘a single family tax credit’) removes the IWTC and creates a single tax credit that improves incomes and helps make work pay . 6 One of the key decisions is whether to retain a ‘hard’ boundary between benefit and work, or whether to instead allow families in work to receive an abated benefit for longer. The diagram on the right shows the different choices for Ministers on the role of the in-work payments. Replace the MFTC with a new in-work payment (retaining the “off-benefit” rule) One in-work payment Option One: A single in- work payment Maintain two in-work payments Option Two: An alternative MFTC Remove the MFTC and provide more support for working people through a main benefit Allow beneficiaries to receive IWTC Option Three: IWTC phase- in Retain 'off- benefit' rule for IWTC Option Four: Change benefit abatement settings Remove the IWTC Option Five: A 'single' tax credit 3 •Options one and two retain the off-benefit requirement to qualify for the in-work payment, which provides a clearer pathway for people to move off a benefit and receive the more ‘light touch’ in-work payments paid by Inland Revenue (IR). •For options three to five, more working families will receive an abated benefit as their hours of work increase, and the boundary between benefit and work is more gradual. These options therefore mean more working families would interact with the higher-compliance benefit system. 7 The single in-work payment (option one) and single tax credit (option five) options involve significant system reform, and present quite different choices for Ministers on the design of WFF. •Option one increases incomes for working families and has a strong focus on making work pay through a single, more generous in-work payment. •Option five removes the in-work payments, relies solely on the Family Tax Credit (FTC) to financially support low to middle-income families, and provides income increases to both non-working and working families. The option modelled modestly reduces the gap between benefit and in-work incomes, but still aims to make work pay through more generous FTC abatement settings rather than through a specific in-work payment. 8 Options two to four are relatively cheaper as they are more tightly targeted and provide relatively small system modifications. They do not inherently include an adequacy-focused component, but they could be progressed alongside adequacy-focused changes and options from Theme Two below. 9 Officials recommend you consider the following important issues as part of subsequent advice on the in-work options: • Increasing the WFF abatement threshold to reduce overlapping abatement with the benefit system. For some options, changes to abatement settings are a necessary part of the design and therefore do not require separate consideration (options one and five). • How payments rates and thresholds will be adjusted over time (indexation) to ensure changes are future proof. 10 Table 1 on the next page provides a summary of some of the key trade-offs. We have modelled the options with initial parameters, and can model more variations of options, if for example, Ministers like the design of a particular option but would prefer to see the modelling of an option with a lower fiscal cost or greater focus on reducing child poverty. The fiscal costs are generally scalable, indicative and do not yet include operational costs or any behavioural impacts. For example, some options will see more people better off receiving a benefit and this has not yet been modelled. The key features and impacts of these options are outlined in more detail in the A3s in Appendix Two. 6 Best Start, could offer a combination of flexible and targeted childcare payments for both working and beneficiary families. Theme Three: administrative and operational improvements 17 Officials have identified five options to improve the accuracy of WFF payments, reduce WFF debt and improve client experience. Our view is that all options merit further analysis and development. 18 The options for improving accuracy are introducing grace periods, extending protected entitlements, and improving information exchange between MSD and IR. For managing debt once it is incurred, the options are introducing a buffer tax credit and increasing the automatic debt write-off threshold. 19 Officials have previously noted that there are fundamental delivery issues related to the joint administration of the tax credits that could be considered, but advice on these is largely dependent on what decisions are made regarding the different design options for tax credits in this paper. Implementation advice 20 When options are more fully developed, we will be able to provide more detailed advice on their potential implementation impacts on IR and MSD. The implementation timeframes provided are indicative only and are dependent on the specifics of the final design and what other work Ministers may require IR and MSD to undertake over the same period. 21 Options that only require changes in rates could be made relatively quickly (before 1 April 2024) if early decisions are taken ahead of Budget 2023. Options that require larger structural changes, such as some of the in-work options, could not be implemented until 1 April 2025, with other options likely to be able to be implemented on 1 April 2024. Child Poverty targets 22 The Review is a primary vehicle for achieving substantial reductions in measured child poverty and for making significant ‘headway’ towards achieving the ten-year targets, which are due to be achieved in 2027/28. 23 Current projections show child poverty rates on the income measures are estimated to be above the target rate for the current three-year targets, which are due to be achieved in the 2023/24 financial year. While any options that are implemented in mid-2023 would still have some impact on progress towards these targets, reporting methods mean that only around half of the impacts of an initiative would be reflected in the measured rates in the 2023/24 target year. Next steps 24 Officials will provide refined modelling and more detailed advice on the options identified for further work by Income Support Ministers on 9 August 2022. 7 Recommended actions It is recommended that you: 1 note that there are trade-offs between progressing options in this paper, as well as wider income support options (such as Childcare Assistance) and other Government priorities 2 note, for the in-work options, officials recommend you focus on narrowing down the options to two or three preferred options for further development and advice 3 note that options that assist with the costs of children in the early years (theme two) and improve administration (theme three) could complement the in-work options 4 note that officials propose that these options are discussed at the Income Support Ministers meeting on 9 August 2022 Theme One: improvements to the structure & design of in-work tax credits 5 agree to further advice on two or three of the following options: 5.1 introducing a single and more targeted in-work payment that replaces both the Minimum Family Tax Credit and In Work Tax Credit (option one) AGREE / DISAGREE 5.2 replacing the Minimum Family Tax Credit with a similar, more flexible payment for sole parents that abates gradually (option two) AGREE / DISAGREE 5.3 phasing-in the In Work Tax Credit more gradually and allowing beneficiaries to receive the payment (option three) AGREE / DISAGREE 5.4 retaining the In Work Tax Credit and change benefit abatement settings to better support low-income working families (option four) AGREE / DISAGREE 5.5 removing the In Work Tax Credit and creating a single tax credit that improves income adequacy and helps make work pay (option five) AGREE / DISAGREE 6 indicate if, as part of further advice on your preferred in-work option(s) in recommendation 5 above, you wish to include variations that increase incomes and child poverty impacts, at a greater fiscal cost (options six and seven) AGREE / DISAGREE 8 7 indicate if you would like to receive further advice on options to better support second earners through changes to Working for Families settings AGREE / DISAGREE Theme Two: improvements in the early years to assist with the care of children and support choices around work 8 agree to further advice on the following: 8.1 extending a targeted Best Start payment for low- to middle-income families with children aged three and four years (option eight) AGREE / DISAGREE 8.2 increasing the Best Start rate for low- to middle-income families with children up to age three (option nine) AGREE / DISAGREE 8.3 the merits of a Childcare Tax Credit payment relative to the improvements currently proposed in the Childcare Assistance Review AGREE / DISAGREE Theme Three: administrative and operational improvements to improve client experience and reduce debt 9 agree to further advice on the following: 9.1 giving Working for Families recipients a longer period of time in which to inform Inland Revenue of a change in circumstances (‘grace periods’) AGREE / DISAGREE 9.2 introducing or extending the periods in which payments are unaffected by subsequent earnings (‘protected entitlements’) AGREE / DISAGREE 9.3 improving information exchange between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development for people moving on and off benefit AGREE / DISAGREE 9.4 introducing an end of year supplement (‘Buffer Tax Credit’) AGREE / DISAGREE 10 PART A: CONTEXT, EVIDENCE, ENGAGEMENT, AND ASSESSMENT Background 25 In May 2021, Income Support Ministers agreed that the original WFF objectives of supporting income adequacy and reducing child poverty, and improving financial incentives for low-income earners to enter the labour market, remain important. They also noted that the third delivery objective, to achieve a system that supports people into, and to remain in, work by making sure they get the assistance they are entitled to in a timely manner, continues to be important regardless of the scale and direction of reform. 26 Income Support Ministers agreed that the Review focus on: • Low-income working families, while maintaining support for beneficiary families. • Options that target support to lower-income families rather than more universal support. • The principle of making work pay and assisting with the costs for people in work. 27 In April 2022, Ministers agreed to two themes for further advice on ‘making work pay’: • Improving the settings for in-work assistance and the work-benefit interface. • Assisting with the costs of children in the early years, particularly additional in-work and childcare costs. 28 Ministers requested advice on how best to remove or reform the MFTC, options for the reform of the IWTC (phasing it in, repurposing the funding for other options), and targeted options to extend Best Start. Across option development, Ministers requested a focus on simplicity and ease of use, and that specific consideration be given to how to improve the accessibility of WFF. 29 Ministers have requested officials’ high-level assessment of WFF, with a particular focus on whether the structure of WFF is ‘fit-for-purpose’ for low-and middle-income NZ families, and whether there are particular families that have not benefited from the payment system who should. Summary of evidence 30 As part of the Review, officials have brought together a range of evidence and analysis on issues relevant to WFF. This evidence helps us assess the effectiveness of the current WFF payments and/or better understand the context the payments operate in. 31 A summary of the key findings is attached to this report as Appendix One. Across this evidence, there are some issues which can be grouped around similar themes: 11 • New Zealand’s model of tax credits is not a significant outlier, and faces similar issues to many other countries. Officials have reviewed the design of different models of tax credits overseas, including Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada, and concluded that the design of WFF in New Zealand fits broadly within the spectrum of tax credit design in these countries. Other countries are similarly grappling with issues of balancing adequacy for working and non-working low-income families, while also maintaining incentives to work and making work pay. • In-work poverty is an increasing issue, as in many other countries. Sole earners, both sole parents and couples with only one parent working, have higher rates of income poverty and material hardship compared to households with two parents in paid work. Rates of poverty have also been increasing for this group, indicating a single income is becoming a less viable option for providing economic security and meeting basic needs. • WFF tax credits are an effective poverty alleviation tool for families with children, but choices about targeting involve trade-offs. Children in poverty are broadly evenly split between beneficiary families and the working poor, and can also be found across a range of low-to middle-income families. This means there are a range of different choices about how to target child poverty reduction, with different trade-offs around ‘coverage’ and cost-effectiveness, as well as different impacts on the relative levels of benefit and work. • While the gap between benefit and work has increased over the past two decades, issues with the design of WFF tax credits (and other income support payments) mean some groups see little return from working more. Between 2003 and 2022, the gap between benefit and work increased for all family types, primarily because of the implementation of WFF between 2004 – 2007 and subsequent increases both to the minimum wage and to wages more generally. However, some groups of families currently face very high Effective Marginal Tax Rates (EMTRs), particularly low-income sole parents and second earners. This often means work does not ‘pay’ and sometimes even means they are worse off the more they work – particularly if they have childcare costs. The extent to which ‘work pays’ is just one factor that influences employment decisions, but the evidence suggests that changes to financial incentives do have modest impacts on employment decisions, with sole parents and second earners responding more than primary earners. • There is a case for investment in the early years of a child’s life. The evidence has demonstrated that this is when children are the most vulnerable to the consequences of poverty, and when caregivers are least able to support themselves through employment in the labour market. There are also affordability issues associated with childcare for low-income 12 families in New Zealand, and that the costs of childcare make a considerable difference on the extent to which ‘work pays’. • Administrative issues impact not just on client experience, but also on adequacy and incentives. The policy objectives of improving income adequacy and making work pay is more difficult if clients are not receiving their entitlements, and there is room for improvement in ‘take-up’ of in- work payments. The administration of WFF is also a contributor to overall debt to government, which can be a considerable cost burden on low- income families and can also discourage work. Our high-level assessment of Working for Families 32 Ministers have requested officials’ high-level assessment of WFF, with a particular focus on whether the structure of WFF is ‘fit-for-purpose’ for low and middle-income families, and whether particular families have not benefited from the payment system who should. Our high-level view is that: • The introduction of WFF between 2004 and 2007 benefited low-income working families more than beneficiary families, and the significant reductions in child poverty it achieved were primarily for low income working households with children. However more recent changes as part of the Families Package in 2018 also provided gains for beneficiary families, and successive benefit increases in 2020, 2021 and 2022 have increased beneficiary incomes further. Both beneficiary and working families have benefited from WFF, though issues of income adequacy and poverty persist for both groups. • Since the late 2000s, WFF has become progressively more targeted to those on lower incomes, as incomes have increased faster than the abatement thresholds and abatement rates have been increased. While this ensures money is generally well directed to those who need it more, it has now reached the point where payments are beginning to abate for those on very low incomes - even for some families supported by benefits. Abatement now overlaps with other income support payments, creating pockets of very high marginal tax rates. • The 2004-07 WFF changes increased the margin between benefit and work and helped to ‘make work pay’, but the immediate impact on employment was relatively modest. Sole parents’ paid employment increased, but second earners decreased, which suggests an incentive payment has modest impacts on decisions to work in aggregate. • Officials believe there are significant issues with the design of in-work assistance, particularly the MFTC but also to a lesser extent the IWTC. There is also significant complexity in the system, not just in the number of payments and the design of their policy settings, but also in the delivery of some payments across two different agencies. 13 33 Overall, the broad structure and targeting of WFF currently achieves an effective balance between key objectives of income adequacy, fiscal cost, and maintaining financial incentives to work. However, further refinements are recommended to address identified issues. Insights from engagement 34 The engagement process as part of the review has now concluded. A separate report summarising key findings has been prepared for Ministers, but the following provides a summary from the process. The majority of feedback was from advocacy groups concerned with child poverty and broader social policy issues. • The majority of survey respondents were of the view that WFF does not currently pay enough to support families. Through targeted engagement, many stakeholders, including a number of academics and those representing groups that advocate for children, emphasized the importance of broader social policy concerns. From these groups, we heard that: o The objective of income adequacy and reducing child poverty is important and that the payments need to keep up with the cost of living to provide adequate support. o The IWTC should be paid to all families and not just those who are off a benefit and in paid work. These stakeholders argued that the payment was discriminatory or unfair, particularly given children were unable to choose whether their parents were working. They also emphasised the need to value other contributions people make, such as caring for children or voluntary work. • We heard mixed views on the importance of WFF as a work incentive and its role in supporting employment: o Through the survey most people thought WFF influenced work decisions. o Through targeted engagement many argued the IWTC was not effective as a work incentive, and that it was more important to remove barriers to employment (such as the costs of travel and childcare). o Several stakeholders thought reducing in-work poverty and making work pay was important – although they thought a ‘work incentive’ payment was not necessary to achieve this. o Other stakeholders, by contrast, emphasised the importance of financial incentives to work, and argued that, if anything, they should be strengthened. Some stakeholders cautioned against providing the IWTC to beneficiaries on these grounds. 14 • Across the engagement, stakeholders from a range of different perspectives noted that the current abatement of WFF payments means people often see little or no return from working more. • Another common theme was that the system is complex and can be difficult for families to access and navigate, particularly for families including disabled people or people for whom English is a second language. Concern around the creation of debt, particularly for families with changing circumstances, has also been a particularly strong theme. Context for assessing options Child poverty targets 35 The WFF Review is likely to present the best opportunity in the coming years to achieve substantial reductions in measured child poverty and to make significant ‘headway’ towards achieving the ten-year targets, which are due to be achieved in 2027/28. The 2022 Child Poverty Budget Report indicates significant further policy interventions are required to reach these targets, particularly on the BHC50 measure. Rates on the BHC50 measure are projected to rise from 2023/24 onwards, particularly due to growth in middle incomes. 36 Current projections also show child poverty rates on the income measures are estimated to be above the target rate for the current three-year targets, which are due to be achieved in the 2023/24 financial year. While any options implemented by mid-2023 would still have some impact on progress towards these targets, reporting methods mean that any impact would be only partial for the reporting on this period. • If Ministers want to increase the impact on measured child poverty, the options for improving the design of in-work payments could have their parameters altered to improve adequacy, be paired with other increases to payment levels (e.g. an FTC or IWTC increase), or be combined with some of the options from Theme Two. Guidance on the fiscal envelope would help subsequent options development here. • If Ministers want to make faster progress on child poverty, officials could consider sequencing and phasing. For example, by progressing simpler changes such as rate increases more quickly ahead of more fundamental design changes. We note, however, that in some cases this may constrain design options, by limiting your ability to use any increases to offset any losses created by changes in tax credit design. 37 This paper includes modelled estimates of the immediate impact of different options on measured child poverty, but it is important to note that reducing child poverty is not solely about increasing income transfers. Investments to help make work pay (either through WFF and/or childcare) also supports poverty reduction in the longer-term, though the impact is more incremental and difficult to discern on the measures. 15 Impact on financial incentives and employment 38 When assessing different options, an important consideration is their impact on financial incentives and employment. Financial incentives to work can be thought about both in terms of their impacts on decisions on whether \`to work at all (the ‘extensive margin’) and also decisions about whether to work more or less hours (the ‘intensive margin’). The options in this paper have different impacts on these aspects of financial incentives, depending on both their impact on the gap between benefit and employment, and their impact on EMTRs. 39 Changes in financial incentives are likely to have flow-on impacts on employment. As noted in Appendix One, the available evidence both in New Zealand and overseas suggests the impact of financial incentives on employment decisions is relatively modest, but it does have an impact. The impacts are greater on encouraging caregivers to enter work rather than on increasing hours of work. Irrespective of the extent of its impact on decision- making and behaviour, the extent to which work ‘pays’ and people see a financial return from working more is also important from the perspective of equity and fairness. 40 Throughout this paper, we have attempted to include a high-level assessment of the impact of the different options on financial incentives, but it is important to note that the impacts may vary for different groups, and they are also partially dependent on the parameters used to design the option (which could be adjusted). Subsequent advice on a specific option can consider the fuller range of impacts on financial incentives in more detail, and differentiate more by client group. This may be able to include modelling of impacts on labour supply. Implementation 41 When options are fully developed, we will be able to provide more detailed advice on the potential impact on IR and MSD of implementing these changes. The implementation timeframes provided for the options in this report should be treated as indicative only. They are current best estimates and are dependent on: •The specifics of the final design. •What other work Ministers may require IR and MSD to undertake. 42 It is preferable from an implementation perspective that changes to WFF be aligned with the beginning of the income year (1 April) rather than occurring part way through the year. Indicative timeframes have been framed on this basis. 43 While it is possible for changes to be implemented in the middle of an income year, such changes are complex to implement, and negatively impact on the accuracy of WFF payments resulting in both over- and under-payments for that 16 year. In addition, changes implemented during the year cannot be incorporated into the usual roll-over process and require new entitlement notices to be prepared and sent to customers. This can increase confusion for customers, which has a consequential administrative impact on IR. 44 Options that only require changes in rates could be made relatively quickly. For example, if Ministers wished to introduce an FTC rate increase applying from 1 April 2023, policy decisions would be required by early October 2022, with legislation being passed by early December 2022. These timeframes are necessary to allow IR and MSD sufficient time to make the required system changes by February 2023, and 2023/2024 entitlement notices to be provided to customers. 45 Options that require more structural changes, such as some of the in-work options, will take longer to implement. It is anticipated that most of the in- work options could not be able to be implemented until 1 April 2025, although some options could be implemented from 1 April 2024. 46 For MSD, options that allow a greater number of working families to receive a main benefit would require significant further work on fundamental parts of the benefit system, such as the definition of full-time employment and the approach to working beneficiaries. This may mean a longer implementation timeframe (beyond 1 April 2024). 47 Further advice on implementation dates is provided throughout the report, alongside options analysis. 17 PART B: OPTIONS FOR REFORM Theme One: Improvements to the structure & design of in-work tax credits (making work pay) 48 These options relate to the design of in-work tax credits to help improve incomes and support movement into work for low-to middle-income families. The options would be relatively targeted to households in in-work poverty, with a focus on providing more support for low-income primary earners. At the end of this section, we have an option that gives more financial assistance to encourage second earners to move into work. Issues with in-work payments and the benefit / work interface WFF is part of a complex system of payments across the ‘benefit-work interface’ 49 WFF includes two work-focused payments (the MFTC and IWTC), and two income adequacy-focused payments (the FTC and Best Start). They interact with tax settings and a wider suite of payments provided by MSD, the primary ones being main benefits and Accommodation Supplement. 50 Each payment has its own set of eligibility rules and abatement settings, and when delivered across two agencies it can make it challenging for people to navigate the system, keep their circumstances updated, and understand what they are entitled to and when they are better off. It can also result in very high EMTRs when payments abate at the same time (e.g. the FTC and main benefits, as outlined on the first page of Appendix Two). The MFTC is complex and not well integrated into the income support system 51 The MFTC is complex and not well understood by customers, which means it has lower take-up and awareness compared to other WFF tax credits. The MFTC’s ‘hours worked’ and ‘off-benefit’ tests can also make entitlement sensitive to any changes in work circumstances. These issues limit its effectiveness as a work incentive and income adequacy payment. 52 The rigidity to MFTC’s eligibility criteria can also result in under and over- payments of entitlements during the year. IR data shows that almost half of the 3,500 MFTC recipients are overpaid their annual entitlement during the year due to subsequent income increases, while most of the remaining MFTC recipients receive a lump-sum payment at the end of the year due to underpayments during the year. 53 The small number of stakeholders who commented on the MFTC suggested removing it, due to its complexity and the debt it often creates for families. Some elements of the MFTC and IWTC do not support making work pay 54 Due to recent policy decisions on how the MFTC threshold should be calculated, the MFTC no longer ensures that couples are financially better off moving off- 18 benefit. 1 The MFTC also now only ensures sole parents are financially better off moving off-benefit in the months when they are not receiving the Winter Energy Payment. 55 Additionally, the MFTC’s 100 percent abatement rate means recipients do not receive any additional income from an extra hour of work (even before any in- work costs are considered). For example, a sole parent in receipt of the MFTC and earning the minimum wage is financially no better off working 35 hours a week compared to 20 hours. 56 While the MFTC was designed to strongly incentivise part-time work, evidence from MSD shows that most sole parents who exit benefit into employment go into full-time work. This suggests the incentives provided via the MFTC do not align with the lived experiences of sole parents moving off benefit, or the availability of suitable part-time work, nor does it affect their work decisions. 57 There are also some issues with the IWTC, but to a lesser degree. While the payment reduces in-work poverty, some elements of the payment do not support making work pay, and there is mixed evidence of its effectiveness as a work incentive payment. Options to better support low to middle-income families through changes to the benefit / work interface 58 There are a range of options available to redesign and/or replace the MFTC, and some options propose redesigning the IWTC as well. Each option, to varying degrees, will: •Reduce child poverty. Including increasing financial assistance for low-to middle-income families. •Better support making work pay. Including reducing EMTRs of greater than 100 percent to ensure people are financially rewarded for increasing their hours of work. •Improve take-up, administration, and customer experience. Including simplification and greater integration of the MFTC (or any replacement tax credit) into the wider suite of tax credits. 59 We have provided five options that make improvements to the status quo, but all have significant trade-offs. One of the main high-level decisions that differentiate these options is whether to retain a ‘hard’ boundary between benefit and work. These trade-offs are summarised below and then expanded on further for each option. 1 Due to recent decisions not to increase the MFTC by the full amount suggested by increases in the benefit system. A partial increase avoided overlapping abatement with the FTC and reduced the fiscal cost of structural changes to in-work assistance as part of this review. 19 Options that replace, but maintain an in-work payment and the ‘off-benefit’ rule •Option One: A single in-work payment that combines the MFTC and IWTC into a single more targeted, flexible and integrated in-work payment. •Option Two: An alternative MFTC payment for sole parents that is more flexible and abates more gradually. 60 Maintaining an in-work payment and the ‘off-benefit’ rule will provide greater incentives to move off benefit and into a desired level of hours worked. These options provide a clear pathway for people to move off a main benefit and receive the more ‘light touch’ in-work payments provided by IR. 61 However, these options mean people are more likely to need to switch between MSD and IR systems if their hours worked change regularly, which can result in more under and over-payments across MSD and IR. There are some changes that could ‘soften’ this boundary, such as introducing grace periods and greater flexibility to assess hours worked. Options that remove the MFTC and provide more support for working people through a main benefit •Option Three: Phase-in the IWTC and allow beneficiaries to receive the payment. •Option Four: Changes to benefit abatement settings to better support low-income working families. •Option Five: A single family tax credit that still ensures work pays by removing the IWTC and redirecting it into the FTC. 62 Options three to five all involve a significant change in the role of main benefits to include supporting some families in close to full-time work, but they will result in more steady income changes if hours worked increase or fluctuate regularly. It could also support greater take-up of in-work assistance from MSD such as Accommodation Supplement and Childcare Assistance. 63 However, these options then require working families to interact with the higher-compliance benefit system which can include weekly income declarations and assessments, and meeting certain obligations. Currently take- up of FTC/IWTC is relatively high for those not receiving a benefit (at over 80 percent) and overseas research suggests there is a risk that the lowest-paid working families will not take-up benefit assistance from MSD. Low take-up is due to a wide range of factors including lack of awareness, compliance costs and stigma associated with the benefit system, which could undermine the intent behind these options. Option 1: Single in-work payment 64 This option combines the IWTC and MFTC into a new in-work payment to provide more support to low-to middle-income working families. It would: 20 •Replace the MFTC and IWTC with a new in-work payment that is a set amount (up to $310pw) that is broadly equal to the current IWTC and MFTC amount. •The new in-work payment abates gradually (e.g. at 30%), at the same abatement rate as but ahead of the FTC, as incomes increase. 2 •Annually adjust the income abatement thresholds to ensure incomes in work remain higher than on benefit (like current MFTC adjustments do). •Maintain the ‘hours worked’ and ‘off-benefit’ tests that are currently applied to the MFTC (i.e., beneficiaries don’t qualify, and sole parents need to work 20 hours a week and couples 30 hours a week). •Allow for some ups and downs of work hours from week to week (e.g., by using average hours worked across a month) and/or through grace periods to better support those with fluctuating hours. 65 The earliest this option could be implemented is 1 April 2024. The estimated annual cost of the option modelled is $675m, increasing in outyears due to indexation. Advantages 66 This option simplifies WFF as it merges two in-work tax credits into one, and better targets in-work assistance to low-to middle-income working families. It maintains the current incentives to move off benefit and work a particular level of hours and reduces EMTRs for families currently receiving the MFTC. 67 It has the potential to significantly improve income adequacy for working families, with around 170,000 households estimated to gain by $81pw. It is estimated to reduce child poverty by around 9,000 on the BHC50 primary measure, and 28,000 on the AHC50 primary measure. 68 The reductions in poverty are lower on the BHC50 primary measure partly because it increases the median income at the same time which can move additional families below the relative poverty line (whereas the AHC50 primary measure fixes the median income), and some low-income working families are made worse off. 69 This option may also result in modest increases in employment from having a more generous in-work payment (similar to the initial WFF changes in 2005/06), which could lead to modest reductions in poverty amongst the unemployed. As noted earlier, officials can provide further advice on possible labour supply effects of options in subsequent modelling. 2 The payment would begin to abate from where families in minimum wage work qualify for the MFTC ($25,000 for sole parents, and $37,400 for couples) and FTC would begin to abate immediately afterwards ($78,700 for smaller families) The order of abatement is switched to mirror the current MFTC, which abates ahead of the FTC (and IWTC currently abates last). 21 70 Some stakeholders noted that work incentives should be strengthened, and many stakeholders were supportive of a simplified system. Disadvantages 71 This option is likely to be relatively more costly than most other options ($675m p.a. and increasing in outyears due to indexation) because it provides larger income increases for working families. It can also result in higher EMTRs for relatively higher income families, which for them could reduce the financial incentives to work more hours. 72 Around 24,000 households will be financially disadvantaged because this option effectively reintroduces an hours-test to qualify for the in-work payment 3 . Most families who benefited from the removal of the IWTC hours test in 2020 are those who regularly work less than 20 hours and many have persistently low incomes below the BHC50 poverty line (rather than having variable working hours). It is likely that many of these families qualify for a main benefit on income grounds and would be financially better off doing so. 73 For customers who currently receive the IWTC, the re-introduction of an hours test could result in the same issues customers experienced when moving on and off benefit. In addition, re-introducing an hours test may be confusing for some customers, at least during the transitional period after implementing the change, which may result in increased customer contacts. 74 Officials can provide further advice on options that phase-in some of the new in-work payment sooner to help reduce the number of people worse off and provide more support for those with low and/or variable working hours. For example, officials could explore options to gradually phase-in the new payment and/or allow people to receive a portion of the payment earlier. Option 2: Alternative MFTC payment for sole parents 75 This option replaces the MFTC with an alternative payment for sole parents that is more flexible and abates gradually as incomes increase. This option: •largely maintains existing settings, except it abates the MFTC more gradually to modestly reduce EMTRs for sole parents (from 100% to 80%- 90%). •increases flexibility of the MFTC to improve coherency, customer experience, and reduce debt for families who have changes in family and work circumstances (e.g. through grace periods and/or measuring the work hours requirement over a longer time period). •annually adjusts the alternative MFTC and FTC abatement thresholds so that abatement occurs sequentially to ensure no overlapping abatement across MFTC and FTC for sole parents. 3 The hours test for the IWTC was removed in 2020 during the initial COVID-19 outbreak to allow people who faced reduced, or more variable, working hours to continue to qualify for the IWTC. 22 76 The earliest this option could be implemented is 1 April 2025. The estimated cost is $35m pa. Advantages 77 This option would better support the existing 3,500 sole parent MFTC recipients by modestly reducing EMTRs. It would also improve customer experience by adding flexibility through grace periods and measuring the work hours requirement over a longer time period. Disadvantages 78 This option does not address wider design issues associated with the benefit- work interface, simplify WFF, nor does it significantly reduce EMTRs for those receiving the MFTC. This option therefore has fewer design and simplification advantages relative to option 1, but does have a lower fiscal cost ($30m p.a., but increasing in outyears). 79 It would be challenging to keep an MFTC type payment for couples without significantly increasing fiscal costs to avoid very high EMTRs from overlapping abatement with FTC and the 30% income tax rate. There is also not a particularly strong rationale for incentivising low-income couples to work 30 hours and providing minimal financial returns for any additional hours of work. Evidence shows that primary earners in couples overwhelmingly work full-time and that they are least responsive to changes in financial incentives to work. 80 Officials recommend that if Ministers are interested in keeping an MFTC like payment, that it be only made available for sole parents. Improving incomes for couples would be better explored through other options in this paper. This would also avoid exacerbating financial disincentives for sole parents to enter a relationship. This option therefore means a relatively small number of couples with children will no longer be eligible to receive the MFTC. Option 3: IWTC phase-in 81 This option phases-in the IWTC to better help smooth incomes of low to middle-income working families. This option would: •gradually phase-in the IWTC. •allow working beneficiaries to receive the IWTC (remove the ‘off-benefit’ rule). •remove the MFTC. 82 The earliest this option could be implemented is 1 April 2025, with an estimated cost of $38m pa. There are also options to extend the payment to students. Advantages 83 This option is preferable if Ministers would like working beneficiaries to receive the in-work payment. It would provide more consistent returns from increasing 23 hours of work by ‘smoothing’ incomes for people in low-paid and part-time work, particularly if their income or hours worked change regularly. 84 This option would improve the incomes of around 41,000 low-income working households by an average $33pw and reduce child poverty by around 1,000 on both the BHC50 and AHC50 primary measures. Disadvantages 85 As noted earlier, this option would lead to more working people needing to interact with the benefit system for financial assistance. 86 Of the in-work options, it would be the most difficult to implement and administer on an on-going basis, and would likely lead to a higher incidence of overpayments and WFF debt. It would require timely sharing of information across MSD and IR and significantly more training for MSD staff on WFF to ensure full and correct entitlement. Officials can provide further advice on options to mitigate these impacts, including additional funding required to train and/or greater information sharing across agencies. 87 There would also be less clear messaging about how much work is ‘worthwhile’ to move off benefit. It would also mean a small reduction in income when people move off benefit when they no longer entitled to WEP during the winter period. Option 4: Changes to benefit abatement settings 88 This option removes the MFTC and reduces EMTRs for low-income working people by changing abatement settings for main benefits. This option would: •increase the benefit abatement thresholds from $160pw to $192pw to ensure people can continue to work 8 hours on the minimum wage before their benefit begins to abate (alternatively, this option could also reduce the benefit abatement rate). •remove the MFTC. •maintain, but there are options to adjust, the IWTC ‘off-benefit’ and ‘hours-worked’ rules. 89 Depending on detailed design, the earliest this option could be implemented is 1 April 2024. The estimated cost is $83m pa. Advantages 90 Changes to benefit abatement settings would increase the incomes of working beneficiaries by enabling those working part-time to keep more of their earnings. It would also provide income increases to AS recipients due to complex flow-on impacts and allow more low-income working families to receive a main benefit (such as those currently receiving the MFTC). 24 91 Increasing the benefit abatement thresholds to maintain the level of minimum wage work before benefits abate would benefit around 225,000 working households by an average of $8pw. 92 While this option is not strictly WFF, it does provide another way of removing the MFTC and achieves similar outcomes to phasing-in the IWTC without undertaking structural changes to WFF. Relative to phasing in the IWTC, it would be easier to explain and less complex. Disadvantages 93 This option carries a greater fiscal cost compared to options 2 and 3 ($83m p.a) with no additional reductions in child poverty (1,000 – 2,000 reductions across both BHC50 and AHC50 measures). The greater fiscal cost is because it also benefits families without children and has flow-on effects to AS. Officials can explore different variations to mitigate these impacts, such as options to only increase abatement thresholds for families with children and/or making consequential adjustments to AS settings. 94 The IWTC would still need to have either an hours-worked or off-benefit test, which means it can result in relatively large increases (or decreases) in financial assistance if hours worked change. Like the IWTC phase-in option, there would be more people receiving a main benefit and how much work is ‘worthwhile’ would become less clear. Option 5: Redirect IWTC into FTC to have a single tax credit that still ensures work pays 95 This option removes all in-work payments in WFF by redirecting the IWTC into the FTC and having one main WFF tax credit. This option: •removes the MFTC and IWTC, but increases the eldest child rate of FTC by $50pw, and subsequent child rate by $15pw. •increases the FTC abatement threshold to $50,000 and reduces the abatement rate to 25% to help make work pay. •introduces a two-tiered abatement regime to target increases more to lower-income working families and to reduce fiscal costs. 96 Depending on detailed design, the earliest this option could be implemented is 1 April 2024. The estimated cost is $540m pa. Advantages 97 A simple ‘rebalance’ of the $72.50pw IWTC into FTC without changes to FTC abatement settings would be a relatively cost-effective way of reducing child poverty but would significantly reduce the margin between benefit and in-work incomes. Many stakeholders, particularly social sector NGOs, recommended incorporating the IWTC into the FTC as their view was a work incentive payment was not needed and/or was discriminatory. 25 98 Making changes to FTC abatement settings, alongside rebalancing the IWTC into FTC, attempts to spread the income increases more equally across both benefit and working families to reduce the negative impacts on financial incentives to work. Stakeholders also saw making work pay as important and many of them recommended changes to FTC abatement settings as well. 99 This option would result in 235,000 households gaining by $46pw on average and reduces child poverty by around 24,000 on the BHC50 primary measure and 27,000 on the AHC50 primary measure. 65,000 non-working households gain by on average $66pw, while 170,000 working households gain by on average $39pw. The lowest income working households gain by relatively more, with an average gain of $46pw. 100 This option would significantly simplify WFF by having one main tax credit and remove the overlapping abatement currently occurring across benefits and FTC. However, it would require substantial changes to the way MSD and IR jointly administer WFF which may delay implementation until April 2025. Disadvantages 101 The option modelled increases the FTC by less than $72.50pw so relies on some of the lowest-paid working families, particularly smaller families, moving onto a main benefit to ensure they are not financially disadvantaged from the removal of the IWTC. In addition, households in shared care situations 4 or receiving AS would be financially disadvantaged due to complex interactions. It is estimated that this option will mean 24,000 households lose by $23pw on average due to the removal of IWTC and flow-ons to AS, and an additional 12,000 households in shared-care situations may also be worse off. 102 This option is one of the costliest ($540m p.a.) because it benefits the largest number of households as it provides income increases to both non-working and working families. The option modelled modestly reduces the gap between benefit and in-work incomes and therefore modestly reduces the financial incentives to work. It may also make any future changes to the FTC more expensive. Further advice could develop variations of this option that would provide relatively larger increases to working families and/or to reduce the number of people worse off due to flow-on impacts. Summary advice on the in-work options 103 All of the options provide improvements relative to the status quo and take some of the ‘rough edges’ out of the system related to the MFTC, either through a more gradual phase-in or phase-out of assistance, or through structural changes. 104 The single in-work payment (option one) and single tax credit (option five) options are relatively more expensive ($540m-$675m), have greater child 4 For people in shared care situations each parent can receive the full IWTC whereas the FTC is apportioned based on the share of care of the child. 26 poverty impacts (27,000 to 28,000 on the AHC50 measure), and between them they present quite different choices for Ministers on the design of WFF. •Option one better supports working families to meet in-work costs by simplifying, and increasing, the in-work payment to improve incomes and customer experience for working families. It recognises the importance of making work pay by maintaining an in-work payment to achieve this. •Option five removes the in-work payments, relies solely on the FTC to financially support low to middle-income families, and provides income increases to both non-working and working families. The option modelled modestly reduces the gap between benefit and in-work incomes. This option recognises the importance of making work pay through more generous FTC abatement settings rather than having a payment specifically for working people not receiving a main benefit. Officials’ view is that it is important to maintain a reasonable gap between benefit and work. 105 The MFTC replacement (option two) and IWTC phase-in (option three) options are relatively cheaper ($30-$40m) and would be more tightly targeted. However, these options provide relatively small system modifications compared to the status quo and have their own set of complexities. Changes to benefit abatement thresholds (option four) can achieve similar outcomes to both options above (at a slightly higher fiscal cost of around $80m) while leaving a system that is less complex system for customers to navigate. Options two, three and four are unlikely to result in significant improvements to income adequacy and child poverty reduction on their own so would be best complemented with increases to FTC payment rates or abatement thresholds, IWTC and/or BSTC. 28 Options for second earners to help meet the costs of working 112 So far, the options have been more focused on improving the benefit and work interface for primary earners (sole parents and single earner couples). However, there are also benefits to improving financial assistance for second earners at the same time to increase their labour market participation. 113 Firstly, households with one earner in the couple have higher rates of in-work poverty than dual-earner households. Secondly, the current family-based structure of WFF can reduce labour market participation incentives for second earners. Income support is targeted on a ‘per family’ basis which can mean that there are relatively high abatement rates and EMTRs for second earners looking to enter paid work. 114 Individual in-work assistance is found in some studies to have strong positive effects on employment rates for women in couples, such as in Italy and Ireland, following tax credit reform. A recent study in Australia has also highlighted the importance of employment for second earners as a mitigation against poverty in the event of a relationship breakdown. 5 Further information on this is provided in Appendix One. 115 Further work could be undertaken to explore options that would improve incomes and financial incentives to enter paid work for second earners. For example, one option is to base entitlement to the IWTC on the work circumstances of the individual. This could be achieved by allowing the second earner in the family to also receive the $72.50pw IWTC amount if they meet certain work requirements (e.g., are working 20 hours a week). 116 There are more trade-offs associated with options to increase support for second earners in couples because the options are likely to have greater fiscal costs and, if not designed effectively, they could also result in a reduction in hours worked for some second earners. 117 If Ministers are interested in providing better support for second earners through WFF then officials can provide further advice on different options, including exploring whether a specific tax credit for second earners would be more appropriate than an individualised IWTC (i.e. a Second Earner Tax Credit). A Second Earner Tax Credit would allow for more design choices and allow more/less targeting of the payment to increase/decrease the poverty reductions and fiscal costs. 5 https://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/research/reports/breaking-down-barriers/research- report-pages/report-5 29 Theme two: assisting with the costs of children in the early years 118 In New Zealand, the key income support payments for the early years are Best Start, Paid Parental Leave (PPL), universal subsidies for early childhood education (ECE) providers (zero to five-year olds), 20 Hours ECE, and the smaller CCA targeted to low-income working families. The FTC and IWTC are also available for eligible families with dependents aged from zero to 18 years. 119 In comparison with other OECD countries, New Zealand’s spending on formal ‘childcare’ for the zero-to-two age group is amongst the lowest per child in the OECD, but amongst the highest per child for ‘pre-primary education’ for ages three to five, (below only Belgium, Norway and Iceland). 6 This is driven largely by the universal 20 Hours ECE provision. Young children are most vulnerable to the consequences of poverty, and financial support in the early years can help counter this 120 A vast literature indicates that poverty in early childhood, aside from being detrimental to the health and wellbeing of children and their families in the ‘here and now’, is a risk factor for a number of negative outcomes, including lower school achievement, reduced earnings, poorer health, and differences in brain structure and function. A number of public policy academics specialising in family tax credits recommend that tax credits should be expanded for families with young children, not only because young children appear to be most vulnerable to the consequences of poverty, but also because mothers are least able to support themselves through employment in the labour market when their children are very young. 7 121 Evidence provides support for a greater emphasis on policies that support parental care and attachment in infancy; and childcare and early learning are more likely to have positive impacts for children once they are older (from three). There is also evidence on the importance of supporting disadvantaged families in particular, who may benefit from earlier ECE where the quality is high. This suggests income support to help enable choice around parental care is particularly helpful when children are very young, followed by more support for high quality childcare potentially from ages two or three, depending on factors such as the home environment and the quality of the childcare. 122 Access to childcare has a strong socioeconomic gradient. Research suggests that mothers from low-income households, the lowest paid occupation groups, and more disadvantaged mothers generally have higher rates of issues with affordability and access to childcare; whereas mothers in the higher skilled and higher paid groups have low rates of issues. Māori and Pasifika mothers are 6 OECD Family Database (2021), ‘Public spending on childcare and early education’ (based on purchasing power parity rates). 7 Duncan, G, Magnuson, K (2011), Collyer, et al., (2020), Troller-Renfree et al., (2022). 30 three-to-four times as likely to experience long-term childcare access issues than European mothers, which includes issues of suitability of childcare. 8 Best Start options to boost income adequacy for low-income families with young children 123 Increasing financial support in the early years would provide additional support at a crucial time for child development and improve flexibility for families to choose care options best suited to their individual circumstances. Enhancing the Best Start payment would provide more income to both working and beneficiary families with children, and would not be connected to childcare or work. Consideration could be given to increasing the payment for low-income families through one of the following two options, which could easily be scaled. Option Eight: Extending Best Start to eligible families with children up to age 5 124 You have asked for advice on options to extend a targeted Best Start payment for an additional two years up to the age of five. The current Best Start payment of $65 a week is a universal payment for families with a baby up to age one, followed by a targeted payment for the subsequent two years, up to age three (abated at 25 percent after family earnings exceed $79,000 pa). 125 We have modelled a payment rate of $40pw to eligible families with three- and four-year olds. This would cost an estimated $104m pa, reduce child poverty by around 5,000 on both the BHC50 and AHC50 primary measures, and an estimated 49,000 households would gain by an average of $41pw. 126 This option would help support low-income families who incur costs over and above the 20 Hours ECE provision and the Childcare Subsidy, as well as those families for whom formal childcare models may not be suitable (e.g. if working non-standard or variable hours, or for cultural reasons). It would help to recognise that many parents in New Zealand use a mix of formal and informal childcare and help to acknowledge the value of unpaid work and the costs of caring for children. The option does, however, focus on the age group where New Zealand’s spend is already high, relative to OECD standards, rather than the zero-to-two-year age group where it is comparatively low. Option Nine: Increasing payment rate to families eligible for Best Start up to age 3 127 This option would increase the rate of the Best Start payment to lower income families by an additional $40 a week, while keeping the current age settings for the payment. The universal payment of $65 a week for the first year would remain, and the targeted increase would apply to eligible families with infants under three years of age (provided their earnings are under $79,000 pa, with the payment abated at higher earnings). Families with an income of less than 8 Motu (2021) ‘Access to childcare: who has difficulty accessing affordable childcare?’, Isabelle Sin. 31 $79,000 pa would therefore receive a maximum Best Start payment of $109 a week in tax year 2024/25 for each child under the age of three. 128 Increasing the payment rate by $40pw to eligible families with a child up to age 3 would cost an estimated $156m pa, and reduce child poverty by around 5,000 on the BHC50 primary measure and 8,000 on the AHC50 primary measure. An estimated 68,000 households would gain by an average of $44pw. 129 Given the evidence for support targeted to the early years, and the fact that NZ spends less in the first three years of a child’s life on childcare, there could be merit in considering this option, which would allow for a longer period of personal care in infancy and/or additional support for either formal or informal childcare. This option would align well with the Government’s First 1000 days wellbeing objectives by supporting strong parent-child attachment and reducing stressors. It would then lead into the age that the 20 Hours ECE entitlement begins, as well as part-time work requirements for those on Sole Parent Support. Support for childcare Low-income families face the greatest barriers to childcare in relation to access and cost 130 Supporting parents with parental preferences for personal care also needs to be balanced with better enabling parental choices to work, particularly given the importance of employment in improving income adequacy, and child and family wellbeing outcomes over the longer term. The inability to access childcare that meets parents’ needs can have a significant impact on the long- term labour market outcomes of mothers in particular, and childcare costs can substantially weaken employment incentives. 131 In European OECD countries, and in New Zealand, low-income families face the greatest barriers to childcare in relation to both access and cost. The OECD recommends that countries should provide carefully targeted support measures that ensure public support reaches the parents who need it most, in order to preserve equity and boost work incentives – as opposed to the current situation of public childcare support often being effectively redistributed toward higher-income families who are more likely to use childcare, thus raising equity and efficiency concerns. 9 132 There are various options and levers to provide additional childcare support to low-income families outside of (or as part of) direct provision to providers. Some countries with child and family tax credits provide an unconditional child payment to families, irrespective of work, such as Canada’s Child Benefit, 9 OECD (2020) ‘Is Childcare Affordable?’ Policy Brief on Employment, Labour and Social Affairs. 32 whereas the Child Tax Credit in the US is conditional on work. 10 Other countries differentiate their tax credit rates according to the age of children to ensure families with younger children receive higher payments, such as Canada, which has an add-on for children under six, and Australia whose Family Tax Benefit Part B has a higher rate for children under five (and a Newborn Supplement payment) 11 . Repurposing the IWTC to support childcare costs 133 You have asked for advice on repurposing the IWTC to support childcare costs, such as a Childcare Tax Credit (CTC) in place of the IWTC, given the primary costs of working for parents with young children are childcare costs. While this would help many families, the evidence suggests it would also take payments away from working families in poverty who have no childcare costs. 134 Recent research on aggregated poverty rates show that rates are broadly similar across the age ranges. 12 Prior to the introduction of the Families Package in mid-2018 and Best Start, poverty rates were slightly higher for the early years, but the distribution is now relatively even by age of youngest child. Rates of in-work poverty are still prevalent for families with older children no longer requiring childcare, and single earner couple families have high income poverty rates, despite being less likely to require childcare with one parent at home. 135 Both employment and unemployment rates notably improve for sole mothers and partnered mothers as the age of the youngest dependent child increases. This might suggest that poverty rates would decline as children age and childcare costs are no longer a factor. Given that the evidence suggests otherwise, other factors are likely to play a role, such as separation rates increasing as children get older, and becoming a sole parent can be a trigger for poverty or material hardship. 136 In summary, the evidence on the distribution of in-work poverty amongst families suggests that a CTC that reimburses parents for childcare costs should not be in lieu of an in-work payment. Officials would not recommend repurposing the IWTC in this way, given many families in poverty would be worse off as a result. A more effective lever to address childcare costs is an age-related one, such as the Best Start options (or alternatively a higher rate of FTC for younger children). 10 It was made unconditional for a year as part of the COVID-19 response, which had a significant impact on child poverty reduction. 11 NZ formerly had higher FTC payments for older children, but the 2018 Families Package aligned the FTC rates and introduced Best Start for 0 – 2 year-olds. There is still a higher eldest child rate to reflect higher set up costs.\] 33 Establishing a standalone Childcare Tax Credit payment 137 Choices for a childcare tax credit largely fall between a formal CTC that is conditional on working (though could also include study and training), or an unconditional tax credit, which would essentially be similar to a transfer such as the FTC payment. A conditional Childcare Tax Credit tied to work and reimbursing parents for childcare costs would require some degree of verification of formal care used throughout the year. 138 Given there is already a requirement to do this as part of the Childcare Subsidy, we would advise that consideration of a CTC be on the basis of a payment in lieu of the current Childcare Subsidy. Further work could assess the potential benefits in replacing the Childcare Subsidy with a CTC, and whether there could be improvements in the administration for clients and delivery via one agency (IR), and improved take-up. Work to explore the relative merits of this approach would best be dealt with through the CCA review. 139 MSD have also provided advice on options to increase the generosity of MSD’s CCA, currently provided to low-income families. This advice includes options to increase subsidy rates, significantly increase the coverage of the subsidy for middle-income families (by increasing income thresholds) and substantially simplify the eligibility requirements and administration for parents. It will also explore the possibility of moving subsidies closer to meeting actual costs for parents, similar to a childcare tax credit. Some of these changes would provide a more meaningful contribution to childcare costs for low-income families and, combined with an enhanced in-work payment and Best Start payment, could offer a combination of flexible and targeted childcare payments for both working and beneficiary families. 34 Theme Three: administrative and operational improvements 140 This theme focuses on changes that would improve accuracy of payments, reduce WFF debt and improve client experience. Options address the third objective of the original WFF reform – supporting people into work (and to remain in work) by making sure they get the assistance they are entitled to in a timely manner. 141 While the options earlier in this report are anticipated to improve income adequacy, make work pay, and simplify the system, they do not address some of the underlying customer experience issues that are present within WFF, namely: •Annual income assessments and the requirement for families to estimate their annual income. Families therefore often face the choice between deliberately over-estimating income (reducing the risk of WFF debt but also the level of support they receive during the year) or risk under- estimating income (ensuring the receive full support during the year but with the risk that they will be overpaid and incur a debt). These issues are exacerbated for individuals who switch between being on and off benefit. •The difficulty families face when trying to understand how a particular change in circumstances (e.g. working more hours, taking a higher paying job, or entering into a relationship) might affect their WFF entitlements and relatedly, the practicalities of notifying of a change in the required timeframes. •The difficulty in understanding the more technical aspects of WFF, such as how BSTC interacts with paid parental leave resulting in overpayments and debt, or what amounts must be included in income estimates (for example gifts and loans). 142 These issues arise from the complexity of WFF policy design, which must then be made to work at an administrative level, and ultimately influence financial support and outcomes for families. 143 The options below attempt to address some of these issues. Although they could help with some issues after the fact to some degree, the issues around estimating annual income and the difficulty customers have understanding their entitlements are more fundamental to the design of WFF and not easy to fix in the shorter term. 144 The options are high-level, and do not detail the trade-offs that they would present. We would expect that each of these options will be supplemented with detailed modelling once further analysis is undertaken. 145 Work under this theme is closely linked to the wider Debt to Government workstream which has the dual focuses of ensuring debt recovery is fair, 35 effective, and avoids exacerbating hardship and of preventing debt from occurring so that it does not create future problems for those in hardship. Reducing overpayments 146 A key issue with administering WFF is the incidence of overpayments. As at April 2022, approximately 57,000 WFF customers had accumulated WFF debt of almost $250 million (being $178 million of overpayments and $71 million of penalties and interest). 147 Customers who receive the payments weekly or fortnightly during the tax year receive them in advance of the end of year calculation, based on an estimate of their family’s income. If the information held by IR is not accurate or is out-of- date, a customer might receive more WFF than they are entitled to, giving rise to WFF debt that must be repaid. 148 Customers are required to inform IR if they have a change in circumstances during the year that affects their WFF entitlements, including: changes in income, care arrangements, or relationships. Depending on when someone notifies IR of a change and when that change is updated in the system, payments received in the interim might have been too high, which would ultimately lead to a WFF debt at an end of year square up. 149 Through engagement we consistently heard concern that the current structure and administration of WFF is driving the creation of debt for families, and the negative impacts this has on families. We heard that families are fearful of incurring debt, and this acts as a barrier to receiving the financial support they need. 150 To help mitigate the incidence of WFF overpayments, there are several options that could be progressed as part of the WFF Review, outlined below. 151 Grace periods - Customers could be given an extended period of time after a change in circumstances in which to inform IR of that change without being liable to repay any overpayment made in the intervening period. For example, currently, if customers have a change of relationship status they would need to inform IR or MSD before the next WFF payment to avoid being overpaid. Instead, the customer could be given a grace period (e.g. two weeks) from the date of the change of circumstance to inform IR before being charged an overpayment. The indicative implementation date for introducing grace periods is 1 April 2024 at the earliest. 152 Extending protected entitlements - Customers who have periods during the year in which they receive MFTC, can end up with overpayments and debt if they have a higher paid job at other times in the year. To address this, the entitlements received in the low-income periods could be ring-fenced (deemed correct) even if later earnings would mean those entitlements would otherwise have been overpaid. This would be a similar approach to that taken for FTC, 36 when customers who receive the payment for a period in which they receive a main benefit are deemed to have received the correct entitlement for that period. The indicative implementation date for extending protected entitlements is 1 April 2024 at the earliest. 153 Improvements in information exchange - Improving the exchange of information between IR and MSD would improve the accuracy of WFF payments by ensuring IR and MSD have access to more timely, complete and accurate information about customers’ circumstances and would reduce the reliance on customers to advise of changes in circumstances. Options to improve the flow of information between IR and MSD could range from improvements to the existing data exchanges (e.g., including additional information or increased frequency) through to more fundamental changes to how information is shared (e.g., more real time information sharing or the development of a portal for MSD staff to access IR-held information). Any changes to the exchanges of information between agencies would require system changes for both agencies, the extent of which would depend on the nature and scale of the change. Managing WFF debt once incurred 154 Debt resulting from the overpayment of WFF can be particularly problematic for recipients on lower incomes and rely on WFF assistance to meet their living costs. The burden of debt repayments for these families is more likely to give rise to, or exacerbate, financial hardship and psychological stress. 155 The following two options are both aimed at reducing lower-level debt amounts and should be treated as alternatives to each other. Both options require consideration of current causes of debt when setting eligibility requirements and the amounts covered. These are not easy issues to solve. Officials would also need to know what other tax credit options are to be progressed under the WFF before being able to advise on appropriate levels for setting a buffer tax credit or automatic write-off amount. For example, if Ministers decide to progress other options that will reduce the incidences (and amounts) of WFF overpayments, then a lower setting for a buffer tax credit or automatic write- off amount may be appropriate. 156 Buffer tax credit – A buffer tax credit is essentially a refundable tax credit made available at the end of the income year. It would be first applied against any WFF debt a customer may have accrued due to over-payments. Where a customer has not accrued any WFF debt, the balance of the buffer tax credit could be paid as a one-off lump sum. A type of buffer tax credit is currently used in Australia. The method chosen for calculating the buffer credit amount would reflect the purpose Ministers wish the credit to serve. There are a range of methods for calculating the buffer amount, for example, using: •a percentage of each family’s entitlement 37 •a specified number of weeks of each family’s entitlement, and/or •a specified number of weeks of the FTC. 157 IR has indicated a buffer tax credit could be available from 1 April 2023. However, because the buffer tax credit would be processed at the end of the tax year, it would not be processed and paid until after March 2024. In any case, early decisions on other options would be required to allow sufficient time for officials to consider the appropriate buffer amount. 158 Increased automatic debt write-off threshold - Increasing the threshold for automatic write-offs for WFF debt (currently $50) could be considered as a means of clearing low-value WFF debt. During the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic, the automatic write-off threshold was temporarily increased to $200. An increased automatic write-off threshold could either apply to all customers or could be targeted to smaller groups with greater need (e.g. customers with income under a certain amount). Like the buffer tax credit, this option could apply from 1 April 2023. However, because automatic write-offs are processed at the end of the income year, it would not need to be processed until after March 2024. In any case, early decisions on other options would be required to allow sufficient time for officials to consider the increased automatic write-off threshold option. Miscellaneous amendments 159 Officials have identified a number of possible administrative changes that could be made to either simplify existing WFF Scheme or improve customer experience for certain groups of customers, including: •Amending the calculation of Family Scheme Income to exclude the income of a partner derived outside the relationship period. Although the issue itself is relatively simple to articulate, the solution is not straight forward. Further analysis on this option is still required to determine its feasibility. •Allowing IR to grant families the Independent Earner Tax Credit where their entitlement to it would be greater than their WFF entitlement. IR would determine the greater entitlement at the end of year square up, rather than during the year, to avoid complications. This option has an indicative implementation date of 1 April 2023. •Amending the MFTC’s work requirements to allow a two-week grace period (matching the IWTC grace period). This would allow workers, such as teacher aides, to continue receiving the MFTC over periods, such as school holidays, when work is not available. This option is contingent on whether Ministers decide to remove the MFTC and has an indicative implementation date of 1 April 2024. •Repealing the Child Tax Credit for the purpose of simplifying the WFF Scheme. The Child Tax Credit is a grand-parented entitlement that is only 38 available to approximately ten WFF customers. This could be implemented by 1 April 2023. 160 With regards to some of the above options with indicative implementation dates of 1 April 2023, legislation would need to be passed by early December 2022 to allow Inland Revenue sufficient time to make the required system changes by February 2023, in time to inform customers of their entitlements beginning from 1 April 2023. This would in turn require Ministers’ decisions by early October 2022 at the latest. Fundamental administrative options 161 Previously, officials had indicated that Theme Three could also consider longer- term, more fundamental administrative issues relating to how WFF payments are jointly delivered by IR and MSD \[refer IR2021/321\]. 162 Officials now consider that these more fundamental joint administration issues are largely dependent on the decisions on the different design options for tax credits covered earlier in this paper, particularly those that change payments across the benefit-work interface. Changes to delivery settings based on the options in this paper could be considered as part of subsequent advice. 163 MSD’s Transformation Programme, Te Pae Tawhiti, will provide opportunities over the coming years to explore improvements to clients’ experience of WFF, for example through enhanced information sharing ability with partner agencies. Longer-term changes could provide further opportunities to explore other changes to administrative arrangements but at this stage this is likely to be beyond the timeframe of this review.

The Aurora Centre, 56 The Terrace, PO Box 1556, Wellington – Telephone 04-916 3300 – Facsimile 04-918 0099 Report Date: 15 November 2022 Security Level: To: Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern, Prime Minister / Minister for Child Poverty Reduction Hon Grant Robertson, Minister of Finance Hon Kelvin Davis, Minister for Children Hon Carmel Sepuloni, Minister for Social Development and Employment Hon David Parker, Minister of Revenue Working for Families Review: Further advice on options to progress for Budget 2023 and beyond Purpose of the report 1 This report seeks agreement on a preferred Working for Families (WFF) option to progress for Budget 2023 and beyond. •a new, more generous, in-work payment (option 1), •a single tax credit with no in-work payment (option 5b), •retain the IWTC plus complementary changes (option 6). 2 A companion report on overpayments of WFF and administrative options, including a buffer tax credit, has been sent to you separately \[IR2022/512, REP/22/11/1111 refers\]. Together these two reports will form the basis for discussions on the next steps for the WFF Review. Executive summary 3 Following advice in July and October, Ministers requested further advice on: •Option 1 (new, more generous, in- work payment) and option 5b (single tax credit with no in- work payment), with variations, to improve the structure of the in-work tax credits •options to scale and phase the reforms to fit within a desired fiscal envelope ($200m-$400m p.a.) •an alternative option (referred to as option 6) that retains the In-Work Tax Credit (IWTC) and makes complementary changes within the existing structure of WFF •administrative and operational improvements, with a focus on the buffer tax credit. Appendix A Document 2 Working for Families Review: Further advice on options to progress for Budget 2023 and beyond 2 Significantly reducing fiscal costs of structural reforms requires some trade-offs 4 Reducing the fiscal costs of the options to within the fiscal envelope is challenging, and only feasible at the upper end of the fiscal envelope. If done at low cost, structural changes can lead to very high effective marginal tax rates ( EMTRs),or result in more families being financially disadvantaged. 5 The options presented in this paper therefore require finely balancing some important trade-offs. All the options, including their scaled variations, provide improvements relative to the status quo, either through significant structural changes (options 1 and 5b) or through changes within the existing WFF system (option 6). Summary of each option Option 1: A new, more generous, in-work payment 6 This option increases the incomes for working families and has a strong focus on making work pay through a single, more generous, in- work payment. The payment ensures families are better off ‘off-benefit’ when working a certain number of hours (i.e. 20 hours for sole parents and 30 hours for couples). There are two variations of this option: • Variation 1a: allows fam ilies to receive some of the payment before the hours test is met, before being topped up to the full amount • Variation 1b: allows families to receive all of the payment before the hours test is met. 7 Variation 1a has greater incentives to work more hours and better manages system integrity, by requiring a certain level of hours worked to receive the full amount of the significantly higher new payment. However, it can mean higher compliance for clients with fluctuating hours and is more complex to administer. Variation 1b is simpler, better accommodates variable work and may reduce the incidence of debt. However, having a large payment with minimal work requirements (i.e. as little as an hour a week) undermines aspects of the benefit system, and could risk potential gaming. 8 The best way to reduce the cost of this option (and its variations) to fit within the fiscal envelope is to introduce a two-tiered abatement regime. This would better target income increases to the lowest income working families and still help to make work pay. If Ministers prefer a lower in-work payment instead to reduce the cost, this would be best achieved through option 6. Option 5b: A single tax credit with no in-work payment 9 This option provides income increases to both working and non-working families. It removes the in-work payments but instead makes work pay through more generous Family Tax Credit (FTC) abatement settings. Officials’ view is that it is important to maintain a reasonable gap between benefit and work to ensure families see financial returns from working, but it is not essential to have a specific in-work payment to achieve this. Working for Families Review: Further advice on options to progress for Budget 2023 and beyond 4 review. Which option to progress depends on how Ministers see WFF operating for families and the relative weight put on certain objectives. Fiscal costs 14 The lower cost variations continue to meet the objectives for reforms, and provide a viable alternative if Ministers are comfortable trading-off smaller reductions in child poverty and a small amount of additional complexity. Option 1b is more expensive relative to the other options, and there’s more room to scale option 6 if Ministers prefer a lower cost option. Supporting income adequacy and reducing child poverty 15 The full cost variations have greater reductions in child poverty than the scaled variations. There are also differences in who gains across options: • Option 1 lifts the incomes of working families only which can limit the size of the poverty reductions achieved, • Option 5b benefits both working and non-working families, therefore benefits more families in poverty and has the greatest child poverty reductions. Option 5b benefits 84% of all sole parents compared to around 40% in option 1. Financial incentives to work / make work pay 16 All the options generally improve the financial incentives to enter work. Option 1 is the most favourable as it provides the largest income increases to working families, whereas option 5b has smaller improvements on average as it provides income increases to both working and non-working families. Benefit/work interface 17 The biggest choice for Ministers here is whether to encourage movement off benefit after a certain number of hours worked (option 1) or instead let working families receive an abated benefit for longer (option 5b and 6). Under options 5b and 6, main benefits play more of a role in supporting low- income workers instead of the more generous in-work payment in option 1. Simplifying the system 18 Most of the options are likely to help to reduce overpayments, depending on the detailed implementation design. Options 1b and 5b have the greatest advantages from a client and delivery perspective, whereas Option 1a has less benefits for families working variable hours. The lower cost variations also simplify WFF, but add a small amount of complexity relative to progressing the full cost options due to two tier abatement (option 1a/b) and phasing (option 5b) – which increases complexity in the short term. Next steps 19 Each option requires significantly more detailed policy design work given the complexities associated with structural reforms. If you wish to progress changes through Budget 2023, officials recommend you choose one preferred Working for Families Review: Further advice on options to progress for Budget 2023 and beyond 5 option for further consideration. Officials can provide more advice on your preferred option in early 2023, including advice on: • the design of specific policy parameters, as changes to these can further alter the costs and impacts of each option (noting that significant further scaling is limited), • updating the fiscal costs using HYEFU (rather than BEFU 2022) and including operational/IT costings, and • transitional arrangements for families financially disadvantaged (at an additional cost), flo w- ons to other assistance and implementation advice. Recommended actions It is recommended that you: Variation of option 1 note that officials recommend that you focus on one option for further development for a Budget 2023 bid 2 agree to further advice on one of the following options: 2.1 a new, more generous, in-work payment, that has: a. a higher payment rate when hours worked test is met (option 1a) AGREE / DISAGREE b. no hours worked test (option 1b) AGREE / DISAGREE 2.2 a single tax credit with no in-work payment (option 5b ) AGREE / DISAGREE 2.3 retain the IWTC plus complementary changes ( option 6). AGREE / DISAGREE Scaling and phasing 3 note that the scaled variations require balancing some key trade-offs across fiscal costs, child poverty reduction, making work pay, and minimising unintended consequences. 4 indicate if, as part of further advice on your preferred in-work option in recommendation 2 above, you wish to focus on: 4.1 the variations of options that have relatively higher fiscal costs (i.e. full cost 1a, 1b, or 5b), OR AGREE / DISAGREE 4.2 the scaled or phased variations that fit within the fiscal envelope (i.e. scaled versions of 1a or 1b, phased version of 5b, or option 6). AGREE / DISAGREE Working for Families Review: Further advice on options to progress for Budget 2023 and beyond 6 5 note that officials will provide more detailed advice on setting payment rates and thresholds to ensure the preferred option is consistent with the scale of reforms agreed to in recommendation 4 above. Next steps 6 agree that subsequent advice in early 2023 include detailed policy and implementation decisions required to fully develop the options to inform a Budget 2023 bid.

Providing timely and accurate entitlements to families also remained important. Ministers also agreed the WFF Review should focus on: • Low-income working families, while maintaining support for beneficiary families • Options that target support to lower income families rather than more universal support, and • The principle of making work pay and assisting with the costs for people in work. 21 These have guided the development of the options one and five presented in this report 1 . Any options will continue to be assessed against these objectives and focus areas, as well as other trade-offs such as fiscal costs. Child poverty targets 22 The Government’s three-year (intermediate) child poverty reduction targets (to be assessed in 2023/24) aim to support the achievement of the ten-year targets. The reforms considered in this paper won’t affect the second intermediary targets for 2023/24 due to implementation timing, but the WFF review is a key mechanism to make progress towards the 10-year targets 23 The ten-year targets require the Government to aim to reduce child poverty on the before housing costs primary measure (BHC 50) to 5% (approximately 60,000 children) and the after-housing costs primary measure (AHC 50) to 10% (approximately 120,000 children). Substantial WFF changes will make an important contribution, but further significant investment will likely be required in Budgets 2024 and Budget 2025 to achieve the 10-year targets. Financial incentives to work 24 Previous advice noted that the available evidence in New Zealand and overseas suggests the impact of financial incentives on employment decisions is relatively modest, but it does have an impact 2 . Increasing in-work incomes and ‘making work pay’ can increase the financial incentive to work for sole parents but decrease it for some second earners. 25 For example, the original WFF reforms between 2004-07 resulted in an additional 8,100 sole parents in work (a 1.8ppt increase) and 9,300 fewer 1 Ministers have discounted options 2, 3 and 4 presented in previous advice REP/22/7/682, DPMC- 2021/22-2539, IR2022/145, T2022/1644. 2 The impacts are broadly greater on encouraging caregivers to enter work rather than on increasing hours of work. Working for Families Review: Further advice on options to progress for Budget 2023 and beyond 8 second earners (a 2.3ppt decrease). The labour supply response was relatively modest in the context of the $1.5b p.a package 3 . 26 It is difficult to assess the impact of our options on labour supply because: • different family types respond differently to changes in financial incentives, and any such impacts are dependent on the parameters used to design the option (which are regularly being refined). • there are non-quantifiable factors, such as changes in the accessibility and flexibility of payments. • there isn’t a labour supply model within government agencies that would be readily available to use, and the recent commissioning for lower cost options has meant reprioritisation of modelling resources. 27 Our initial view is that the scaled variations of the options are more modest than the original WFF reforms in 2004-07 and will likely have relatively smaller impacts on aggregate labour supply. Option 1 is likely to increase labour supply for sole parents and decrease it for second earners. The impacts of option 5b (single tax credit) would be more challenging to quantify, but officials consider its impact on labour supply to be neutral at best (even if it increases the returns from working for many) given it also increases the incomes of both working and non-working families. 28 Investment in labour market programmes, and other forms of in- work assistance can also help support positive labour market outcomes. For example, the recently announced changes to the Childcare Assistance income thresholds will help improve the financial incentives to work. Administration and family experience 29 Eligible working families can currently receive an abated benefit from MSD, or the IWTC from Inland Revenue ( IR) (and MFTC if eligible). Families can qualify for both at the same time but may only receive one or the other. 30 While we generally expect families will choose the payment that provides them with the most financial support, this isn’t always the case. MSD data suggests there are around 5,000 benefit recipients who would financially gain from receiving the MFTC/IWTC instead, and there are IWTC recipients who would be better off receiving an abated benefit. There are several reasons why, such as a lack of understanding of what payments make families ‘better off’, as well as non-financial factors (such as compliance costs and stigma). 31 There are compliance costs for families having to switch between benefit and work, with two different delivery agencies administering either benefit or tax credit payments. This can result in under or overpayments of WFF, and leads to debt to government. 3 Changing Families’ Financial Support and Incentives for Working: the summary report of the evaluation of the Working for Families package, 2010. Working for Families Review: Further advice on options to progress for Budget 2023 and beyond 10 families do not update their hours, or switch between benefit and the payment, debt may be created. Greater for work incentives: A top-up once the hours test is met provides stronger incentives to work the desired level of hours. Clients working a small number of hours are significantly better off receiving an abated benefit, which balances the State paying financial support with requiring clients to meet work obligations. higher new payment at lower hours of work if they choose not to be on benefit. The payment rate of $310pw is comparable to the single rate of Jobseeker Support, currently $315pw, but has no work obligations, which require clients to be looking for work in order to receive financial support at no or low hours of work. However, it would be more amenable for people working variable hours week to week. Reducing costs for option 1 is best achieved through a two-tier abatement regime, rather than a lower payment rate 37 The most cost-effective way to lower fiscal costs while maintaining the policy intent of this payment is to introduce a two-tier abatement regime. This would reduce the fiscal costs by more tightly targeting income increases to working families on relatively lower incomes, and provide smaller increases to relatively higher income families. 38 The full cost variation has a single abatement rate of 30%. We have modelled a scaled variation that has higher abatement at low incomes (55%), and lower abatement at higher incomes (30%). This would replace the high EMTRs associated with the MFTC and replace it with more moderate EMTRs over a slightly wider income range. 5 It increases complexity relative to the full cost variation, but still offers some simplicity relative to the status quo as it reduces the number of in- work payments. 39 Officials also explored whether a lower payment rate would help reduce fiscal costs and continue to support the wider outcomes sought under this option. On balance, the payment rate would likely need to be reduced significantly to fit within the fiscal envelope provided – to levels that do not ensure families are better off off-benefit at the same level of hours worked (i.e. 20/30 hours of work). If Ministers prefer a lower in-work payment, then progressing option 6 is recommended instead. Summary of impacts 40 The full cost variations have the potential to significantly improve income adequacy for working families, and reduce child poverty. If option 1 is scaled, it would reduce the fiscal costs by approximately half and result in relatively lower income increases and child poverty reductions. 5 The higher abatement of 55% can be done at lower incomes before the AS begins abating (at 25%). F or AS recipients this means the abatement rate would be 55% in total across both payments. Working for Families Review: Further advice on options to progress for Budget 2023 and beyond 12 earlier, this can mean compliance costs and debt for families if they switch between benefit and work due to a change in work circumstances. This could potentially be mitigated by applying the existing IWTC grace period. 46 Option 1b doesn’t have an hours test which also helps with the client experience at the benefit work interface, like IWTC currently. Inland Revenue prefers not to re-introduce an hours test given the administrative complexity and potential impact on debt, all else equal. 47 To illustrate the potential benefits of no hours test, we analysed administrative data on the impact of the removal of the IWTC hours test from 1 July 2020. W e estimate that approximately 7,200 families potentially benefitted from the removal of the IWTC hours test in the 2020-21 tax year. Of these, most families (80%) had family incomes less than $40,000 before tax, and just over half had transitioned on/off benefit during the year. 48 Some other comparable countries also have in-work payments, like the United States and Canada, however their equivalent payments are at much lower levels and function more as an income adequacy back stop for working families (more like option 6 or the status quo). Option 5: A single tax credit with no in-work payment 49 Option 5b creates a single tax credit by removing all in -work payments and redirecting the funding into the FTC. This option supports income adequacy for families with children and aims to make work pay by making FTC abatement settings more generous, instead of having an in-work payment. 50 It increases the FTC eldest child rate (by $50pw) and subsequent child rate (by $15pw). It also makes abatement settings more generous by increasing the abatement threshold from $42,700 to $60,000 and reduces the abatement rate from 27% to 25%. Earnings above $80,000 are abated at 30% via a two-tiered abatement regime. 51 Ministers requested further advice on the variation of option 5 that includes moving part of the benefit rates into FTC at the same time. This doesn’t mean a reduction in beneficiaries’ total incomes, but it means a small reduction in benefits to go with the larger FTC increases. Rebalancing benefits saves around $200m, shifts the balance of gains more towards working families, while still providing income increases to non-working families, and makes the option more neutral on work incentives (given the removal of the IWTC). 52 In practice, this means that main benefits rates for couples ‘with’ and ‘without children’ will be the same, with additional support for children provided solely through the FTC. This would bring settings back to how they were post WFF reforms in 2004-07 through to early 2016. Reducing costs for option 5b is best achieved by phasing it in, rather than scaling it down 53 There is limited scope to significantly change payment rates and abatement settings to a level where it reduces costs to within the desired fiscal envelope. Working for Families Review: Further advice on options to progress for Budget 2023 and beyond 14 flow-on impacts. These issues are summarised below, with more information included in Appendix Two. • A small number of losers for families in shared care situations, as families with shared care of children have the FTC apportioned, while both parents can receive the full amount of IWTC • Some working families receiving a small reduction in their AS and IRRS due to an increase in the amount families need to contribute to their housing costs while receiving these payments, and • Some Orphan’s Benefit (OB), Unsupported Child’s Benefit (UCB) and Foster Care Allowance (FCA) families as they are eligible to receive the IWTC but not the FTC. 60 Some families may also be financially disadvantaged due to the FTC increases proposed for the eldest child rate being lower than the IWTC reduction (to manage costs). Some of these families may currently be eligible to receive a benefit and would financially benefit from transitioning onto one. 61 There are options to mitigate most of the issues discussed in this section, but they require more detailed policy development and consideration. Further advice and modelling on mitigating these impacts, including fiscal costs, will be provided in subsequent advice (if this option is preferred). Option 5b also improves the return from working more 62 Option 5b improves the financial return from working more compared to the status quo for many households. This is primarily due to the inclusion in this option of the main benefit rebalance into FTC. In particular, this option provides greater returns from working for primary earners in couples and sole parents earning just above the minimum wage. 63 While it generally improves the financial incentives to enter work, it does so by less than option 1. Due to the removal of the MFTC, it may also reduce the returns from working part-time for some sole parents and how much work ‘is worthwhile’ may become less clear. However, as noted in previous advice the MFTC is not well understood and has relatively poor take-up. 64 Ministers could also explore extending WEP to working families in receipt of WFF to improve the financial incentives to work at relatively lower cost. This could be through a lumpsum payment at the end of the tax year, due to tax credits having an annual entitlement unlike main benefits. Officials can provide further advice and modelling if Ministers are interested in exploring this further, noting it is likely to be administratively complex and unlikely to be implemented quickly. 65 In the context of the original advice on option 5 (without the main benefit rebalance included), Ministers requested advice on whether changes to tax settings would improve the work incentives of this option. Advice on this is provided in Appendix Three. Working for Families Review: Further advice on options to progress for Budget 2023 and beyond 15 Administrative and client experience 66 This option could be implemented from 1 April 2024 at the earliest 8 , and would require primary legislative change and changes to the benefit system. Option 5b would mean main benefits and FTC become the primary payments for providing financial assistance to working families on very low incomes and/or working part-time. 67 This means more working families would be incentivised to receive an abated benefit (instead of tax credits currently), which comes with some important trade-offs. Any impact on benefit numbers is highly uncertain, likely to be relatively small within the context of changes to wider economic conditions (estimated at around 3,000 additional families) and would happen gradually over time. Ta k e-up rates for benefit may be lower due to the relatively higher compliance associated with the benefit system compared to tax credits. 68 At the same time this option also has some advantages. It could reduce the incidence of debt, due to a significantly simplified tax credit system. In addition, m any low-income working families are likely to also be eligible for AS and childcare assistance, which could lead to higher take-up across a wider suite of in-work supports provided by MSD. 69 If this option is progressed, main benefit settings will need to be amended to allow sole parents with children aged 14+ to receive Sole Parent Support (instead of Jobseeker Support), and to allow couples with one partner working full time to continue to receive an abated benefit for longer. These changes are technical in nature (and described in more detailed in Appendix Two) but allow working families to be better able to receive an abated benefit. 70 This structure of payments would be consistent with how Australia supports families with children, as they don’t have a specific work focused payment. Similarly, with the UK’s implementation of their universal credit they will no longer have an in-work tax credit (the design of the NZ’s IWTC was originally based off the UK’s in-work tax credit). These countries therefore rely on higher abatement thresholds for working families to help make work pay rather than through a specific in-work payment. Option 6: Retain the IWTC plus complementary changes 71 At the last Income Support Ministers meeting, it was requested that officials explore an additional option that removes MFTC and makes complementary changes within the existing structure of WFF, such as adjusting abatement thresholds, increasing rates, and possible changes to Best Start or WEP. 72 Such an option could be progressed instead of fundamental reforms, particularly if Ministers find the lower cost structural reform options do not 8 Recommended changes to the benefit system are not possible for 1 April 2024, with earliest implementation in 2025, dependent on other priorities. Working for Families Review: Further advice on options to progress for Budget 2023 and beyond 17 Option 6a ( with FTC increase) 78 This option has the potential to improve income adequacy for both non- working and working families, with relatively larger income gains to working households ($32pw), compared to non-working households ($11pw). Option 6a benefits 138,000 couples (29% of all couples), and 132,000 sole parents (86% of all sole parents). Option 6b (with IWTC increase) 79 This option has the potential to significantly improve income adequacy for working families only, with around 169,000 working households estimated to gain by $48pw. It benefits 122,000 couples (26% of all couples), and 55,000 sole parents (36% of all sole parents). The lower impact on sole parents reflects that, like option one, this option does not provide gains to beneficiary families, who are largely sole parent families. 80 A scaled down version of the IWTC increase for working families could allow for an accompanying increase in Best Start, which would go to both working and beneficiary families. Discussion on the options 81 Which variation of this alternative option to progress largely depends on whether you want an increase that is directed to working and beneficiary families (option 6a) or only working families (option 6b) . If option 6 is preferred, officials can provide additional variations for further consideration. 82 If Ministers see these options as an interim step ahead of larger structural reforms (through either options 1 or 5), then any interim changes progressed also need to be consistent with the desired longer-term outcomes (covered further in Appendix Four). 83 If Ministers would like to progress option 1 in the longer-term, then the variations of option 6 would be consistent with the outcomes being sought in option 1 and would not preclude implementation of this option at a later stage. The main difference between a higher IWTC (option 6b) and the variations of option 1 is that the IWTC does not ensure families are better off after working a certain number of hours. 84 If Ministers would like to progress option 5b in the longer-term, then option 6 would not be recommended because neither variation of option 6 provides a cost-efficient pathway. In particular, increasing the IWTC would not be recommended if Ministers would like to remove the payment at a later stage. Officials would instead recommend phasing in option 5b. Administrative and client experience impacts 85 Option 6 could be implemented from 1 April 2024 at the earliest, and would require primary legislative change and possible changes to the benefit system. It would involve less fundamental redesign and instead focus on improving income adequacy and smoothing EMTRs for families on very low incomes within the existing structure of WFF. Working for Families Review: Further advice on options to progress for Budget 2023 and beyond 18 86 The removal of the MFTC may result in more working sole parents continuing to receive an abated main benefit for longer, but to a lesser degree than option 5b due to the retention of the IWTC. For couples, there would be little impact on administrative and client experience compared to the status quo. 87 All the benefit interface changes recommended under option 5b (Appendix Two) are likely to be recommended under this option as well, to ensure working families are better supported through the benefit system 11 . A framework on the role of in-work payments 88 A framework for the role of in-work payments is provided below. Making work pay remains an important policy objective across all the options, but the role and size of the in-work payment/s differs across each of the options. Which option to progress depends on the relative weight put on the different trade- offs and objectives by Ministers. Next steps 89 Officials recommend that Income Support Ministers proceed with a preferred option for consideration through Budget 2023. Subsequent advice in early 2023 will reflect any feedback provided on this paper and include more details on the parameters of your preferred option, including: • Refining the detailed payment rates and thresholds in line with the feedback provided by Ministers • Updating the fiscal costs using HYEFU (rather than BEFU 22), and including operational/IT costings 11 Changes to the benefit system are not able to be implemented until 2025 at the earliest. Working for Families Review: Further advice on options to progress for Budget 2023 and beyond 19 • Transitional arrangements for any families financially disadvantaged, at an additional cost, and flow-ons to other assistance (such as to Community Services Card and the Best Start abatement threshold) 90 We will include more detailed advice on implementation and administrative settings (including operational costs) for the preferred option. The implementation timeframes provided in this report are the current best estimates and are dependent both on the specifics of the final design, and other work Ministers may require IR and MSD to undertake, such as a potential income insurance scheme. Working for Families Review: Further advice on options to progress for Budget 2023 and beyond 20 Appendix One: A3 summary comparing options 1, 5 and 6 (Attached separately) Working for Families Review: Further advice on options to progress for Budget 2023 and beyond 21 Appendix Two: More detailed considerations Impacts of specific family types Table 1: FTC and IWTC current settings FTC IWTC Payment structure Paid per child Higher rate for eldest child Paid per family, but additional $15 per child for 4+ children Shared care Payment apportioned based on care Payment not apportioned, both parents can receive it if they qualify OB/UCB/FCA Not eligible (analogous to FTC). Eligible. Shared Care 91 Under the status quo, families with shared care of children have the FTC apportioned, based on the division of care of the child, while both parents can receive the full amount of IWTC. There are approximately 25,000 families in shared care representing around 6-7% of WFF recipients, with around 16,000 of these receiving both the FTC and IWTC 12 . 92 Under option 1, both parents in shared care arrangements will be eligible for the new in-work payment, like the IWTC. The new payment is significantly more generous and may create greater integrity risks for partnered families to falsely claim they have separated. This risk will be greater under option 1b, where the full payment is available without an hours test. 93 Under option 5, without any changes, some families in shared care will be worse off from the removal of the IWTC and MFTC. Both families which previously received the full IWTC would instead receive an apportioned FTC. There are options to reduce the number of families financially disadvantaged by these changes, and we can provide further advice if option 5 is a preferred option. These may increase costs. 94 Both variations of option 6 maintain the IWTC, therefore no changes to shared care are required. Orphan’s Benefit, Unsupported Child’s Benefit and Foster Care Allowance 95 Under the status quo, families who are receiving OB, UCB or FCA are ineligible to receive the FTC as the payments are considered analogous. These families can receive the IWTC and MFTC. There are approximately 16,000 OB/UCB/FCA caregivers, caring for 25,000 children. 96 Under option 1, these caregivers will be able to receive the new in-work payment, if they meet the eligibility criteria. No changes are required to rates of OB/UCB/FCA as there are no changes to the FTC. 12 Around 4,500 only receive the FTC, and 4,000 only receive the IWTC. Working for Families Review: Further advice on options to progress for Budget 2023 and beyond 22 97 Under option 5, families who currently receive the IWTC will be worse off if no changes are made 13 , as these families will not benefit from the increase to the FTC and will lose entitlement to IWTC. An increase to the rates of OB/UCB/FCA could be made to flow through any increases to the FTC. This would see an increase in rates for all caregivers, not just those who received the IWTC. There are choices around how much to increase the rates by which may increase costs. 98 Under option 6, the IWTC is retained, therefore no significant changes to OB/UCB/FCA are required. If you progress an FTC increase (6a is currently modelled with a $5 FTC increase) you could pass on the equivalent increase to OB/UCB/FCA rates at a small cost, as had been done previously. Benefit/work interface under options 5 and 6 99 Currently Sole Parent Support recipients (youngest child is aged under 14) can work any number of hours, until their benefit has abated to zero. However, Jobseeker Support (JS) sole parents (youngest child is aged over 14) and couples have some restrictions on work, due to the 30-hour rule 14 . 100 This means complementary changes to the benefit system are required for options five and six, to better support more working families to receive an abated benefit (outlined below). Some of these issues already exist under the current system, given the eroded value of the MFTC, but may be exacerbated under options five and six. • Move JS s ole parents onto Sole Parent Support ( as was the case pre 2013 welfare reform): This change would allow sole parents with older children to receive an abated benefit for longer, like other sole parents, while retaining full time work obligations that currently apply under JS 15 . • Make changes to settings for couples receiving JS: - changes to JS to allow couples to qualify without meeting the requirement to be available for full time work, if one person in the couple is already working full time and they have children under 14 - changes to work obligations for couples who qualify through the above exemption to ensure they better reflect the age of dependent children - process improvements for switching the primary recipient to support couples to receive an abated benefit for longer while on low incomes. 101 These changes require more policy work if either option 5 or 6 is preferred, and detailed advice can be provided in early 2023, including operational and flow on costs. 13 E stimates suggest that this may affect around 3,000-3,500 families, but further work is required. 14 Primary recipients are unable to qualify for Jobseeker Support if they are working ‘full time’ which is defined in the Social Security Act as 30 hours per week. 15 There are currently no full-time obligations under Sole Parent Support so this would require introducing them Appendix Three: Tax changes and the impact on work incentives 1 After the Income Support Minister’s meeting on 5 October, Ministers requested advice on whether a change in tax would have an impact on work incentives for Option 5. The options in this paper have different impacts on financial work incentives, with all options (apart from scaled or phased) improving work incentives for sole parents working minimum wage compared to the status quo. However, the options are not particularly favourable for second earners for some hours of work. 2 Options 1a, 1b, and 6 retain an in-work payment, whereas Option 5 does not have an in-work payment. Comparing Option 5 (which has no in-work payment) with the other options, more people will receive a combination of FTC and benefits (without any change in their working behaviour). It is difficult to quantify how many people might change their behaviour because this depends on their preferences and choices available, but Option 5 may have weaker financial work incentives than Options 1a or 1b for a sole parent working minimum wage. The tax system and work incentives 3 Personal tax settings can impact work incentives, and should be considered alongside social policy decisions as taxes and transfers interact. The impact of any tax changes, including on financial work incentives, will depend on the nature of the change (for example, which rate or threshold is changed and by how much) and the individual’s circumstances (whether they are a beneficiary or working, a single or couple family, and their interaction with the transfer system). 4 The interaction between taxes and transfers is particularly complicated, as the tax system is individually based while the transfer system is largely based on the family unit. As a result, two families with the same total income but a different income mix may be affected differently by a given tax change, and the impacts on work incentives may be different in each case. Consideration should be given to how families are distributed by income to understand the aggregate impact on labour supply. 5 Tax reductions can have different impacts on work incentives. They will typically allow a person to retain more of their income (all else equal) and the person may feel that this means that they have sufficient income and not feel incentivised to earn more (the income effect). A tax cut may also allow a person to keep more of their additional income if they take on more work (if the tax cut applies to their additional income), lowering their effective marginal tax rate, which may improve their work incentives (the substitution effect). A tax cut will not provide this second type of improvement in work incentives if it occurs at a level below the affected person’s existing income level. For example, if the 10.5% rate was reduced but a person already earns over $14,000, they will already receive the full benefit of the tax reduction in their existing income and the reduction would not reduce the tax burden on any additional income that they earn. Therefore, to improve work incentives through personal tax reductions, it is important to understand who the groups intended to benefit would be and how they would be affected by changes to particular rates and/or thresholds. 6 Another consideration is that personal tax changes do not automatically flow through to main benefit payments because main benefits are set on a net basis (i.e., gross payments are adjusted, but recipients do not see the effect of that if they do not work). However, benefit rates will increase over time via net wage indexation because the average wage will increase as a result of a reduction in tax. 7 Some illustrative examples below consider the impact of a few different tax changes in isolation and based on specified family income mixes. However, there are many different types of families and income mixes where the impacts would be different. Understanding the full impacts of any given tax change would require microsimulation modelling. Example one – Tax Working Group scenario - $7,000 tax free threshold 8 A single person receiving the main benefit (and getting a main benefit of more than $7,000) would not get any immediate increase, as their benefit is calculated net of tax. Benefit rates will increase over time via net wage indexation because the average wage will increase as a result of a reduction in tax. 9 A single parent with no benefit income, who is working 20 hours a week on $24 an hour (around the minimum wage expected from 1 April 2023), would earn $24,960 per annum. They would receive an increase in take home pay of $735 per annum, or around $14 a week. The personal income tax changes would not affect their WFF entitlement as this is based on their income before tax, therefore could increase financial work incentives. 10 Everyone earning taxable income of more than $7,000 would receive the same increase in their take home pay with a $7,000 tax free threshold. For example, a person earning $250,000 per annum would receive the same increase in take home pay of $735 per annum, or around $14 a week as the single parent earning $24,960. Example two - reduction in the 17.5% rate to 15% 11 A single parent with no benefit income, who is working 20 hours a week on $24 an hour (around the minimum wage expected from 1 April 2023) would earn $24,960 per annum. They would receive an increase in take home pay of $274 per annum, or around $5 a week. They would also reduce their effective marginal tax rate (EMTR) by 2.5 percent in the income range of the tax change. 12 The personal income tax changes would not affect their WFF entitlement as this is based on their income before tax, therefore could increase financial work incentives. Example three – reduction in the 30% rate to 25% 13 A couple with two children and one earner working 40 hours per week on $30 an hour (around the average wage) would earn $62,400 per annum. They would receive an increase in take home pay of $720 per annum (around $14 a week). The specific effect on the earner’s EMTR would depend on whether they were the Principal Caregiver for WFF, but would reduce by 5%. Impacts of a tax- free threshold on work incentives for Option 5 14 As the benefit is treated as the primary source of income, having a tax-free threshold (at a level lower than their benefit entitlement) has no impact for people receiving a main benefit. 15 Having a tax-free threshold that is greater than a person’s benefit entitlement will increase take home pay, but it is unlikely to address EMTR concerns as the EMTR is the combination of the tax rate and any abatement rate applying to the last dollar that a person earns. If a person is subject to benefit abatement, their benefit abates at a rate of 70% and this comprises the most significant part of their EMTR. A tax-free threshold would have a comparatively small effect compared to the abatement rate. 16 A tax-free threshold is typically set at a relatively low level and is therefore usually below the last dollar that a person earns. Adjustments to higher tax rate thresholds such as the 30% tax rate threshold ($48,000) may have more impact on EMTRs as they would be more likely to reduce the tax rate applying to a person’s last dollar of income (ie shifting the 30% tax rate threshold to $58,000 would reduce the EMTR of a person earning $50,000 by 12.5%). However, the nature of those changes will affect where those gains are felt, and also depends on factors such as income levels, benefit rates and abatement settings. There are other ways to impact on work incentives in the WFF system that may be more cost effective than tax changes 17 While the impacts of any given tax change depend on the specifics, we consider it unlikely that small changes to the marginal tax rates would have a material impact on financial work incentives for low-income families. The impacts faced by families who consider working more include reductions in entitlements including Accommodation Supplement and WFF. On current settings, families lose 25c in the dollar through the withdrawal of the FTC and IWTC, on top of what they lose through personal tax (this depends on the family, but could be 30-33c). In combination, this means most families receiving WFF have EMTRs of at least 55-58%, and 80-83% if they also start losing the Accommodation Supplement. 18 Work incentives can also be impacted by more than just the financial return from work. They are influenced by availability and affordability of childcare, work availability, and personal preferences. 19 As tax settings apply to all income earners, any changes have far-reaching effects, including broader distributional impacts and fiscal costs. Any tax changes would create new winners and/or losers depending on what the specific tax changes are. In general, there will always be trade-offs between which groups of individuals to incentivise, with income distribution being a key consideration, and balancing objectives (e.g., increasing income adequacy or incentivising work, fiscal costs). 20 There are other ways to improve financial work incentives than through changes to the tax system, including adjusting abatement rates of tax credits, which could have a more pronounced financial impact for low- income families and can be designed to target financial work incentives at different pinch points. Different abatement rates for the WFF options are being considered.

It is intended to be a companion piece to the report on policy reform options Working for Families Review: Further advice on options to progress for Budget 2023 and beyond (DPMC-2022/23-547, T2022/2489, REP/22/11/1097 and IR2022/511 refer). A key issue resulting from the administration of WFF is overpayments. They arise from the underlying WFF policy and interaction between the benefit and tax credit systems. Overpayments can be exacerbated by changes in family circumstances and the joint administration of WFF by Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development (MSD). We estimate that around 20 percent of overpayments arise as a result of joint administration. Improved information collection and sharing between agencies can help to address existing issues. Officials therefore recommend that this be further investigated as a first call for improving administration of WFF, by assessing the existing Inland Revenue–MSD Approved Information Sharing Agreement (AISA). This would proceed on a longer timetable than the other options outlined in this report and would need to be prioritised by both agencies given current resource constraints. As such, we are seeking your agreement that this work should be prioritised. Other options that we recommend include: • Providing a four-week grace period for the death of a child to recipients of Family Tax Credit (FTC) and In-Work Tax Credit (IWTC) (and Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC), if it remains in place) to align with the settings for the Best Start Tax Credit. • Repealing the grandparented Child Tax Credit (CTC) – this would simplify the WFF administration and would only affect seven families. If progressed, both options could be effective from 1 April 2024 at the earliest, but this depends on other priorities that Inland Revenue and MSD are asked to deliver. After further consideration, we have determined that some options are not feasible, or are not recommended given the trade-offs and implications. These include: • Introducing a Buffer Tax Credit (BTC) – not feasible in the short term because it would require improved information collection and exchange as a prerequisite. These changes are still yet to be fully scoped and prioritised by MSD and Inland Revenue, and therefore changes to enable a BTC cannot be implemented in the short term. • Introducing an automatic debt write-off for WFF overpayments – feasible, but not recommended because of equity issues. IR2022/512; REP/22/11/1111: Working for Families Review – administrative options Page 2 of 18 • Excluding income earned outside of certain relationship periods for WFF calculations – not recommended because it would be complex and compliance-heavy. • Paying the Independent Earner Tax Credit (IETC) to WFF customers – not recommended because it would be complex and does not resolve fundamental issues with the IETC. Next steps If you wish to progress any options, we will provide you with further advice on implementation implications and fiscal costs. In addition to the administrative options outlined in this report, we have several minor remedial WFF amendments that could be progressed in a bill in 2023 for example. If you are interested in progressing some minor remedial amendments in a bill next year to improve the administration of the WFF scheme and clarify the legislation, we will report to you on what our suggested changes are in February 2023. Recommended action We recommend that you: 1. note that underpayments and overpayments of WFF entitlements are primarily caused by changes to family circumstances and the joint administration of WFF, and these can be improved with better information collection and sharing; Noted 2. agree that officials assess the existing information exchanged under the Inland Revenue–MSD AISA and determine the scope and feasibility of potential changes (recommended); Agreed/Not agreed 3. note that recommendation 2 will proceed on a longer timetable than the other options in this report and would need to be prioritised by both agencies given current resource constraints; Noted 4. agree to provide a four-week grace period when a child dies for the FTC and IWTC (and MFTC, if it remains in place) (recommended); Agreed/Not agreed 5. note that officials will provide you with a fiscal costing if you agree to recommendation 4; Noted IR2022/512; REP/22/11/1111: Working for Families Review – administrative options Page 3 of 18 6. agree that a general grace period for other changes in circumstances should not be progressed at this stage (recommended); Agreed/Not agreed 7. note that a BTC would require changes to the exchange of information between MSD and Inland Revenue and, as a result, a BTC cannot be implemented in the short term; Noted 8. indicate whether you want further advice on a BTC and, if so, the process and timing for the advice (not recommended); Yes/No 9. indicate whether you want further advice on a WFF-specific automatic debt write- off and, if so, the process and timing for the advice (not recommended); Yes/No 10. agree to repeal the grandparented CTC (recommended); Agreed/Not agreed 11. note the fiscal implications of recommendation 10 are nil; Noted 12. note that the earliest that recommendations 4 and 10 can be implemented is 1 April 2024, and that this effective date will ultimately depend on other priorities that Inland Revenue and MSD are asked to deliver at the same time; Noted 13. agree not to progress work on excluding non-salary or wage income earned outside the relevant relationship periods from the calculation of family scheme income (recommended); Agreed/Not agreed 14. agree not to progress allowing Inland Revenue to grant families the IETC where their entitlement to it would be greater than their WFF entitlement (recommended); Agreed/Not agreed 15. note that officials propose to undertake a review of the IETC at a later date after the completion of the WFF Review; Noted IR2022/512; REP/22/11/1111: Working for Families Review – administrative options Page 4 of 18 16. indicate whether you want further advice in February 2023 about remedial amendments that could be included in a bill in 2023 (recommended).

As part of the Working for Families (WFF) Review, we previously identified potential administrative improvements to the WFF scheme that could be implemented in the short to medium term (DPMC-2021/22-2539, T2022/1644, REP/22/7/682 and IR2022/145 refer). You requested further advice on all administrative options outlined in the July report, except for extending protected entitlements for the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC). 2. This report provides you with a progress update on the options and seeks your decisions on whether to progress some of these options. It is intended to be a companion piece to the report on policy reform options, Working for Families Review: Further advice on options to progress for Budget 2023 and beyond (DPMC- 2022/23-547, T2022/2489, REP/22/11/1097 and IR2022/511 refer). Background 3. A key issue with administering WFF is the incidence of underpayments and overpayments. Inland Revenue’s administrative data shows an almost equal proportion of WFF customers being underpaid as there are being overpaid. Most of the options presented in this report address overpayments. 4. Previous engagement with stakeholders highlighted that WFF debt is a particular concern for customers. Families are fearful of incurring debt, which acts as a barrier to them receiving the financial support they need. Yet, the system for assessing WFF entitlements is complex, relying on estimations. This is particularly difficult for families whose income is volatile. A late Child Support payment, for example, would trigger an increased entitlement for the period in which the Child Support was not received, and a probable overpayment when the Child Support eventually arrives. 5. Where families incur debt, they experience increased stress and can end up in hardship trying to repay it. Interest and penalty arrangements for WFF overpayments are the same as those for income tax debt. An automatic write-off applies under the annual ‘auto calculation’ process for combined WFF and income tax debt below $50. The existing law also provides the ability for customers to apply for a write-off of their debt due to serious hardship. 6. Debt arising from WFF overpayments has also been identified as a focus area for the Debt to Government project. This project has the dual focuses of: 6.1 ensuring debt recovery is fair, effective, and avoids exacerbating hardship, and 6.2 preventing debt from occurring so that it does not create future problems for those in hardship. 7. Early next year we will look at interest rate and penalty settings and ask Ministers whether it is appropriate to treat WFF debt in the same way as income tax debt. With low (or no) interest it would be feasible for overpayments to be recovered over a longer period of time, which might reduce the burden on recipients. Changes to the interest regime have not been costed but officials expect that any proposal for change would need to go through the Budget process. 8. We note that the options presented in this report are a response to the WFF policies that are currently in place and the existing complexity in the system. More substantive prevention of overpayments (and underpayments) could occur through reform options which simplify the system, discussed in the companion report. If instead, complexity of the system increases following reform decisions, these administrative options may not adequately address subsequent overpayment issues, apart from improving information exchanged discussed below. IR2022/512; REP/22/11/1111: Working for Families Review – administrative options Page 6 of 18 Causes of overpayments 9. In the 2021 tax year, WFF overpayments totalled $136 million. As of September 2022, $71 million of these overpayments has either been repaid 1 or written off, leaving an outstanding balance of $65 million. As of July 2022, approximately 57,000 customers had accumulated WFF debt of almost $250 million (comprised of $178 million of overpayments and $71 million of penalties and interest). 10. There are two primary causes of debt. The first is in regard to changes in circumstances for families, and the second is the joint administration of WFF payments by Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development (MSD). Further detail is provided in Appendix 1. 11. Changes in circumstances (that is, life events such as partnering or splitting with a partner, having children, or working or not) affect customers’ entitlements. As there is a natural lag depending on when someone notifies Inland Revenue of a change in their circumstances and when that change is updated in the system, payments received in the interim may be incorrect. These can result in the customer being in debt at the end of the year. 12. Joint administration can create overpayments in two main ways. The first reflects the underlying policy interaction of the main benefits and tax credit abatement rules, and the requirements to be off benefit and working to be eligible for certain tax credits. The second reflects MSD administering WFF payments to their clients, which can create overpayments because of lack of information collected and shared between agencies. This is exacerbated by changes in circumstances of MSD clients, as described above for Inland Revenue’s customers. 13. For example, when MSD clients work more and their information is not updated with Inland Revenue, MSD would have paid them a full WFF entitlement, but they should have been paid an abated amount. Administrative data show that in the 2022 tax year, nearly 5,000 MSD clients had family scheme income above the WFF abatement threshold and had a resulting overpayment. Approximately 21 percent had not been squared up by Inland Revenue. 14. Data shows that around 20 percent of all WFF recipients with overpayments occur because of joint administration. These families are among the lowest-income WFF recipients, and their WFF debt for the 2021 tax year was approximately $20 to $25 million as of September 2022. 15. Officials are not proposing to change joint administration of WFF at this time – that would be a significant change and further consideration of the implications to doing so would need to be undertaken. However, customers’ outcomes could be improved by changing the information collected and sharing arrangements between agencies as discussed below. Options to reduce incidence of overpayments 16. There are two proposals that could help to mitigate overpayments before they are incurred so that customers could have a net smaller debt owing at the end of the year. While these options may not eliminate all potential debt, they would improve customer outcomes. Improvements in information exchanged 17. MSD currently provides information to Inland Revenue about their clients’ benefit receipts, WFF payments paid by MSD, and occasionally their circumstances. In 1 In this context, “repaid” includes instances where an income tax refund was offset against the overpayment. IR2022/512; REP/22/11/1111: Working for Families Review – administrative options Page 7 of 18 relation to customers’ circumstances, details are provided when a customer moves on or off a benefit. Inland Revenue also provides information to MSD on beneficiaries’ income data for use in checking against their declared income. 18. Even with these exchanges, information to determine entitlement can be missing or inefficiently exchanged. For example, Inland Revenue does not receive updates of MSD customers’ changes in family circumstances (for example, relationships or dependent children) unless their beneficiary status has also changed. There are currently multiple exchanges between the agencies, which can result in missed information that is relevant. 19. Improving the exchange of information between Inland Revenue and MSD would improve the accuracy of WFF payments by ensuring Inland Revenue has access to more timely, complete and accurate information about customers’ circumstances and would reduce the current reliance on customers to advise changes in their circumstances. This would not just reduce the incidence of overpayments but should also result in fewer customers being underpaid. Improved information sharing would also support the reform options being considered as part of the wider WFF Review. 20. As noted in the July report, there are various options for improving the flow of information between Inland Revenue and MSD. This could include, for example, collecting new information, streamlining the existing exchanges by reducing the number of exchanges, and/or increasing the frequency. Specific changes that could be considered are: 20.1 Ensuring Inland Revenue gets updates from MSD of child and partner changes and payer details even when the customer’s benefit status is unchanged. 2 20.2 Better information sharing to manage situations where MSD has one partner as the principal caregiver and Inland Revenue has the other partner in the principal caregiver role. 20.3 Increasing the frequency of information sharing to two or three times a week (currently it is sent to Inland Revenue weekly). 21. Any changes to the exchange of information between the two agencies would require system changes for both agencies, the extent of which would depend on the nature and scale of the changes. The outcome could potentially establish longer- term benefits to the administration of transfer payments (both main benefits and WFF). 22. We propose to assess the existing Inland Revenue–MSD Approved Information Sharing Agreement (AISA) and determine the scope and feasibility of potential changes that could be progressed. This would proceed on a longer timetable than the other options outlined in this report and would need to be prioritised by both agencies given current resource constraints. As such, we are seeking your agreement that we should prioritise this work. 23. We consider this workstream has the potential to improve outcomes for WFF customers, particularly those who are lower-income and working. We recommend that Ministers prioritise this as part of future WFF improvements. 2 Currently, Inland Revenue only receives this information when the customer’s beneficiary status changes. ‘Payer details’ refers to who pays the customer their WFF entitlement – the customer elects to be paid by either Inland Revenue or MSD. Essentially, enabling updates of payer details to be exchanged would enable customers to more easily change who pays them their WFF (at present, they have to contact both agencies in order to make this change). IR2022/512; REP/22/11/1111: Working for Families Review – administrative options Page 8 of 18 Grace periods 24. Improved information exchanges would help to mitigate debt for customers who are paid WFF by MSD and squared up by Inland Revenue at the end of the year. However, overpayments can arise in other contexts as a result of life changes that are not foreseeable, resulting in overpayments that are unavoidable. To address this, an option is to introduce grace periods for customers who have a change in their circumstances that reduces their WFF entitlement. 25. Currently, if a WFF customer has such a change in their circumstances they need to inform Inland Revenue or MSD before their next WFF payment. With a grace period, customers would have an extension of time to notify Inland Revenue of a relevant change – meaning they would not be liable to repay any overpayment made in the intervening period. 26. A two-week grace period currently applies for the In-Work Tax Credit (IWTC) component of WFF. The grace period allows families to continue to receive the IWTC when earners have short gaps in their paid work. 3 Data to analyse the impacts of this change is not yet available. Grace periods are also provided for the Best Start Tax Credit (BSTC) and Paid Parental Leave (PPL) when a child passes away. 4 Changes in circumstances, including income, can be difficult to identify 27. Some changes in circumstances are readily foreseeable based on the information that Inland Revenue holds and are adequately dealt with through proactive management. An example is when a customer has a child in their care who is about to turn 18, Inland Revenue will contact the customer to confirm if their child will be attending secondary school or a tertiary institution beyond their eighteenth birthday to determine if they will continue to be entitled for that child until the end of the year. 28. In cases such as relationship changes, a child becoming financially independent or changes in shared care arrangements, it is not easy for customers or Inland Revenue to identify when a change in the customer’s circumstances occurred. 29. Some changes in circumstances that are relatively straightforward to verify when they occurred but are particularly sensitive, such as the death of a child or partner, would also affect a family’s entitlement. However, informing Inland Revenue of such changes is unlikely to be the customer’s top priority when they are going through a difficult time. 30. Administrative data show that the lag between a change occurring and it being updated in Inland Revenue’s system is typically three weeks or less for all types of changes, except for those relating to MFTC eligibility which have a median lag of 33 days to be updated. The types of changes that would typically be updated within three weeks or less include: 5 30.1 partner changes (median lag of 15 days); 30.2 child changes (median lag of 22 days or less); and 3 This applies for workers whose employment has ended, those taking unpaid leave but who are still employed, and the likes of teacher aides or support staff in schools or universities who are unpaid during school holidays or university breaks. 4 If a child is born alive and dies or passes away before their third birthday, payments of the BSTC generally continue for four weeks following the date of the child’s death. For other WFF tax credits there is currently no grace period when a child dies. For PPL entitlements, if the customer was eligible for PPL and the child died or was miscarried or stillborn, they are still entitled to the full amount of PPL until their entitlement ceases. 5 Lags were calculated only for updates that were made within the same tax year that the change occurred. IR2022/512; REP/22/11/1111: Working for Families Review – administrative options Page 9 of 18 30.3 changes affecting the customer’s entitlement to the IWTC (median lag of 15 days). Note that a two-week grace period already exists for the IWTC, which may affect this figure. 31. We note that these lags are the amount of time between when the change occurred and when it was updated in Inland Revenue’s system, not the amount of time between the change occurring and Inland Revenue being notified of the change. This makes implementing a grace period complex and presents integrity issues 32. Grace periods become administratively cumbersome when a customer has multiple different changes in circumstances, as multiple grace periods for different changes (and different start and end dates) may apply for the same customer, and may overlap. This could be very difficult to implement and administer, and may not improve customers’ experience. 33. There are integrity risks with providing grace periods for changes that also affect other WFF recipients, such as changes in shared care arrangements. 6 Providing a grace period to the caregiver whose WFF entitlement has decreased– while at the same time backdating the change for the other caregiver whose WFF entitlement has increased – would mean that there would be a greater than 100 percent WFF entitlement paid for the same child for the duration of the grace period. This could be easily gamed by ex-partners looking to obtain a financial advantage. 34. There would be similar issues for changes in income. For example, changes to self- employment or shift work dates would not be easily determined by Inland Revenue and would therefore present challenges to identify when a grace period should apply from. 35. Even if a grace period was designed to only apply for a very limited set of changes in circumstances (for example, for partner changes or when a child becomes financially independent), this could be confusing to customers if a grace period applies for some types of changes in circumstances and not others. We recommend extending the existing grace period that applies to the BSTC for death of child 36. We recommend extending the four-week grace period for the death of a child that already exists for the BSTC so that it also applies for the IWTC and Family Tax Credit (FTC) (and the MFTC if it remains in place). This is consistent with the recommendation of the Welfare Expert Advisory Group, which recommended aligning the timeframes for stopping income support payments when a child has died. The earliest possible application date for this option is 1 April 2024, as this change would need to have prospective (rather than retrospective) effect. This will depend on other priorities that Inland Revenue and MSD are asked to deliver at the same time. 37. Based on administrative data from the 2020–21 year, the proposed four-week grace period should be sufficient to ensure the vast majority of customers in this situation do not have an overpayment from this unfortunate event. We would expect approximately 400 families to benefit from the proposal each year. 6 Under the shared care rules, a child is considered to be in shared care if the principal caregiver has a minimum of five days of care per fortnight. In most cases, a second caregiver is attributed the remainder of the care during the fortnight. The second caregiver may also have an entitlement to WFF tax credits for their care of the child and for any other children in their care. IR2022/512; REP/22/11/1111: Working for Families Review – administrative options Page 10 of 18 38. If Ministers are interested in extending the grace period for the death of a child to other WFF tax credits as suggested above, we can provide you with a fiscal costing and further implementation details. 39. At this stage, we do not recommend providing a general grace period for other changes in circumstances, due to the administrative complexity and integrity risks that it would present. Managing WFF debt once incurred 40. We have also considered options that could address WFF overpayments after they have been made. Analysis of administrative data shows that a substantial proportion of overpayments are low value – 45 percent of overpaid customers in 2021 received overpayments totalling $500 or less. Appendix 2 provides more detail on overpayments. 41. These low-level overpayments are usually repaid. However, low-level overpayments are significantly less likely to be repaid when the customer’s main or only income source is a benefit, and these overpayments are more likely to be written off compared to other WFF customers. Buffer Tax Credit 42. We previously suggested that one possible way to provide relief from low-level debt amounts resulting from WFF overpayments is to introduce a new tax credit that would act as a ‘buffer’ or supplement at the end of the year, referred to as the Buffer Tax Credit (BTC). 43. The primary purpose of a BTC is to reduce WFF customers’ end of year debt. However, as a means of ensuring that it would not create perverse incentives by rewarding noncompliant behaviour, it would also be provided to customers that have no WFF debt. As a refundable tax credit, any excess after offsetting against overpayments and end of year income tax debt would be paid to the customer as a lump sum. This means customers with no WFF overpayments or income tax to pay at the end of the year would receive the full amount of the credit. It would effectively be an additional entitlement to all WFF customers. 44. As payment of the BTC would require that customers are first squared up, and MSD does not have processes in place to do such a square up, this proposal would require Inland Revenue to square up all MSD clients and pay the BTC. In turn, this would require improved information exchanges. 45. Without accurate and up to date information, a square up of MSD clients could potentially lead to an assessment of overpayments. For example, if MSD clients do not have IRD numbers for their children, Inland Revenue would consider that they were not entitled to receive WFF for those children. 7 46. For these reasons, a BTC would not be implementable in the near future until the information collected and exchanged between MSD and Inland Revenue is improved, as discussed above. 47. We considered whether a BTC could be implemented in a way that avoids the problems that would arise if Inland Revenue was to square up all MSD customers, such as paying these customers the BTC as a lump sum without squaring them up or simply excluding these customers from receiving the BTC. However, we would not recommend either of these options on equity grounds. In particular, if MSD was to pay the BTC to their full-year clients, there would be a risk that some MSD clients 7 Legislation requires that Inland Revenue pay WFF for children who have IRD numbers. The legislation does not require MSD to do the same. IR2022/512; REP/22/11/1111: Working for Families Review – administrative options Page 11 of 18 could be paid the BTC by MSD, but for various reasons are subsequently squared up by Inland Revenue. Depending on the timing, they could be overpaid their BTC. 48. If Ministers would like to do something quickly to provide relief from low-level debt amounts resulting from WFF overpayments, an automatic WFF debt write-off could be introduced with application from 1 April 2023 at the earliest. As shown below, this option would be significantly less expensive than a BTC, although it would also be less equitable. Fiscal implications and impact on customers 49. We have prepared costings for variations of a BTC. The costings are based on the initially proposed application date of 1 April 2023 and so are indicative only. The main options we have costed are a fixed BTC of $250 or $500 per customer and a BTC calculated as five percent of the customer’s WFF entitlement. 49.1 A BTC of $250 per WFF customer would cost approximately $70–80 million each year. 49.2 A $500 BTC would cost approximately $140–160 million each year. Targeting the $500 option to families with incomes of $60,000 or less produces a similar fiscal cost to the $250 option. 49.3 A BTC calculated as five percent of the customer’s WFF entitlement would cost approximately $140–170 million each year. Automatic debt write-off threshold 50. An alternative to the BTC is to provide an additional automatic debt write-off threshold specifically for WFF overpayments. The write-off would apply to offset overpayments up to the amount of the threshold. As this would only apply to families with overpayments, the fiscal cost of this option is lower in comparison to the BTC. 51. However, at the same time, it is less equitable and could create perverse compliance incentives. Customers who have complied with obligations or taken steps to ensure they are not overpaid would be worse off compared to those who receive a write- off. Customers who have had their entitlements adjusted downwards during the year to avoid overpayments would similarly be disadvantaged. 52. This option could create an incentive for customers to create an overpayment up to the write-off threshold. However, we expect that with a relatively low threshold, such as $250 or $500, there would not be as much scope for customers to deliberately create an overpayment. 53. An automatic write-off of the first $250 of overpayments would cost around $10 million per annum. Increasing the threshold to $500 would cost around $13–15 million per annum. Comparison of BTC and automatic debt write-off 54. The BTC and automatic write-off of the same amount will impact the same number of debt-holders. Based on administrative data, we estimate that approximately 40,000 customers each year with WFF overpayments would have the entire balance of their overpayments cancelled out by either a $500 BTC or a $500 automatic WFF debt write-off (without means testing). If set at $250, around 30,000 customers each year would have their overpayments reduced to zero. (There are in total around 80,000 to 90,000 customers each year who are overpaid their WFF entitlements.) IR2022/512; REP/22/11/1111: Working for Families Review – administrative options Page 12 of 18 55. A $500 BTC or a $500 automatic write-off without means testing would reduce the amount of overpayments at the end of each tax year by approximately $25 million. Approximately $10 million of the $25 million would likely be written off through existing write-off provisions, meaning that the proposals would address $15 million in overpayments annually (hence the $500 write-off costing between $13 and $15 million each year). Given the difference in cost between the two options (a $500 BTC is approximately $125–145 million more expensive each year than an automatic WFF debt write-off of $500), this makes the $500 BTC option a very expensive one for eliminating low-level overpayments. An automatic debt write-off would be a comparatively cost-efficient option to achieve the same debt outcome. 56. We note that both the BTC and automatic write-off provide a small amount of debt relief at an individual customer level. Overpayments of $500 or less comprise just two percent of the total value of overpayments each year, whereas overpayments of more than $1,000 are more likely to become long term debt. Overpayments over $1,000 account for 95 percent of the total value of 2021 overpayments still outstanding. (See Appendix 2.) 57. If an automatic debt write-off for WFF overpayments is preferred, consideration should first be given to how other reform options could reduce overpayments before choosing a threshold. We note that option 1b and option 5 in the companion report would likely help to reduce overpayments, depending on the implementation design details. If Ministers are interested in this option, officials can provide more information. Miscellaneous amendments 58. A number of miscellaneous administrative changes were also suggested as possible options for further analysis in the July report. Our recommendations in relation to these options are outlined below. Repealing the Child Tax Credit (recommended) 59. The Child Tax Credit (CTC) was replaced by the IWTC on 1 April 2006 but was grandparented for some existing customers who did not qualify for the IWTC. There are currently seven families that still receive the payment. 60. After further consideration, we recommend repealing the CTC to simplify the WFF scheme. While small, this change would improve the simplicity and coherence of the scheme from a legislative and policy perspective. It would also simplify customer interactions for front-line Inland Revenue staff. 61. Repealing the CTC would make these families worse off unless they are directly compensated. If Ministers want to ensure these customers are not immediately worse off, they could be compensated by way of a one-off lump sum payment for the remainder of their entitlement. However, we would not recommend this because it affects only a very small group of customers who have already benefited from the CTC being grandparented for 16 years. In any event, we expect most of these customers to have their last child age out of eligibility for Working for Families within the next two years. 62. As at 31 October 2022, $0.481 million was accrued for final CTC claims. Appropriations since October 2022 for the CTC have been nil. Repealing the CTC will not change this. 63. On balance, we recommend repealing the CTC effective on 1 April 2024. This means the last year for entitlement would be the 2023–24 income year. IR2022/512; REP/22/11/1111: Working for Families Review – administrative options Page 13 of 18 Calculation of family scheme income: Deemed derivation at uniform daily rate (not recommended) 64. We indicated that you could amend the calculation of family scheme income to exclude non-salary or wage income earned outside the relevant relationship periods. 8 This can raise fairness concerns. However, after further consideration we do not recommend this. 65. Administratively, it would increase compliance costs because customers would be asked to provide start and stop dates for various income types and adjustments, including self-employed income, partnership income, estate/trustee income, shareholder salaries and rental income. There would also be an integrity risk in that Inland Revenue would not have a way to verify the dates provided by customers in many cases. Disagreements between principal caregivers and ex-partners on dates would also have to be managed somehow. 66. Rather than a systematic approach, an alternative could be to allow for a discretionary application. However, we would not recommend this approach on equity grounds as it would benefit only those customers who complain. It is also undesirable from a policy and legal perspective for a person’s entitlements or obligations to be determined on a discretionary basis. 67. We recommend that the provision remains as it is currently. Independent Earner Tax Credit and Working for Families interaction (not recommended) 68. The Independent Earner Tax Credit (IETC) is a $10 per week entitlement for individuals who earns between $24,000 and $48,000. 9 To be eligible, the person or their partner must not be entitled to WFF. This rule applies even if the family’s entitlement to WFF is less than the IETC they would otherwise be entitled to. For those affected, this raises fairness concerns about the interaction between the IETC and the WFF scheme. 69. The issue largely affects around 2,600 relatively higher-income couples where at least one partner’s income falls within the income thresholds. 70. After further consideration, we recommend that this proposal not be considered further. While it would be feasible to implement this for couples who do not have a change in their relationship status, it would be relatively complex to account for any changes to relationships during the year. In applying an either/or payment (that is, either an IETC or WFF payment) to each ex-partner, this would increase confusion on which payment to give each person depending on shared care arrangements. 71. We are already aware of more fundamental issues with the IETC settings, particularly as the income thresholds have not been adjusted since its introduction in 2009. Rather than address a relatively minor issue, we recommend instead that a review of the IETC be undertaken. This could be at a later date after substantive decisions have been made on the WFF Review and any related and relevant policy changes. Financial implications 72. The costings provided in this report are indicative and do not include costs of implementation. Should Ministers be interested in progressing any of these options, 8 A new ‘relationship period’ begins at the start of each tax year, but will also begin or end during the tax year with partner changes or when the customer’s entitlement starts or stops due to having their first dependent child or no more children in their care. 9 The IETC abates between $44,000 and $48,000 at 13 cents in the dollar. IR2022/512; REP/22/11/1111: Working for Families Review – administrative options Page 14 of 18 we will refine the costings based on any updated parameters or information and will also provide operational costings. Administrative implications 73. All these changes would require legislative changes, systems changes and testing, staff training, updating guidance for the public and for Inland Revenue staff, and would have potential impacts on other business as usual activities. The BTC would have significant impacts and would also have information sharing implications. The grace period and repealing the CTC would require mostly the same types of changes but to a lesser degree. 74. While we have provided indicative application dates for each of the options recommended in this report for further consideration, these will also depend on other priorities that Inland Revenue and MSD are asked to deliver at the same time. 75. We strongly recommend that changes are effective from 1 April of any tax year to ensure full year calculations can be made. While it would be possible for any changes to be implemented in the middle of a tax year, these changes would be complex and may negatively impact accuracy of the payment. This could result in both overpayments and underpayments which may exacerbate debt and income adequacy. Consultation 76. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and The Treasury were consulted on this report. Next steps 77. At your request, we will provide you with further advice on options discussed in this report. 78. If you wish to progress any reform options in the companion report for Budget 2023, as well as introduce a four-week grace period for the FTC and IWTC that would apply when a child dies, and/or repeal the CTC through the Budget 2023 process, we will provide you with subsequent advice in early 2023. 79. In addition to the administrative options outlined in this report, we have several minor remedial WFF amendments that could be progressed, potentially in a bill in 2023 for example. If you are interested in potentially progressing some minor remedial amendments in a bill next year to improve the administration of the WFF scheme and rectify technical errors with the legislation, we will report to you on what our suggested changes are in February 2023. IR2022/512; REP/22/11/1111: Working for Families Review – administrative options Page 15 of 18 Appendix 1 – Causes of overpayments 1. Based on Inland Revenue’s administrative data, overpayments are largely due to income changes and co-administration of the WFF scheme by two separate government agencies (refer Table A1 below). Other factors, such as changes in relationships, also play a role. Table A1: Contributing causes of WFF overpayments Overpaymen t amount No eligible children all year 10 Reductio n in no. of children MSD–IR interface Change in partner Family income increase >10% Family income decrease >10% Income change <10% (increase or decrease ) $1–$250 0% 10% 18% 2% 40% 10% 19% $251–$500 1% 15% 22% 3% 32% 7% 19% $501–$1,000 1% 16% 20% 3% 36% 8% 17% $1,001– $2,500 2% 16% 19% 3% 40% 7% 13% $2,501– $5,000 2% 15% 22% 3% 42% 5% 10% $5,001+ 5% 13% 22% 3% 44% 5% 8% Overall 1% 14% 20% 3% 39% 8% 16% 2. As Table A1 also shows, the degree of overpayment does not seem to vary significantly for a given reason. In other words, families do not tend to be more overpaid because they have had a change in partner, for example. The notable exception is when a family has no eligible children, for which overpayments tend to be more than $5,000. This occurs, for example, when children or families leave the country but have not notified Inland Revenue. Improved information sharing could help in this regard. 10 This refers to the situation where a customer receiving upfront WFF payments did not have any eligible dependent children in their care for the entire year and did not tell Inland Revenue. IR2022/512; REP/22/11/1111: Working for Families Review – administrative options Page 17 of 18 Table A1: Number of WFF overpayments repaid or written off Overpayment amount Paid Written off Mix Paid/Write- off Not yet repaid Total $1–$250 20,293 (68%) 5,003 (17%) 1,959 (7%) 2,522 (8%) 29,777 $251–$500 7,168 (63%) 1,527 (13%) 719 (6%) 2,038 (18%) 11,452 $501–$1,000 7,612 (54%) 1,962 (14%) 1,031 (7%) 3,557 (25%) 14,162 $1,001– $2,500 8,451 (44%) 1,280 (7%) 786 (4%) 8,809 (46%) 19,326 $2,501– $5,000 3,263 (31%) 872 (8%) 144 (1%) 6,167 (59%) 10,446 $5,001+ 1,474 (24%) 527 (8%) 53 (1%) 4,178 (67%) 6,232 All 48,261 (53%) 11,171 (12%) 4,692 (5%) 27,271 (30%) 91,395 4. For overpayment amounts of $250 or less, 92 percent had repaid these amounts and/or had them written off, and for overpayments between $250 and $500 the proportion of customers that had their overpayments repaid and/or written off was 82 percent. For overpayment amounts of $250 or less, 68 percent had repaid these amounts. In contrast, the proportion of customers that received overpayments above $5,000 that repaid these amounts was only 23 percent. 5. Salary and wage earners and self-employed people are the most likely to have repaid any WFF overpayments they received over the year. Repayment rates are the lowest for beneficiaries, and write-off rates for that group are the highest. Table A2 below shows the breakdown of WFF customers in the 2021 year who received a benefit as their only source of income. 6. While 60 percent of beneficiaries who were overpaid in 2021 have either repaid the overpayments they received or had these amounts written off, 83 percent of the total value of overpayments made to beneficiaries remains unpaid. For the 2021 return period, 18 percent of the beneficiaries that were overpaid had repaid the balance by late September 2022, while 32 percent had their overpayments written off. In total, 58 percent of beneficiaries had repaid their 2021 overpayments and/or had them written off.

Executive summary 3 We understand that your preferred direction for WFF reform is the introduction of a new in-work payment to replace the IWTC and Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC) – Option 1B from previous advice. 4 Officials have determined, however, that there is insufficient time to develop and model the detailed settings for Option 1B in order to be able to provide comprehensive advice for Budget 2023. It would also not be possible to Appendix A Document 4 Working for Families: Improving support for working families and Budget 2023 2 implement Option 1B by 1 April 2024, even if it were funded through Budget 2023, given the complexity of the changes involved. 5 For this reason, we have explored options for simpler changes to IWTC settings that could be announced in Budget 2023 to provide immediate support to working families. These are broadly consistent with the direction of travel towards the new in-work payment design, while also being sensible standalone options. They could be implemented in either July 2023 or April 2024, depending on the nature of the changes and other priorities IR and MSD are asked to deliver over the same timeframes. Shifting towards a new, enhanced in-work payment 6 Option 1B introduces a new in-work payment for working families with children who are off-benefit. It aims to ensure families are better off off- benefit once they are working more than 20 or 30 hours a week 1 , similar to the MFTC currently, but with more gradual abatement. This payment does not have an ‘hours test’, so families off-benefit can receive the full payment if they work less, as long as they are in employment and receiving some employment income. 7 In this paper, we have included illustrative modelling of, and advice on, some different versions of this option to inform the decision about whether this is the desirable high-level direction of travel for the WFF reforms. 8 We have updated the modelling for Option 1B for implementation in 2025/26, with revised parameters that take into account the latest decisions and other recent factors. We have re-modelled both the full option ($1,055m), and the scaled option with a two-tier abatement regime to reduce cost and more tightly target income increases to working families on relatively lower incomes ($703m). 9 This option has a strong focus on making work pay and would provide real gains to low-income working families. It would support families with variable working hours, reduce debt to Government, and help to simplify the system. However, there are also a number of considerations to take into account: • Ideally, the margin between benefit and work should be maintained over time, which would require indexation of some settings which would come with higher annual costs, and would also mean discretionary increases to benefit levels would carry greater fiscal cost. • The abatement changes increase targeting, but have a mixed impact on effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs), being more gradual for a small group of former MFTC recipients, but higher for most other WFF recipients. 1 Equivalent to 20 hours a week of work on the minimum wage for sole parents, and 30 hours a week for couples. Working for Families: Improving support for working families and Budget 2023 3 • Not introducing an hours test would be a significant shift in approach around obligations associated with a payment of this size, creating a tension with the benefit system given the obligations required in return for a similar payment on a main benefit (for example, the requirement for clients to be actively looking for, or preparing for, part or full-time work). 10 There are likely to be other variations you could consider as the advice on this high-level option progresses. The estimated costs for both the full and the scaled option, which were already significant, are now estimated to be higher due to a later implementation date and updated economic and fiscal forecasts. We could explore design changes to reduce these costs though these are likely to have trade-offs. You could also explore reducing the impact on EMTRs for middle-income families by introducing more gradual abatement settings (though this is likely to increase costs, rather than decrease them). 11 We have also identified a number of other detailed policy matters that would need to be worked through for the new payment design, including settings for parents in shared care situations; eligibility for the self-employed, and for recipients of Orphans Benefit, Foster Care Allowance, Unsupported Child’s Benefit (OB/FCA/UCB); and detailed rules about how income and abatement settings are operationalised. 12 Given the complexity of the change, there may be other policy issues that are yet to be identified, and officials do not recommend you announce the change in Budget 2023. At most, we recommend you indicate that a new in-work payment is a possible direction of travel that is being explored further. 13 In order for the option to be implemented by April 2025, work would also need to continue to progress at pace. In-principle decisions would need to be made at the end of this year with funding ideally provided through a pre- commitment against Budget 2024, and detailed parameters would need to be confirmed by April 2024. A detailed example timeline is provided in para 45, though final implementation timeframes will depend on the final design of the option chosen and what other priorities IR and MSD are asked to progress over the same timeframes. Announcing immediate changes in Budget 2023 14 There are options for simpler changes to the IWTC settings or the WFF abatement threshold that could be announced in Budget 2023 to provide more immediate support to working families. 15 You have requested advice on progressing option ‘6B’ from past advice, which: • keeps the FTC and IWTC in its current form, but removes the MFTC • increases the IWTC rate by $25 per week (pw) to improve income adequacy Working for Families: Improving support for working families and Budget 2023 4 • increases the WFF abatement threshold from $42,700 to $50,000 per annum (pa) to help make work pay and avoid overlapping abatement with benefits. 16 This option could be announced in Budget 2023 and implemented by April 2024. Because it includes the removal of the MFTC, however, our advice on whether to progress it depends on the ultimate direction of the WFF reforms. Officials recommend maintaining the MFTC using its current formula until decisions about the longer-term direction of WFF are made: • If you wish to ultimately progress to a system based around option 1B or something similar, we do not recommend you progress this option. Removal of the MFTC in the intervening period would likely create difficulty and confusion for those currently in receipt of the payment and result in a small number of very low-income families being financially disadvantaged in the interim. • If you wish to make this option the ‘end-point’ for the reforms, then this option could be progressed, though the removal of the MFTC would mean more working families receiving a benefit and would likely result in some families being financially disadvantaged from the change. 17 We have also modelled other simpler changes, all of which retain the MFTC, including: • increases to the IWTC rate of $25 and $15 pw as stand-alone options • an abatement threshold increase ($50,000 pa) as a stand-alone option, and • a combination of a $10 pw IWTC rate increase with an increase in the abatement threshold to $50,000 pa. 18 These simpler changes could likely be implemented on 1 July 2023 or 1 April 2024. However, given the complexity of the tax and transfer system, and the significant number of interactions between payments, a later implementation date will provide agencies with more time to manage these. Other Budget priorities may also make the earlier implementation date more challenging. For these reasons, officials recommend a 1 April 2024 implementation date for these changes. 19 The costs and impacts on incomes and measured child poverty of these simpler options are set out in the summary table below. As with Option 1B, the gains and impacts would be for working families only. Note that the costs do not include operational costs – these will be completed for the Budget Cabinet paper if any of these options progress. The costs below are from Treasury’s Tax and Welfare Analysis (TAWA) model. Inland Revenue (IR) have also costed these options and a comparison between the two is provided in Appendix 1. Five-year costings by IR are also in Appendix 1 and include costings for both 1 July 2023 and 1 April 2024 implementation dates for the Budget 2023 options. Working for Families: Improving support for working families and Budget 2023 5 Trade-offs between Budget 2023 options 20 If fiscal constraints necessitate a choice between an increase to the IWTC payment rate and an increase to the WFF abatement threshold, then you may wish to consider the relative merits of the two options: • Of the options modelled, the increase to the abatement threshold carries a higher fiscal cost, but has a greater impact on incomes and child poverty. • An IWTC rate increase is slightly more targeted at those on the lowest incomes. • An abatement threshold increase would reduce the overlapping abatement of benefits and WFF, and mean that single minimum wage earners do not face abatement of their payments. 21 The option that best addresses income adequacy and lifts the most children out of poverty on the AHC50 measure 2 per dollar of fiscal cost combines an IWTC increase of $10 per week with an increased abatement threshold (option 6B5). This option reduces child poverty by 17,000 on the AHC50 measure at a cost of $309 million. 22 If any of these simpler options became an end-point for the WFF Review, they would still align with the objectives of supporting income adequacy and reducing child poverty, and improving financial incentives to work. They are not focused on simplifying the system however, and some of the issues identified in past reports that related to the MFTC and the complexity of the tax/benefit interface would remain. Consequential impacts of B23 options 23 Given the complexity of the tax and transfer system there are a number of interdependencies and flow-ons between payments. Constrained modelling timeframes mean that these have not yet been fully quantified, but will be included in the Budget Cabinet paper. These will have minor impacts on estimated gains and losses for families and fiscal costs. 24 One consequential impact will require a later decision from Ministers. These changes will count as income for the Community Services Card (CSC), so a decision will be required on whether to increase the CSC income threshold to maintain eligibility for families. Officials recommend seeking Cabinet agreement to delegate authority for the Minister for Social Development and Employment, Minister of Finance and Minister of Health to make decisions on any consequential changes to the CSC income thresholds. 2 The number of children living in households that have an after-housing-costs income that is less than 50 percent of the (2017/18) baseline year’s median after-housing-costs household income, after adjusting for inflation. Working for Families: Improving support for working families and Budget 2023 6 Update on administrative and operational improvements 25 Ministers previously agreed to further advice on administrative and operational improvements, including the potential for additional changes to information sharing to reduce overpayments and improve customer experience, the introduction for a ‘grace period’ for FTC and IWTC when a child dies, the removal of the Child Tax Credit, and remedial amendments that could be included in a bill in 2023. 26 Further advice on other administrative improvements (some of which have fiscal costs) has been delayed to focus on the substantive advice for WFF for Budget 2023. Treasury has advised that those initiatives that have fiscal costs should not be progressed as part of the Budget 2023 package. However, it may be possible to implement some initiatives with no fiscal implications for April 2024. Additionally, we could continue to progress this workstream and seek to fund the other initiatives with fiscals as part of the larger reforms for Budget 2024, or progress specific initiatives through the Debt to Government work. Next steps 27 If you wish to progress one of the simpler IWTC changes in this paper for Budget 2023 and/or you wish to seek further advice on Option 1B for Budget 2024 or later, officials can prepare material for you to seek the agreement of your colleagues at Cabinet.

Inflation has triggered further increases to both FTC and Best Start over two consecutive years, and an additional FTC increase was timed to coincide with the CPI increase last year. In addition, there have been consecutive increases to main benefits in 2020, 2021, and 2022, increases to the benefit abatement thresholds, and the indexation of main benefits to wages. 8 The IWTC, on the other hand, was last increased in Budget 2015, from $60 to $72.50 pw alongside a benefit rate increase for families with children. There are no requirements to automatically increase the rate of the IWTC, meaning its real value has decreased over time, and the numbers of families eligible for the payment have decreased as wages have risen. The IWTC is the key instrument to ‘make work pay’ within the wider context of the WFF package and it was designed to address in-work poverty. 9 As noted in past advice, in-work poverty is an increasing issue in New Zealand, particularly for sole earners (both sole parents and couples with only one parent working). Rates of poverty have been increasing for this group, indicating a single income is becoming a less viable option for providing economic security and meeting basic needs \[REP/22/7/682 refers\]. 10 There is also a strong case for supporting working families in the current climate. For a significant number of working families, the cost of living will have risen faster than incomes this past year. Inflation, as measured by the all-groups CPI, was 7.2% for 2022, whereas the net average wage increased by 6.2%. There are scheduled increases to the minimum wage, but many low-middle income workers above the minimum wage will be experiencing worsening income adequacy – where costs are rising faster than pay. In contrast, families receiving a main benefit will gain from a discretionary increase to main benefits to match the rate of CPI (rather than wages) from 1 April 2024. Working for Families: Improving support for working families and Budget 2023 13 The child poverty targets 11 Previous advice noted that the WFF Review is likely to present the best opportunity in the coming years to achieve substantial reductions in measured child poverty. 12 The simpler options in this paper that could potentially be implemented by July 2023 would have a partial impact on progress towards the second intermediate child poverty targets. Options that would be implemented in April 2024 or April 2025 would contribute to progress in the third target period, which covers the 24/25, 25/26, and 26/27 years. After this, there is one more financial year before the ten-year targets are due to be achieved (2027/28). 13 Modelled estimates of child poverty impacts have been included throughout this paper. Reductions for the Budget 2023 initiatives are generally in the order of 5,000-10,000 children on each measure, whereas the versions of 1B included in this paper are much larger - closer to 20,000 on BHC50 3 and 30,000-40,000 on AHC50. Even with these impacts, significant further policy interventions will likely be required to reach the ten-year child poverty targets. 14 All the options in this paper provide gains for working families only. Broadly half of children in poverty live in working households, so the benefits of these options are confined to this group. The other half of children in poverty are in households that rely on income from main benefits. The gains are lower on the BHC50 measure as there are fewer working families in poverty under this measure (and fewer families in poverty overall under this measure). This means there is a limit on how much BHC50 reductions can be achieved through increases to in-work payments alone. Part Two: Shifting to a new, enhanced in-work payment 15 We understand that your preferred direction for WFF reform is ‘option 1’ from past advice. As a reminder, option 1: • introduces a new in-work payment that replaces the MFTC and IWTC and is available for working families who are off-benefit. • ensures families are better off off-benefit, like MFTC currently, but with more gradual abatement. 16 The Minister for Social Development and Employment has further indicated their current preference for settings that allow families to receive the full in- work payment ($386 pw) when they are in paid work (1B, ‘no hours test’); rather than settings that allow families to receive a partial payment with ‘no 3 The number of children living in households that have less than 50 percent of the median equivalised disposable household income before housing costs. Working for Families: Improving support for working families and Budget 2023 14 hours test’ (e.g. $100 pw), which gets topped up to the full amount when the hours test is met (1A, ‘partial hours test’). 17 Previous advice included two versions of this option, with different abatement settings and fiscal cost: • The ‘full’ option with a single abatement rate of 30%, which was previously estimated to cost an estimated $955m per annum. • The ‘scaled’ option with a two-tiered abatement regime that reduces cost and targets increases more to lower-income working families. Modelling: Costs and impacts for families 18 We have updated the modelling for both variations of Option 1B for implementation in 2025/26, with revised parameters that take into account the latest decisions and other recent factors. For both the ‘full’ and the ‘scaled’ option, the existing MFTC and IWTC are replaced with a new in-work payment set at a rate of $386 pw. 19 Under the ‘full option’, the new in-work payment abates at 30% over $26,500 pa, and once this is fully abated the FTC abates at the same rate. Modelling indicates that this would: • cost $1,055m in 2025/26 • see 190,000 households gain an average of $106 per week, and • reduce child poverty by 21,000 children on the BHC50 measure and 37,000 on the AHC50 measure. 20 Under the ‘scaled option’, a two-tier abatement regime is introduced: a first tier of abatement above $26,500 pa, where the new IWP withdraws much more quickly at 55%, and a second tier of abatement above $49,500 pa, where WFF payments abate at 30%. Modelling indicates that the ‘scaled’ option would: • cost $703m in 2025/26 • see 170,000 households gain an average of $79 per week, and • reduce child poverty by 18,000 children on the BHC50 measure and 29,000 on the AHC50 measure. 21 The fiscal cost of the scaled options has increased significantly compared with previous advice due to the implementation date being shifted to a year later, and other changes including the impact of the upcoming benefit increases on 1 April and updated macroeconomic assumptions. Note that the above costs are from Treasury’s TAWA modelling and do not include operational costs or all flow-on impacts. TAWA’s costs are for the income tax year, starting 1 April. Modelling by IR, including five-year costs and fiscal years, is provided in Appendix 1. Working for Families: Improving support for working families and Budget 2023 15 Other considerations related to Option 1B 22 In both cases, Option 1B has a strong focus on making work pay and would provide real gains to low-income working families. The payment ensures families are better off when in work, addresses a number of issues created by the current MFTC, and should encourage movement off benefit more strongly than current settings. Having no hours test has simplification benefits 23 On current settings, families with children are eligible for the IWTC ($72.50 pw) as long as they are off-benefit and in paid work; there is no hours test. Families are eligible for the MFTC once they are working a minimum number of hours (20 hours for sole parents, 30 hours for couples). 24 There are simplification benefits to having no hours test – families would not have to notify changing hours to IR at a lower level of hours worked, which makes the payment simpler to administer, reduces debt to Government, and better supports families with variable work hours. 25 Families may be less likely to experience gaps in support or need to move on/off a main benefit, reducing the need to navigate between MSD and IR. Having no hours test could also encourage people to leave benefit to take up small amounts of work, and there is evidence that some participation in the labour market encourages people to work more Not including any hours test with a payment of this size creates a tension with the benefit system 26 As noted in past advice, having a large payment ($386 pw) with minimal work requirements (i.e. as little as an hour a week) creates a tension with aspects of the benefit system, given the work obligations and sanctions attached to the receipt of main benefits. This option would mean working families can receive the new payment at lower hours of work if they choose not to be on benefit. The payment rate ($386 pw) is close to the level of main benefits ($440 pw for sole parents), which require clients to be actively looking for part- or full-time work or, for those with a child under three, preparing or planning for work. In general, the option means higher effective marginal tax rates for most WFF recipients, particularly with a two-tier abatement regime 27 The impact of Option 1B on effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) is different for different family types and depends on a range of factors, including family type, income, and the combination of payments they receive. For those earning below $50,000 pa: • Those currently receiving the MFTC would shift to the new in-work payment, which would abate more gradually, rather than withdrawing on a dollar-for-dollar basis. This would mean a reduction in EMTRs for this group of people. Working for Families: Improving support for working families and Budget 2023 16 • Those who are not receiving the MFTC (the majority of WFF recipients) would see a substantial increase in EMTRs, particularly under the scaled option, where their EMTRs increase from around 20% to around 75%. 28 Families earning above $50,000 pa would see a smaller increase (3ppt), but for some of these higher income families this would be on top of already high ETMRs. These are families who are receiving other payments, such as the Accommodation Supplement or Best Start, which abate at the same time as WFF. Some families with very high EMTRs currently will see these increase even more 29 In order to minimise issues with overlapping abatement, the abatement settings for the new in-work payment were based in part on other settings in the tax and transfer system: • The first abatement threshold of $26,500 pa is set at a level where they could receive the full payment when working 20 hours on the minimum wage. Above that threshold, the payment abates at 55%. • The second abatement threshold of $49,500 pa was set around the point where Accommodation Supplement begins abating at 25%. 4 Above this threshold, the WFF abatement rate is 30%, which means the combined abatement rate for Accommodation Supplement and WFF above this threshold would be 55%. 30 Working families with incomes above the second threshold who are receiving both the Accommodation Supplement and Working for Families already face very high EMTRs, and this option would see these increase further. Once personal tax and ACC are taken into account, their EMTRs approach 90%. 31 For people in some specific circumstances, EMTRs would be even higher, and could exceed 100%: • Those also with student loan debt earning above $21,000 pa need to contribute a further 12c in the dollar for every additional dollar earned above this level. • Those receiving Best Start with family income above $79,000 pa have their payment abate at the same time as Working for Families payments, at 21c in the dollar. 32 These very high EMTRs would only apply to some families receiving specific combinations of payments – for example, there are relatively few families 4 If this option progresses, we also recommend a change to the Accommodation Supplement abatement threshold for sole parents, which is currently based on the full- time abatement regime which used to apply to sole-parents on Job-Seeker Support. Without this change, there would be an income range (between $42,000 and $52,000) for sole parents receiving both WFF and AS where the combined abatement of the two payments is 85%, and whose EMTRs would exceed 100% once tax and ACC is included. Working for Families: Improving support for working families and Budget 2023 17 receiving AS who earn over $79,000 pa, and even fewer with children under 3. 33 We have also modelled a variant with more gradual abatement settings, which withdraws at 50% and then 27%, rather than 55% and then 30%. As well as meaning less of an increase on EMTRs, this would mean higher gains for families and child poverty impacts – but with a higher accompanying cost. 34 The gradual abatement version of Option 1B would: • cost $923m in 2025/26 • see 191,000 households gain an average of $93 per week, and • reduce child poverty by 19,000 children on the BHC50 low income measure and 33,000 on the AHC50 measure. 35 We could also consider increasing the abatement threshold for Best Start – an increase to $100,000 pa would reduce the overlap between Accommodation Supplement and Best Start abatement and likely cost around $40-50m. We can provide confirmed costings and further advice on any key considerations with this option as part of the next stage of advice. To maintain the margin between benefit and work, indexation of some settings would likely be required, and discretionary increases to benefit levels could potentially carry greater fiscal cost 36 One of the features of the design of Option 1B is that the new in-work payment ensures that a family is better off in work than on benefit, a role in the payment system currently occupied by the Minimum Family Tax Credit. In order to maintain these relativities, we recommend that an automatic adjustment mechanism of some kind is introduced each year to ensure work (supplemented by the in-work payment) continues to pay more than the benefit. 37 There are a range of options that could be considered, with different strengths and weaknesses. An instrument designed solely for this purpose would take into account the levels of both benefit rates and the minimum wage, and apply to both the payment rate and the first abatement threshold of the new payment. However, this would be complex and may have unintended consequences – for example, decisions around minimum wage or benefit increases would have broader implications for WFF and fiscal cost. The shift to indexing some settings would mean that the WFF payment system would carry higher costs over time, relative to current settings. 38 Another option would be simply to index the payment threshold only using the growth in net average wages, the same mechanism currently used to adjust benefit levels. This would be simpler but would not necessarily guarantee that relativities are preserved. Settings could gradually become out-of-date, particularly if the minimum wage is increased faster than average wages. Working for Families: Improving support for working families and Budget 2023 18 39 Another related policy question with Option 1B is whether to also ‘lock together’ benefit rates with WFF settings, so that any discretionary increases to main benefits also change settings for the new in-work payment, as they do currently with the MFTC. If WFF settings were automatically adjusted to preserve the margin between benefit and work, this would mean any future benefit increases would carry a higher fiscal cost. There are a number of detailed policy questions and operational complexities that need to be worked through 40 The introduction of a new in-work payment, and the reversal of the order of abatement so that the FTC withdraws after the new in-work payment, creates a number of policy questions that need to be worked through: • Eligibility for the self-employed - Officials are likely to recommend that the new IWP would include self-employed people, but we would need to do further work to confirm this and examine its specific implications. Under the status quo, self-employed people are eligible for the IWTC only and not the MFTC, for reasons that are partly historical in nature, and because of the increased risk of gaming with self-employment. Self- employed people are more likely to be able to exercise choice with their hours of work, and would be expected to self-declare their hours. • Shared care - Currently the full amount of IWTC is available for each parent with shared care of a child, whereas the FTC is apportioned between parents depending on the level of care. There is a question as to how the shared care rules would apply to the new in-work payment, and whether the same rules would apply as for the IWTC. • OB/UCB/FCA recipients - Caregivers cannot currently receive OB/UCB/FCA and the FTC for the same child, as these payments are considered analogous, whereas they can receive both the IWTC and OB/UCB/FCA, if they qualify. Decisions would be required on whether the same settings apply to the new in-work payment. • 4+ IWTC rate - the current In-Work Tax Credit includes a per-child rate of $15 pw for the 4 th and subsequent children, which did not feature in the original design of Option 1B included in past advice. There is a policy question as to whether to retain the rate, or remove it (and potentially disadvantage some larger working families). • Detailed abatement and ringfencing rules – the shift from IWTC/MFTC to the new payment may have implications for various rules about how income and abatement settings are operationalised in practice, and detailed policy settings need to be confirmed. There may be some families who are financially disadvantaged from the changes. 41 Detailed advice and decisions are likely required on the above issues. The above issues are just those identified through initial analysis, and there may be others that are yet to be identified. Working for Families: Improving support for working families and Budget 2023 19 Timing 42 As noted earlier in this report, officials have determined that there is insufficient time to develop and model the detailed settings for Option 1B in order to be able to provide comprehensive advice for Budget 2023. It would also likely not be possible to implement Option 1B by 1 April 2024, even if it were funded through Budget 2023, given the complexity and scale of the changes involved. At most, we recommend you indicate that a new in-work payment is a possible direction of travel that is being explored further. 43 You could signal the possibility of change through the release of a discussion document, given it would be such a significant change to the system. However, officials’ view is that the timing of the election would make this very challenging and would likely overlap with the pre-election period which begins on 14 July 2023. Officials are also unlikely to be able to resource the development of a discussion document and public consultation at the same time as continuing the policy work required. 44 In order for the option to be implemented by April 2025, work would also need to continue at pace. In-principle decisions would need to be made at the end of this year, and detailed parameters would need to be confirmed by April 2024, with funding provided through a precommitment on Budget 2024. Implementation timeframes will also depend on the final design of the option chosen and what other priorities IR and MSD are asked to progress over the same timeframes. 45 An illustrative timeframe based on this approach is as follows: • April 2023 – Cabinet agreement to progress further work on exploring options in the direction of option 1B, including how this will be signalled in Budget 2023 announcements • June/July 2023 – further advice on options • November 2023 – detailed advice ready as part of Briefings to Incoming Ministers • December 2023 – in-principle decisions made, Budget 2024 pre- commitment • April 2024 - detailed parameters confirmed • 2024 - legislation passed • 1 April 2025 – option implemented. 46 Officials note that the above timeframes are tight for decisions and there is also insufficient time for any further public consultation. Part Three: Immediate changes for Budget 2023 47 There are options for simpler changes to settings that could be announced in Budget 2023 that are broadly consistent with the direction of travel towards the new in-work payment design. Working for Families: Improving support for working families and Budget 2023 20 48 Note that we have provided indicative implementation timeframes below but these in part depend on other Budget priorities that IR and MSD are asked to deliver over the same timeframes. 49 The costs below are from Treasury’s TAWA model and do not include operational costs or all flow-on impacts. TAWA’s costs are for the income tax year, starting 1 April. Modelling by IR, including five-year costs and fiscal years, is provided in Appendix 1. Modelling: Costs and impacts for families 50 You have expressed interest in the introduction of option 6B from the November advice, as an initial step towards option 1B. As a reminder, this option: • keeps the FTC and IWTC in its current form • removes the MFTC • increases the IWTC rate by $25 pw to improve income adequacy, and • increases the WFF abatement threshold to $50,000 pa to help make work pay and avoid overlapping abatement with benefits. 51 The costs and immediate impacts on incomes and measured child poverty are set out in the table below. Key considerations with Option 6B 52 If you wish to ultimately progress to a system based around ‘Option 1’, we do not recommend you remove MFTC now, as this would likely create difficulty and confusion for those currently in receipt of the payment. To ensure these clients are not worse off, agencies would advise them to transfer to benefit, but then they would need to transfer back to the in-work payment the following year. A small group of very low-income working families would also likely not be eligible for benefit and would be financially disadvantaged. For these reasons, officials recommend maintaining the MFTC using its current formula, until decisions about the longer-term direction of WFF are made. 53 If you wish to implement Option 6B as the ‘end-point’ for the reforms, then the removal of the MFTC could be considered, but it is worth keeping in mind the downsides noted in previous advice. While this option maintains an in- Tax Year Cost (24/25) Average gains/losses Poverty impacts Implementation Option 6B $25 pw IWTC increase + WFF abatement threshold to $50,000 pa + MFTC removed $406m 173,000 HHs gain $46pw 6,000 HHs lose $35pw 8,000 (BHC50) 19,000 (AHC50) April 2024 Working for Families: Improving support for working families and Budget 2023 21 work payment through the IWTC, it does not guarantee low-income families are better off receiving it and going off-benefit at 20/30 hours of work. It may mean more working families, mainly sole parents, would stay on benefit for longer, as they would be better off receiving an abated benefit when working part time. 54 As noted in previous advice, complementary changes to the benefit system would also be required if you opt to remove the MFTC. These include moving sole parents with children over 14 from Job Seeker Support to Sole Parent Support, to enable them to receive an abated benefit for longer, and changes to work requirements and obligations for couples receiving Job Seeker Support. These changes would not be able to be implemented by MSD until April 2025 at the earliest. 55 The removal of MFTC is also likely to result in some families being financially disadvantaged from the change: • Treasury’s TAWA modelling for Option 6B shows 6,000 households would lose $35 per week on average. • IR modelling of those who are estimated to be financially disadvantaged (which is not directly comparable to the TAWA modelling above) indicates around 3,000 current families receiving MFTC would be worse off by an average of $79pw. 56 To some extent, these numbers of families who are financially disadvantaged are likely to be over-stated, as both estimates do not take into account the fact that many of affected families would be eligible to shift to receiving an abated benefit to offset their losses. However, there would be a small group of families who would not be eligible for benefits, for example, due to working more than 30 hours a week. Other simple IWTC and/or abatement threshold changes for Budget 2023 57 We have also modelled other simple IWTC changes that retain the MFTC and could be considered for Budget 2023, including: • increases to the IWTC rate of $25 and $15 pw as stand-alone options • an abatement threshold increase ($50,000 pa) as stand-alone option, and • a combination of a $10 pw IWTC rate increase with an increase in the abatement threshold to $50,000 pa. Working for Families: Improving support for working families and Budget 2023 22 58 These options could likely be implemented on 1 July 2023 or 1 April 2024. However, given the complexity of the tax and transfer system, and the significant number of interactions between payments, a later implementation date will provide agencies with more time to manage these. Other Budget priorities may also make the earlier implementation date more challenging. For these reasons, officials recommend a 1 April 2024 implementation date for these changes. 59 These changes will have impacts on the MFTC that are not included in the above costings. For example, increases to the rate of the IWTC will generally result in a decrease in the MFTC threshold. Detailed costs and impacts will be provided in the Budget Cabinet paper if one of these options progresses. Comparing impacts: IWTC payment rate vs WFF abatement threshold 60 If fiscal constraints necessitate a choice between an increase to the IWTC payment rate and an increase to the WFF abatement threshold, then you may wish to consider the relative distributional impact of the two options: • of the options modelled, the increase to the abatement threshold carries a higher fiscal cost and, commensurate with this, has a greater impact on incomes. • as shown in the graph below, an IWTC rate increase is slightly more targeted at those on the lowest incomes – families below $50,000 gain a greater proportion of the additional expenditure – whereas a threshold increase impacts more on low-middle income families. Tax Year Cost (24/25) Average gains/losses Poverty impacts Implementation Option 6B2 $25 pw IWTC increase only $166m 160,000 HHs gain $20pw 4,000 (BHC50) 6,000 (AHC50 July 2023 or April 2024 Option 6B3 $15 pw IWTC increase only $97m 153,000 HHs gain $12pw 4,000 HHs lose $3pw 3,000 (BHC50) 4,000 (AHC50) July 2023 or April 2024 Option 6B4 Abatement threshold to $50,000 pa $238m 152,000 HHs gain $30pw 4,000 (BHC50) 11,000 (AHC50) July 2023 or April 2024 Option 6B5 $10 pw IWTC increase + abatement threshold to $50,000 pa $309m 173,000 HHs gain $34pw 6,000 (BHC50) 17,000 (AHC50) July 2023 or April 2024 Working for Families: Improving support for working families and Budget 2023 23 • an abatement threshold increase has slightly higher child poverty impacts, with the AHC measure reducing by 11,000 children, compared with 6,000 children for the $25 pw IWTC increase. 61 There are other reasons why you may wish to consider an abatement threshold increase. This increase reduces the extent to which abatement of benefits and WFF overlap. IR estimate that this would reduce WFF debt for approximately 2,400 beneficiary families and eliminate it for approximately 1,200 beneficiary families. This increase also ensures that a single earner on the minimum wage does not face abatement of WFF payments (as 40 hours of work a week means the current minimum wage is equivalent to around $47,000 pa). 62 The option that best addresses income adequacy and lifts the most children out of poverty on the AHC50 measure per dollar of fiscal cost combines an IWTC increase of $10 pw with an increased abatement threshold (option 6B5). This option reduces child poverty by 17,000 on the AHC50 measure at a cost of $309 million. 63 If any of these simpler options became an end-point for the WFF Review, they would still align with the objectives of supporting income adequacy and reducing child poverty, and improving financial incentives to work. They are not focused on simplifying the system however, and some of the issues identified in past reports related to the MFTC and the complexity of the tax/benefit interface would remain. Consequential impacts and detailed policy decisions 64 Given the interdependencies between payments in the welfare system, there are some consequential impacts of increasing the IWTC and/or the WFF abatement threshold that need to be considered for Budget 2023. Constrained timeframes for modelling mean that impacts have not yet been fully quantified and further flow-ons may be identified. All flow-ons will be included in the Budget Cabinet paper, if an option progresses. Working for Families: Improving support for working families and Budget 2023 24 65 Both options will increase the income people receive from either the IWTC or FTC, 5 which are considered income for some types of assistance: 65.1 Community Services Card (CSC): When the rate of FTC or IWTC increases, families close to the income threshold for CSC may be pushed over the income threshold and lose eligibility to the card. This flow on occurred in 2018 as a result of the Families Package. At that time, Cabinet agreed to increase the CSC income thresholds to ensure no families lost eligibility to the CSC as a result \[CAB-17-MIN-0516 refers\]. This will occur under all of the proposed options for Budget 2023, however further work is required to estimate how many families could be impacted, though fiscal impacts are likely to be minor. Officials recommend this decision is delegated by Cabinet to a group of Ministers to make subsequent decisions. 65.2 Temporary Additional Support (TAS) and Special Benefit: These are temporary payments made to top up a person’s weekly income to meet essential costs. FTC is chargeable income for Special Benefit, while all WFF tax credits are chargeable income for TAS. This means all of the proposed options for Budget 2023 may reduce the amount of TAS or Special Benefit a person receives. However, it is expected that people receiving these payments will still generally receive an increase in their income overall. The exception to this is those who lose entitlement to TAS because their deficiency is less than a dollar, therefore the loss is less than a dollar of TAS. 65.3 Independent Earner Tax Credit (IETC): If a family is entitled to WFF then they are not eligible to receive IETC ($10 pw). Any increase in entitlement to WFF from these changes will mean some individuals within families are no longer eligible to IETC. Part Four: Update on administrative options workstream 66 In July 2022, you agreed to further advice on administrative and operational improvements to improve client experience and reduce debt. The resultant administrative workstream focuses on the third objective of the original WFF reform, namely, supporting people into work (and to remain in work) by making sure they get the assistance they are entitled to in a timely manner. 67 In November 2022, you agreed to the following recommendations, and noted that further advice would be provided on implementation and fiscal costs in a report in early 2023: • that officials assess the existing information exchanged under the Inland Revenue-Ministry for Social Development Approved Information Sharing 5 Increasing the abatement threshold will increase the rate of IWTC and/or FTC that people receive at various income levels. Working for Families: Improving support for working families and Budget 2023 25 Agreement and determine the scope and feasibility of additional changes that would reduce overpayments and improve customer experience; • to provide a four-week grace period when a child dies for the FTC and IWTC; and • to repeal the grand parented Child Tax Credit. 68 The fiscal impact of providing a four-week grace period when a child dies for the FTC and IWTC has now been costed. This would be $0.48 million over the forecast period, and then $0.156 million for out years. This is based on a 1 April 2024 application date, and the number of cases whereby IR has been advised of the death of a child during the year. 6 69 You also indicated that you would want further advice about remedial amendments that could be included in a bill in 2023. Officials have developed proposals for remedial amendments, as well as additional administrative and operational improvements. However, this advice has been delayed to focus on the substantive advice for WFF for Budget 2023. Some of these additional proposals have small fiscal costs while other proposals do not. 70 Treasury has advised that the WFF administrative options with fiscal costs should not be progressed as part of the Budget 2023 package. If Ministers wish, officials could provide advice on the administrative and remedial initiatives with no fiscal implications, and whether they could be implemented for April 2024, through a tax bill enacted by the end of 2023. 71 Additionally, we could continue to progress this workstream and seek to fund the other initiatives with fiscals as part of the larger WFF reforms for Budget 2024. Alternatively, items that relate to debt reduction could be progressed as part of the wider debt to government work. As part of the debt to government work, changes to penalties and interest settings are progressing on a similar timeframe, and changes will likely form a bid for Budget 2024. Next steps 72 If you wish to progress one of the simpler IWTC changes in this paper for Budget 2023, officials can prepare material for you to seek the agreement of your colleagues – either through a dedicated Cabinet paper, or through the overall Budget Cabinet paper. We can engage with your office on the most appropriate mechanism for progressing Cabinet decisions. 73 If you wish to progress to further advice in the direction of Option 1B, we also recommend you seek agreement from your colleagues via Cabinet paper – this could be through the same Budget paper, or separate to it. This will include how the future direction of WFF will be signalled as part of Budget 2023 announcements. 6 This is currently 326 children per annum. Working for Families: Improving support for working families and Budget 2023 26 74 As noted above, in order for an option like 1B to be implemented by April 2025, detailed parameters would need to be confirmed by April 2024, with funding provided through a precommitment on Budget 2024. Work would also need to continue to progress at pace, with in-principle decisions made by the end of this year. MSD REP/23/3/169 - IR2023/018 Author: Tim Garlick, Principal Advisor, MSD Responsible manager: Polly Vowles, Policy Manager, MSD Working for Families: Improving support for working families and Budget 2023 27 Appendix 1: Comparison of IR and TAWA costings The tables below show the TAWA and IR modelling of the cost of the WFF options. TAWA’s costs are for the income tax year, starting 1 April. IR’s costs are for fiscal years (starting 1 July) and include costs over the forecast period (five-year costs). IR’s model is currently costing the WFF options around 10% higher than Treasury’s TAWA model. This is largely due to differences in the underlying populations between the models – with IR’s model based on administrative data and TAWA’s based on the Household Economic Survey. Officials will determine the most appropriate costings to use in the Budget Cabinet paper. The five-year costings by IR include costings for both 1 July 2023 and 1 April 2024 implementation dates for the Budget 2023 options. It is also worth noting that IR’s model also captures some more detailed flow-on impacts that TAWA does not, and is based on a larger population, which generally means that it may identify more families that are financially disadvantaged by changes. For example, TAWA has suppressed results for families who are financially disadvantaged by the variations of Option 1B. For these same variations, IR modelling suggests there may be up to around 5,000 families who are financially disadvantaged. Neither model shows any families financially disadvantaged by the options for Budget 2023 that retain the MFTC. Modelling of implementing the Budget 2023 options in 2023 before Option 1B is implemented in 2025 suggests that progressing these options before implementing option 1B may increase the number of families who are financially disadvantaged. Further advice can explore these results.

This will enable a Cabinet report back by the end of 2023 on the next steps of the Review. Executive summary 2 The decisions in this report on the preferred option/s for the WFF Review will enable a report back to Cabinet in December 2023. If Ministers would like to progress a WFF option for consideration in Budget 2024, timely decisions on the advice in this report will be required. 3 Ministers have indicated that their preferred direction for structural reform was a scaled version of an option referred to in previous advice as Option 1B –a new in-work payment. Previous options considered by the Review are set out in Appendix One. 4 Through further work on the Review, officials have determined that there is insufficient time to develop a structural reform option for Budget 2024 (with an implementation date of 1 April 2025), though smaller-scale changes within the current system could still be considered. Options for structural reform could be considered in Budget 2025, with an implementation date of 1 April 2026. This report presents: Appendix A Document 5 Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 2 • a set of structural reform options illustrating key choices about the design of the in-work payment, and • a set of smaller-scale changes within the current system focused on addressing issues with the current abatement threshold. Structural reform of Working for Families - a new in-work payment 5 This new in-work payment combines the current work-related tax credits – the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC) and In-Work Tax Credit (IWTC) into a single, more generous in-work payment. This new system also retains the Family Tax Credit (FTC) and the Best Start Tax Credit (BSTC) which go to both beneficiary and non-beneficiary families with children. 6 The new in-work payment would continue to be available for low to middle- income working families not receiving a main benefit. It also switches the order of abatement compared to the current system, with the new in-work payment abating first from a lower starting point, and the FTC abating after the in-work payment. This is illustrated in a diagram in Appendix Two. 7 The new in-work payment provides significant income gains to low and middle-income working families (meeting a key objective of the Review). At the same time, it would reduce the number of children in poverty. A core improvement of the new in-work payment is that it removes effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) of above 100% created by the MFTC, improving work incentives for the approximately 3,000 current MFTC recipients. 8 The full-cost version of Option 1 was estimated in previous advice to cost around $1,055m per year (not including operational costs). Given this significant cost, a scaled option was also provided that reduced the annual fiscal cost to $703m 1 by increasing abatement settings to target increases more to lower-income working families, consistent with the objectives of the Review. In-work payment variations 9 This report provides updated costings of the scaled option provided in previous advice 2 – referred to in this report as the “base case” (IWP(base)) – as well as four variations that adjust key parameters to address issues with the base option that: • further reduce the high fiscal cost • reduce high effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs), and • reduce tensions with the benefit system. 1 This costing was prepared for the March 2023 advice using a different Economic and Fiscal forecast update than the forecast update used for this paper. 2 REP/23/3/169; IR2023/018 Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 3 10 A key parameter that is varied to reduce cost is the payment rate - the IWP(base) option for the in-work payment option has a high payment rate. 11 The variations: • Address the high cost of the IWP(base) option - IWP(a) and IWP(b): A medium or low payment rate set in relation to sole parents receiving a broadly equivalent amount of income as the current system • Address the high EMTRs of the IWP(base) option - IWP(c): A medium payment rate with more gradual abatement • Address the tension with the benefit system and high cost of the IWP(base) option - IWP(d): A medium payment rate and a partial hours test. 12 The table below provides a summary of the main impacts of each in-work payment option. Costings in this report do not include operational costs – these will be provided in further advice. IWP(base)- high IWP IWP(a) – medium IWP IWP(b) – low IWP IWP(c) – medium IWP + gradual abatement IWP(d) – medium IWP + partial hours test Fiscal impact 3 Tax year 25/26 $690m $343m $221m $617m $240m Average gains/losses 170,000 HHs gain $78pw 148,000 HHs gain $45pw 5,000 HHs lose $20pw 136,000 HHs gain $33pw 11,000 HHs lose $18pw 173,000 HHs gain $68pw 142,000 HHs gain $34pw 11,000 HHs lose $20pw Child poverty reduction 21,000 (BHC50) 26,000 (AHC50) 14,000 (BHC50) 14,000 (AHC50) 8,000 (BHC50) 7,000 (AHC50) 19,000 (BHC50) 23,000 (AHC50) 9,000 (BHC50) 10,000 (AHC50) 13 The base option for the new in-work payment and the variations presented in the report still meet the objectives of the Review outlined in paragraph 41 of 3 Fiscal costs in this report use outputs from Treasury’s Tax and Welfare Analysis model. Inland Revenue have also modelled these costs. There is some variance between the two modelling outputs, largely due to the differences in underlying populations between the models. Officials will determine the best source of costings for Cabinet papers and Budget proposals. Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 4 the main body of the report. However, when making choices between these options, the key trade-offs relate to managing fiscal cost against: • the impact a reduced payment rate has on couples • impacts on effective marginal tax rates and financial incentives to work, and • achieving significant reductions in child poverty. 14 The variations are intended to illustrate the key choices about the parameters of the new in-work payment in order for Ministers to indicate their preferred settings in this advice and enable the next report to focus on detailed design issues. 15 Further assessment of each of the variations of the in-work payment is provided in Appendix Three, and Appendix Four provides further detail on the parameters of each option. Variations - payment rate and impacts on couples 16 Setting the payment rate in relation to sole parents – at a medium or low payment rate (IWP (a) – (d)) – compared to the high payment rate in IWP(base), reduces the overall costs of the payment but perpetuates an existing issue with the benefit system in relation to the MFTC. With the current rate of MFTC, couples are not necessarily better off leaving the benefit system at 30 hours of work at the minimum wage than they are receiving an abated benefit. 17 The lower the payment rate is set, the more that couples would need to work to be better-off receiving it. Also, the “30-hour rule” in the benefit system means that a small number of couples may not be able to continue to receive Jobseeker Support beyond 30 hours of work a week, so may need to come off benefit and be worse off. To ensure these couples aren’t worse off at 30 hours, changes to primary legislation are recommended to enable couples to continue to receive an abated benefit for longer. 18 Officials will provide further advice on this issue depending on the option chosen. Variations - abatement settings and targeting of fiscal costs 19 The IWP(base) option and most of the variations have abatement settings that increase EMTRs compared to the current system for most recipients of WFF tax credits (other than current MFTC recipients). Providing more gradual abatement rates (IWP(c)) maintains the EMTRs at or below the current levels (maintaining financial incentives to work). However, the more gradual abatement means that this option is significantly costlier than the other variations and has a similar scale of fiscal costs compared to the base option. Further, the large fiscal costs are less targeted towards low-income working families compared to other options. Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 5 Variations - introducing an hours test to reduce tension with the benefit system 20 The new in-work payment provides a level of income that is much closer to what is received by a main benefit compared to the current system. Having a large payment with minimal work requirements creates a tension with the benefit system given the work obligations and sanctions attached to the receipt of main benefit. Without an hours test, the new payment could be argued to undermine the purpose and principles of the benefit system and in particular the work obligations and sanctions laid out in the Social Security Act 2018. 21 However, it is not easy to address this issue without facing significant trade- offs. The key advantage of an hours test is that it mitigates tensions with the work obligations and sanctions in the benefit system and provides greater incentives to work more by retaining the hours test for the full amount of weekly payment. 22 The key disadvantages of an hours test are that it would reintroduce complexity, uncertainty and potentially increase debt for a larger number of WFF recipients who have fluctuating employment arrangements. For this reason, Inland Revenue (IR) do not recommend this option as it would be unlikely to improve the current system overall. Considerations to be worked through in subsequent advice on structural reform with a new in-work payment 23 There are further considerations for the new in-work payment that will be provided in subsequent advice. These considerations require a considerable amount of further detailed policy work. 24 These include: indexation of the in-work payment rate and/or abatement settings, implications for the costs of any future discretionary increases to main benefits or the FTC, eligibility of self-employed families; how shared care arrangements are dealt with; eligibility for Orphans Benefit/ Unsupported Childs Benefit /Foster Care Allowance recipients; consideration of 4+ children rate, detailed abatement and ring-fencing rules (including abatement thresholds), and payment settings in relation to the MFTC within the transition period. 25 Ministerial decisions on many of these aspects would be needed to inform a future Budget Bid. Emerging issues to address if structural reform is not progressed 26 If no changes are made to Working for Families in the next two years, overlapping abatement will increasingly undermine the functioning of the system. It is anticipated that by 1 April 2026 the MFTC and the WFF abatement thresholds will overlap, creating effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) of over 100% for a small group of low-income working families that would grow without continual adjustments. Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 6 27 In addition, an increasing number of beneficiaries will also face overlapping abatement of their main benefits and the Family Tax Credit (FTC). Finally, inflation and wage growth have been significant since the WFF abatement threshold was last adjusted in 2018. Increases in the abatement threshold are recommended by officials to both address overlapping abatement and ensure that WFF continues to support both low and middle-income working families. These issues could be addressed by either structural reform or smaller-scale changes to Working for Families progressed in Budget 2025 at the latest. Options to address overlapping abatement thresholds 28 There are four options that are presented that address the abatement threshold overlap and progress complementary increases to IWTC and/or remove the MFTC completely. These are summarised in the table below. AT(a) Abatement threshold to $50,000 pa only AT(b) $10 pw IWTC increase + abatement threshold to $50,000 pa AT(c) $25 pw IWTC increase + WFF abatement threshold to $50,000 pa + MFTC removed AT(d) $10 pw IWTC increase + WFF abatement threshold to $50,000 pa + MFTC removed Fiscal impact Tax Year (24/25) 4 $238m $309m $406m $291m Average gains/losses 152,000 HHs gain $30pw 173,000 HHs gain $34pw 173,000 HHs gain $46pw 6,000 HHs lose $35pw 167,000 HHs gain $35pw 7,000 HHs lose $36pw Child poverty reduction 4,000 (BHC50) 11,000 (AHC50) 6,000 (BHC50) 17,000 (AHC50) 8,000 (BHC50) 19,000 (AHC50) 5,000 (BHC50) 16,000 (AHC50) 29 The abatement threshold options could be progressed in lieu of wider structural reform or as a first step progressed in either Budgets 2024 or 2025, and structural reform options considered through later Budgets. 30 As with the in-work payment options, further assessment of each of the variations of the in-work payment is provided in Appendix Three, and Appendix Four provides further detail on the parameters of each option. Preferred approach for December Cabinet paper 31 Choices between higher and lower-cost options depend primarily on the Government’s wider fiscal strategy and desired progress towards the ten-year child poverty reduction targets. 4 Fiscals costs only, does not include implementation or operational costings. Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 7 32 Appendix Three sets out key trade-offs for consideration of the in-work payment options and the abatement threshold options discussed in this report: • High-cost options for an in-work payment: IWP(base) / IWP(c) • Lower-cost options for an in-work payment: IWP(a) / IWP(b) / IWP(d) • Abatement threshold increase and complementary changes: AT(a) – (d). 33 When considering between the IWP options, variations have been provided to reduce costs and address key issues with the base option. However these variations also introduce more trade-offs. While the in-work payment removes effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) of above 100% for the small number of MTFC recipients, the overall impact of the new IWP is that it increases EMTRs for the much larger group of FTC recipients. However, maintaining EMTRs at current levels results in significantly higher fiscal costs and less targeting to lower-income families. 34 Some of the variations of the IWP also create losers (IWP(a), IWP(b) and IWP(d)) and provide lower child poverty reductions. The higher cost options, IWP(base) and IWP(c) provide the largest child poverty reductions. Finally, there are differing agency views on whether or not there is an hours test with the in-work payment. 35 IR do not recommend re-introducing a partial hours test as it would reintroduce complexity, uncertainty and potentially increase debt for a larger number of WFF recipients who have fluctuating employment arrangements. For MSD, the decision on whether or not to introduce an hours test is finely balanced but given the large in-work payment, providing it without an hours test represents a large philosophical change to the welfare system as noted in paragraph 20 above. 36 If Ministers are interested in progressing changes that cost between $200 - $400m then the trade-offs and losers associated with the lower cost IWP options begin to outweigh the benefits associated with the new in-work payment. For a similar fiscal envelope, officials recommend considering the abatement threshold options, AT(a) or AT(b), instead. 37 While the abatement thresholds options do not provide large structural reform, they help to maintain the policy intent of WFF by adjusting the abatement thresholds to allow for recent wage and inflation increases. Abatement threshold options also provide a key change that most stakeholders are interested in. By not removing the MFTC, option AT(a) and AT(b) do not create any losers and are comparatively simpler to administer. Officials do not recommend abatement threshold options that remove the MFTC unless further changes are made to reduce the number of families financially disadvantaged. 38 The implementation dates outlined in this report are indicative. Once policy and implementation dates are available, consideration of the deliverability of Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 8 this initiative within MSD and Inland Revenue’s wider policy change portfolio would need to be made. Next steps 39 Given the scale of some of the options presented in this report, we recommend this advice is forwarded and discussed with a group of Ministers that replicates the previous Income Support Ministers. This group would include the Prime Minister, Minister for Children, Minister of Finance, Ministers of Child Poverty Reduction and the Minister of Revenue.

In May 2023, the Minister for Social Development and Employment and the Associate Minister of Revenue took a paper to Cabinet, providing an update on the progress of the Review to date \[CAB-23-MIN-0178\]. 46 The paper noted that the next steps of the Review will consider exploring a potential new in-work payment (IWP) to support working families alongside consideration of other changes to current settings. The paper also noted the 5 March 2023 (REP/23/3/169; IR2023/018); November 2022 (REP/22/11/1097; DPMC- 2022/23-547; T2022/2489; IR2022/511); July 2022 (REP/22/7/682; T2022/1644; IR22/145; DPMC-2021/22-2539) 6 Income Support Ministers included the Minister for Child Poverty Reduction, Minister of Finance, Minister of Social Development and Employment and the Minister of Revenue. Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 14 Review provides the best opportunity to make progress on meeting the Government’s long-term child poverty targets. The Minister for Social Development and Employment and the Associate Minister of Revenue were invited to report back to Cabinet by the end of the year on the next steps of the Review. Purpose and structure of this report 47 The decisions in this report on the preferred option/s for the WFF Review will enable a report back to Cabinet in December 2023. If Ministers would like to progress a WFF option for consideration in Budget 2024, timely decisions on the advice in this report will be required. 48 Through further work on the Review, officials have determined that there is insufficient time to develop a structural reform option for Budget 2024 (with an implementation date of 1 April 2025), though smaller-scale changes within the current system could still be considered. Options for structural reform could be considered in Budget 2025, with an implementation date of 1 April 2026. 49 Furthermore, if no changes are made to Working for Families in the next two years overlapping abatement will increasingly undermine the functioning of the system. This issue could be addressed by either structural reform or smaller-scale changes to Working for Families progressed in Budget 2025 at the latest. 50 Officials note that these initiatives will need to be considered as part of the Government’s wider policy work programme to mitigate potential deliverability risk, particularly where agencies are asked to deliver other changes within a similar timeframe. 51 This report is separated into four parts to address the above issues and related work: • Section One: Options for structural reform of Working for Families • Section Two: Smaller scale options to address anticipated overlapping abatement thresholds • Section Three: Economic and fiscal context and the child poverty reduction targets • Section Four: Further work and timeframes for Cabinet report back Section One: Options for structural reform of Working for Families 52 Option 1 introduces a new in-work payment, which combines the MFTC and IWTC into a single, more generous payment, and retains the FTC. It would continue to be available for low to middle-income working families not receiving a main benefit. It also switches the order of abatement compared to the current system, with the new in-work payment abating first, from a lower Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 15 starting point and the FTC abating after the in-work payment. This is illustrated in a diagram in Appendix Two. 53 Option 1 provides significant income gains to low and middle-income working families (meeting a core objective of the Review) and reductions in child poverty. A core improvement of the new in-work payment is that it removes effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) of above 100% created by the MFTC, improving work incentives for the roughly 3000 families currently receiving MFTC. Previous advice has canvassed two variations of this option: • Option 1A: allows families to receive some of the payment before the hours test 7 is met, before being topped up to the full amount. • Option 1B: allows families to receive all of the payment without an hours test. 54 It is worth noting that a new payment that is targeted towards families off benefit is not the preferred direction of the Review for a large group of stakeholders. From public engagement conducted in 2022, around half of stakeholders and submitters, including the Child Poverty Action Group, argued that the IWTC should be paid to all families regardless of work and benefit status to support child poverty reduction. 55 In the March advice, Option 1B was estimated to cost $1,055m a year in 2025/26. 8 Ministers previously indicated that a fiscal envelope of $200m to $400m a year was likely to be appropriate in Budget 2023. Updated advice on the current economic and fiscal context is provided later in the report in paragraphs 146 - 147. 56 A scaled version of Option 1B was also provided to reduce costs to closer to the suggested envelope. The scaled version of Option 1B had the same payment rate but had higher abatement compared to the full-cost version of Option 1B, targeting the increase in payments more towards lower-income families, consistent with the objectives of the Review. However, the scaled version also provides for smaller income gains and reductions in child poverty and increases EMTRs slightly for many families compared to the current system. The scaled version of Option 1B was estimated to cost $703m in 2025/26 \[REP 23/3/169\]. 57 Ministers have indicated that their preferred direction for structural reform of WFF was a scaled version of Option 1B. This section provides updated costings of the scaled Option 1B (with a higher two-tier abatement regime) 7 The hours test relates to the minimum number of hours a family needs to work before they are eligible for the full rate of payment. For this payment the hours test is 20 hours a week for sole parents and 30 hours a week for couples. For families that work below the hours test are eligible for a partial payment. 8 Costings for this report used the Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update 2022 (HYEFU 22) as a base. Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 16 which will be referred to as the “base case” in-work payment option – IWP(base) - for the remainder of the report. 9 58 The key parameters of the IWP(base) are: • A high payment rate of $384 per week (set at a level so that couples are better off receiving the IWP working 30 hours on minimum wage 10 ) • The payment abates at 55% from working 20 hours a week on minimum wage ($26,500 per annum (pa)), reducing to 30% from the Accommodation Supplement abatement threshold ($49,500 pa) 11 • has no hours test. 59 It also presents four alternative options related to this option which adjust key parameters of the new in-work payment to address issues with the current IWP option – its high cost, high abatement rates and tension with the benefit system. All of these options have a lower payment rate that only ensures that sole parents are better off moving off-benefit at 20 hours of work on the minimum wage and does not ensure that couples are better off. This issue is described in more detail in paras 76 - 79 below. 60 The report presents four alternative options to the IWP(base). These are set out below with the key differences to the parameters of the base option described in paragraph 58 bolded: • To address the high cost - IWP(a) and IWP(b): A medium payment or low payment rate set in relation to sole parents receiving broadly equivalent amount of income as the current system • To address the high EMTRs - IWP(c): A medium payment rate with more gradual abatement • To address the tension with the benefit system - IWP(d): A medium payment rate and a partial hours test to address tension with the benefit system. 9 Costings have used the Budget and Fiscal Update 2023 (BEFU 23) forecasts and an implementation date of 1 April 2025 and do not include operational costings. 10 The modelling for the IWP options has assumed a minimum wage of $25.50 per hour from 1 April 2025. 11 This is to avoid EMTRs over 100% once the Accommodation Supplement starts to abate at 25c/$1. Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 17 61 A summary of key impacts of the parameters of each option is provided in Appendices Two and Three and in the table below: IWP(base)- high IWP IWP(a) – medium IWP IWP(b) – low IWP IWP(c) – medium IWP + gradual abatement IWP(d) – medium IWP + partial hours test Payment rate High - $384pw Medium - $335pw Low - $316pw Medium - $335pw Medium - $335pw Payment rate – who is better off Couple Sole parent Sole parent Sole parent Sole parent Abatement rates Base Base Base Less severe Base Hours Test No No No No Yes Fiscal impact (25/26) $690m $343m $221m $617m $240m Average gains / losses 170,000 HHs gain $78pw 148,000 HHs gain $45pw 5,000 HHs lose $20pw 136,000 HHs gain $33pw 11,000 HHs lose $18pw 173,000 HHs gain $68pw 142,000 HHs gain $34pw 11,000 HHs lose $20pw Child poverty reductions 21,000 (BHC50) 26,000 (AHC50) 14,000 (BHC50) 14,000 (AHC50) 8,000 (BHC50) 7,000 (AHC50) 19,000 (BHC50) 23,000 (AHC50) 9,000 (BHC50) 10,000 (AHC50) 62 Fiscal costs in this report use outputs from Treasury’s Tax and Welfare Analysis model. Inland Revenue have also modelled these costs. There is some variance between the two modelling outputs, largely due to the differences in underlying populations between the models. Officials will determine the best source of costings for Cabinet papers and Budget proposals. 63 The base option for the new in-work payment and the variations presented in the report still meet the objectives of the Review outlined in paragraph 41. However, when making choices between these options, the key trade-offs relate to managing fiscal cost against: • achieving significant reductions in child poverty • impacts on effective marginal tax rates and financial incentives to work, and • the impact a reduced payment rate has on couples. Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 18 64 Another key tension the new in-work payment creates is with the benefit system if there is no hours test. Without an hours test, the new payment could be argued to undermine the purpose and principles of the benefit system and in particular the Social Security Act 2018, which is centred around work with strong obligations and sanctions. However, an hours test would reintroduce complexity, uncertainty and potentially increase debt for a larger number of WFF recipients who have fluctuating employment arrangements. 65 These trade-offs are summarised in a table in Appendix Three and discussed further in each section of the alternative options below. In-work payment, base option - IWP(base): A new, enhanced in-work payment, with two-tier abatement 66 The IWP(base) option provides the new in-work payment for working families with children who are off-benefit. The payment is set at $384 pw (high payment rate). This payment rate is set at this level to ensure that couples with a single earner working 30 hours a week at the minimum wage will be better off receiving the payment than remaining on a main benefit. These are similar payment settings to the MFTC prior to 2021, but with more gradual abatement. 67 The high payment rate means that the number of hours of work where sole parents are better off will be much lower. Assuming a minimum wage of $25.50 at 1 April 2025, a sole parent would be better off moving off-benefit working 15 hours a week. 68 The key feature of the base option is that there is no hours test meaning that families would receive the full in-work payment ($384 pw) when they are in paid work and off-benefit. This means that there are no minimum number of hours of work required to receive the full amount like the current IWTC, but unlike the MFTC. 69 Modelling 12 indicates that IWP(base) (scaled from the full option 1B) would: • Cost $690m in 2025/26 (the first full year of payments) • See 170,000 households gain an average of $78 per week, and • Reduce child poverty by 21,000 children on the BHC50 measure, and 26,000 on the AHC50 measure. 70 The base option meets the objectives of the Review and provides the greatest reduction in child poverty and the greatest weekly gain to households of the options costed for this report. 12 In the March Report, this option cost $703m. Fiscal modelling provided in the March report has been updated using BEFU 23. Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 19 71 Despite the benefits of this option, the main trade-offs related to this option are: • Cost – even with the two-tier abatement settings this option still has a high fiscal cost of $690m per year which may not be feasible. Options IWP(a) and IWP(b) present ways to reduce the payment rate and lower the overall cost of this option. • Effective marginal tax rates – the rate at which the in-work payment abates creates higher EMTRs for many families. Option IWP(c) provides an alternative setting for the two-tier abatement to lower EMTRs (noting that this increases the cost) • Tension created with the benefit system – having a large weekly payment with no hours test creates tensions with the benefit system in relation to work obligations and sanctions for a near-equivalent rate of payment in the benefit system. To mitigate this, Option IWP(d) includes a partial hours test. Lower payment rates to address the overall costs of the base option: IWP(a) and IWP(b) 72 The two lower payment rate options costed for this report are: • A medium payment rate of $335 per week – IWP(a), and • A low payment rate of $316 per week – IWP(b). 73 Assuming a 1 April 2025 implementation date, IWP(a) would: • cost $343m in 2025/26 • see 148,000 households gain an average of $45 per week and see 5,000 households lose an average of $20 per week 13 , and • reduce child poverty by 14,000 children on the BHC50 measure and 14,000 on the AHC50 measure. 74 Assuming a 1 April 2025 implementation date, IWP(b) would: • cost $221m in 2025/26 • see 136,000 households gain an average of $33 per week and see 11,000 households lose an average of $18 per week 14 , and • reduce child poverty by 8,000 children on the BHC50 measure and 7,000 on the AHC50 measure. 13 The losers for this option are in-work couple families who lose more in IWTC than the gain in the combined new in-work payment plus the FTC. This includes anyone not receiving a full year of the IWP (for example those with shared care arrangements and higher income families with more than four children). 14 The losers for this option are in-work couple families who lose more in IWTC than the gain in the combined new in-work payment plus the FTC. Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 20 75 These lower cost options still largely meet the objectives of the reform (see Appendix One) with much lower fiscal costs. IWP(a) is approximately 50% of the cost of the base option for the first full year of payment and IWP(b) is approximately 32% of the cost. 76 However, both IWP(a) and IWP(b) provide for more modest gains for families and smaller reductions in child poverty than IWP(base), with the lower payment rate resulting in the smallest income gains and lowest reductions in child poverty. Trade-offs for payment rates - couples 77 Both the medium and low payment rates reflect the current MFTC settings which have prioritised the payment rate towards sole parents being better off, due to decisions to only partially increase the MFTC abatement thresholds in 2020 \[CAB-20-MIN-0152 refers\]. 78 Sole parents make up around 86% of current MFTC recipients. Setting the payment at a rate that means sole parents will be better off will likely meet the policy intent for the majority of recipients. Previous advice has also noted that the available evidence in New Zealand and overseas suggest that sole parents have more significant responses to changes in financial incentives to work than primary earners in couples. This evidence also suggests that greater in-work payments can work in the opposite direction for couples, by reducing the labour force participation of secondary earners in couples overall. 79 However, a key trade-off with a payment rate below $384 per week means that a couple will no longer be better off moving off-benefit and receiving the IWP working 30 hours a week on minimum wage. The lower the rate, the more couples will need to work – for example, a couple with a single earner on the minimum wage would need to work for 38 hours a week on the minimum wage 15 to be better off receiving the IWP (with a medium payment rate). For an IWP with the lower payment rate, a couple with a single earner on the minimum wage would need to work 41 hours a week on the minimum wage to be better off off-benefit. 80 Further, the “30-hour rule” in the benefit system means that a small number of couples may be ineligible for Jobseeker Support at this point, so may need to come off benefit (before it fully abates) and be worse off because their employment earnings alone are not equivalent to the amount received through the benefit system. 16 To ensure these couples aren’t worse off at 30 15 Assuming a minimum wage of $25.50 on 1 April 2025 16 Jobseeker Support recipients cannot continue to receive the benefit if they are working full-time, which is deemed to be 30 hours or more per week. There are exceptions for sole parents and grandparented clients who were transferred to Jobseeker Support during Welfare Reform, who can work full time for up to 26 weeks. Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 21 hours of work or more, changes to primary legislation are recommended to enable couples to continue to receive an abated benefit for longer (ie. remaining eligible when working more than 30 hours per week). Officials will provide further advice on this issue depending on the option chosen. Trade-offs for payment rates – between medium and low payment rates 81 The exact dollar figures of the medium and lower rates are illustrative and can vary, both higher and lower, depending on other variables. The two key considerations for how payment rates could be set are comparisons with existing levels of payments (MFTC and IWTC) and the minimum wage. 82 The medium payment rate provides families working 20 hours a week on the minimum wage with an equivalent amount of support from the IWP as the combined value of the MFTC and IWTC on 1 April 2024. 83 The low payment rate provides these families with a lower amount of IWP than the current system would on 1 April 2025. However, if there are increases in the minimum wage (for the purposes of these costings we have assumed a minimum wage on 1 April 2025 of $25.50), then sole parents overall incomes would not fall and they would still be better off overall off- benefit at 20 hours of work. 84 For this report the low payment rate means that sole parents working 20 hours a week at the minimum wage would see a $5 increase in net weekly income on 1 April 2025, compared to what they would be receiving on 31 March 2025 if they were working 20 hours and receiving the MFTC and IWTC, because they receive higher income from the minimum wage increase. However, this effectively means they do not gain from the increase in the minimum wage. The medium payment rate means that these families retain more of the gain from an increase in the minimum wage and are $24 per week better off, comparing 31 March and 1 April 2025. 85 If the payment rate is set even lower, below $310 per week, then sole parents would see a reduction in income on 1 April 2025, compared to 31 March 2025. Lower payment rates reduce the fiscal cost considerably - based on modelling, a $10 per week reduction in the payment rate translates roughly to a decrease in the fiscal cost of around $65 to $75 million per year. A medium payment rate with more gradual abatement settings to address high EMTRs: IWP(c) 86 The two-tier abatement settings of the base option (outlined in paragraph 58) were introduced to reduce costs for the full-scale Option 1B. However, the rates of the two-tier abatement settings creates higher EMTRs for families earning above $50,000 per year and receiving both the Accommodation Supplement and WFF. High EMTRs reduce the amount of income that families retain from increases in wages – and this means that financial incentives to work are reduced. Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 22 87 There are also some scenarios where families could face EMTRs that exceed 100% particularly if they are repaying Student Loan debt (which is repaid at 12c in the dollar for income above $21,000) and/or receiving Best Start (abates at 21% for family income above $79,000 at the same time as WFF payments). 88 One option to reduce the high EMTRs of the base option is to have more gradual abatement settings. IWP(c) has the same weekly payment rate as IWP(a) ($335 pw) and two-tier abatement settings, however for income above $26,500 the payment would abate at 50% (instead of 55%) and for income above $49,500 the payment would abate at 27% (instead of 30%). 89 Assuming a 1 April 2025 implementation date, IWP(c) would: • cost $617m in 2025/26 • see 173,000 households gain an average of $68 per week • reduce child poverty by 19,000 children on the BHC50 measure and 23,000 on the AHC50 measure. 90 The key benefit of this option is that it reduces the very high EMTRs for people earning above $50,000 a year. It also has the greatest reductions in child poverty of all the scaling options. 91 However this option provides only an 11% reduction in fiscal costs ($73 million) for 2024/25 compared to the base option, which may not be sufficient. 92 In addition to the high fiscal costs, this option has a greater proportion of gains going to higher-income families so it targets less of the overall fiscal cost towards working families on the lowest incomes. • For IWP(c), approximately 38% of the total fiscal cost goes to households with income under $42,700 (the lowest two income deciles), with an average gain across all households of $68 per week. • In comparison, IWP(a) which has the same payment rate, has 47% of the total fiscal costs going to households in two lowest income deciles and an average gain across all households of $45 per week, at a considerably lower fiscal cost. 93 This option, as with IWP(a) and (b) maintains an existing issue where couples are not necessarily better off leaving the benefit system at 30 hours of work at the minimum wage and receiving a payment for people in work (either the MFTC or a new IWP), than they are receiving an abated benefit. To address tensions with the benefit system: IWP(d) 94 Having a large payment with minimal work requirements (i.e. as little as an hour a week) creates a tension with the benefit system given the work obligations and sanctions attached to the receipt of main benefit. Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 23 95 IWP(d) reintroduces a partial hours test 17 and would allow families with children off-benefit to receive a portion of the payment ($100 pw) before the hours test is met, then receive a higher amount (up to $335 pw) if the hours test is met (20 hours a week for sole parents, 30 hours a week for couples). This mirrors the current system, where families can receive $72.50 pw 18 from the IWTC with no hours test but must meet an hours test to receive the MFTC (up to $253 per week). 96 The payment rate for IWP(d) is set at the same point as IWP(a) and IWP(b) described above, the medium payment rate. It also has the base settings for the two-tier abatement regime (55% and 30%). 97 Assuming a 1 April 2025 implementation date, IWP(d) would: • cost $240m in 2025/26 19 • see 142,000 households gain an average of $34 per week and 11,000 households lose an average of $20 per week 20 • reduce child poverty by 9,000 children on the BHC50 measure and 10,000 on the AHC50 measure 98 IWP(d) is one of the lowest cost options of the Option 1 variations and is 35% of the costs of the base option. IWP(d) largely meets the objectives of the reform, however there are smaller reductions to child poverty and significant additional complexity in customer compliance and administration. Tensions with the benefit system – obligations and sanctions 99 Under the base rate and variants, working families could receive up to $335 per week but would have no work obligations beyond being in paid work in a given week. 21 Work obligations in the benefit system require sole parents (and partners in couples with children) to be seeking part-time work (20 hours a week) when their youngest child is aged between 3 and 13 years and to seek full-time work (30 hours a week) once they reach 14 years of age. For couples, the primary recipient of Jobseeker Support must have full-time work obligations, unless they have reduced work capacity because of a health 17 The hours test was removed from the IWTC from 1 July 2020 but remained for the MFTC. 18 Families with four or more children can receive an additional $15 per child with the IWTC. 19 IR have provided a costing estimate of $393m for this option. The variability between IR and the Treasury’s costing for this option will be investigated as part of further work to develop this option. 20 As with IWP(a) and IWP(b) those that lose assistance are couple families who lose more in the IWTC than they gain in the IWP + FTC and there are also single and couple families that lose because they work fewer hours than the hours test. 21 To be eligible for the current IWTC, a principal caregiver and/or their partner must normally be an earner and derive an income in the week they are an earner (e.g., be in paid work in a week). This paragraph assumes the IWP would operate in the same way if there is no hours test. Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 24 condition, injury or disability, in which case they either have part-time work obligations or have their work obligations deferred. 100 The example below illustrates the scale of change from the current system if the full payment rate is available without an hours test. • Under the current system, at one hour of work a week a sole parent on the minimum wage will be better off receiving a main benefit by $441.97 pw. This is a strong incentive to remain on a main benefit despite its more stringent requirements. o They would get $591.77 pw 22 without receiving a main benefit and $1,033.74pw if receiving a main benefit. • Under the new IWP with a medium payment rate (IWP(a)), they are better off receiving a main benefit by only $179.47 pw as they now can receive $854.27 23 without receiving a main benefit. 101 With no hours test, MSD also considers that there are increased incentives for the self-employed to manipulate their hours to be eligible for the payment. This is essentially exacerbating an existing risk with the IWTC, but with a much larger payment. 102 The hours test in IWP(d) provides greater incentives to work more hours and better manages benefit system integrity, by requiring a certain level of hours worked to receive the full amount of the significantly higher new payment. From a proportionality perspective, the partial hours test is also fairer as it targets a higher payment rate towards recipients who work more hours and who would likely have higher in-work costs. Trade-offs with an hours test – compliance costs and complexity 103 However, there are considerable trade-offs associated with an hours test. It would mean higher compliance costs for clients with fluctuating hours and is significantly more complex to administer than the current system. 104 Introducing an hours test for the new IWP creates greater complexity for recipients as there is an increased likelihood that they would need to navigate between MSD and IR systems as hours change. If a recipient has variable or unpredictable hours, they may experience gaps in support for the IWP and would be better off switching to a main benefit. This is demonstrated by the example provided below. 22 This assumes they are receiving Accommodation Supplement from MSD as a non- beneficiary client. This also includes the FTC and IWTC. 23 As above, this assumes they are receiving Accommodation Supplement from MSD as a non-beneficiary client. This also includes the FTC and new IWP. Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 25 Example: Hospitality worker receiving IWP with variable hours Kate is a sole parent working casually at a Dunedin restaurant on minimum wage. Her hours of work vary week to week depending on the time of year and availability of other staff. During the university term, the restaurant is busy, and she is generally rostered on for 25 hours per week. This means she earns $567.50 per week before tax. As she meets the hours test of 20 hours per week, she also receives the full $386 per week of IWP. However, the restaurant is very quiet during university holidays, so Kate is only rostered to work 10 hours per week. Her income reduces to $227 per week before tax, and as she no longer meets the hours test, she only receives a partial IWP of $100 per week. The gap in support created by the varying rate of IWP means she would be better off going on benefit (and continuing to work, reporting her income, and getting an abated sole parent support payment) during the quiet period. Kate would then need to navigate between MSD and IR’s systems when her hours picked up again. 105 Further, evidence suggests that generally people respond more to incentives to enter work (the extensive margin) than incentives to increase hours of work (intensive margin). Accordingly, an hours test may not be a well-targeted payment. 106 In addition to the increased complexity for clients, there are operational considerations for Inland Revenue and potentially some additional compliance costs for employers. Primarily, Inland Revenue does not hold or collect data to administer an hours test well. This is an existing design issue for the MFTC (and for the IWTC previously), however this issue is limited to 3,000 people. Introducing an hours test for the new IWP would extend the issue for a broader group of families. 107 Inland Revenue modelling indicates that between 15,000 – 30,000 families would fall below the threshold of a 20 hours per week test for at least one month of the tax year 24 . If ceasing to qualify (even temporarily) is not proactively declared by recipients, it may be picked up by IR’s early intervention process or at the end of year square up. This creates an increased likelihood of overpayments because these checks must be retrospective in nature. If (as with the previous IWTC hours test) the hours test was required to be met weekly, the administrative burden and associated costs for IR and for recipients would be substantial. 108 Because an hours test would reintroduce complexity of the system policies, complexity for recipients, increase the uncertainty of outcomes for families, and potentially increase debt for a larger number of WFF recipients who have 24 Based on IR using minimum wage multiplied by 20 hours per week as a proxy for meeting the hours test. Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 26 fluctuating employment arrangements, Inland Revenue do not recommend this option as it would be unlikely to improve the current system overall. Further considerations for introducing a new in-work payment 109 There are a set of further choices about the settings of these options that will be covered in future advice but are set out at a high level here. These considerations require a considerable amount of further detailed policy work. Indexation of the in-work payment 110 Indexation of the new IWP should maintain the policy intent of payments as benefits increase. The policy intent of the IWP is that work pays more than being on benefit. For this report, we have costed the indexation of IWP(a) only for the 2026/27 year and have assumed the IWP is maintained in line with benefit and wage increases, which is a relatively complex interaction. 111 For tax year 2026/27 it is estimated that IWP(a) will cost $361m for the second full year of payment, an $18m increase on the first year costs. 112 Indexation could apply to either the payment rate or the lowest abatement threshold, or indexation could be applied to both settings. Once a preferred option has been identified, further consideration and modelling of indexation options will be included in the next set of advice. 113 It should be noted that this effectively indexes the FTC as well and would eventually have a threshold cross-over with the BSTC. The FTC abatement threshold in the highest-cost IWP(base) option is already only $5,000 below the BSTC threshold in 2025/26. Implications for discretionary benefit and/or Family Tax Credit increases 114 In the past, when discretionary increases to main benefit rates have been made (i.e. in 2020 and 2021), an equivalent increase to the MFTC has also been made to ensure that low-income working families remain better off off- benefit at 20 hours of work a week on the minimum wage. 115 To maintain the work incentives for the group of families who previously received the MFTC and the policy intent of the payment, similar increases would need to be applied to the new IWP. It is estimated approximately 50 – 80,000 families would receive the new IWP. This would represent a much larger flow-on fiscal cost compared to the status quo. 116 Officials have not costed the fiscal impacts for the new IWP of discretionary increases to benefits or the FTC, however scenarios using the preferred option can be provided in the next round of advice. Flow on impact of the new in-work payment 117 As indicated in previous advice \[REP 23/3/169\] the new IWP and the two- tier abatement settings will create interactions and policy issues with other forms of assistance that will need to be worked through. The key areas of further advice relate to eligibility for the self-employed, shared care, Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 27 OB/UCV/FCA, 4+ IWTC and detailed abatement and ring-fencing rules. Appendix Five provides further advice on these flow-ons. 118 As officials work through the detailed design for the new IWP, decisions are likely to be required on the above issues. Additional issues may also arise during the detailed design process. A single WFF tax credit with no in-work payment has previously been considered as a significant structural change option 120 In previous advice, an alternative option for significant structural change was considered - a single tax credit with no IWP (referred to as Option 5 in previous advice). The single tax credit removes all in-work payments and redirects the funding into the FTC. The option supports income adequacy for families with children (both in-work and on benefit) and aims to make work pay by making FTC abatement settings more generous, instead of having an IWP. 121 Compared to the new IWP, the single tax credit would be simpler, both from a client’s perspective and for agencies to administer, but would be likely to cost more in the long term. It would also mean that low-income working families would remain on an abated benefit for longer. 122 The key impacts of this option were: • comparable gains to both beneficiary and non-beneficiary families • reductions in child poverty of 24,000 children on the BHC50 measure and 27,000 children on the AHC50 measures • Costings provided in the November report estimated the cost of the first year of the full option would be $686m in 2024/25, but if the option was phased in, the first full year cost would reduce to $365m in 2024/25. o Note these costings used BEFU 22, so are likely to underestimate the fiscal costs compared to the options provided in this advice. 123 Appendix One provides further information about the single tax credit option and the other options that have been considered as part of the Review. s 9(2)(h) Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 28 Section Two: Smaller scale options to address anticipated overlapping abatement thresholds 124 If you do not want to progress structural reform for the Review, or fiscal conditions do not allow for significant investment in WFF in Budget 2025, options could be progressed to help future proof WFF. 125 Inflation and wage growth have been significant since the WFF abatement threshold was last adjusted in 2018. Increases in the abatement threshold are recommended by officials to ensure that WFF continues to support both low and middle-income working families. 126 In addition, officials estimate that by 1 April 2026 the MFTC and the WFF abatement threshold will overlap, creating EMTRs over 100% for a small group of low-income working families. With strong wage growth and increases to the MFTC, this could occur even earlier than anticipated. This would undermine the function and policy intent of the MFTC. 127 An increasing number of beneficiaries will also face overlapping abatement of their benefit and the FTC. At a minimum, changes to the WFF abatement threshold are needed to address this in the absence of structural reform. 128 Indicative modelling from March 2023 of potential changes to current settings that address the anticipated overlapping abatement is used in this section. These costings are calculated using the 2022 Half-Year Economic Fiscal Update and assume a 1 April 2024 implementation date. If you wish to progress an option to help future proof WFF in lieu of structural reform, updated modelling and advice on implementation dates could be provided in subsequent advice. An increase to the WFF abatement threshold would help future proof WFF and could be progressed alongside complementary changes to current settings 129 The WFF abatement threshold, currently $42,700 per annum (pa), was last increased from 1 July 2018 and is not periodically adjusted. This means that the annual increases to the MFTC 25 will continue to lift the MFTC until it overlaps with the WFF abatement threshold, causing some low-income working families to be financially disadvantaged. It also means that WFF payments effectively become more targeted over time as wage growth pushes families out of eligibility. 130 An increase to the WFF abatement threshold is needed to mitigate these issues. As per previous advice 26 , officials recommend the threshold is increased to $50,000 to ensure that a single earner on the minimum wage 25 To reflect anticipated wage growth indexation of benefits. 26 March 2023: REP/23/3/169; IR2023/018 Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 29 does not face significant abatement of WFF payments (as 40 hours of work a week means the current minimum wage is equivalent to $47,216 pa and future increases to the minimum wage will increase this annual income further). 131 Alongside addressing anticipated overlapping thresholds, changes to the WFF abatement threshold would also reduce the extent to which abatement of benefits and WFF overlap. IR estimate this would reduce debt for approximately 2,400 beneficiary families and eliminate it for approximately 1,200 beneficiary families. Summary of options to address anticipated overlapping and modelling from March 2023 132 A summary of the options to address abatement thresholds is provided in Appendix Three and in the table below. AT(a) Abatement threshold to $50,000 pa only AT(b) $10 pw IWTC increase + abatement threshold to $50,000 pa AT(c) $25 pw IWTC increase + WFF abatement threshold to $50,000 pa + MFTC removed AT(d) $10 pw IWTC increase + WFF abatement threshold to $50,000 pa + MFTC removed Fiscal impact Tax Year (24/25) 27 $238m $309m $406m $291m Average gains/losses 152,000 HHs gain $30pw 173,000 HHs gain $34pw 173,000 HHs gain $46pw 6,000 HHs lose $35pw 167,000 HHs gain $35pw 7,000 HHs lose $36pw Child poverty reduction 4,000 (BHC50) 11,000 (AHC50) 6,000 (BHC50) 17,000 (AHC50) 8,000 (BHC50) 19,000 (AHC50) 5,000 (BHC50) 16,000 (AHC50) 133 The March 2023 advice presented the following options for consideration through Budget 2023, which assumed a 1 April 2024 implementation date: • AT(a): increase the WFF abatement threshold to $50,000 pa. • AT(b): increase the WFF abatement threshold to $50,000 pa + a $10 pw increase to the IWTC rate. 134 These options were presented as both potential interim measures broadly consistent with further structural change and also sensible standalone options to address anticipated overlapping abatement if structural reform is not 27 Fiscal costs only, does not include implementation or operational costings. Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 30 desirable. Compared to the IWP options, there are lower fiscal costs associated with these changes, but also smaller reductions in child poverty. 135 The Review objectives of supporting income adequacy and reducing child poverty, as well as improving financial incentives to work, are met under both options. However, they are not focused on simplifying the system, so do not address the core design issues with the MFTC and the complexity of the tax/benefit interface would remain. 136 The option that best supports income adequacy and lifts the most children out of poverty on the AHC50 measure per dollar of fiscal cost combines an IWTC increase of $10 pw with an increased abatement threshold (AT(b)). This option is estimated to reduce child poverty by 17,000 on the AHC50 measure at a cost of $309 million in 2024/25. 28 137 Increasing the abatement threshold only means that overlap is likely to occur again in the future without further changes being made to mitigate this, such as indexing the WFF abatement threshold. Increasing or indexing the threshold for the BSTC could also be considered as overlapping abatement will increase with these options. Officials can provide further advice on this if requested. 138 These options (AT(a) and AT(b)) could be implemented from 1 April 2024 if urgent legislation is passed before the end of 2023. 139 You may also wish to remove the MFTC, but this is not recommended without changes to avoid families being worse off. In the absence of structural reform, core design issues with the MFTC remain, including its high EMTRs. You may wish to address these by removing the MFTC, alongside the required changes to address anticipated overlapping abatement. 140 Previous advice explored options that remove the MFTC alongside increasing the WFF abatement threshold to $50,000 pa and increasing the IWTC. These options were: • AT(c): remove the MFTC, increase the WFF abatement threshold to $50,000 pa and increase the IWTC rate by $25 pw. This option: o had a cost of $406 million in 2024/25 o was estimated to reduce child poverty by 19,000 on the AHC50 measure. • AT(d): remove the MFTC, increase the WFF abatement threshold to $50,000 pa and increase the IWTC rate by $10 pw. This option: o reduced the cost to $291 million but had slightly smaller reductions in child poverty – 16,000 on the AHC50 measure. 28 Costings from March 2023 do not include operational costs. Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 31 141 While still meeting the objectives of supporting income adequacy and reducing child poverty, as well as improving financial incentives to work, these options (AT(c) and AT(d)) would also help to simplify the system. As these options include the removal of the MFTC they would require longer to implement than AT(a) and AT(b) and could be implemented by 1 April 2025. 142 Officials recommend against removing the MFTC unless further changes are made to reduce the number of families financially disadvantaged. Removing the MFTC would create difficulty and confusion for those currently in receipt of the payment and is likely to result in some families being financially disadvantaged. Previous modelling 29 estimates that AT(c) would result in: • 6,000 households losing on average $35 pw (using TAWA modelling) • 3,000 families currently receiving the MFTC would lose on average $79 pw (using IR modelling, which is not directly comparable to the TAWA modelling above). 143 To reduce the number of people made worse off by the changes, agencies would advise those eligible to transfer to benefit. This would likely eliminate most of the losses estimated above, as The Treasury and IR’s models cannot estimate families moving onto benefit. A small group of very low-income working families would not be eligible for benefit and would be financially disadvantaged, for example Jobseeker Support couples, due to working 30 or more hours a week. As noted earlier, complementary changes to the benefit system would be required to enable couples to receive an abated benefit for longer. 144 An alternate option to removing the MFTC completely is to freeze the rate of MFTC or alternatively grandparent the current recipients and eventually remove the payment when all families have moved off. These types of options would have lower fiscal costs but would increase administrative complexity and have negative impacts for MFTC customers. Officials have not costed these options but can do so if Ministers are interested in future advice. Section Three: Economic and fiscal context and child poverty reduction targets 145 Choices between higher and lower cost options depend on the Government’s wider fiscal strategy and progress towards the ten-year child poverty reduction targets. 29 The number of families estimated to be financially disadvantaged are likely to be over-stated, as both estimates do not account for the fact that many affected families would be eligible to receive an abated benefit to offset their losses. However, there would be a small group of families who would not be eligible for benefits, for example, Jobseeker Support due to working more than 30 hours a week. Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 32 146 In the Budget Economic and Fiscal Update 2023, The Treasury estimated that the Budget 2024 operating allowances should be sufficient to cover cost pressures to existing services but will leave limited headroom for other operating investments. Further to this, pre-existing challenges such as demographic changes are expected to put pressure on the public finances in the coming years. As such, ongoing fiscal discipline and potentially difficult choices will be necessary to ensure a sustainable operating balance before gains and losses (OBEGAL) trajectory both during the forecast period and over the medium term. 147 This means that available funding for any potential changes to WFF in Budget 2024 will be significantly constrained, as spending will need to remain within allowances to maintain the fiscal strategy and help ensure a sustainable fiscal trajectory across the short and medium-term 148 Appendix Three sets out key trade-offs for consideration of the in-work payment options and the abatement threshold options discussed in Sections One and Two of this report: • high-cost options for an in work payment: IWP(base) / IWP(c) • lower-cost options for an in work payment: IWP(a) / IWP(b) / IWP(d) • abatement threshold increase and complementary changes: AT(a) – (d). Child Poverty targets 149 As officials have noted in previous advice, this review presents the biggest opportunity to make further progress towards child poverty targets in the coming years. Substantial investment since the targets were first set in 2018 has helped to make considerable progress in reducing child poverty, but sizeable reductions are still needed to reach the ten-year targets. 150 This is particularly the case on the before-housing-cost primary measure, which currently needs to be reduced by a further 7 percentage points or ~80,000 children. Large reductions are also still required on the after- housing-cost and the material hardship primary measures – in the order of 4- 5 percentage points or ~50-60,000 children on each. 151 All the options in this report provide gains for working families only. Broadly half of children in poverty live in working households, so the benefits of these options are confined to this group. The other half of children in poverty are in households that rely on income from main benefits. Section Four: Further work and timeframes for Cabinet report back 152 In the recent Cabinet paper “Future Direction of the Working for Families Review” it was noted that you would report back to Cabinet on the next steps of the Review by the end of the year \[CAB-23-MIN-0178\]. Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 33 153 Depending on Government formation timelines following the election and other Government priorities during the post-election period, officials anticipate the most likely date for the Cabinet report back is December 2023. Timing of subsequent advice 154 The decisions in the report on the preferred option/s for the WFF Review will enable a report back to Cabinet in December 2023. If Ministers would like to progress a WFF option for consideration in Budget 2024, timely decisions on the advice in this report will be required. 155 Through further work on the Review, officials have determined that there is insufficient time to develop a structural reform option for Budget 2024 (with an implementation date of 1 April 2025), though smaller-scale changes within the current system could still be considered. Options for structural reform could be considered in Budget 2025, with an implementation date of 1 April 2026. 156 If Ministers still would like to progress the in-work payment, officials will provide advice in late 2023 or early 2024 to enable decisions in Budget 2025 with an implementation date on or after 1 April 2026. 157 If the preferred outcome of the Review is to address the anticipated overlapping abatement of MFTC and WFF by one of the abatement threshold variations, then decisions related to this option could be progressed on standard timeframes. For implementation on 1 April 2025, funding could be sought through Budget 2024. However, as the overlap is not anticipated to occur until April 2026, this decision could be delayed and funding could be sought through Budget 2025 for implementation on 1 April 2026. 158 It would also be possible to implement the abatement threshold options that do not remove the MFTC (AT(a) and AT(b)) more quickly – by 1 April 2024. However, this would require urgent legislation passed by the end of 2023 and a pre-commitment against Budget 2024. Public announcements related to the next steps of the Review 159 As part of the May 2023 Cabinet paper \[CAB-23-MIN-0178 refers\], Cabinet noted that any reactive communications about the next steps of the Review would indicate that a new in-work payment is a possible option being explored further, alongside consideration of changes to current settings. 160 Cabinet agreement would need to be sought again to make any further public announcements related to the options outlined in this report. Next Steps Inland Revenue advice on administrative improvements 161 In November 2022 (MSD REP/22/11/111) - IR2022/512), the Minister for Social Development and Employment and the Minister of Revenue agreed to some administrative improvements (providing a grace period on the death of a child, removing the historic Child Tax Credit, and improving information Working for Families Review: Preferred approach for Budget 2024 34 sharing between MSD and IR) which would be $0.48 million over the forecast period and $0.156 million for outyears and which could be implemented as part of the reforms. 162 In March 2023 (MSD REP/23/3/169 - IR2023/018), we noted that we will provide further advice about minor administrative and remedial amendments. Inland Revenue officials are currently working through proposals including how they relate to the debt reduction work. Officials expect these to be in the range of $1 - 2 million a year. The changes identified so far could be implemented in time for an April 2025 start date if decisions are made in Budget 2024. We will provide further advice when we report to you on the broader package. Ministerial discussion of this advice 163 Officials recommend you forward a copy of this advice to the Prime Minister, Minister for Children, Minister of Finance, Minister for Child Poverty Reduction and the Minister of Revenue and that a Ministerial meeting is set up to consider this advice and the next steps for the Review.

For example, a higher payment may result in more incentives to game. Under the status quo, self-employed people are eligible for the IWTC only and not the MFTC, for reasons that are partly historical in nature, and because of an increased incentive to game for self-employed people. • Shared care – Currently the full amount of IWTC is available for each parent with shared care of a child, whereas the FTC is apportioned between parents depending on the level of care. Modelling for this report has assumed the same rules as the IWTC. There is a question as to how the shared care rules would apply to the new in-work payment, and whether the same rules apply as for the IWTC. The Minister for Social Development and Employment recently received initial advice on options to address split and shared care within the welfare system \[REP/23/6/583\]. • OB/UCB/FCA – Caregivers cannot currently receive OB/UCB/FCA and the FTC for the same child, as these payments are considered analogous. However, caregivers can receive both the IWTC and the OB/UCB/FCA, if they qualify. Decisions would be required on whether the same settings should apply to the new in-work payment. • 4+ IWTC rate – The current IWTC includes a per-child rate of $15 pw for the 4 th and subsequent children, which did not feature in the original design of Option 1B included in previous advice. There is a policy question as to whether to retain the rate or remove it - removing it would potentially disadvantage some larger working families. • Detailed abatement and ring-fencing rules – The shift from IWTC/MFTC to the new in-work payment may have implications for rules about how income and abatement settings are operationalised in practice. Detailed policy settings are yet to be confirmed. There may be some families who are financially disadvantaged from these changes.

It also identifies future areas of work in relation to the tax and transfer system. Background Main benefit indexation 2.The Government has agreed to index the rate of main benefits to inflation (upwards movement in the Consumers Price Index (CPI)) from 1 April 2024 \[CAB-23-MIN- 0490 refers\]. This will replace the current legislative requirement, which has been in force since 2019, to adjust main benefits by net average wage growth at the Annual General Adjustment (AGA). 1 3.We understand that a part of the Government’s rationale for indexing main benefits to inflation is to ensure cost effectiveness in annual adjustments to main benefit rates. Minimum family tax credit threshold 4.The MFTC, which is part of the Working for Families scheme, seeks to provide a financial incentive to work by ensuring that low income working families remain financially better off in full time work then they would be on a main benefit. The current MFTC calculation ensures sole parents are better off working and receiving the MFTC than they would be receiving a benefit on an annual basis \[CAB-21-MIN- 0116.33 refers\]. 5.The MFTC threshold is tied to main benefit rates. That is, as main benefit rates are proposed to increase with upwards movement in the CPI from 1 April 2024, the MFTC threshold will also need to be increased to maintain the policy intent of the payment. Therefore, the Government has agreed that the annual amount of the 1 This is the annual process undertaken by MSD to adjust benefit and payment rates to account for either the Consumers Price Index or net average wage changes. Appendix A Document 6 Page 2 of 2 MFTC increase from $34,217 to $35,360 (after tax) for the tax year beginning 1 April 2024 \[CAB-23-MIN-0490 refers\]. Fiscal savings 6. The MFTC threshold increase is already included in the budget forecasts created in the Half-yearly Economic and Fiscal Update 2023. However, this was based on main benefits being adjusted by changes in net average wage growth. 7. Indexing main benefits to upwards movement in the CPI from 1 April 2024 will result in smaller increases to the MFTC threshold over time. This will save approximately $7 million over the forecast period. Legislation 8. Depending on other legislative priorities and available House time, it is proposed that an omnibus bill is introduced into the house early next year on approximately 12 February 2024. This bill would contain Social Security Act 2018 amendments for benefit indexation, as well as Income Tax Act 2007 consequential amendments for the MFTC threshold. 9. The Ministry of Social Development (MSD) will be the lead agency responsible for progressing the omnibus bill. Inland Revenue will be consulted where appropriate in relation to the MFTC threshold. 10. The bill will need to be enacted prior to 20 February 2024. This is so Inland Revenue can notify affected customers of this change in their new notices of entitlement. 11. The timing of issuing these notices gives customers four weeks to review their details and notify Inland Revenue of any required changes prior to 1 April. This timing also ensures customers know what their entitlements are going to be, can plan their household budget, and get paid the right entitlement, avoiding debt. Customers who receive the MFTC require high levels of reassurance from Inland Revenue during this time and are a particularly vulnerable customer group, so certainty of entitlements, and early notification of changes, is highly desirable. Future work 12. 13. Inland Revenue is also undertaking a stewardship project on Working for Families and will provide advice in 2024 on how this work relates to the Government’s priorities. Consultation 14. The Treasury was not informed about this briefing note. 15. The Ministry of Social Development was consulted on this briefing note. Richard McLaughlan Senior Policy Advisor s 9(2)(g)(i) s 9(2)(a) www.ird.govt.nz Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Kaupapa me te Tiaki i ngā Ture 55 Featherston Street PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 New Zealand T.04-890 1500 Memo 10-01-2023 To: From: Richard McLaughlan Omnibus bill query – MFTC threshold This memo seeks preliminary advice on whether a threshold adjustment to the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC) can be included in an omnibus bill alongside changes to the indexation method for main benefit rates. This would require there to be a single broad policy linking the two changes. Social security indexation changes The Government has agreed to index the rate of main benefits to inflation (upwards movement in the Consumers Price Index (CPI)) from 1 April 2024 \[CAB-23-MIN-0490 refers\]. This will replace the current legislative requirement, which has been in force since 2020, to adjust main benefits by net average wage growth at the Annual General Adjustment (AGA). To facilitate this change, amendments are required to the Social Security Act 2018. This will allow the indexation of main benefits to be tied to changes in the CPI and will affect the payment rate of MFTC from 1 April 2024 onwards. Minimum family tax credit threshold The MFTC, which is part of the Working for Families scheme, seeks to provide a financial incentive to work by ensuring that low income working families remain financially better off in full time work then they would be on a main benefit. The current MFTC calculation ensures sole parents are better off working and receiving the MFTC than they would be receiving a benefit on an annual basis \[CAB-21-MIN-0116.33 refers\]. The MFTC threshold is tied to main benefit rates. That is, as main benefit rates are proposed to increase with upwards movement in the CPI from 1 April 2024, the MFTC threshold will also need to be increased to maintain the policy intent of the payment. Therefore, the Government has also agreed that the annual amount of the MFTC increase from $34,217 to $35,360 (after tax) for the tax year beginning 1 April 2024 \[CAB-23-MIN-0490 refers\]. To facilitate an increase to the MFTC threshold an amendment is required to the Income Tax Act 2007. Single broad policy Under Standing Order 267 an omnibus bill that amends more than one Act may be introduced if the amendments deal with an interrelated topic that can be regarded as implementing a Appendix A Document 7 s 9(2)(a) 2 single broad policy. The indexation of main benefits is included in the Social Security Act 2018, however, Working for Families tax credits including the MFTC are included in the Income Tax Act 2007. There is a strong connection between the MFTC and main benefits. These payments both address income adequacy and are a part of the government’s income support scheme. The single broad policy is to provide for a benefit system that responds to increases in the cost of living without creating perverse work incentives. The policy would allow for upwards adjustments of main benefit rates, based on movements in the consumers price index. However, it would also ensure that low-income working families remain better off in full time work then they would be on a main benefit. This policy protects the real incomes of benefit recipients as well as financial incentive to work. For the tax credit system to work as intended, the lower limit of the MFTC must increase according to the increase in main benefits. This maintains rate relativities and work incentives. The increase to the MFTC threshold occurs alongside any changes made to main benefit rates. The AGA, and the beginning of a tax year, both take effect on 1 April of any given year. Usually, the prescribed amount of the MFTC is increased by an Order in Council, once either wage growth or CPI indexation information that will be used for the indexation of benefits is made available.

Under current Working for Families (WFF) legislation, the Family Tax Credit (FTC) and Best Start Tax Credit (BSTC) payment rates must be increased to match inflation at specified times. The rates are increased once the cumulative value of quarterly increases in the Consumers Price Index (CPI) reaches 5% since the payment rates for these credits were last adjusted (which in this case last occurred on 1 October 2021). Any change to credit payment rates takes effect at the start of the following tax year. 2. Because of the higher rate of inflation this year, we anticipate the 5% cumulative CPI threshold will be exceeded at the end of the September 2022 quarter. This means higher payments would be required from 1 April 2023. 3. Current Cabinet policy also requires the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC) threshold to be adjusted to ensure MFTC recipients continue to be better off financially in work than they would be on a main benefit. As main benefits will increase with wage growth, the MFTC threshold will also need to be increased from 1 April 2023. 4. The FTC and BSTC rates and the MFTC threshold can be adjusted by Order in Council. This will need to occur by 1 December 2022 to apply from 1 April 2023. 5. Officials are preparing advice on policy options as part of the WFF Review for Income Support Ministers for November. While the options being considered could impact on FTC, BSTC, and MFTC, they would not be implemented until 1 April 2024 at the earliest. The indexation adjustments would maintain the value of the tax credits in the interim. 6. If Ministers wish to increase the FTC or BSTC beyond the indexation adjustments for the income year beginning 1 April 2023, officials will provide you with urgent advice on the implications for timeframes and any interactions with the wider WFF Review. This may also affect our ability to provide the full WFF Review advice requested for the November Income Support Ministers’ meeting. IR2022/440; T2022/2142: Working for Families Review: CPI indexation of Family Tax Credit/Best Start Tax Credit and adjustment of Page 1 of 8 Recommended action We recommend that you: 1. Note the legislative requirement to CPI index FTC and BSTC rates, regardless of other decisions Ministers may make in relation to the WFF Review. Noted 2. Note that the exact CPI increases for FTC and BSTC rates will be confirmed in mid- October with officials reporting to Ministers shortly after with updated rates for final approval, and the rates would need to be enacted in legislation by 1 December 2022. Noted 3. Note that Cabinet agreed to increase the MFTC threshold in line with increases to main benefit rates, which increase by wage growth every year. Noted 4. Note that, until decisions under the WFF Review have been made, Cabinet agreed the calculation for the MFTC threshold beginning in the 2021-22 tax year would ensure that only sole parents working 20 hours per week are better off when averaging the Winter Energy Payment over the year. Noted 5. Note that policy options under consideration as part of the WFF Review that may increase or otherwise impact on FTC, BSTC, or MFTC could be implemented from 1 April 2024 at the earliest, and the CPI indexation adjustments would be required to maintain the value of these tax credits in the interim. Noted 6. Agree to make CPI-indexation increases to FTC and BSTC rates applying from 1 April 2023. \[Recommended\] Agreed / Not agreed 7. Note that it is possible to further increase the FTC and BSTC payments beyond the indexation adjustment for 1 April 2023; however, doing so would require: 7.1 a pre-commitment to Budget 2023 and may affect the fiscal costs of future changes in the WFF Review, and 7.2 Cabinet policy decisions by 28 November 2022 to enable urgent primary legislation to be enacted by 1 December 2022. Noted 8. Direct officials to provide additional policy advice on increasing the FTC and/or BSTC rates beyond the indexation adjusted amounts. Directed / Not directed 9. Agree to increase the MFTC threshold from 1 April 2023, reflecting the forecast wage indexation of main benefits, in line with the current agreed approach. \[Recommended\] Agreed / Not agreed IR2022/440; T2022/2142: Working for Families Review: CPI indexation of Family Tax Credit/Best Start Tax Credit and adjustment of Page 3 of 8 Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern Hon Grant Robertson Prime Minister Minister of Finance Minister for Child Poverty Reduction / /2022 / /2022 Hon Kelvin Davis Hon Carmel Sepuloni Minister for Children Minister for Social Development and Employment / /2022 / /2022 Hon David Parker Minister for Revenue / /2022 IR2022/440; T2022/2142: Working for Families Review: CPI indexation of Family Tax Credit/Best Start Tax Credit and adjustment of Page 4 of 8 Background CPI inflation adjustment of FTC and BSTC required by legislation 11. Under the Income Tax Act 2007, the Family Tax Credit (FTC) and Best Start Tax Credit (BSTC) payment rates must be adjusted for inflation once the cumulative value of quarterly increases in the CPI reaches 5% since the payment rates were last adjusted. These inflation-indexed increases in payment rates ensure FTC and BSTC maintain their real value over time. The process for setting and authorising rates through Orders in Council is set out in the Income Tax Act 2007. 12. The payment rates for the FTC and BSTC were last set by legislative amendment incorporating inflation up to the end of September 2021. This means the cumulative count of inflation began from 1 October 2021. Due to the current high rates of inflation, it is anticipated that the 5% cumulative threshold will be exceeded by the end of the September 2022 quarter. Once this is confirmed by StatsNZ, increases to FTC and BSTC rates will need to be made by Order in Council no later than 1 December 2022. The new, adjusted FTC and BSTC payment rates will apply from 1 April 2023. 13. Final CPI figures will be available on 18 October 2022. The relevant percentage increases and new rates will be confirmed in a subsequent report and the Cabinet paper. MFTC annual adjustment 14. Unlike the CPI indexation of FTC and BSTC, the adjustment of the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC) threshold is required under current Cabinet policy rather than by legislation. The intention is to ensure low income working families remain better off financially in full time work than they would be on a main benefit. This helps support people in moving from a main benefit to full-time work. 1 Because benefit rates are expected to increase from 1 April 2023 to reflect wage growth, the MFTC threshold needs to be adjusted to ensure this policy intention is achieved. 15. The way the MFTC threshold is calculated has changed over the last few years. Because the Winter Energy Payment is paid for part of the year, the MFTC threshold calculation was adjusted to take this into account beginning 1 July 2021. Cabinet changed the calculation as part of a series of changes to benefit settings and WFF rates to balance fiscal cost, financial incentives to work and the cost of options being considered through the WFF Review. The current method ensures sole parents are better off working and receiving the MFTC than they would be receiving a benefit on an annual basis \[CAB-21-MIN-0116.33 refers\]. This calculation change was intended for the duration of the WFF Review. 16. Officials have calculated the threshold adjustment using the same approach as agreed by Ministers last year, using current forecasts of wage growth that adjust benefit rates. 2 The current MFTC rate is $32,864 net of tax and the current forecasted increase in benefits is 3.4% based on the June 2022 quarter. 17. The MFTC threshold for 1 April 2023 has been calculated as $33,852 net of tax, equivalent to a gross income of $39,828. This is based on estimates of MSD’s sole- parent benefit rates for 2023, and five months of Winter Energy Payments spread over 12 months (flat-rate WEP option). 1 Full-time is defined as working 20 hours or more per week for sole parents and 30 hours or more per week for couples, as defined in s MA 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 2 in REP/21/3/318; T2021/814; IR2021/144 of 30 March 2021, and CAB-21-MIN-0116.33 refers. IR2022/440; T2022/2142: Working for Families Review: CPI indexation of Family Tax Credit/Best Start Tax Credit and adjustment of Page 5 of 8 Discussion Timing of legislation and potential impacts of further increases beyond indexation adjustments 18. Officials are currently preparing further advice on two options for structural changes to WFF and will provide an update to Ministers in late September and further detailed advice in November. 19. Both the FTC and BSTC rates and the MFTC threshold can be adjusted by Order in Council by 1 December 2022. On occasion, these rates have been increased by legislative amendment (e.g., 2021 when the rates were increased by more than the CPI adjustment). 20. If Ministers agree to make the CPI-indexation increases with no additional rate increases, then this will be done via Order in Council. We will report in mid- to late- October once the final CPI figures are confirmed and seek final agreement to the rates, threshold adjustments and next steps. 21. If, on the other hand, Ministers prefer to consider further measures (in addition to the indexation of the FTC and BSTC) alongside the indexation round, officials will provide urgent advice on changes that could be implemented in these timeframes. In our view, any further measures should be confined to changes to the FTC and BSTC payment rates, rather than further changes such as abatement rate increases. Either way, there would be trade-offs with an additional increase in advance of the more significant reform options in terms of de-prioritising the review and increasing the costs of implementation of the reform options. 22. If Ministers want to make additional changes, this would require urgent amendments to primary legislation to be passed by 1 December at the latest. This may affect our ability to provide the full WFF Review advice requested for the November Income Support Ministers’ meeting. The cost of the decision would need to be pre-committed against the Budget 2023 allowance. However, the choice would have to be made without detailed advice on alternative options to advance the Government’s priorities through the Budget process or final advice on the economic and fiscal context. Generally, there is a high bar for taking such decisions. 23. Related to a potential additional increase, caregivers who receive the Orphan’s Benefit (OB), Unsupported Child’s Benefit (UCB) and Foster Care Allowance (FCA) do not qualify for FTC for the same child. However, increases to FTC rates have resulted in commensurate increases to the base rates of the OB, UCB, and FCA in 2005, 2007, 2018 and 2022. This is because the FTC makes a partial contribution towards the costs of raising children. The OB, UCB and FCA are indexed to the CPI and are adjusted each year on 1 April. If Ministers progress additional increases to FTC beyond indexation, these will not automatically flow on to increases to OB, UCB and FCA. Officials will include options to pass the increases on if subsequent advice is requested. Child poverty targets 24. The 2022 Child Poverty Budget Report shows child poverty rates on the primary income poverty measures are estimated to be above the target rate for the current three-year targets, which are due to be achieved in the 2023/24 financial year. 25. The modelling shows that rates are expected to be about 2.9ppt (31,000 children) above the second intermediate BHC50 3 target rate and 1.4ppt (15,000 children) 3 The before-housing-costs moving-line measure – second intermediate target rate is 10%.

The anticipated rate increases are set out in the table below. These are based on forecast CPI data. The table also provides the estimated fiscal costs (as compared to not changing the entitlements at all). 32. The Budget 2022 Fiscal Forecasts have assumed that this indexation occurs and the above fiscal costs are already included in the fiscal forecasts.

Next steps 33. Officials will provide final numbers once the September quarter CPI figures are released, in mid-October. Following decisions by joint Ministers, officials will seek your direction to prepare a draft Cabinet paper and issue drafting instructions. Officials recommend that the Minister of Revenue be invited to submit a paper for LEG. 34. The Cabinet paper will need to be lodged by 16 November 2022 at the latest to ensure Cabinet decisions are made before 1 December. 35. Officials will work with your Offices on the details for any announcement.

Next Steps Next steps If Ministers have any feedback on this update we can reflect this in the substantive November advice. If Ministers are generallycomfortable with the direction of the advice, officials will provide two reports on Working for Families for the November Income Support Ministers meeting. The two reportswill cover detailed advice on: •Paper One: Further advice on options 1 and 5, expanding on the content covered in this brief update •Paper Two: Administrative and operational improvements, including more detailed advice on the buffer tax credit and increased debt write-off threshold. At the November Ministers meeting, officials recommend Ministers choose a preferred option for redesign –this would allow officials and Ministers to focus on more detailed policy parameters that comes with significant redesign. Paper One: Further advice on options 1 and 5 Paper Two: Administrative and operational improvements November advice content In addition to more detail on the options included in this update, Paper One will also respond to the following questions and feedback. Option One: •What impact the removal of the IWTC hours test has had, and advice on how to soften any reintroduction of this test. •Expected increased employment effects of this option. Option Five: •What is the impact of this option on sole parent households relative to other households? •How can this option reduce the reliance on some families moving onto a main benefit, and/or be more customer friendly for people on benefit? •Would lower income tax rates at the bottom help to improve work incentives for this option? Across options: •How do the options align with OB, UCB, and FCA? •Analysis of any potential savings, including any reduced supplementary/hardship payments. Officials will also consider more detailed advice on: •Child poverty, financial incentives / making work pay, and fiscal costs (including longer-term costs). •Behaviouralimpacts / laboursupply. •Indexation and longer-term settings. •Phasing-in or sequencing of options (including using existing CPI adjustments). •Interactions of options with NZ Income Insurance Scheme. In addition to more detailed advice on the buffer tax credit and increased debt write-off threshold, Paper Two will respond to the following requests for further advice: •giving WFF recipients a longer period of time in which to inform Inland Revenue of a change in circumstances (‘grace periods’) •improving information exchange between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development for people moving on and off benefit •other miscellaneous administrative changes to improve customer experience, as set out in the WFF advice provided in July 2022. This paper will also respond to the question on how widespread overpayments are resulting from the complexity of WFF. 5. Buffer tax credit vs increased automatic debt write-off threshold Buffer Tax CreditIncreased debt write-off threshold Description Essentially a refundable tax credit made available at the end of the income year. It would be first applied against any WFF debt a customer may have accrued due to over-payments. Where a customer has not accrued any WFF debt, the balance of the buffer tax credit could be paid as a one-off lump sum at the end of the tax year. Increasing the threshold for automatic write-offs for WFF debt (currently $50) would clear low-value WFF debt. An increased write-off threshold could either apply to all customers or could be targeted to smaller groups with greater need (e.g. customers with income under a certain amount). Initial advice on trade-offs •Benefits customers with and without debt, so less targeted towards families with debt. However, is more equitable than an increased debt write-off threshold because customers who have kept IR informed of changes receive the same dollar amount as other customers who have been overpaid during the year and have debt written off. This also means it doesn’t create perverse incentives. •More costly than increasing the debt write-off threshold by the equivalent dollar amount. •More complicated to administer due to the requirement to pay out unused portion of the tax credit if the customer has no debt or their debt is less than the amount of the credit. •Targeted as it is only available to customers with debt, but may create perverse incentives and would be less equitable than the buffer tax credit. •Likely to be lower cost than the buffer tax credit. •Less complicated to administer because no further steps are required after the debt write-off has been applied.

This conversation happened at the 29 April 2024 ELT meeting. Over the past years, we have increasingly used Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue to describe the Department, and Aotearoa to talk about the country in our internal and external communications. Although we have not received ministerial direction about the use of these terms, we recognise the benefit of having a consistent approach to their use in communicating with our people and in the delivery of messaging and services to the public. The following proposed guidance aligns to this and codifies the ELT meeting conversation. We are presenting this for your approval to proceed with the guidelines and the implementation approach. Proposed guidelines The National and New Zealand First Coalition Agreement requires public service departments have their primary name in English. \[1\] The Minister of State Services stated, “Our coalition agreements reflect this view with a commitment that in most instances public agencies will communicate their names and services in English, alongside any use of te reo Māori”. \[2\] Guideline 1: For internal and external communications, we would follow the direction set in the coalition agreement and use Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake at the first use of our name in any communication. Guideline 2: For any subsequent use of the department’s name, we would continue to use existing protocol referring to the department as IR or We. Guideline 3: In talking about the name of the country, we should follow a similar protocol to the department’s name. For internal and external communications, we would use New Zealand Aotearoa at the first instance in any communication. Guideline 4: For any subsequent use of the country’s name, we would use New Zealand. \[1\] Commitment is phrased as “Ensure all public service departments have their primary name in English, except for those specifically related to Māori.” s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) 2 Te Ao Māori News, (8 April 2024) How the government’s push for English-first names is tracking, https://www.teaonews.co.nz/2024/04/08/how-the-governments-push-for-english- first-names-is-tracking/ How this guidance will be implemented These changes will not be retrospective. We will not go back into previous external website or intranet content and change the Department’s name or the use of Aotearoa. The change will happen on future content. These changes will be actioned by the Marketing and Communications team in the communications they write/edit/curate and commission. The guidelines will also be added to the IR Writing and Style Guide.

25OIA1321 Page 1 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 27 September 2024 Dear Thank you for your email on 13 September 2024 to Inland Revenue requesting the following information: I am working on a research project that aims to show the total tax paid, transfers and subsidies for 26 different household types. Ideally I would like the GST estimates to be as refined as possible. I know IRD can't of course trace GST paid by individuals, but I recall there has been work in the past for Tax Working Groups that has provided estimates. What I am after is any information or papers that can help with the following: 1. Proportion of after tax income that goes on GST for the average (mean or median) New Zealander 2. Proportion of after tax income that goes on GST for different income levels, deciles, quintiles etc 3. Any known differences in GST paid by sex, age, ethnicity, employment status\] Your request has been considered under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA). As you noted, Inland Revenue does not collect information on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) paid by individuals. Therefore, we do not hold data which could be broken down into the specific categories requested in parts one, two and three of your request. As a result, your request is refused under section 18(e) of the OIA as the information requested does not exist. Past research in this space has generally been carried out using survey data held by Statistics New Zealand (Stats NZ) to infer the GST payable. You may be interested in related information released by the Tax Working Group at https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/index.html. In particular, a paper prepared in March 2018 for consideration by the Tax Working Group offered insights into the distribution of tax burdens across income deciles, including income tax, GST, and transfers. While it does not specify the exact proportion of after-tax income dedicated to GST for the average New Zealander, or delve into GST payments specifically by sex or employment states, it includes references to demographic breakdowns of wealth by ethnicity 25OIA1321 Page 2 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] and age. The document is available at https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018- 09/twg-bg-distributional-analysis.pdf. Additionally, Inland Revenue has published a report in April 2023 which examines GST relative to expenditure and income across household income deciles. The report can be found on Inland Revenue’s website at High-Wealth Individuals Research Project Report - April 2023 (ird.govt.nz). This report also provides links to earlier work carried out at Victoria University of Wellington in 2015: Thomas, A. (2015). The Distributional Effects of Consumption Taxes in New Zealand. Working Papers in Public Finance. Working Paper 08/2015. This document can be found at http://hdl.handle.net/10063/4668 Inland Revenue has consulted with Stats NZ to determine whether the information you are requesting is instead held by that agency which would allow for a transfer of your request. However, Stats NZ has advised that they too do not collect data on GST paid by individuals. They have suggested you may be interested though, in household expenditure statistics published on the Stats NZ website at https://www.stats.govt.nz/information- releases/household-expenditure-statistics-year-ended-june-2023/. Inland Revenue has also consulted with The Treasury as we noted that they have published analytical papers about the effects of taxes on household incomes, including those paid on consumption. For example, a paper titled “Fiscal incidence in New Zealand: The effects of taxes and benefits on household incomes in tax year 2018/19 (AN 24/01)”, can be found online at https://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/an/an-24-01. You may want to consider approaching The Treasury directly if you think that they might hold other information of interest to you. Right of review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: commissionerscorrespondence@ird.govt.nz. Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman by email at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz. If you choose to have an internal review, you can still ask the Ombudsman for a review. Publishing of OIA response We intend to publish our response to your request on Inland Revenue’s website (ird.govt.nz) as this information may be of interest to other members of the public. This letter, with your personal details removed, may be published in its entirety. Publishing responses increases the availability of information to the public and is consistent with the OIA's purpose of enabling more effective participation in the making and administration of laws and policies and promoting the accountability of officials. 25OIA1321 Page 3 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Yours sincerely Sandra Watson Policy Lead, Forecasting and Analysis
Classified in Confidence – IR Protected \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Use of Facebook’s Custom Audience for advertising campaigns Brief Privacy Analysis Prepared by: Date: About this Document The purpose of this document is to demonstrate that privacy has been considered in a project or process that involves personal information. The Analysis pulls together relevant information to determine whether a full Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) should be completed and records IRs decision of why a PIA has not been done. It will answer the following questions: 1.Does this proposal involve a new way of managing personal information? 2.Does the proposal raise a significant privacy risk for IR? 3.Is a full privacy impact assessment required? 1.Project summary: Data matching for advertising campaigns 1.1 Brief description of the project This project is initially for advertising activity directed at Student Loans customers but would be used more widely in marketing campaigns. For instance, using this service to display banners to social policy customers without a myIR account Currently we provide our advertising agency (FCB) with personal information in the form of a list of email addresses and mobile numbers. This data is then ‘hashed’ (a way of encrypting the data so it cannot be identified to anyone) and matched against Facebook profiles and to be used in targeted advertising campaigns. Facebook has increased the data matching capabilities to include more than just email and mobile numbers. The new data types available for matching include: •First Name •Last Name •Postal Code •City •Date of birth •Gender By providing this information we could greatly improve the results of the marketing activities and direct more relevant messages to customers. In the case of Student Loan overseas-based borrowers we currently have contact details (email and mobile numbers) Appendix A Classified in Confidence – IR Protected \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] of approximately 55% of the population. If we were to use the full list of data types FCB estimates we would be able to match 87% of the population. This would greatly improve Inland Revenues ability to meet its objectives of increasing repayments and increasing the contact details we have for overseas-based student loan borrowers. The main stakeholders or entities involved in this project will be: •Corporate Legal and Corporate Integrity & Assurance teams to advise any changes required from a legal perspective •Marketing – to implement any changes required •Intel delivery – To provide the data •FCB – Receive the password protected data files and load the data to Facebook’s system. Facebook provide FCB with a Custom Audience for advertising purposes How Custom Audience works Inland Revenue sends its advertising agency (FCB) a list of the people we wish to present adverts to. FCB can create a customer list custom audience as they’re the owner of an ad account connected to Meta Business Manager or the owner has provided admin or advertiser permissions. To make a custom audience from a customer list, Meta is provided with information about existing customers and this is matched to Meta profiles. The information on a customer list is known as an “identifier” (such as email, phone number, address) and is use it to help find the audiences you want your ads to reach. Your customer list can either be a CSV or TXT file that includes these identifiers. A custom audience is created by adding a customer list into Meta Ad Manager and selecting the identifiers to be used (name, email etc). Information in the customer list is hashed and will be unidentifiable at an individual level. Hashing is a type of cryptographic security method that turns identifiers into randomized code and cannot be reversed. For example, for example, John.doe@ird.govt.nz may come out hashed as wLKziR/6RoXDv1MDaXLH1UNUC9nIVr97jrTnL4TcxsM=. It’s important to note that hashing is one way; you can take an email address and hash it, however you can’t take hashed data and turn it back into an email address. After information in the customer list is hashed, it is sent to Facebook. Facebook uses this hashed information by comparing it to its own hashed information and builds a custom audience by finding the Facebook profiles that match. After the Custom Audience is created, the matched and unmatched hashed information is deleted.

Classified in Confidence – IR Protected \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Use of Facebook’s Custom Audience for advertising campaigns Brief Privacy Analysis Prepared by: Date: About this Document The purpose of this document is to demonstrate that privacy has been considered in a project or process that involves personal information. The Analysis pulls together relevant information to determine whether a full Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) should be completed and records IRs decision of why a PIA has not been done. It will answer the following questions: 1.Does this proposal involve a new way of managing personal information? 2.Does the proposal raise a significant privacy risk for IR? 3.Is a full privacy impact assessment required? 1.Project summary: Data matching for advertising campaigns 1.1 Brief description of the project This project is initially for advertising activity directed at Student Loans customers but would be used more widely in marketing campaigns. For instance, using this service to display banners to social policy customers without a myIR account Currently we provide our advertising agency (FCB) with personal information in the form of a list of email addresses and mobile numbers. This data is then ‘hashed’ (a way of encrypting the data so it cannot be identified to anyone) and matched against Facebook profiles and to be used in targeted advertising campaigns. Facebook has increased the data matching capabilities to include more than just email and mobile numbers. The new data types available for matching include: •First Name •Last Name •Postal Code •City •Date of birth •Gender By providing this information we could greatly improve the results of the marketing activities and direct more relevant messages to customers. In the case of Student Loan overseas-based borrowers we currently have contact details (email and mobile numbers) Appendix A Classified in Confidence – IR Protected \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] of approximately 55% of the population. If we were to use the full list of data types FCB estimates we would be able to match 87% of the population. This would greatly improve Inland Revenues ability to meet its objectives of increasing repayments and increasing the contact details we have for overseas-based student loan borrowers. The main stakeholders or entities involved in this project will be: •Corporate Legal and Corporate Integrity & Assurance teams to advise any changes required from a legal perspective •Marketing – to implement any changes required •Intel delivery – To provide the data •FCB – Receive the password protected data files and load the data to Facebook’s system. Facebook provide FCB with a Custom Audience for advertising purposes How Custom Audience works Inland Revenue sends its advertising agency (FCB) a list of the people we wish to present adverts to. FCB can create a customer list custom audience as they’re the owner of an ad account connected to Meta Business Manager or the owner has provided admin or advertiser permissions. To make a custom audience from a customer list, Meta is provided with information about existing customers and this is matched to Meta profiles. The information on a customer list is known as an “identifier” (such as email, phone number, address) and is use it to help find the audiences you want your ads to reach. Your customer list can either be a CSV or TXT file that includes these identifiers. A custom audience is created by adding a customer list into Meta Ad Manager and selecting the identifiers to be used (name, email etc). Information in the customer list is hashed and will be unidentifiable at an individual level. Hashing is a type of cryptographic security method that turns identifiers into randomized code and cannot be reversed. For example, for example, John.doe@ird.govt.nz may come out hashed as wLKziR/6RoXDv1MDaXLH1UNUC9nIVr97jrTnL4TcxsM=. It’s important to note that hashing is one way; you can take an email address and hash it, however you can’t take hashed data and turn it back into an email address. After information in the customer list is hashed, it is sent to Facebook. Facebook uses this hashed information by comparing it to its own hashed information and builds a custom audience by finding the Facebook profiles that match. After the Custom Audience is created, the matched and unmatched hashed information is deleted.

We did not continue with custom audiences through the rejected platforms. We also have a process for how custom audiences are uploaded. If we are running a campaign through an advertising agency, the lists are uploaded by the IR marketing team. That way the agency doesn’t have access to the customer data but can set up ads and budget to be allocated to the already hashed lists within the platform.

Visit us online at ird.govt.nz s 9(2)(a) Briefing note Reference: BN 2024/369 Date: 09 September 2024 To: Private Secretary, Minister of Revenue – Angela Graham Private Secretary, Minister of Revenue – Helen Kuy Private Secretary, Minister of Finance – Emma Grigg Copy to: James Grayson, Acting Commissioner Lisa Barret, Deputy Commissioner Joanne Petrie, Executive Support Advisor to the Commissioner Denise Wright Management Support to Deputy Commissioner Carolyn Patchell Management Support to Deputy Commissioner Governance and Ministerial Services From: Pip Knight, Service Leader Marketing and Communications Subject: The use of Custom Audience list on social media platforms Purpose 1.To provide a briefing to the Minister of Revenue and Minister of Finance on Inland Revenue’s use of social media platforms, and the anonymised information we share with them, to target campaigns at taxpayers to increase compliance. Background and context 2.Inland Revenue recently received an OIA and Media enquiries in relation to its use of Custom Audience list on social media. 3.For advertising purposes, Inland Revenue uploads custom audience lists securely to Meta (Facebook and Instagram), LinkedIn and Google. Inland Revenue does not upload custom audience lists to X (formally known as Twitter) or TikTok. 4.A custom audience list is a list of specific customers who Inland Revenue wants to target. 5.The data is hashed when it is uploaded meaning that it is un-identifiable when it gets to the social media platform. 6.Hashing is a type of cryptographic security method that turns identifiers into randomised code and cannot be reversed so identities are protected. For example, John.doe@ird.govt.nz may come out hashed as wLKziR/6RoXDv1MDaXLH1UNUC9nIVr97jrTnL4TcxsM=. 7.Custom audience data is used only to match a customer using unidentifiable data, so the platform will not be able to access any personal information. 8.Inland Revenue uses custom audience lists on the social media platforms to reach relevant customers who are on these platforms. The purpose of using custom audience Appendix C BN2024/369 The use of Custom Audience lists 2 advertising is to increase the compliance of collecting tax revenue and dispersing payments by targeting only customers who need to see the advert. Examples of where we regularly use custom audience advertising are: a.Student loan customers who have debt owing. We separate these audiences into different segments for accuracy, such as those based overseas, those within New Zealand who are self-employed and those based in New Zealand earning salary and wages. b.GST customers who have returns and/or a debt due c.Income tax debt – customers who have tax debt and would benefit from setting up an instalment arrangement to manage this debt d.Working for Families customers who need to update their information with Inland Revenue. 9.Social media platforms offer a custom audience feature which allows businesses and government departments to upload information to an encrypted site for direct marketing purposes. 10. Each social media platform has its own privacy principles in place that it must adhere to. These privacy principles were reviewed by Inland Revenue to ensure that customer information is protected and only used for the intended purpose. 11. Inland Revenue is satisfied that this information is deleted when the hashing process has been completed. 12. Inland Revenue is authorised to manage its own privacy assessments and work undertakings. 13. Inland Revenue does not have the ability to identify customers who would like to opt out of advertising. However customers can opt-out of being shown specific ads by editing their advertising preferences in the social platforms they use. 14. Inland Revenue only has access to information that is publicly available on social media platforms. 15. Inland Revenue continuously reviews our processes to ensure we’re safe. Off the back of these enquiries and comments from the US Federal Trade Commission and European Data Protection Supervisor, our CISO team ha s begun looking further into the use of hashing to ensure it is still safe to use. NZ Information Security manual, which is maintained by the GCSB, has guidelines. Inland Revenue’s standards with relation to hashing operates within these guidelines.

Our SME Leadership Hui is fast approaching and as you know, we’ll all be participating in a Wall Walk as part of our ongoing cultural uplift through Pūkenga Ahurea. This session is facilitated by Dr Simone Bull and is designed to raise collective awareness of key events in history for Aotearoa. Despite the name, it isn’t a physical walk. It’s a room-based ‘walk’ through time and events and gives you the opportunity to understand the impact of key events for Māori and for wider Aotearoa. One of the amazing parts of this workshop is that it can be tailored to us as an audience and how our role as a public service influences social outcomes, and there is pre-work that we will all take part in to prepare for the session. Below are the groups you’re in and attached is a document with your pre-work topic to complete. The document has links that you might find helpful, but you are also encouraged to do you own rangahau/research to create a 6-minute group presentation on your topic. These topics are key events/subjects that have had targeted and enduring impacts on Māori and you’re all encouraged to meet as a group and wānanga/discuss and ako/learn together. Part of Pūkenga Ahurea is to also lift our segment’s understanding of tikanga māori and how that’s demonstrated practically in a work environment. Like many aspects of Te Ao Māori, tikanga is not easily defined. In essence, is it cultural practices, customs, and principles that protect the physical, mental/emotional, and spiritual wellbeing of iwi, hapū, whānau, and individuals. While most tikanga are quite practical like not sitting on a table because why would you want your nono (backside lol) to go on something you eat off there is also a spiritual element to these practices. For this particular example, food is our way to lift or remove a person from a state of tapu (where you’re in a spiritually vulnerable space). By sitting on a table, you’re inferring that you are an object used to lift this state of tapu and reducing yourself to the ‘level’ of food. See – practical and spiritual, and I’ve got a couply more examples up my sleeve if you want to learn more To that end, after the Wall Walk session there will be a quick mihimihi of thanks to Simone and we’ll sing a waiata tautoko/supporting waiata after this mihimihi. This tikanga is one that most of you are familiar with, where a group will offer physical and spiritual support to a kaikōrero/speaker in the form of a song. So we will be singing all 12 verses of E noho Tūheitia with actions. Jooookes – I’m not that cruel plus not all the rohe/areas that our sites are from support the Kiingitanga, and we won’t even be in the Waikato rohe so that doesn’t make sense. Our waiata Tautoko will be Te Aroha . Please take the time to learn this short waiata so we can flex our vocal skills for our manuhiri/guest. If you have any pātai/questions, please reach out to myself, Raven, or Tracy and we’ll do our best to awhi you along this haerenga/journey ❤ s 9(2)(a) From:Sherree Perfect To:Andrew Stott; Vanessa Jarman Subject:RE: Kaitakawaenga Māori Training Budget 23-24 - The Wall Walk Date:Friday, 19 January 2024 12:19:00 pm Kia ora korua, We are ready to book in the date’s pre-30 June for the event, Holly – Kaitakawaenga Māori Nelson with Amy will be organising on site. Andrew - we need one night’s accommodation and flights for the Kaitakawaenga Māori and their leaders travelling from outside of Christchuch (8) – and a budget for a morning tea for 30/40 say $200 , the experience is like a forum with prework and group work that is fed back so it is preferred min 30 people to gain the full experience, recommended we book 40 to allow for natural reduction. We are planning to go to all CCOM Christchurch and wider segments if needed. Van – we need collab approval? Perhaps just a heads up until we have a date, I can confirm that SME has booked for the same course but theirs is full they will be running from Auckland.

The course requires pre work and is for a half day. Topics covered Quote from one of our IR people “It was great - I loved it and learnt so much. We didn't have any handouts - you learn through the interactive workshop and the input you put into the pre-course work”.

What - Titiro whakamuri, kokiri whakamua – look back and reflect, so you can move forward. This Wall Walk looks (with a Police lens) at the Crown-Māori history from the early 1800’s to today. It’s an interactive half-day workshop designed to raise collective awareness of key events in the history of NZ’s bicultural relations. The Wall Walk ® . Some of you may have attended previous ones I’ve organised or been to them at other agencies. They are a safe and engaging way to increase awareness and knowledge of NZ history. I’ve always thought an IR version of this could be so interesting to create. It is not a ‘walk’ per se - the walk occurs in a room (Asteron L5 rooms for this). Arrival time ~9.45am; opens at 10am; starts at 10.10; lunch (self-catered) around noon; resumes at 12.30; ends around 2.30pm. There is pre-work sent out 2 weeks prior. The wider group are put into smaller teams (~10 people) and assigned an historical event. They prepare and present back on the day (~5m). This is designed to be reflective in advance, and to support active participation on the day. Action: are you interested in joining (no cost to you), please indicate now so I can lock in our booking/s before someone else gets them: a. If you’re interested - via poll – indicate which dates you could attend i.e. Tue 4 June and/or Mon 24 June or ‘interested but can’t make either’? (View/vote in browser ). This will give me a level of confidence to book one or both dates (or start looking for more dates). If you are available one or both dates, pop them on hold in your diary. b. If you also wish to pre-select a date – use the voting buttons above to choose one or the other and we’ll put you down for that specific date – we can take up to 60 per day and I anticipate they will be fully subscribed. OR c. If you’re not interested right now, you can ignore this message. d. If you have a direct report you would prioritise for attendance, please let Pat know and they’ll be some of the next people we open this up to. A virtual wall walk is now available – see the ‘on demand’ tab in The Wall Walk link above. s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) 1 Subject:The Wall Walk - Te Hikoi Maumahara - Connecting People to the Past Location:Asteron, Wellington Rooms Level 5, Tokomaru, Aotea & Kurahaupo Start:Mon 24/06/2024 10:00 am End: Mon 24/06/2024 3:00 pm Show Time As:Tentative Recurrence:(none) Meeting Status:Not yet responded Organizer: People & Workplace Services Required Attendees: Joanne Edgecombe; Tanaya Ratima; Fionna Chester; Jordan Takiwa; Mere Paul-Mataa; Vicki Rangitakatu; Kirsten Eden; Prerna Dwivedi; Glenn Richards; Tima Basha; Grace Chatwin; Andrew Tringham; Andrew Robertson; Alex Shaw; Caleb Lerm; Debbie Hamel; Geoff Wintle; Hannah Crawshaw; Jade Tafua; Jane Elley; Kelly Paterson; Mathew Beros; Matthew Prince; Esme Dawson; Tanja Jonson; Samantha Cunningham; Niki Loizou; Shardee Hadfield; Charles Goldsmith; Stacey Tipene; Tegan Workman; Aidan Howell; Hauauru Rae; Marino Rapata; Meesh Gray; Aimee Rudkin; Brianna O'Dea; Molly Puia; Keanu Head; Tim Sharma; Ruth Bromley; Josh Green; Jason Ratima; Suzanne Sherris; Olive Pule; Anya Henarath; Bobbie Tapurau; Jesse Thwaites; Michelle Paul; Denise Birdling; Raksha Bhim; Luke Schaumkell; Kaylynne Bell; Melissa Zhen; Shelley Hayman; Kiaya McLuckie; Mili Herrera; Jamie Robinson; Mongi Kampanga Optional Attendees: Erina Clayton Tēnā Koutou, Thank you for registering for The Wall Walk www.thewallwalk.co.nz on Monday; 24 June 2024, in Wellington Please accept/decline this appointment so that we can keep track of the numbers aƩending and accommodate others on our Wait list if you are unable to aƩend. This is appreciated. This is a half day workshop where you’ll be ‘walking’ through a timeline of key events in NZ history focussing on the relationship between Māori and the Crown.

Dr Simone Bull was very impressed with the presentations and thankyou to all of you that ‘soldiered on’ despite losing some of your teammates due to flight delays and sickness. Ka rawe! Ngā mihi nui to Jordan Takiwa for welcoming Dr Sim and opening Karakia along with our Māori wahine for their beautiful singing. You may also be thinking about your ongoing learning around Māori, NZ history / hitori, and Crown-Māori (or Māori-Crown) relations. A few of the resources below that Erina has got value from, in case they are of interest to you: What was before Crown-Māori? By c1300 Māori had come to this land. For ~500 years they lived here before anyone else arrived. There will be other opportunities to develop your understanding of this time in our nation’s history. See these short YouTube videos if you want learning bites for now: 1. He Whenua Rangatira. A Māori land - see the history of Māori arrivals from 1200, European arrivals from 1642 and the signing of He Whakaputanga from 1835 to 1839 (4 minutes) 2. He Whakaputanga — Whose hand was it that crafted these words. Here's the story of the writing of He Whakaputanga, the Declaration of Independence which preceded te tiriti (1 minute) 3. The voyages of Te Tiriti o Waitangi - See the voyage of the 9 sheets of the Treaty over 8 months in 1840 across New Zealand. The sheets went to 45 locations and gathered 542 signatures (3 minutes) 4. Land ownership - See major Crown acquisitions since 1840, including confiscations after the New Zealand Wars and peak Native Land Court era (2 minutes) 5. Maori creation stories. Book One (of at least 4) Te Orokotīmatanga o te Ao is the story of the creation of the universe according to Māori. It begins with Io, the Supreme Being and the infinite state of nothingness before you are transported through aeons to the time of Ranginui (Sky Father) and Papatūānuku (Earth Mother). You are then introduced to some of their children who are the source and inspiration for the stories that follow. What other learning can IR offer? Learn about the Treaty of Waitangi and how it fits into the work we do, and basic te reo and tikanga Māori protocols. Ātea learning modules (sharepoint.com) And remember the new Tūrama app - Tūrama (sharepoint.com). We are committed to building stronger relationships with Māori. Looking back and reflecting is a really valuable thing to do, and to keep doing. Ngā mihi Erina & Pat

The tool allows these data sets to be uploaded to Facebook’s servers, and matched with existing accounts to create targeted segments of specific Facebook users. The mechanism for creating audiences is through an internally developed web interface called Power Editor. Audiences are also able to be created through the Ads Manager API. Facebook has implemented certain controls and security mechanisms to protect and secure uploaded advertiser data including specific controls within the matching process and restrictions on data retention and usage The process has been designed to cryptographically hash customer data that advertisers have independent of Facebook (such as telephone numbers and email addresses) prior to any information being received by Facebook. JavaScript code within the browser hashes the information, and it is passed to Facebook through the Ads API. The hashed data is then matched against hashed Facebook user data to determine if the corresponding accounts exist. The resulting output of matching accounts is called a “Custom Audience.” The Custom Audience does not list any specific user data, nor does it identify for advertisers specifically which users successfully matched. Rather, user information for advertisers is organized into aggregate demographics, describing the audience as a whole. For example, the Custom Audience attributes list an approximate number of matches, rather than the specific individuals included in the Custom Audience. Furthermore, access to the Custom Audience by an advertiser does not include access to Facebook unique identifiers, such as user ID, nor do the data sets contain other information about users in the Custom Audiences. The data set is linked to a consumer using only the Audience ID – a number assigned to each new Custom Audience, used by Facebook as a dataset identifier. Facebook does not keep data (matched or unmatched) provided by the advertiser, except for the time necessary to properly perform the match. After that, Facebook destroys the advertiser provided data. Facebook’s Description of the Custom Audiences Processing and Related Controls Getting Started and Accessing Custom Audiences 1. Accessing the Power Editor for Custom Audiences The first way that customers can submit data for the creation of a Custom Audience is using Power Editor. This can be accessed via the customers Ad Manager page. Customers download all their current Ads Account data into Power Editor in order to manage the account and its associated Pages. 2. Gaining access to the Ads API The second way to create and manage Custom Audiences is through the Ads API. In order to have access to make the Ads API calls, advertisers may partner with “Preferred Marketing Developers” (“PMDs”) – they have elevated access given to specific strategic ad partners to enable this functionality. PMDs have API keys used for authentication, before the API will respond to requests. Page 11 of 14 This report is intended solely for the information and use of Facebook and users of Facebook's Custom Audiences product, defined as Advertisers who have read the Custom Audiences Terms. The report is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties. Creating Custom Audiences 1. Uploading and submitting data through Power Editor and the API Power Editor is a web application that sends data to Facebook via the Ads API. Regardless if the advertiser’s PMD is directly calling the API, or using the GUI (Power Editor) themselves, the commands to the API are the same; and funnel through the same entry point. Customers can submit data in either .txt or .csv formats. The application will match on emails, UIDs, or phone numbers. 2. Hashing client-side customer provided data Email addresses and phone numbers are hashed prior to being sent to Facebook. The hashing always takes place on the client side. When uploading data using Power Editor, JavaScript within the browser is used to execute the hashing. Advertisers that use PMDs are also able to send information directly to the Ads API, bypassing the Power Editor user interface. However, because sending API commands do not include the inherent hashing functionality used by Power Editor when advertisers’ PMDs submit data to the API directly, they are responsible for inputting the hashing syntax in the API command. 3. Data validation Facebook limits the data that can be processed to create Custom Audiences, by including data validations within Custom Audiences’ web server. Facebook stores only the data that passes the validations. Checks for inappropriately formatted data are performed prior to processing. Facebook performs the following data validations for Custom Audiences’ customer input files:  Data submitted as Facebook userIDs are validated to ensure that they are numbers only, and no additional characters (such as: “@”, “,”, or “-“) are included in the string.  Data submitted as email addresses will not accept values that do not have the “@” symbol.  Data submitted as phone numbers will not accept values that have the “(” or “-” symbols. Matching Audience Data against Facebook Users. 1. Facebook hashing and matching capabilities Facebook hashes user account data in the same way advertisers hash their data. This allows Facebook to perform a matching process against the advertiser provided data, and determine which users in the advertiser provided data have Facebook accounts. Facebook uses a proprietary multivariate matching process that allows them to match data based off multiple criteria. Custom Audiences can utilize multivariate matching in the event that the customer provides multiple variables for each user in their dataset. This can also be done by specifying the parameters of the campaign and audience the advertiser wants to target within their Ad Manager. 2. Matching advertiser provided data with Facebook users The hashed advertiser provided data is sent through the Ads API to Facebook for further validation. These validations check to make sure the data is formatted properly and that plaintext data is rejected with an error message. The validated data is then compared to Facebook user data, and matches are identified to create the Custom Audience for the Advertiser. It is important to note that this process is asynchronous and as a result, the Custom Audience can take up to two days to generate (depending on the size of the audience) and be sent back to the customer.

The report is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties. Data Protection and Deletion 1. Retention of data by Facebook All hashed advertiser provided data is removed once the asynchronous matching process is complete. The retention period can last up to 48 hours. This duration is considered by Facebook Engineering to be the maximum amount of time required to successfully process any Custom Audience. After that time, the hashed advertiser provided data is removed permanently. Additionally, any attempt to query or access the Advertisers’ hashed data is logged. Only privileged users have access to the environment where Custom Audience data is stored. Once the data is matched and the audience is created, the hashed data is not used for any other purpose, destroyed and not accessible from Facebook systems. Sharing of Custom Audiences 1. Sharing between ad accounts Custom Audiences, by default, are only visible by the Facebook user account that created them. The Custom Audience owner can share their audiences by using Power Editor or by making an HTTP POST request within the API. The Custom Audience owner specifies the Ad Account ID of the user(s) to whom want to share the Custom Audience. Custom Audience owners are able to share their audiences with as many other ad account users as they wish. Additionally, at any time, the sharing privileges may be revoked by the Custom Audience owner. 2. Shared account access privileges After Custom Audiences are shared between users, the user with whom the Custom Audiences has been shared does not have the ability to modify, delete, or further share the audience; nor could the information about the Facebook users within the Custom Audience be viewed. Only the user that created the Custom Audience may edit or share it. Managing Access to Related Systems 1. Access management for privileged and non-privileged systems Access to production systems housing the customer provided hashed data is restricted to Facebook authorized personnel that need it. Additionally, access to the development environment requires 2-factor authentication. 2. Facebook accounts Authentication to internal web-based tools is restricted to the employee’s individual Facebook account. When an employee performs certain actions, whether it is developing code, responding to incident requests, or logging on to a specific system, the action is attributed to an easily traceable account. 3. Changes and termination of access In the event an employee transfers roles within the organization, an automated alert is sent to the employee and the information security team for review. The Security Engineer reviews the change and communicates with the transferred user to make a determination as to whether any subsequent system access changes need to be made. Facebook utilizes an Identity Management tool to automatically de-provision user access to all systems in the event of their termination. This tool interfaces with the HR system of record, which indicates a change in the user’s employment status. As a result, the automated tool removes the user’s access from all systems, including physical building access.

The report is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties. Managing Changes to Related Systems 1. Change and configuration management Changes to the Custom Audiences’ infrastructure and back-end environment, including operating systems, databases, servers, and interfaces, follow the Facebook coding and release process. This process includes documentation, enterprise-wide consistent secure coding practices, peer level code reviews and testing, segregated environment access restrictions, and a formalized code release process. 2. Change documentation and review Changes submitted and released to production are automatically captured within the source-code repository and Facebook release libraries. The process is designed to require multiple users to review and authorize the change before it can be released into production. All committed code changes are reviewed by an individual that is different than the developer, and are tested prior to commit to production. A history of every change made to a specific system or code base is captured and available for review. 3. Releasing changes to production Facebook has a defined code release process. Access to release code to the production environment is restricted to only the engineers with responsibility and authority to release changes. The release team will not release code to production unless adequate testing has been performed and all changes have been approved for release into production.

It will answer the following questions: 1.Does this proposal involve a new way of managing personal information? 2.Does the proposal raise a significant privacy risk for IR? 3.Is a full privacy impact assessment required? 1.Project summary: Data matching for advertising campaigns 1.1 Brief description of the project This project is initially for advertising activity directed at Student Loans customers but would be used more widely in marketing campaigns. For instance, using this service to display banners to social policy customers without a myIR account Currently we provide our advertising agency (FCB) with personal information in the form of a list of email addresses and mobile numbers. This data is then ‘hashed’ (a way of encrypting the data so it cannot be identified to anyone) and matched against Facebook profiles and to be used in targeted advertising campaigns. Facebook has increased the data matching capabilities to include more than just email and mobile numbers. The new data types available for matching include: •First Name •Last Name •Postal Code •City •Date of birth •Gender By providing this information we could greatly improve the results of the marketing activities and direct more relevant messages to customers. In the case of Student Loan overseas-based borrowers we currently have contact details (email and mobile numbers) Appendix A Classified in Confidence – IR Protected \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] of approximately 55% of the population. If we were to use the full list of data types FCB estimates we would be able to match 87% of the population. This would greatly improve Inland Revenues ability to meet its objectives of increasing repayments and increasing the contact details we have for overseas-based student loan borrowers. The main stakeholders or entities involved in this project will be: •Corporate Legal and Corporate Integrity & Assurance teams to advise any changes required from a legal perspective •Marketing – to implement any changes required •Intel delivery – To provide the data •FCB – Receive the password protected data files and load the data to Facebook’s system. Facebook provide FCB with a Custom Audience for advertising purposes How Custom Audience works Inland Revenue sends its advertising agency (FCB) a list of the people we wish to present adverts to. FCB can create a customer list custom audience as they’re the owner of an ad account connected to Meta Business Manager or the owner has provided admin or advertiser permissions. To make a custom audience from a customer list, Meta is provided with information about existing customers and this is matched to Meta profiles. The information on a customer list is known as an “identifier” (such as email, phone number, address) and is use it to help find the audiences you want your ads to reach. Your customer list can either be a CSV or TXT file that includes these identifiers. A custom audience is created by adding a customer list into Meta Ad Manager and selecting the identifiers to be used (name, email etc). Information in the customer list is hashed and will be unidentifiable at an individual level. Hashing is a type of cryptographic security method that turns identifiers into randomized code and cannot be reversed. For example, for example, John.doe@ird.govt.nz may come out hashed as wLKziR/6RoXDv1MDaXLH1UNUC9nIVr97jrTnL4TcxsM=. It’s important to note that hashing is one way; you can take an email address and hash it, however you can’t take hashed data and turn it back into an email address. After information in the customer list is hashed, it is sent to Facebook. Facebook uses this hashed information by comparing it to its own hashed information and builds a custom audience by finding the Facebook profiles that match. After the Custom Audience is created, the matched and unmatched hashed information is deleted.

Appendix A 25 January 2024 Excerpt from Weekly Status Report PUB00465 Charities – Business income exemption Inland Revenue will release for consultation draft public guidance on the application of the charitable exemption for business income in the week commencing 5 February. The Income Tax Act 2007 provides an exemption for income derived by a registered charity from a business carried out exclusively for charitable purposes, subject to the following two restrictions: •If a registered charity carries out its charitable purposes in New Zealand and overseas it must apportion the business income it derives between those purposes in and outside New Zealand. Only the part apportioned to the charitable purposes in New Zealand is exempt. •Business income is not exempt if a person with some control over the business is able to direct or divert money away from the charity. The items follow an Issues Paper released in December 2022 that sought feedback on the correct approach to the law on technical issues that have caused uncertainty for the sector.

This report provides you with an overview of the charities and not-for-profits (NFPs) sector and related tax policy matters. This context may be useful for future tax policy reports and for matters that may be raised with you by stakeholders and other Ministers. 2. This report does not purport to contain a detailed analysis and description of each matter. Rather, it seeks to inform you of the potential range of matters and makes some comment on their attributes so that you can discuss which matters you want to further consider. The appendix contains a summary of these items. 3. We recommend you note this report and invite you to meet with officials to discuss the contents. Background Charities and NFPs framework 4. Charities and NFPs make important contributions to the wellbeing of New Zealanders. The sector supports efforts to bolster our social, human, and natural capital. The economic activities of the sector also affect the accumulation of physical and financial capital in the New Zealand economy. These factors form the basis for the tax exemptions and deduction frameworks provided to charities and NFP organisations. 5. The broad policy setting for this sector is that the Government supports charities and NFPs by providing targeted tax concessions. Inland Revenue administers charitable tax exemptions from income tax, fringe benefit tax, goods and services tax and resident withholding tax. We also approve donee status, which gives tax benefits to people donating to these organisations. NFPs that benefit from the widest range of tax concessions will be registered charities that are well regulated, publicly transparent and provide public benefit. Donation tax incentives have the objective of reinforcing and encouraging giving to approved donee organisations. Income tax and donation benefits for charities with charitable purposes outside New Zealand are restricted. 6. Some of the policy options for this sector will need to be considered in the context of broader objectives the Government has for the sector. Charities and NFPs statistics on Inland Revenue systems 7. There are approximately 90,000 NFPs on Inland Revenue’s system. These include: 7.1 29,000 tax-exempt charities. Based on accounts filed on the public charities register for 2022–23, tax-exempt charities control $81 billion of assets, employ 138,000 people full time (5% of the New Zealand workforce), benefit from 170,000 volunteers each week and contribute about 5% of GDP. IR2024/110: Charities and not-for-profits overview Page 2 of 6 7.2 20,000 tax-exempt amateur sports bodies. 7.3 1,000 tax-exempt local and regional promotion bodies (beautification societies). 7.4 28,000 NFPs that are not tax exempt. About 24,000 of these have net income below a $1,000 deduction threshold available for NFPs, so they do not file income tax returns or pay income tax. About 4,000 file income tax returns and report a taxable income, taxable loss or zero net income. Recent legislative and regulatory change for the sector 8. This sector has been subject to legislative and regulatory change over recent years. Significant changes include: 8.1 The Incorporated Societies Act 2022, which requires approximately 23,000 incorporated societies to re-register by April 2026 and annually report using the same accounting standards as registered charities. 8.2 The Charities Amendment Act 2023, which introduced a number of changes for 29,000 registered charities. The changes include a new requirement for large charities to report the reasons why they are accumulating funds. 8.3 The External Reporting Board (XRB) has introduced changes to the threshold size of some reporting tiers for registered charities, incorporated societies and other public benefit entities. The focus has been to make it easier for small charities to apply the standards and for larger charities to adopt new service performance reporting standards. Current policy work 9. There are three projects involving this sector that our policy staff are currently involved with. Disposals of trading stock at below market value 10. In January 2024, you agreed to progress work related to disposals of trading stock at below market value. Cabinet agreed to the changes on 26 February 2024. These changes will benefit donee organisations because businesses will be able to donate trading stock to them and claim tax deductions on an ongoing basis. These changes are being progressed in an Amendment Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023–24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill. Requests for overseas donee status 11. Every year there are requests from New Zealand charities with overseas purposes to be granted overseas donee status. Overseas donee status is an exception to the current law that restricts tax benefits for donations to charities with New Zealand purposes. Decisions to give overseas donee status that meet certain Cabinet criteria, such as the relief of poverty, sickness, or the ravages of war or natural disaster, or other overseas development aid objectives, require legislative change. 12. We plan to report to you in April 2024 about the next tranche of requests for overseas donee status for inclusion in the next taxation Bill, scheduled for introduction in August 2024. s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2024/110: Charities and not-for-profits overview Page 3 of 6 Regulatory stewardship 13. Later this year Inland Revenue will complete a regulatory stewardship report on donation tax credits. While this report is not primarily policy-related, it may contain policy recommendations that you decide to include on a future Tax and Social Policy Work Programme. Future policy work 14. A range of potential tax policy matters affecting this sector are identified in the Appendix. Two of these matters will be reported to you shortly and are summarised below. s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2024/110: Charities and not-for-profits overview Page 4 of 6 22. 23. Next steps 24. 25. We would welcome the opportunity to discuss any other matters raised in this report with you. 26. We are aware that Minister Louise Upston may write to you on certain tax matters and both she and Minister Nicola Willis have an interest in this sector. We recommend you share this paper with them, so that they are kept informed of this context. Consultation with the Treasury 27. The Treasury was informed about this report. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) Page 1 of 2 Policy Taukaea 55 Featherston Street PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 New Zealand T.04 890 1500 Briefing note Reference: BN2024/328 Date: 15 August 2024 To: Revenue Advisor, Minister of Revenue – Angela Graham Private Secretary, Minister of Revenue – Helen Kuy From: Stewart Donaldson Subject: Charities and not-for-profits tax briefing for Minister Upston Purpose 1.The purpose of this briefing note is to inform Minister Watts of charity and not-for - profit tax matters officials will discuss with Minister Upston on Thursday 22 August. Background 2.Earlier this year, officials offered to brief the Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Hon Louise Upston, about the tax rules which affect charities and not-for -profit organisations. Minister Upston accepted this offer and a meeting is scheduled on Thursday 22 August. Briefing content 3.Minister Watts has referred three charity / not-for -profit tax reports to Minister Upston so far this year and he has corresponded with her about volunteers and honoraria ( IR2024/110, IR2024/161, IR2024/237 and IR2024/238 refers). 4.This tax briefing will allow Minster Upston to clarify tax rules and policy settings for the sector. 5.A powerpoint that will be provided to Minister Upston is attached to this briefing note.

TAX POLICY FRAMEWORK / PRINCIPLES 1.Charities and not-for-profits make important contributions to the wellbeing of New Zealanders. 2.One of the ways the Government supports charities and not- for-profits is by providing favourable tax treatment. For context, the value of tax concessions is about 10% of government grants paid directly to charities and not-for- profits. 3.Registered charities generally receive the most tax benefits, in recognition of the public benefits they provide and their public accountability requirements. 4.Tax benefits for charities with charitable purposes outside New Zealand are restricted. 5.Donations tax incentives are aimed at reinforcing and encouraging giving to support the charitable, community and voluntary sectors. They empower the community to decide funding priorities. 6.Tax expenditures should be subject to continual monitoring and review to determine their effectiveness, both in meeting objectives, and relative to alternative methods of providing assistance. 3 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 2. TAX CONCESSIONS Favourable tax treatment mainly comes in the form of: ▪Income tax exemptions ▪Income tax deductions ▪Tax concessions for donations ▪Fringe benefit tax exemptions ▪GST concessions All tax expenditures are subject to continual monitoring and review to determine their effectiveness 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4. DONATION TAX CONCESSIONS Timeline 1962-2024: Donation tax concessions were introduced in 1962 for individuals, 1972 for corporates and extended for Māori authorities in 2003-04. The maximum claims were increased significantly in 2008-09 (individual caps increased from a $630 tax credit to 1/3 of taxable income; corporate and Māori authority caps increased from 5% to total net income). Payroll giving was introduced in 2010. There are about 25,000doneeorganisations (recipients of donations that qualify for donation tax credits): To qualify, organisations must apply funds for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes wholly or mainly\* within NZ. Most registered charities and education providers qualify as doneeorganisations. The NZ concessions are generous compared to international benchmarks: •They are payable as a refundable tax credit at a high rate of 33 1/3% (Australia has an income tax deduction so donorswith income below their $18,200 tax-free threshold(including many pensioners) do not benefit) •They have a high maximum claim (cap), and •The list of eligible doneeorganisationsis relatively large (Australia does not allow claims for donations to religious organisationsor schools; in NZ these make up over 70% of claims). •Butconcessions are limited to gifts of money (not gifts in kind) and do not include debt forgiveness or bequests. Recent tax changes to make concessions more generous: •From 1 April 2024 businesses can donate trading stock to doneeorganisations and claim a deduction (there is no maximum cap for trading stock donations) •From 1 April 2019 donors have been able to upload receipts into MyIRduring the tax year and many receive automatic refunds after the end of the tax year •From 1 April 2019 IR relaxed its interpretation of ‘wholly or mainly’from a 1 year to 3 yeartestso more charities with overseas purposes qualify as doneeorganisations. \*Wholly or mainly: At least 75% of funds must be applied in NZ over a three-year period; The amount applied in NZ in any one year cannot fall below 50%. A number oforganisationswhich do not meet this criteriastill qualify as doneeorganisationsif they are specificallylisted in Schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 7 s 9(2)(f)(iv) \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 8 s 9(2)(f)(iv) \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 9 s 9(2)(f)(iv) \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 7.DONATIONTAX STATISTICS (2023 will increase slightly as late claims are filed) 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 7.DONATIONTAX STATISTICS 11 1.Totals:The value of total donations subject to tax claims for the 2022-23 year was $1.05b.

Tax incentives for volunteering should not be adopted. 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 13 s 9(2)(f)(iv) Page 1 of 2 Tax Counsel Office Te Tari Tohutohu Tāke 55 Featherston Street PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 New Zealand T. 04 890 1500 Briefing note Reference: BN2024/347 Date: 27 August 2024 To: Revenue Advisor, Minister of Revenue – Angela Graham Private Secretary, Minister of Revenue – Helen Kuy From: Ed Oosterwijk (Group Leader, Tax Counsel Office) Subject: Public guidance – Interpretation Statement – Charities business income exemption Release of public guidance 1. The Tax Counsel Office is preparing to release an Interpretation Statement in early September about the application of the current charitable exemption for business income. The statement’s aim is to provide clarity on how the existing law applies to charities registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005 that derive business income and carry out charitable purposes in and outside New Zealand. The release is relevant for the Minister because of the level of public interest in the tax rules for charities business income as well as recent statements made by the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance about the tax rules for charities with commercial activities. Background 2. Subject to the following restrictions, broadly the Act provides an exemption for business income derived by an entity registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005. • If a registered charity carries out its charitable purposes in New Zealand and overseas it must apportion the business income it derives between those purposes in and outside New Zealand. Only the part apportioned to the charitable purposes in New Zealand is exempt. • Business income is not exempt if a person with some control over the business is able to direct or divert money away from the charity. 3. The business income exemption can be contrasted with the exemption for non- business income. Non-business income derived by a registered charity is not subject to the restrictions described in \[2\] above. 4. The charitable exemption for business income has been in place for a long time but uncertainty exists about how the exemption operates. We have raised this uncertainty with you previously (IR2024/237 para 39 refers). The income tax issues 5. Inland Revenue (IR) is aware that there is some uncertainty about how the law applies. This uncertainty includes what income is included in the charities business Page 2 of 2 income exemption (and therefore subject to the restrictions described in \[2\]) and how a tax charity with New Zealand and overseas charitable purposes apportions its business income between its charitable purposes in and outside New Zealand. 6. In December 2022, IR released an Issues Paper explaining the competing views on how the charitable exemption for business income applies and proposing an approach to how the law applies. The responses received from interested persons to this Issues Paper and the draft version of the statement that we are about to publish, helped form our view of the correct approach. 7. The statement provides guidance on what amounts are income from a business, the requirements that must be satisfied for business income to be exempt and guidance on how a charity with charitable purposes in and outside New Zealand should apportion its business income between those purposes. Industry response. 8. We do not anticipate the statement being relevant to a significant number of charities. The charities register shows about 18,000 charities reported business income / loss in 2022. The statement will be relevant to about 2,500 (14%) of these, being charities that reported carrying out a charitable purpose overseas. 9. Some charities may have interpreted the section differently to the interpretation taken in the statement. However, we expect that the number of charities in this position is low. 10. A number of interested persons who commented on the Issues Paper and draft item expressed concern regarding the complexity of the business income exemption and cost of compliance for smaller charities relative to the amount of business income derived. Providing relief for small charities, for example, by way of a de minimis, would require a legislative change and the relevant submissions have been referred to Policy for consideration. In the meantime, the statement clarifies that IR does not require a charity’s apportionment of business income between charitable purposes in and outside New Zealand to be exact to the last dollar but rather reflect what is objectively reasonable in the circumstances. Other 11. Policy have reviewed the item and are supportive of it being published. Ed Oosterwijk Group Leader, Tax Counsel Office DDI: s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a)

The rates must be increased once the cumulative value of quarterly increases in the Consumers Price Index (CPI) reaches 5% since the rates were last adjusted. 1 4.As occurred in 2022, the prescribed amount for these changes can be increased by an Order in Council (OIC), but this must be done by 1 December of the relevant year, with the change applying from 1 April of the following calendar year. There is also an ability to amend these rates via primary legislation, however, the 1 December statutory deadline still applies. 2 5.The cumulative CPI threshold released on 17 October 2023 was 5.65% from 1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023, which will automatically trigger a higher rate of WFF payment rates from 1 April 2024. 6.The FTC will be increased for the eldest child rate from $7,121 to $7,524, and the subsequent child rate from $5,802 to $6,130. The BSTC will be increased from $3,632 to $3,838. The expected fiscal costs of the CPI adjustments are included in the fiscal forecasts created in the Half-yearly Economic and Fiscal Update 2023. Next steps 7.To meet the date required by law, the OIC must be made no later than 1 December. We understand that there is a Cabinet and an Executive Council meeting scheduled on 29 November 2023. Officials recommend that the Minister of Revenue submit a Cabinet paper and associated OIC to these meetings for consideration and approval, in order to meet the statutory deadline. 8.The OIC has been prepared by the Parliamentary Counsel Office and is currently with the Cabinet Office. 1 The payment rates for the FTC and BSTC were last set in November 2022 by Order in Council incorporating inflation from 1 October 2021 to 30 September 2022. 2 There will not be a primary legislative vehicle available to make this change that would be enacted prior to 1 December.

This payment is available to families with dependent children and is not conditional on work obligations or whether they are receiving a benefit. The amount received depends on the family’s income, the number of dependent children they have and any shared care arrangements. There are approximately 264,100 recipients of the FTC. 3 10.The Best Start Tax Credit (BSTC) is a payment of $69 per week for families supporting a new-born baby and is universal for all families with new-borns in their first year. It was introduced in 2018 as part of the Families Package, replacing the Parental Tax Credit. There are approximately 137,600 recipients of the BSTC. 11.Under the Income Tax Act 2007, the FTC and BSTC payment rates must be adjusted for inflation once the cumulative value of quarterly increases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) reaches 5%. These inflation-indexed increases ensure FTC and BSTC maintain their real value over time. 12.The standard process for setting and authorising rates through an Order in Council (OIC) is set out in the Income Tax Act 2007. T he OIC must be made no later than 1 December and come into effect and apply from 1 April following that date. There is also an ability to amend these rates via primary legislation, however, the 1 December statutory deadline still applies. 4 13.Th e rates were last set by an OIC incorporating inflation up to the end of September 2022. For this report, the cumulative count of inflation starts from 1 October 2022. The 5% cumulative threshold was exceeded from 1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023 by 0.65%. This was published on 17 October 2023. This will result in a higher rate of WFF from 1 April 2024. 14.Accordingly, the adjustments to the WFF Tax Credits that will take affect from 1 April 2024 are as follows: Tax credit payment (annualised) From ($) To ($) Change ($) Family Tax Credit Approximately 264,100 recipients Eldest child rate $7,121 $136 p/w $7,524 $144 p/w $403 $8 p/w Subsequent child rate $5,802 $111 p/w $6,130 $117 p/w $328 $6 p/w Best Start Tax Credit Approximately 137,600 recipients $3,632 $69 p/w $3,838 $73 p/w $206 $4 p/w Costs included in forecasts 15.The regular index adjustments are estimated to have the following fiscal costs: 3 Recipient figures are taken from the number of Working for Families claims with non-zero entitlement during the 2022 income tax year. 4 There will not be a primary legislative vehicle available to make this change that would be enacted prior to 1 December.

It should be noted that this does not include flow-on implications to the Ministry for Social Development. More specifically, the savings for MSD administered financial assistance. Minimum Family Tax Credit 17.The Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC) provides a financial incentive to ensure low income working families remain better off financially in full time work than they would be on a main benefit. This helps support people in moving from a main benefit to full-time work. 7 18.The MFTC rate is tied to main benefit rates. That is, as main benefits will increase with either wage growth or inflation from 1 April 2024, the MFTC should also be increased, to maintain the policy intent of the payment. The confirmed method of indexing main benefits was not established in time for the MFTC adjustment to be included as part of this Order in Council process. Ministers will be asked to take decisions on the impacts of indexation on the MFTC. Officials will report to you at a later date. Ne xt steps 19.The FTC and BSTC adjustments are reflected in the drafting of the OIC which the Parliamentary Counsel Office has provided to the Cabinet Office. The title of this OIC is the Income Tax (Tax Credit) Order 2023. 20.The Cabinet paper and associated OIC will need to be lodged in time for Cabinet consideration (and the Executive Council thereafter) on Wednesday 29 November 2023. This will ensure that the OIC is published no later than 1 December. 5 An increase in the FTC entitlement rate will have a flow-on effect to increase IWTC costs because IWTC abates after FTC. This does not include the proposed increase to the IWTC of $25 per week from 1 April 2024. 6 The impairment ratio represents the amount of Working for Families debt that has been generated as a result of the overpayment of an entitlement. The impairment ratio drives the difference between cash and revenue forecasts as it represents cash paid out was Working for Families entitlements (cash) where no entitlement exists (revenue). 7 Or for sole parents, to work 20 hours or more a week. IR 2023/267: CPI indexation of the Family Tax Credit and Best Start Tax Credit Page 6 of 6 21.Inland Revenue will publish an item in its Tax Information Bulletin series informing individuals of the change in early 2024. Existing recipients will be contacted in February 2024 with an updated estimate of their WFF tax credit entitlement for the tax year beginning 1 April 2024. In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet ORDER IN COUNCIL: INCREASE IN WORKING FOR FAMILIES TAX CREDIT RATES Proposal 1This paper seeks Cabinet’s agreement to increase certain Working for Families tax credit rates, as required by the Income Tax Act 2007. Authority is sought for the Minister of Revenue to make a submission to the Executive Council on 29 November 2023 of the required Order in Council, the Income Tax (Tax Credit) Order 2023 (the Order). 2A series of adjustments to the Family Tax Credit (FTC) and Best Start Tax Credit (BSTC), which form part of the Working for Families tax credits, have been proposed to reflect annual price inflation of 5.65% since rates were last adjusted in September 2022. 3In summary, I propose that, from 1 April 2024, the: 3.1FTC rates increase: 3.1.1 For the eldest child, from $7,121 p.a. to $7,524 (i.e. from $136 to $144 per week) after tax; 3.1.2 For a subsequent child, from $5,802 p.a. to $6,130 (i.e. from $111 to $117 per week) after tax; and 3.2BSTC rate increase from $3,632 p.a. to $3,838 (i.e. from $69 to $73 per week) after tax. Policy Best Start Tax Credit and Family Tax Credit 4The Income Tax Act 2007 requires that the FTC and BSTC payment rates must be adjusted for inflation once the total value of quarterly increases in the CPI reaches 5% since the payment rates were last adjusted. 5The payment rates for the FTC and BSTC were last set in November 2022 by Order in Council incorporating inflation from 1 October 2021 to 30 September 2022. Due to the current rates of inflation, the 5% threshold was exceeded at the end of the September 2023 quarter. The annual rate of inflation from 1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023 was 5.65%. 1 2bnpvvfw8u 2023-12-04 09:14:12 Doc 2 Financial Implications 6There are no Budget allowance implications associated with adjusting the rates of Working for Families Tax Credits by inflation. The expected fiscal costs of the CPI adjustments are included in the fiscal forecasts created in the Half-yearly Economic and Fiscal Update 2023 and is expected to be $20 million lower than the estimates created for the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update 2023. Timing and 28-day rule 7The Income Tax Act 2007 requires the Order to be made no later than 1 December and to come into effect and apply from 1 April following that date. The Order therefore is in accordance with the rule that regulations must not come into force until at least 28 days after they have been notified in the New Zealand Gazette. Compliance 8The Order complies with: 8.1the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 8.2the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 8.3the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993 (if the regulations raise privacy issues, indicate whether the Privacy Commissioner agrees that they comply with all relevant principles); 8.4relevant international standards and obligations; 8.5the Legislation Guidelines (2021 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Regulations Review Committee 9The Order will be certified by Parliamentary Counsel Office as being in order for submission to Cabinet. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel Office 10Officials consider that there are no grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319. Impact analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 11The Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that that the proposals to adjust the FTC and the BSTC for inflation are exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the grounds that the Government has limited statutory decision making because it is required to make the adjustment by the Income Tax Act 2007. 2 2bnpvvfw8u 2023-12-04 09:14:12 \[ Regulatory Impact Assessment 12The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) teams has been consulted and confirms the CIPA requirements to not apply to these proposals as the threshold for significance is not met. Publicity 13Inland Revenue will publish an item in its Tax Information Bulletin series, and relevant publications and material will be updated to incorporate the new amount. The Ministry of Social Development may also update its publicly available information. 14Existing recipients will be contacted in early 2024 with an updated estimate of their Working for Families tax credits entitlement for the tax year beginning 1 April 2024. 15The Order will be published in the New Zealand Gazette. Proactive release 16I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 17The Treasury, Ministry of Social Development and Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet have been consulted on this paper. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that Cabinet: 1Note the statutory requirement that the Family Tax Credit and Best Start Tax Credit payment rates must be adjusted for inflation once the total value of quarterly increases in the CPI reaches 5% since the payment rates were last adjusted. 2Agree that the Family Tax Credit increase from: 2.1For the eldest child, $7,121 p.a. to $7,524 (i.e. from $136 to $144 per week) after tax; and 2.2For a subsequent child, from $5,802 p.a. to $6,130 (i.e. from $111 to $117 per week) after tax; 3Agree that the Best Start Tax Credit rate increase from $3,632 p.a. to $3,838 (i.e. from $69 to $73 per week) after tax; 4Authorise the submission of an Order in Council to the Executive Council at its meeting on 29 November 2023, giving effect to recommendations 2 and 3, above. 3 2bnpvvfw8u 2023-12-04 09:14:12 Authorised for lodgement Hon Simon Watts Minister of Revenue 4 2bnpvvfw8u 2023-12-04 09:14:12 CAB-23-MIN-0465 Cabinet Minute of Decision This document contains information for the New Zealand Cabinet.

A draft Cabinet paper is attached for your review. A brief history of the TPR Act 2023 2.The previous government commissioned work on developing a reporting framework on the tax system based around a series of tax principles, such as efficiency and fairness. This new reporting would supplement existing reporting under the Public Finance Act 1989 and Inland Revenue’s Annual Reports prepared under the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3.On 8 May 2023, Cabinet agreed to introduce and enact a TPR Act as a standalone piece of legislation, and noted that officials would continue to work on whether to shift some aspects of the Public Finance Act into the TPR Act, around the requirements to prepare a Revenue Strategy. 4.The TPR Act was introduced, received its first reading on 19 May 2023 and was referred to the Finance and Expenditure Committee. Submissions were considered under a truncated Select Committee process and a revised version of the Bill received its third reading under urgency on 23 August 2023. The Act received the Royal assent on 30 August 2023. The need for urgency was so officials would be required to provide their first report under the TPR Act this year. 5.The TPR Act requires officials to provide reports on the tax system as it relates to a set of tax principles by the end of each calendar year. In December 2023 and 2024 the report would be an interim version, with a more comprehensive version in 2025. The cycle of interim and comprehensive reports would repeat every three years. The reports are required to be published, with the comprehensive report required to be tabled in Parliament. Policy options and regulatory requirements 6.The repeal of the legislation may require a Regulatory Impact Statement (“RIS”) to be completed. However, we have applied for an exemption from the RIS requirements and are awaiting further advice from Treasury’s RIS team. 7.If a RIS was required, it could cover the two main options for the TPR Act: retain it (with or without amendments) or repeal it. The implications from these options are described below. IR2023/274: Repeal of the Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023 Page 2 of 4 If the TPR Act is retained 8.If the TPR Act is retained, officials will be required to provide you with an interim report by 31 December 2023. With the Christmas shutdown period this realistically means a report by 22 December 2023 at the latest. The interim report would include information on aspects of the tax system that cover the four areas set out in the legislation, namely: •Income distribution and income tax paid •Distribution of exemptions from tax and of lower rates of taxation •Perceptions of integrity of the tax system, and •Compliance with the law by taxpayers. 9.The TPR Act would then require Inland Revenue to publish the report as soon as reasonably practical afterwards. Given the Christmas shutdown period, publication would be in mid-January at the earliest. 10.Some of this information is already published at different times of the year in different locations 1 . The interim report would bring the information together in one place and provide more analysis. 11.Further reporting would occur each year, with one in three yearly reports being a more comprehensive report into the design of the tax system with a focus on longitudinal data and one-off in-depth topics. This would require resources to be devoted to its production and publication. 12.If retained, the TPR Act could be amended as required over time to align with the Government’s priorities and objectives. If the TPR Act is repealed this year 13.If the TPR Act is repealed this year, Inland Revenue would no longer be required to report on the operation of the tax system in relation to the tax principles set out in the Act. 14.Inland Revenue would continue to report on the administration of the tax system through its Annual Report process as required under the Tax Administration Act. It would also continue to report on the use of appropriations through the annual Budget process. Additional data may also be published from time to time in response to Official Information Act requests or as part of our stewardship function, depending on priorities and resources. If the TPR Act is repealed next year 15.If it is not possible to repeal the TPR Act before the end of this year, a repeal clause could be inserted into a Supplementary Order Paper to the current Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill. This would occur in March 2024. 16.As this would be after the end of this calendar year, officials would be required to provide you with an interim report on the tax system and to publish it. Work on further reports would stop once the TPR Act is repealed. 17.As part of a later repeal, some reporting aspects of the TPR Act could be consolidated into the Tax Administration Act with the remaining parts of the TPR 1 Some are published on various Inland Revenue websites, some on Treasury’s Budget website. IR2023/274: Repeal of the Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023 Page 3 of 4 Act repealed. This would authorise Inland Revenue to report on more than just the administration of the tax system, and to include additional information around the design of the tax system. Again, this would depend on priorities and resources. Over time this could address some of the concerns raised by some in the tax community about the lack of availability of some tax system information. Inland Revenue’s view 18.A reporting framework could be a valuable addition to Inland Revenue’s obligations, especially where it has broad support of a range of groups in society. However, enshrining the principles in legislation removes flexibility, and the descriptions themselves were contentious throughout policy development and at Select Committee. 19.The process also lacked tax sector consultation on the measures to be reported, which makes it more difficult to meet the objectives of the legislation. In the light of this, we recommend that you repeal the legislation. The process for repeal 20.We understand that you wish to repeal the TPR Act, and for the repeal to occur before officials are required to provide the first interim report. 21.The process to repeal the TPR Act is: •Agreement by Cabinet to repeal the TPR Act (a draft Cabinet paper is attached for your consideration) –This would need to be lodged with Cabinet Office by 7 December, considered at CBC on 13 December and confirmed by Cabinet on 18 December. –It may be possible to seek permission to go direct to Cabinet on 11 December to seek approval to repeal the TPR Act and introduce a Bill. •Cabinet to authorise the Minister, in consultation with the Leader of the House, to introduce legislation into Parliament to give effect to Cabinet’s decisions, with the Minister signing off the legislation to be introduced –Usually draft legislation would go through a separate Cabinet committee process for approval after Cabinet has approved the policy but there is precedent for combining the two processes into one especially where there are time pressures and the draft legislation is simple. •The repeal Bill will be drafted by the Inland Revenue drafting team: the repeal Bill would be short. •A Bill of Rights check by the Ministry of Justice is required (they may be busy checking a number of 100-day Bills but we do not foresee any issues with the Bill of Rights check, only the time it may take to get a response) •Preparation of supplementary material such as a legislative statement, and material to support you with the passage of the Bill through the House •The Bill to be taken through all stages under urgency (expected in the week beginning 18 December – the last sitting week), with Royal assent before 31 December 2023. \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Consultation 22.The Treasury has been consulted. Next steps 23. Next steps include: • referring a copy of the report to the Minister of Finance, • providing feedback and/or lodging the draft Cabinet paper seeking approval to repeal the TPR Act as soon as you are able, and • Inland Revenue drafting a Bill and seeking a Bill of Rights check from the Ministry of Justice. Recommended action We recommend that you: 1. agree to repeal the Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023. Agreed/Not agreed 2. agree the repeal Bill should be enacted before 31 December 2023 so the legal requirement for officials to provide an interim report this year will not apply. Agreed/Not agreed 3. approve the attached draft Cabinet paper seeking Cabinet agreement to repeal the Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023 and authorising you to introduce the Bill into Parliament, in consultation with the Leader of the House. Approved/Not approved 4.refer a copy of this report to the Minister of Finance for their information.

I propose the repeal occur before the end of the current calendar year. Relation to government priorities 2.The Government is committed to improving the quality of Government spending and regulation. Repealing the Act would focus Inland Revenue’s resources on its core business of collecting tax revenue to fund the government’s objectives, providing financial assistance and assisting taxpayers to comply with their obligations. Background 3.The previous government commissioned work on developing a reporting framework on the tax system based around a series of tax principles, such as efficiency and fairness. This would have been in addition to existing reporting required under the Public Finance Act 1989 and the Annual Reports prepared under the Tax Administration Act 1994. 4.On 8 May 2023, Cabinet agreed to proceed with the Act as a standalone piece of legislation, and noted officials would continue to work on whether to shift some aspects of the Public Finance Act 1989 into the Act (specifically, the requirement to prepare a Revenue Strategy) \[CAB-23-MIN-0160.01 refers\]. 5.The legislation was introduced and received its first reading on Budget Day, 18 May 2023 and was referred to the Finance and Expenditure Committee for consideration. It underwent a truncated Select Committee process and received its third reading under urgency on 23 August 2023. The Act received the Royal assent on 30 August 2023. 6.The Act requires Inland Revenue to provide the first interim report by the end of the calendar year after the Act commences and annual reports each subsequent year. In 2025 and every three years following, the report is to be more comprehensive and detailed and to be tabled in Parliament. This means that officials are required to provide me with a first report by 31 December 2023 unless the Act is repealed prior. Analysis 7.In my view, the Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023 is unnecessary. A reporting function does not require primary legislation and can been achieved through other Document 2 I N C O N F I D E N C E 2 I N C O N F I D E N C E means (e.g. a Cabinet direction). Devoting an entire Act to this purpose is a poor use of primary legislation. The Legislation Design and Advisory Committee also submitted on the draft legislation, saying its intent could be achieved through non-legislative arrangements. 8.The Act’s drafting is unusual for tax legislation. The Act is centred around a set of tax principles contained within its Schedule. Although the principles themselves are not unusual, some of their descriptions associated with them are unconventional and debatable. For example, they refer to the relative amounts “wealthy people” should pay in tax and presume decisions about trade-offs between the principles which are the purview of the Government of the day. 9.I would also note the Bill was considered under a truncated timeframe and did not undergo the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP) or full Select Committee consideration. The GTPP is an important stakeholder consultation process which is designed to ensure effective tax policy development and legislation. 10.The Government is committed to ensuring agencies are operating efficiently and are focused on performing their core roles. Requiring Inland Revenue to produce additional annual reports would take extra resources at a time when the Government is managing fiscal pressures and improving service delivery. 11.The operation of the Act will create administrative costs for Inland Revenue and compliance costs for taxpayers. For example, in administering the Act, Inland Revenue will be required to collect and collate new information, to prepare and publish an annual report and to regularly consult with the public on appropriate metrics. 12.In addition to these administrative costs, taxpayers will incur compliance costs in adjusting their systems to collect and supply new data, and in devoting time and resources to engaging with Inland Revenue. Concern with the compliance implications was a strong theme in Select Committee submissions. I believe the resources of these businesses can be put to better use contributing to the growth of the economy. 13.If the Act is repealed this year, Inland Revenue will not be required to publish and engage with the public on its first report, nor will it need to establish the processes necessary to ensure the reporting framework operates over the coming years. Instead, Inland Revenue’s resources will be focused on its core role of collecting tax and contributing to the achievement of the Government’s tax plans to be delivered in the coming year. 14.Finally, I note Inland Revenue has a stewardship function mandated under the Public Service Act 2020. As part of that function, I expect Inland Revenue to ensure that the tax system remains up-to-date and to publish material encouraging public debate on the tax system. Inland Revenue will be providing advice to me as part of the upcoming refresh of the Tax and Social Policy Work Programme which could include recommendations for future work in this area. Cost-of-living Implications 15.The repeal of the Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023 does not have cost of living implications. I N C O N F I D E N C E 3 I N C O N F I D E N C E Financial Implications 16.As the Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023 was to be funded from existing departmental baselines, no fiscal implications arise from its repeal. Legislative Implications 17.Repealing the Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023 will require a short repeal Bill to be introduced into the House and go through all stages under urgency before the end of this year. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Statement 18.The Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that the proposal to repeal the Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023 is exempt from the requirement to provide a new Regulatory Impact Statement. This exemption is granted on the grounds that the relevant issues have already been addressed by existing Impact Analysis produced when the policy decisions were taken \[CAB-23-MIN-0160.01 refers\]. This exemption is conditional on Inland Revenue producing a coversheet that provides assurance that the analysis is still applicable and provides any additional or updated analysis where relevant, and Inland Revenue's quality assurance panel certifying it is fit for purpose. 19.The previously completed Regulatory Impact Statement and coversheet analysis are attached in the Appendix. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 20.The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as it not expected to result in any significant, direct emissions impacts. Population Implications 21.There are no direct population implications associated with the repeal of the Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023. Human Rights 22.The repeal of the Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023 does not present Human Rights implications. Consultation 23.Inland Revenue has consulted with the Treasury on the proposed repeal of the Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023. I N C O N F I D E N C E 4 I N C O N F I D E N C E Communications 24.I intend to announce the repeal through a press release when the Bill is introduced to Parliament or just prior. Proactive Release 25.I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers, in line with the provisions of the Official Information 1982, within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Recommendations I recommend that the Cabinet Business Committee: 1 Note that repeal before the end of this calendar year will ensure that Inland Revenue is not required to provide the Minister of Revenue with an interim report. 2 Agree that the Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023 be repealed. 3 Authorise of the Minister of Revenue to, after consultation with the Leader of the House, introduce a Bill giving effect to recommendation 2 above. Authorised for lodgement Minister of Revenue IN CONFIDENCE Document 3 CBC-23-MIN-0025 Cabinet Business Committee Minute of Decision This document contains information for the New Zealand Cabinet. It must be treated in confidence and handled in accordance with any security classification, or other endorsement.

� Inland Revenue � � Te Tari Taake Taxation Principles Reporting Act: Annual Report December 2023 Policy and regulatory stewardship Inland Revenue Version \[draft\] � Inland Revenue � a.' Te Tari Taake Tax principles interim annual report draft Page 2 of 32 Tax principles interim annual report draft Taxation Principles Reporting Act: interim report Background Over the past three decades there have been several working groups formed to comment on how to improve the tax system. They tend to form their advice for change around principles of efficiency, fairness, simplicity and cohesiveness in the tax system. The Taxation Principles Reporting Act ("the Act"), enacted in August 2023, requires the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to provide the Minister of Revenue with a report on New Zealand's current tax settings in relation to a set of tax principles. The principles are assessed through the approved taxation principles measurements in section 12 of the Act. The objective of this report This inaugural report provides information on the tax principles that underpin the design of a tax system. It does not offer any judgement on whether the current New Zealand tax system achieves those principles. This report is intended to help inform conversations and debate by providing relevant data in one place. The reporting obligations The Act stipulates that the report produced by Inland Revenue must take one of two forms and be either an "interim" report or a "full" report (with the "full" version being required once every three years, beginning in 2025). This hybrid reporting model was designed to ensure that available annual data is captured and reported, while ensuring that departmental resources for more comprehensive reporting are used efficiently with less frequent reporting. This inaugural report is an interim report. Unless otherwise specified, we have used data from tax years where we have complete records. The most recent year for which we have complete records is the tax year ending (for most taxpayers) 31 March 2022. � Inland Revenue � a.' Te Tari Taake Page 3 of 32 Tax principles interim annual report draft What are tax principles? Tax principles are generally understood as the overarching values or aims which a tax system should pursue. These inform the tax policy frameworks which economists, tax professionals and policy makers use to develop and evaluate tax policy proposals. Trade-offs are usually required between the principles. Some of the tax principles in Schedule 1 of the Act can be traced back to at least Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, while others are more recent innovations. Efficiency The principle of efficiency provides that revenue should be raised at the least possible social cost to society. Ultimately, regardless of whether they are levied on companies, transactions, individuals or families, taxes are paid by people. The social cost of taxation is at a minimum when the only cost of raising a dollar is the dollar paid from the person ultimately bearing the cost of the tax. Efficiency costs are from people changing their behaviour 1 in response to a tax. Taxpayers lose more than just the tax revenue raised. They lose the surplus they were receiving from any activity curtailed by the tax. This is a net loss to society not compensated by the tax revenue collected. Equity Horizontal equity The concept of horizontal equity provides that people in similar positions should be treated similarly. This implies that people who earn similar amounts of income should pay a similar proportion of their income in tax. Whether a country's tax system is regarded as horizontally equitable between two people will depend in part on judgments about whether these people are in similar positions. Vertical equity Vertical equity provides that people in different positions should be treated differently. A common perspective is that this means that people with higher incomes should pay a higher proportion of their income in tax than those with lower income. This is known as progressivity and is observed when the average rate of tax rises as income increases. Revenue integrity 1 Assuming that the tax is not an externality tax designed to discourage activities with spillover costs. Our income and consumption taxes are not these sorts of taxes. � Inland Revenue � a.' Te Tari Taake Page 4 of 32 Tax principles interim annual report draft This concept looks at how reliably the tax system is able to raise the level of revenue required to meet the government's expenditure programme over the longer term. This includes the tax system's contribution to whether the government can respond to unexpected events through sustainable fiscal strategy. It also looks at whether the taxes are applied fairly and with integrity, or whether there are large gaps or lack of enforcement that means some groups do not contribute to the tax system when they should. Compliance and administration costs Compliance costs refer to the costs which taxpayers incur in meeting their tax obligations (for example, the price of seeking professional services). These costs include non-monetary costs (e.g. the time and stress which taxpayers incur in determining and meeting their obligations). Administration costs are the costs faced by a tax authority (e.g. Inland Revenue) in administering the tax system. Both categories of costs should be minimised as far as possible. For a tax authority, minimising costs ensures that public funds are used efficiently. For taxpayers, it lowers the total costs of meeting their liabilities. Certainty and predictability The principles of certainty and predictability refer to the ability of taxpayers to reliably determine their tax liabilities in advance. This can have important implications for investors' willingness to make long-term decisions, which will in turn affect the level of economic activity within a jurisdiction. As it is difficult to measure the level of certainty and predictability within a jurisdiction directly, discussion of this principle often occurs with reference to qualitative information. Flexibility and adaptability The principles of flexibility and adaptability are about tax systems keeping pace with technological and commercial developments. Although the structural features of a tax system should be enduring, it is important that a tax system is flexible enough to allow governments to respond to changes within society. 2 This could include changes in technology and business models and changes in society, such as aging population and changes in international mobility. 2 OECD.

Te Tari Taake Page 5 of 32 Tax principles interim annual report draft Assessing the principles As it is difficult to assess some principles directly, the Act describes the categories of information which are relevant to the principles. This was designed to allow the report's authors to report relevant information without limiting the tools at their disposal. The measurements specified in section 12 of the Act to be used are: • Income distribution and income tax paid • Distribution of exemptions from tax and of lower rates of taxation • Perceptions of integrity of the tax system, and • Compliance with the law by taxpayers. This report addresses each in turn. Income distribution and income tax paid The principle to which this measurement most closely relates is equity. In particular, the income distribution and the amount of income tax paid provides a measure of progressivity, which in turn informs judgments about vertical equity. Progressivity in taxation has a specific technical definition: it is achieved when the average tax rate increases as income increases. New Zealand's tax system achieves its progressivity through increasing marginal tax rates. By applying increasing marginal tax rates, average tax rates increase as taxable incomes increase. This ensures that those with higher taxable incomes face higher average tax rates - they contribute a proportionally larger share of their income to taxes. When average tax rates increase, a tax system is said to be "progressive". Some level of progressivity is desirable because it supports vertical equity. Vertical equity is the concept that taxpayers with different levels of ability to pay should be taxed differently, aligning tax liabilities more closely with individuals' financial capabilities. Before looking at marginal income tax rates and their impact, it is important to understand the broader taxable income distribution in New Zealand, as represented in Figure 1 below. The graph shows the distribution of taxable income up to $300,000. This captures 99.3% of taxpayers and 92. 7% of personal taxable income. Taxable income itself is defined by tax law and is not the same as economic income, although there will be a s ignificant overlap of the two concepts. 3 3 The standard economic definition of income used in public economics is the Haig-Simons' definition. This defines income as the increase in wealth plus consumer spending over a given period of time (e.g. a year). See R.M. Haig. (1921) The Concept of Income-Economic and Legal Aspects R. M. Haig (Ed.), The Federal Income Tax (pp. 1-28). New York: Columbia University Press., and Simons, H. C. (1938). Personal Income Taxation: The Definition of Income as a Problem of Fiscal Policy. Columbia University Press. Inland Revenue's recent High-wealth individuals research project � Inland Revenue � a.' Te Tari Taake Page 6 of 32 Tax principles interim annual report draft It is important to note that certain spikes tend to dominate the graph. These spikes are due to specific income amounts paid to a lot of people (such as those at the level of universal New Zealand Superannuation payments) and the graph should be interpreted with this context in mind.

Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake Page 7 of 32 Tax principles interim annual report draft Figure 2 below shows how the marginal income tax rates and thresholds create an upward sloping average tax rate for the taxable income range of $0 - $300,000. Figure 2: Average tax rates rise as income increases 35.0 30.0 25.0 20.0 15.0 10.0 5.0 0.0 Average tax rates from 2012 - 2022 32.3% Over time, as incomes grow through inflation or real increases, average tax rates increase unless the marginal tax rate structure is changed. Progressivity falls unless thresholds are adjusted upwards. We can see the particular effect that strong inflation can have by looking at the change in distribution of taxpayers' incomes from 2012 - 2017, as compared with the change in 2017 - 2022. Figure 3 shows the distribution of taxpayers' salary and wage incomes for 2012, 2017, and 2022, with the average tax rate of the most common regularly employed worker highlighted. 4 From 2012 to 2017, the average tax rate of the most common income of a regularly employed worker increased by 0.1 percentage points. But from 2017 to 2022 it increased by 1.2 percentage points. The significant increase is because the peak that includes the most common regularly employed worker shifts to the higher marginal tax rate of 30%. The average tax rate then increases rapidly as incomes rise from there and marginal income is taxed at 30% instead of 17.5%. 4 Looking only at salary and wage income removes the large spikes associated with particular government payments like NZ Superannuation and other taxable welfare payments.

Whether that improves or worsens vertical equity depends on a view about how much progressivity is desirable. Progressivity and the distribution of tax paid Some commentators use the percentage of tax revenue contributed by a segment of taxpayers to indicate progressivity. However, rising average tax rates provides a more accurate measure, because the percentage of tax paid is not a measure of progressivity unless we know the proportion of taxable income earned by each segment (i.e. the underlying distribution of the tax base). For example, in 2022, as shown in Figure 4 below, the top decile of taxable income earners paid 44 percent of personal income taxes. But this does not offer a complete picture of progressivity. Such a distribution could also result from a flat tax system if the top decile of taxpayers received 44 percent of the total taxable income. Figure 4 captures both tax paid and taxable income earned, showing the top decile earned 33 percent of total taxable income. The combination of these (paying 44 percent of total personal income tax, earning 33 percent of total taxable income), is a better indicator of progressivity than the 44 percent measure by itself. � Inland Revenue � a.' Te Tari Taake Page 10 of 32 Tax principles interim annual report draft Note that many of those in decile one have losses 5 • Figure 4: Taxable income earned and income tax paid by each decile TAX PAID I TAXABLE INCOME EARNED a, E 8 -= a, "' X "' � 8 12% 13% 7 �11% 6--6% ........ 9% 5 - 4% --- 7% 4 aiis% 3 a.64% 2 1. % 3% i I o % I 1% 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 44% 33% 35% 40% 45% 50% There are two further factors relevant to progressivity. First, if the tax base could be altered to better reflect taxpayers' actual ability to pay, the system's progressivity might be more effectively realised. In New Zealand, the major debate relevant here is whether realised capital gains should be included in the tax base. 5 We have also removed from the distribution people with an automated annual square-up of tax withheld at source whose total taxable income was less than $100. These are often children or others whose only taxable income is from a small balance in an interest-bearing bank account. Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake Page 11 of 32 Tax principles interim annual report draft Second, taxpayers who are more able to control their taxable income 6 might do so to remain below higher tax thresholds. This is evident in the observable "bunching" at certain income levels. An example of "bunching" can be seen in the graph below. Figure S: Reported incomes bunch at the threshold of $180,000 after the introduction of the 39% rate � 7,000 a, "' "' 6,000 ::, ·:;; 5,000 a, 4,000 ::, 3,000 BEFORE the 39% rate was introduced, numbers of taxpayers reporting higher 2,000 incomes tend to decline as incomes rise, with some variability 1,000 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 N' ID' g '$ �-.,.. .,.. .... .... .... .... .... = = = = = Taxable income 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 ,-; ir, o' q-' ,..\_ ,..\_ 00 00 .... .... .... .... = = = = AFTER the 39% rate was introduced, we see a significant spike in numbers of taxpayers reporting income close to the threshold 0 0 0 8 8 8 (¥J N' ID' 00 a, a, .... .... .... = = = 0 8 8 N = 2022 tax year 2021 tax year Prior to the introduction of the 39% personal income tax rate, the number of taxpayers reporting higher incomes tended to decline (albeit with some variation in the data). However, following the introduction of the 39% rate in the 2021-22 income tax year, there was a "spike" in the numbers of taxpayers reporting income just below the $180,000 threshold. This suggests that some taxpayers are structuring their income to avoid paying the 39% rate of tax. 6 For example, those taxpayers who operate a business through a company and can control the timing and amount of shareholder salaries and dividends. Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake Page 12 of 32 Tax principles interim annual report draft Distribution of exemptions and lower rates Tax exemptions and lower rates of taxation for specified groups or activities are similar to government spending. These mechanisms, broadly categorised as "tax expenditures", represent the government's financial commitments through the tax system, benefiting various social or business segments. Exemptions and lower rates are relevant to the principles of both equity and efficiency. The link to equity is the implications for vertical and horizonal equity if some taxpayers receive exemptions or lower tax rates. The efficiency question is whether having higher taxes on some taxpayers to raise enough revenue so that others can have lower taxes or be exempt results in higher total costs from taxation than a more neutral system. But also relevant is whether exemptions in any particular case are justified because the compliance and administration costs are higher for those particular taxpayers receiving the exemption. The Treasury regularly provides an annual tax expenditure statement as part of the budget process. There are different ways of categorising tax expenditures. In the annual tax expenditure statement they are categorised into "social", "business", and "other". To provide further information about their distribution, we present an alternative categorisation of tax expenditures: • in the nature of welfare payments, • to encourage private charity, • to internalise "spillovers", and • to promote particular activi ties or industries.7 Only some of the tax expenditures are quantified in the annual tax expenditure statement. This is because some expenditures (particularly those that are tax credits) require information to be provided to Inland Revenue while others do not. In this report, we take a closer look at tax expenditures: in the nature of welfare payments, to encourage private charity, and to internalise "spillovers" through subsidies. This last category is motivated by situations where the full benefit of an activity is not captured by the parties to a transaction. In this case, the level of the activity will be inefficiently low. It will be inefficiently low because the parties do not face the wider marginal benefits and costs of their activity. Total benefits for wider society could be increased by subsidising the activity. The usual example given of this (and the primary activity of this nature subsidised through the tax system in New Zealand) is research and development expendi ture. 7 This includes activities or industries where the tax expenditure is to reduce compliance costs. � Inland Revenue � a.' Te Tari Taake Page 13 of 32 Tax principles interim annual report draft Tax expenditures in the nature of welfare payments were falling until 2018 An example of "tax expenditure" is the use of welfare focused tax credits. The graph below shows tax expenditure through Working for Families Tax Credits and the Independent Earner's Tax Credit. This declined from the 2013-14 financial year until the family income package was introduced in the 2018-19 financial year, which raised abatement thresholds. This lifted expenditure briefly before it began to decline again.

It allows registered charities to operate without paying income tax. 2. Donations tax credit and deductions: This category includes the donations tax credit for individuals and the deductions available to companies and Maori authorities for donations to registered donee organisations.

This credit aims to increase company spending on R&D by reducing the cost of R&D faced by companies. The logic behind this is that there are spillover benefits not captured by firms undertaking R&D. Because of this, firms will do an inefficiently low amount of R&D. This tax expenditure has risen significantly since the introduction of the tax credit in the 2018/19 financial year, with over $1.4 billion claimed since the tax credit first became available.

Taxpayer perceptions influence taxpayer compliance, which in turn affects the government's ability to raise revenue. However, perceptions of integrity are also clearly related to equity (and people's perceptions of it) and efficiency. Because taxpayers' behaviour is influenced by their perception of others' behaviour, a tax system will be more efficient when it has integrity and people understand that others comply with their obligations and cannot step around tax rules. This is because taxpayers will spend less resources trying to avoid or evade obligations. In addition, a high integrity system will require fewer resources to ensure taxpayers meet their obligations, lowering administration costs. Perceptions of integrity have been stable over time The information below shows the results of Inland Revenue's Customer Experience and Perceptions survey over the last four years. The metrics are broadly stable, but some have declined slightly over the past four years. However, in some cases, signs of recovery are evident in the most recent quarterly data. Taxpayers' trust in the tax system rose 10% in the July - September 2023, suggesting a recovery from the fall in the preceding quarter. 8 Figure 10: Trust in the tax system has fallen slightly fallen over the past four years 100 90 80 70 60 "-.,,/ 60 so 40 30 20 10 0 8 Respondents are asked about the extent to which they trust Inland Revenue and provided with a seven-point scale (1 being do not trust Inland Revenue at all, 7 being trust Inland Revenue completely). The percentage of those who scored Inland Revenue between 5-7 is reflected in the graph above. � Inland Revenue � a.'

Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake Page 18 of 32 Tax principles interim annual report draft Taxpayers' perceptions of consequences for taxpayers who do not meet their obligations have declined slightly but remain largely consistent. Figure 13: Perceptions of consequences for taxpayers 100 90 80 70 60 so 40 30 20 10 0 Compliance with the law 75 This measurement relates to revenue integrity, efficiency, and compliance and administration costs. High compliance with the law improves revenue integrity, increases efficiency, and reduces compliance and administration costs. Comprehensive data on compliance with the law is difficult to collect but disputes are falling Disputes Disputes refer to disagreements between taxpayers and Inland Revenue. These can be initiated by Inland Revenue following audit activity, or by taxpayers in filing a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NoPA). In each case, either Inland Revenue or the taxpayer will have disagreed with the tax position taken by the other party. The frequency and value of disputes can have important implications for such principles as efficiency, compliance and administrative costs, and certainty. However, drawing clear conclusions from the number of open disputes at any one time can be challenging. For example, a large number of open disputes could be interpreted as the tax environment being uncertain and creating the ambiguity necessary to allow large numbers of disputes to arise. Or, it could be interpreted as an increased focus on compliance activity on the part of Inland Revenue, or a greater inclination to engage in disputes on the part of taxpayers. � Inland Revenue � a.' Te Tari Taake Page 19 of 32 Tax principles interim annual report draft The graph below shows the number of open disputes since July 2020. These are disputes which have been initiated by either the taxpayer or Inland Revenue and which have not proceeded to litigation. Figure 14: The number of open dispute cases has declined 350 300 250 200 150 100 so 0 182 In general, there is a trend toward a reduction in the number of open disputes. This could be due to a range of factors, including the impact of Inland Revenue's Business Transformation Programme, COVID-19 disruptions and the resulting focus less on compliance activity when taxpayers have got things wrong, and more on designing systems to try to get things "right from the start".

Some of this has been the temporary shift in effort from back-end compliance activities to support COVID-19 and cost-of­ living initiatives. This is expected to change in future as more resources become available for investigation work.

Regulatory Impact Statement | 1 Regulatory Impact Statement: Crypto-asset Reporting Framework Covers heet Purpose of Document Decision sought: Analysis produced for the purpose of informing final Cabinet decisions Advising agencies: Inland Revenue Proposing Ministers: Minister of Revenue Date finalised: 8 May 2024 Problem Definition Inland Revenue currently has a lack of visibility over income derived through cryptoassets. This presents a tax compliance risk as taxpayers could underreport or conceal income they generate through these assets. This proposal seeks to improve tax compliance regarding cryptoassets. Executive Summary Overview Cryptoassets are digital representations of value that can be transferred, stored or traded electronically. Instead of relying on a financial institution to verify transactions, cryptoasset transactions are confirmed by computers operating on the cryptoasset’s network. This is known as distributed ledger technology. Blockchain is a form of this technology. In almost all cases, the disposal of cryptoassets is taxable in New Zealand. Disposals include selling cryptoassets for money, exchanging one cryptoasset for another type of cryptoasset and using cryptoassets to pay for goods or services. The characteristics of cryptoassets pose unique challenges for tax administrations from a tax compliance perspective, as they can be stored and transferred in a decentralised manner, without reliance on traditional financial intermediaries. This has given rise to a new set of intermediaries, such as cryptoasset exchanges and wallet providers, that are subject to little regulatory oversight. The Financial Markets Authority in New Zealand does not regulate cryptoassets, and only regulates cryptoasset issuers or providers to the extent that a product they are offering meets existing definitions for financial products and services. Cryptoassets are also similarly unregulated in other jurisdictions. These factors mean that tax authorities do not have visibility over incomes derived through cryptoassets, like they do with incomes derived through more traditional sources (such as employment income, investment income, and income from financial institutions. For example, Inland Revenue receives regular income information from employers and investment income payers. New Zealand has also implemented the OECD Common Reporting Standard (CRS) which imposes information gathering and reporting obligations on financial institutions in relation to financial account information, and this information is shared with tax authorities in participating jurisdictions.) Most OECD countries have indicated that they will implement the CARF. Regulatory Impact Statement | 2 Along with the implementation of CARF, the OECD also approved a set of amendments to the CRS in order to bring new financial assets, digital financial products, and intermediaries in scope, because they are potential alternatives to traditional financial products. The amendments include an optional election to report under the CRS the information on certain assets that has to be reported under the CARF to minimise duplicated reporting. Option 1 – Status quo (no action) Under the status quo, Inland Revenue would not receive any information in respect of income derived by New Zealand residents through offshore cryptoasset intermediaries. This is because these intermediaries are not subject to NZ legislation and information demand powers under the Tax Administration Act 1994. Inland Revenue would receive information from New Zealand intermediaries on an ad-hoc basis when utilising these information demand powers but would not receive regular income information from these intermediaries. Under the status quo, Inland Revenue would be reliant on self-reporting by taxpayers of their cryptoasset income and on those taxpayers being aware of their tax obligations (essentially voluntary compliance). Advantages of taking no action Inland Revenue would not need to make necessary system changes to process and analyse a largescale information exchange. Cryptoasset intermediaries would not have to make the necessary system changes to allow for regular exchanges of information. Disadvantages of taking no action The visibility that Inland Revenue has over incomes derived through cryptoassets would remain limited and this would present cryptoasset users with increased opportunity to conceal incomes from Inland Revenue (it effectively relies on voluntary compliance). Ad hoc information requests also arguably impose a greater compliance burden on cryptoasset intermediaries rather than a standardised international schema. As noted above, as of 8 May 2024 most OECD countries have signalled that they intend to implement the CARF (more than 50 jurisdictions have publicly committed to implementing the CARF by signing up to a joint statement supporting its implementation.)Taking no action may have negative reputational impacts on New Zealand Option 2 – OECD Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (the OECD) has developed a Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) that will require intermediaries, such as cryptoasset exchanges, brokers and dealers, to provide tax authorities with income information in respect of users operating through them. Further details on the CARF will be provided in section 2 of this regulatory impact statement. The CARF will be subject to an international information exchange framework. This means that jurisdictions that receive information on the activities of cryptoasset users under the CARF will be required to share that information with tax authorities of other countries that have also implemented the CARF, to the extent that the information relates to persons resident in that jurisdiction. Similarly, tax authorities will also receive information from other jurisdictions’ tax authorities where the rules have been implemented. Advantages of OECD CARF Implementing the CARF in New Zealand domestic legislation will achieve the intended policy objectives of improving Inland Revenue’s visibility over incomes derived through cryptoassets by NZ tax residents, and thereby supports greater tax compliance. Regulatory Impact Statement | 3 One clear advantage of this OECD-led solution is that it promotes a standardised schema with significant buy in and consultation having been undertaken with cryptoasset intermediaries themselves. This standardised schema reduces compliance costs for intermediaries, compared to responding to ad-hoc requests for information from many different tax authorities. Further, if jurisdictions designed their own rules, the variations between jurisdictions would result in increased compliance costs for cryptoasset intermediaries that had to design their information systems to satisfy the requirements of multiple bespoke rules. This solution also leverages existing technological frameworks that have been implemented by tax authorities worldwide for the automatic exchange of information of financial account information, as seen recently in the context of the gig and sharing economy. Limitations of the OECD CARF The success of the information flows from the CARF is dependent on other countries signing up for improved information flows. This is because information will only be shared among tax authorities whose countries have implemented the rules (that is, if New Zealand implemented the rules, Inland Revenue would only receive information from other tax authorities that were also subject to the rules). This will not be much of an issue in practice, as the CARF initiative is a global minimum standard, which means all OECD countries are required to implement it. To date, over 50 jurisdictions have publicly committed to implementing the CARF by signing up to a joint statement supporting its implementation. Option 3 – Bespoke rules The third option considered is for the NZ Government to design and implement its own rules to require cryptoasset exchanges, brokers and dealers to provide information on NZ resident users directly to Inland Revenue. Advantages of bespoke rules One theoretical advantage of developing bespoke rules is that NZ could prescribe the data we wanted to collect from cryptoasset intermediaries along with the frequency and timing of this information. The purpose of collecting this information is to undertake compliance work to ensure New Zealanders who derive income through cryptoassets are complying with their tax obligations. The information prescribed to be shared by the OECD CARF is fit for purpose in this regard and therefore there would be no advantage in practice from developing bespoke rules. Disadvantage of bespoke rules One key disadvantage of a bespoke solution is that it would be difficult for New Zealand to collect data from non-resident cryptoasset intermediaries with NZ users. This is because our domestic law would be unenforceable, and information requests would be sitting outside the internationally agreed OECD framework which has received a large degree of buy-in across many jurisdictions. This is a significant disadvantage given approximately 80% of NZ cryptoasset users’ activity is undertaken through offshore exchanges. Moreover, the CARF is a global minimum standard, and this means all OECD countries are expected to implement it. It follows that if NZ were to elect to implement a bespoke regime that could undermine our participation at the OECD. A bespoke solution for NZ would also increase compliance costs for cryptoasset intermediaries (to the extent that it is enforceable) and could result in a reduced appetite for them allowing NZ users to operate through them. A bespoke regime would also take much Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 longer to implement as a more extensive consultation would be required (noting that under the OECD solution a lot of this work has been done). Option 4 – annual disclosure regime Similar to the annual disclosure that is required under current law in respect of foreign shares, Inland Revenue could require owners of cryptoassets to provide information on their holdings on an annual basis. Advantages of an annual disclosure regime One theoretical advantage of an annual disclosure regime is that it does not require intermediaries to provide tax authorities with information in respect of cryptoassets. This lowers compliance costs for intermediaries. Disadvantages of an annual disclosure regime An annual disclosure regime levies compliance costs on individuals that hold cryptoassets. This is arguably inefficient as the provision of information can more effectively be dealt with by intermediaries who are larger, more sophisticated and have the technological systems in place to process thousands of transactions in real time. Another key disadvantage of an annual disclosure regime is that it relies on voluntary compliance by individual holders of cryptoassets. This would not necessarily translate to increased tax compliance and therefore would not fulfil the policy objectives. This is because individuals who would comply with a disclosure regime are likely to be individuals who would also comply with their tax obligation anyway. Option 2 is the preferred option. Impact of the preferred option The primary purpose of the OECD CARF is to improve tax authorities’ visibility over incomes derived by users through cryptoasset intermediaries. This visibility is important as cryptoassets operate outside the traditional financial system and have given rise to a new form of intermediary (such as exchange and wallet providers). 1 The OECD CARF creates a standardised information exchange framework to minimise compliance costs for cryptoasset intermediaries. The information that Inland Revenue would receive from other tax authorities under the CARF will reduce the ability for cryptoasset holders in NZ to successfully conceal or under- report income derived through these assets. This information will be used by Inland Revenue to ensure tax compliance and also monitor for any high-risk activity or behaviours that may be symptomatic of fraud or illegal activity (due to their decentralised and somewhat anonymous nature, cryptoassets can be used to facilitate illegal activities). In terms of specific impacts, the following parties are affected in the following ways: 1. Cryptoasset intermediaries that are subject to the CARF: These intermediaries will need to provide information to tax authorities about the activity of users on their platforms (although this will be covered later on in this regulatory impact statement, this will include reporting on crypto-to-crypto transactions, crypto-to-fiat transactions 1 Cryptoasset exchanges facilitate the purchase, sale and exchange of cryptoassets for other cryptoassets or fiat currencies. Wallet providers offer digital wallets which individuals can use to store their cryptoassets. Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 and relevant transfers). Cryptoasset intermediaries will also be required to gather and report personal information on their users. As this is a significant reporting obligation, cryptoasset intermediaries will be required to invest in developing the necessary systems. It is anticipated that there are several cryptoasset exchanges in New Zealand that would fall within the CARF. 2. Users of cryptoasset intermediaries: Reduced opportunities to conceal income derived through cryptoasset intermediaries. As transactions will be under increased scrutiny and subject to reporting, this may also change behaviour of the small percentage of users who may utilise cryptoassets for illicit activities (this is because patterns of behaviours that suggest a risk of illicit activity will be more readily identifiable by authorities). Cryptoasset intermediary users may also have to provide some additional personal information or identifying details to these intermediaries to the extent that isn’t already covered by AML regulations. 3. Inland Revenue: Changes will be required to Inland Revenue’s START system to ensure that the information received from cryptoasset intermediaries and other tax authorities is aligned with the OECD’s schema. There will be additional ongoing administration costs to support the information exchange with other tax authorities (ensuring the data meets appropriate data quality standards). Additional compliance resource will be needed to analyse the information received under the CARF in order to determine whether profits derived through cryptoassets are income, and therefore subject to tax. Consultation The OECD released a public consultation document on the CARF in March 2022 which included a draft version of the rules and specific questions for submitters. This consultation closed 29 April 2022. Approximately 80 submissions were received, primarily from tax advisory firms, banks and large cryptoasset exchanges. These were published on the OECD website. Inland Revenue also undertook a round of targeted consultation on the proposed implementation of the CARF. This involved sending a letter to cryptoasset intermediaries potentially impacted by any reporting regime. The letter consulted on both implementing the CARF in New Zealand and sought thoughts on adopting a bespoke regime. Submitters were largely supportive of an OECD-led solution and recognised the benefit of a standardised international solution in minimising compliance costs for reporting crypto-asset service providers. The main concern raised by submitters was ensuring that there was sufficient lead in time to allow reporting entities to make the necessary system changes to be able to comply with the CARF.

Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, the market for cryptoassets worldwide has experienced fast growth and development. There are currently almost 21,000 cryptoassets with a market capitalisation of almost US$4 trillion dollars. The technological innovations brought about by the growth of cryptoassets and blockchain technology has also led to the development of new products such as decentralised finance, non-fungible tokens, and the Metaverse. Between 6% to 10% of New Zealanders own some cryptocurrency, according to three different online surveys which were conducted in 2022. 2 Inland Revenue’s analytics show that 80% of cryptoasset activity by New Zealanders is undertaken through offshore exchanges. The characteristics of cryptoassets pose unique challenges for tax administrations from a tax compliance perspective. Cryptoassets utilise cryptography and can be stored and transferred in a decentralised manner without reliance on traditional financial intermediaries. 3 This has given rise to a new set of intermediaries, such as cryptoasset exchanges and wallet providers, that are subject to little regulatory oversight. In many cases, the intermediary will be located in a different jurisdiction to its users, and it is difficult for tax authorities to obtain information about their tax residents if this information is held offshore. Inland Revenue does not receive regular information on income derived through cryptoassets (like it does from banks or employers in respect of investment income or salary and wages or under the OECD Common Reporting Standard (CRS) on financial account information from international financial intermediaries).

Survey conducted January 2022; Finder Cryptocurrency adoption index, August 2022. 3 Cryptography is a digital process of using algorithms to validate messages and transactions in order to secure digital information against unauthorised access or corruption. Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 is through ad hoc information demands under Inland Revenue’s information gathering powers in the Tax Administration Act 1994, and these information demands can only be applied to cryptoasset intermediaries that are operating in NZ and therefore subject to NZ law. There are mechanisms to request information through tax treaties from other jurisdictions but these can be impractical and difficult to apply on a regular basis. This means that Inland Revenue currently lacks sufficient visibility over incomes derived through cryptoassets and is reliant on voluntary compliance by taxpayers. Increased information flows are required to support tax compliance and ensure that individuals pay the correct amount of tax. This will also provide Inland Revenue with the opportunity to further educate taxpayers on what their tax obligations are with respect to cryptoassets. Inland Revenue receives regular employment and investment income information from employers and banks, and this is generally used to pre-populate income tax returns. Taxpayers in these circumstances will typically confirm that the information that is pre-populated in their income tax returns is correct and can make adjustments if necessary. This reduces their compliance costs as they do not need to collate information about their income earned from various sources and can instead rely on information that has already been provided to Inland Revenue. As the world becomes more digitalised and connected, it is commonplace for income to be derived and facilitated through large platforms or institutions. The OECD has led and co- ordinated measures to ensure that tax authorities retain visibility over incomes generated through such means. Examples include the OECD Common Reporting Standard (CRS), which facilitates the automatic exchange of financial account information between tax authorities, and more recently, the OECD initiative on the taxation of the gig and sharing economy, which requires digital platforms to provide tax authorities with income information in respect of sellers operating through these platforms. Cryptoasset intermediaries are similar to employers, banks, digital platforms and other third parties that hold information that is useful for tax administration purposes. This includes information about the profits derived through cryptoassets. This information would be useful for Inland Revenue if it were available on a regular basis, as it would ensure that sellers were declaring the income they earn through these assets. Cryptoasset intermediaries are generally sophisticated and have business models that allow them to accurately track and process millions of transactions. Because these intermediaries operate in many different countries it is desirable from their perspective that any requirement to provide tax authorities with information about sellers that use their platform is simple to understand and comply with, whilst minimising compliance costs to the extent possible. Given the growth of cryptoassets (which currently have a combined market capitalisation of almost 4 trillion USD, compared to just 17 billion USD at the start of 2017), it is appropriate that the Government consider ways in which it can increase visibility over incomes derived through cryptoassets by New Zealand residents. The OECD have developed a CARF that jurisdictions can implement. The CARF provides for the collection and automatic exchange of information on cryptoassets. Under the CARF, entities that facilitate exchange transactions on behalf of customers (Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Providers) will be required to provide tax authorities with information regarding transactions in Relevant Crypto-Assets by Reportable Users. At a high level, Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Providers must collect and report personal information (such as the name, address, date of birth and tax identification number) for all its Reportable Users, along with aggregate level data on all Relevant Crypto-asset transactions Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 in relation to each Reportable User. This data includes information on crypto-to-crypto transactions, crypto-to-fiat transactions and transfers of relevant cryptoassets (such as to a wallet address) broken down by relevant asset. The CARF also includes various valuation and currency translation rules, such as specifying that the amount paid or received is reported in the FIAT currency in which it was reported or received. Crypto-Asset Service Providers will also be required to follow a self-certification process in respect of each user to determine whether that user is a reportable user. In short, this requires that the provider goes through AML/KYC requirements and obtains a signed certification from each user with relevant personal information, including confirmation of their country of tax residence. There are certain assets, such as shares issued in crypto form, which could qualify as reportable under the CARF and as financial assets that would be reportable under CRS (e.g. shares issued in crypto form). To avoid duplicative reporting, the CRS amendment contain an optional provision to switch-off reporting under the CRS if such information is reported under the CARF. The way in which Inland Revenue would receive information under the CARF is through an information exchange agreement with other jurisdictions. Jurisdictions that receive information on the activities of crypto-asset users from Reporting Crypto-Asset Service providers will be required to share that information with tax authorities of other countries that have also implemented the rules to the extent that the information relates to persons resident in that jurisdiction. Tax authorities will also receive information from other jurisdictions’ tax authorities where the rules have been implemented. International context surrounding the CARF The OECD have been undertaking work over the past few years to develop a CARF that jurisdictions can implement. A draft framework was consulted on by the OECD in early 2022 and the final CARF rules were declassified publicly on 10 October 2022. The success of this initiative depends on its widespread implementation by jurisdictions. If some countries do not implement the CARF, then cryptoasset users could undertake their cryptoasset activity through intermediaries located in a jurisdiction that had not implemented the rules. This would undermine the objective of the CARF of increasing visibility over incomes derived through cryptoassets. It is noted that this should not be an issue in practice as the CARF is a global minimum standard. This means that all OECD countries are expected to implement it. To date, over 50 jurisdictions have publicly committed to implementing the CARF by issuing a joint statement outlining their commitment to its implementation. The CARF is set to apply from the 2026/27 tax year, with the first information exchanges taking place in 2027 in respect of the 2026-year data). The OECD are currently working on finalising the IT schema for the CARF. Once finalised, this will be released to tax administrations and crypto-asset service providers and other financial institutions to enable them to make IT changes to implement the CARF. W h a t i s t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m o r o p p o r t u n i t y ? The policy problem this proposal seeks to address is to improve Inland Revenue’s visibility over incomes derived through cryptoassets. Having access to this information will help improve tax compliance (if individuals do not include income derived through cryptoassets in their tax return then Inland Revenue will know). Regulatory Impact Statement | 9 As mentioned previously in this impact statement, cryptoassets and underlying blockchain technology has grown at a rapid rate in recent years, with the current market capitalisation of these assets nearing 4 trillion USD. The technological advances afforded by blockchain technology also continue to grow at a rapid rate as new financial offerings are brought to market that utilise blockchain technology (such as non-fungible tokens, the development of decentralised finance and the growth of the metaverse). It is important that tax authorities improve their visibility of incomes derived through cryptoassets. If nothing is done to support improved information flows, then this could compromise tax compliance and the ability of Inland Revenue to ensure cryptoasset users pay the correct amount of tax. Increased visibility over cryptoasset incomes is forecast to generate $50m in revenue per annum, as Inland Revenue will utilise this information to support tax compliance. The proposals to require cryptoasset intermediaries to provide Inland Revenue with transaction information in respect of their users would affect: Cryptoasset intermediaries: These intermediaries will have reporting obligations to tax authorities in respect of relevant cryptoasset transactions undertaken by their users. This includes compiling reports and identifying information about users and their transactions. Cryptoasset intermediaries would be required to make the necessary system changes to enable this information reporting to occur. Users of cryptoasset intermediaries: Inland Revenue would have improved visibility over incomes derived through cryptoassets and therefore users would have a reduced ability to conceal any income or criminality. Inland Revenue: Under both the OECD CARF and a bespoke regime, Inland Revenue would receive information from cryptoasset intermediaries on transactions undertaken by their users. This information could be used to support tax compliance and tax administration functions. Inland Revenue would also be required to make the necessary system changes to its computer system, START, to allow for the automatic exchange of information. W h a t o b j e c t i v e s a r e s o u g h t i n r e l a t i o n t o t he p o l i c y p r o b l e m ? The objective is to improve visibility over incomes derived through cryptoassets to ensure increased tax compliance. Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 Section 2: Deciding upon an option to addres s the policy proble m W h a t c r i t e r i a w i l l b e u s e d to c o m p a r e o p t i o n s to t h e s t a t u s q u o ? The critiera that have been used to assess the options are: Fairness: Is the option effective at facilitating the payment of the correct amount of tax by taxpayers? This is often described as horizontal equity: the idea that people in the same position should pay the same amount of tax. Tax should not be easier to avoid just because someone works in a different industry or sector (for example, if a person’s income is derived through cryptoasset trading as opposed to a salary and wage earner). Compliance costs: Does the preferred option achieve the desired policy objective of visibility over incomes derived through cryptoassets whilst minimising compliance costs for cryptoasset intermediaries and users.. Due to the nature of the policy objective, it is recognised that there will be some compliance costs but the preferred option will minimise these to the extent possible. Administration: Is the preferred option possible for Inland Revenue to implement and administer without substantial ongoing administration costs? Efficiency: Does the preferred option minimise impediments to economic growth and avoid distortions to taxpayer decisions? Does the preferred option ensure that comparable investments are effectively taxed in the same way? Coherence: Does the preferred option make sense in the context of the entire tax system and New Zealand’s international tax relations? Is the preferred option consistent with New Zealand’s broad-base low-rate framework? Sustainability: Is the preferred option future-proofed? Will the option be able to apply and extend to future developments in the cryptoasset space without the need for further regulatory change? W h a t s c o p e w i l l o p t i o n s b e c o n s i d e r e d w i t h i n ? In order to improve tax compliance with regard to incomes derived through cryptoassets, it follows that Inland Revenue will need access to income information. The most feasible option to improve these information flows is to require cryptoasset intermediaries to provide this income information to Inland Revenue in some way or another. There is scope in terms of the exact categories of information to be collected and the timing and frequency of this information (for example, if a bespoke regime were implemented). Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 W h a t o p t i o n s a r e b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d? Option One – Taking no action Under the status quo, Inland Revenue would not receive any information in respect of income derived by New Zealand resident through offshore cryptoasset intermediaries. This is because these intermediaries are not subject to NZ legislation and information demand powers under the Tax Administration Act 1994. Inland Revenue would receive information from New Zealand intermediaries on an ad-hoc basis when utilising these information demand powers, but would not receive regular income information from these intermediaries. This means that the visibility Inland Revenue has over incomes derived through cryptoassets would remain limited and this would present cryptoasset users with increased opportunity to conceal incomes from Inland Revenue. Most other OECD countries have recently indicated they will implement CARF. Taking no action would mean that New Zealand would not be aligned with other OECD countries. Option Two – Implementing the OECD CARF The CARF is a global minimum standard. This means all OECD countries are expected to implement it. To date, over 50 jurisdictions have signed up to a joint statement signalling their commitment to implementing the CARF. Countries that have signed up to date include Australia, Canada, the UK, USA and most of Europe. Implementing the CARF will achieve the intended policy objectives of improving Inland Revenue’s visibility over incomes derived through cryptoassets, and thereby supporting greater tax compliance. As mentioned earlier in this regulatory impact statement, the standardised schema provided through the CARF reduces compliance costs for intermediaries, compared to responding to ad-hoc requests for information from many different tax authorities which would apply if jurisdictions implemented bespoke regimes. Standardisation also reduces system build costs for intermediaries as all requests are managed in a standardised format. Inland Revenue would use the information provided under the CARF to promote tax compliance. This would be in the form of specific compliance activity and prompting individuals that do derive income through cryptoassets to include this in their income tax return. This will make it harder for individuals to conceal incomes derived through cryptoassets from Inland Revenue. Although information obtained under the CARF is tightly controlled, the information could also be utilised to monitor for any high risk activity or behaviours that may be symptomatic of fraud or illegal activity (due to their decentralised and somewhat anonymous nature, cryptoassets can be used to facilitate illegal activities). Inland Revenue is not considering using this information to pre-populate income tax returns at this stage. This is because profits derived through selling cryptoassets are not necessarily income (although they will be in most cases). Cryptoassets are taxed on a realisation basis in New Zealand in accordance with section CB 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (based on the dominant purpose at acquisition). This means that it can be unclear if profits derived through cryptoassets and reported under the CARF are taxable (the dominant purpose on acquisition may be to derive a passive income through staking, rather than to make a profit for example), although in a lot of cases they clearly would be taxable. However, pre-population of income tax returns with cryptoasset income is something that may be considered at a later date. This Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 could be of particular benefit once potential policy changes are made to simplify the way tax is calculated on cryptoassets (which is something that could be considered subject to prioritisation as part of the Government’s Tax Policy Work Programme). It is noted that if NZ tax settings and the information flows under the CARF were able to work synergistically with each other to enable accurate pre-population (at least for some categories of cryptoassets where it would be clear that a disposal is taxable), then it is clear that this would bring obvious benefits in reduced compliance costs. This would make it much easier for individuals to comply with their tax obligations as their taxable income would be calculated without them having to do anything, allowing them to avoid complex calculations and rely on information reported under the CARF. This potential benefit points to the CARF being a sustainable and enduring solution. Option 3 – Bespoke regime An alternative solution would be to implement bespoke information reporting requirements in New Zealand’s domestic legislation. Under this option, Inland Revenue would receive information about users’ incomes earned through cryptoasset intermediaries. The difference between this option and the OECD CARF is that Inland Revenue could prescribe what categories of information, along with timing and frequency of information that it receives from cryptoasset intermediaries. Just like option 2, this would provide Inland Revenue with income information to support tax compliance. As Inland Revenue could prescribe the frequency and timing of information, this would allow for easier pre-population to our 1 April – 31 March tax year, in the event that we elected to go down this pathway in the future. There is a risk that this option would not be sustainable long term as cryptoasset intermediaries may refuse NZ customers if we attempted to impose bespoke reporting obligations on them. A bespoke regime would also not be in line with the internationally agreed standards developed by the OECD to which NZ is a member country. As previously mentioned, 80% of New Zealanders conduct their cryptoasset activities through offshore exchanges and a bespoke solution would not be as effective in compelling compliance by offshore exchanges (our laws would not apply to overseas jurisdictions and so it would not be anywhere near as effective as the CARF and its information exchange protocol). The other problem with this approach is that it would increase compliance costs for cryptoasset intermediaries who would need to implement bespoke system changes to comply with New Zealand’s domestic legislation. This could increase the likelihood of non-compliance, and could result in Inland Revenue not receiving any income information. Option 4 – annual disclosure regime Similar to the annual disclosure that is required under current law in respect of foreign shares, Inland Revenue could require owners of cryptoassets to provide information on their holdings. This would result in increased visibility over incomes derived through cryptoassets but would not necessarily translate to increased tax compliance. This is because those who would adhere to a disclosure regime are probably compliant taxpayers anyway. This option does not effectively deal with the tax compliance issue, as the decentralised nature of cryptoassets makes it easier for motivated individuals to conceal their incomes without third party reporting.

The option that is likely to best address the problem, meet the policy objectives, and deliver the highest net benefits is implementing the OECD’s CARF (Option 2). This option will achieve the policy objective of ensuring Inland Revenue has visibility over incomes derived through cryptoassets and thereby supporting tax compliance. This option has clear benefits over option 3 (bespoke rules). Firstly, be adopting a standardised OECD schema this reduces compliance costs for cryptoasset intermediaries. The OECD CARF is also a more sustainable solution given it has buy-in from jurisdictions worldwide and greater support from cryptoasset intermediaries. Although a bespoke regime would provide New Zealand with the theoretical flexibility to mandate timing of reporting and the categories of information to be reported, this is not necessary. This is because the information prescribed to be shared under the OECD CARF is fit for purpose to promote tax compliance in New Zealand. If, at a future date, Inland Revenue decided to utilise the information received through cryptoasset intermediaries to pre-populate income tax returns, a bespoke regime would provide some advantages (such as the ability to ensure that information was provided in accordance with NZ’s 1 April – 31 March tax year, as opposed to a calendar year as is likely under the CARF). This theoretical benefit is far outweighed by the benefits of standardisation and reduced compliance costs afforded under the CARF however.

The operating costs include depreciation and capital charge. There are also ongoing administration costs for Inland Revenue beyond the current forecast period. High Others (cryptoasset intermediaries) New Zealand resident cryptoasset intermediaries would be required to provide Inland Revenue with aggregated information in respect of transactions undertaken by users on their platforms. Offshore cryptoasset intermediaries in jurisdictions that have implemented the CARF would be subject to an information exchange and these jurisdictions would provide Inland Revenue with information in respect of NZ resident users operating through these offshore intermediaries.

Low High Regulators (Inland Revenue) Inland Revenue would have improved information flows about incomes derived by cryptoasset users through cryptoasset intermediaries.

There would be a particular focus on taxpayers that have derived large amount of profits through cryptoassets or on taxpayers who are not compliant with their tax obligations. The benefit has been estimated using a macroeconomic approach that estimates the total value of cryptoassets held by New Zealanders and then uses a series of assumptions to form the basis of the model. The size of the cryptoasset market in NZ has been calculated by comparing NZ’s relative share of global GDP against the total market capitalisation for cryptoassets and then scaling this down conservatively based on the percentage of New Zealanders who invest in this asset class. This figure has then been layered with a number of assumptions such as the probability that any given disposal is taxable, rate of return, assumed tax rate, current compliance level, and how much of an uplift in compliance will be achieved through utilising the data for compliance measures. Conservative figures were used in arriving at this estimate given the highly volatile nature of cryptoassets in general. Section 3: Delivering a n option H o w w i l l t h e n e w a r r a n g e m e n t s b e i m p l e m e n t e d? Inland Revenue will be responsible for the implementation and ongoing administration of the new rules. Inland Revenue will provide information to increase awareness regarding the new rules. This will include producing a relevant Tax Information Bulletin item and updating guidance on Inland Revenue’s website along with relevant press releases to advise cryptoasset intermediaries and users of the changes. bolstered if high risk cryptoasset activity that suggests criminal activity is identified and passed on to the relevant authorities. There will also be a general fairness benefit to taxpayers who do not hold cryptoassets. This is because income derived through cryptoassets that may have previously been hidden from Inland Revenue will now be subject to tax. Total monetised benefits n/a $50 million over the current forecast period, and $50m per annum thereafter Medium Non-monetised benefits Low Medium Regulatory Impact Statement | 17 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Implementing these proposals would require legislative change. Similar to how FATCA/CRS and the taxation of the gig and sharing economy proposals were adopted, a legislative change could be made to state that the OECD CARF, schema and user guide have force in NZ’s domestic legislation. Greater legislative change would be required for a bespoke regime. From an Inland Revenue systems perspective, there would be a sizeable upfront cost to build functionality within START (Inland Revenue’s computer system) to enable for the sharing and receiving of income information with other jurisdictions. The preferred option is that the OECD’s CARF is implemented with the 2026/27 tax year being the first year that information is required to be collected by cryptoasset intermediaries in New Zealand affected by the rules. This means that: • New Zealand cryptoasset intermediaries must adhere to a self-certification process in respect of each user and collect and report this self-certification information along with all aggregate level data on all relevant crypto-asset transactions in relation to each reportable user. This data will cover information on crypto-to-crypto transactions, crypto-to-fiat transactions and transfers of relevant cryptoassets. This information will be subject to various valuation and currency translation rules, such as specifying that the amount paid or received is reporting in the fiat currency in which it was reported or received. • Inland Revenue would need to exchange this relevant information with other jurisdictions, to the extent that the information held related to foreign tax residents in jurisdictions that had also implemented the OECD CARF. • Inland Revenue would use the information it received to support New Zealand users of cryptoasset intermediaries to comply with their tax obligations. This will ensure greater tax compliance and minimise the opportunities for these individuals to conceal incomes derived through cryptoassets.

If the OECD CARF was implemented, it is noted that the OECD will be able to allocate resources to making any changes to the CARF where necessary. Any changes to the OECD schema and rules can then be reflected into domestic legislation in NZ. Given the likely widespread buy-in from jurisdictions, this ensures a more enduring and sustainable policy reform. New Zealand regularly participate in OECD meetings so would be able to provide a contribution towards any discussions evaluating or seeking to make improvements to the CARF. The OECD would also answer questions and issue clarifications on how the OECD rules were to operate to ensure that jurisdictions understood the technical aspects of the rules. Inland Revenue would also allocate resource to compliance initiatives to ensure that the information received was effectively utilised to support users of cryptoasset intermediaries to pay the correct amount of tax. Inland Revenue regularly reviews tax settings on an ongoing basis and provides advice and updates to the Government accordingly. Policy officials maintain strong communication channels with stakeholders in the tax advisory community and these stakeholders will be able to correspond with officials about the operation of the new rules at any time. If problems emerge, they will be dealt with either operationally, or by way of legislative amendment if agreed by Parliament.

The Act amends the Income Tax Act 2007 (the ITA) to increase the trustee tax rate from 33% to 39% for the 2024–25 and later income years to address the under-taxation of trust income. The new legislation also introduces: • Measures to mitigate over-taxation, including: o retaining the 33% rate where trustee income for the income year does not exceed $10,000 (after deductible expenses); o targeted rules for deceased estates and trusts settled for disabled people; and o exclusions for energy consumer trusts and legacy superannuation funds. • A measure to buttress the 39% trustee tax rate by taxing beneficiary income derived by certain close companies at the 39% trustee tax rate. Unless otherwise specified, the focus of this Special Report is on “complying trusts”. 1 Current law The annual income of a trust is taxed either to the trustees or to the beneficiaries of the trust. 2 Trustees of a trust are treated as a single taxable person and their trustee income is calculated separately from their personal income. 3 Beneficiary income Definition: Beneficiary income is all income earned by a trust in an income year that is vested absolutely in a beneficiary during the income year, or paid or allocated to a beneficiary before the later of: • 6 months following the end of the income year, or • the earlier of: 1 A complying trust is a trust where tax has always been paid in New Zealand on the worldwide income derived by the trustee and the tax obligations relating to the trustee’s income tax liability have been satisfied. A complying trust is defined in section HC 10 of the ITA. 2 Section HC 5 of the ITA. 3 Sections HC 2 and YA 5 of the ITA. Page 4 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 o the date the trust files its tax return, or o the date the trust is required to file its tax return. 4 Income does not need to be paid to a beneficiary to be beneficiary income; the income can be allocated to a beneficiary. Provided the income is vested absolutely in the beneficiary, the income is beneficiary income and is taxed at the beneficiary’s personal tax rate unless it is subject to the minor beneficiary rule. Income being “vested absolutely” is broadly equivalent to the trustees allocating the income irreversibly to a beneficiary, i.e. they cannot change their mind about the allocation. Definition: The minor beneficiary rule applies to beneficiary income derived by a minor (a New Zealand resident natural person under 16 years old) from property settled on a trust by: • a relative or legal guardian, or • an associated person of a relative or legal guardian, unless a specific exception applies. If the total beneficiary income derived by the minor from a trust is greater than $1,000 in an income year, the income is taxed at the trustee tax rate. 5 The purpose of the minor beneficiary rule is to limit the tax benefits that could otherwise be achieved by distributing the income of a trust to a minor beneficiary (likely to be on the lowest marginal tax rate). This rule addresses the concern that a minor is not economically independent from the parents or guardians who control the trust. This rule helps ensure that a family with a trust cannot gain a tax advantage over a family without one by using the income of a trust to meet the family’s expenses. This is because families would be able to use a trust to meet the expenses of children from income taxed at the marginal tax rates of the children, instead of meeting those expenses from their own after-tax income. 4 Section HC 6 of the ITA. 5 Sections HC 35 to HC 37 of the ITA. Page 5 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 Table 1: Types of beneficiary income Types of beneficiary income Examples Income distributed or paid to a beneficiary. Cash transferred to the beneficiary. Income allocated to a beneficiary by crediting the beneficiary’s current account (i.e., the cash is still with the trust but can be called upon by the beneficiary). Trustees allocating an amount to a beneficiary by making a journal entry in the trust’s accounts to the beneficiary’s current account. Income that is allocated to a beneficiary for them to possess at a future date or event. Trustees settle an amount of income on a sub- trust for a beneficiary. Trustee income Definition: Trustee income is all income derived by the trustees of a trust in an income year that is not beneficiary income. 6 Once income has been taxed as trustee income, subsequent distributions of that income to the beneficiaries are tax-free. 7 That is, trustee income is subject to a final tax imposed in the year the income is derived by the trust. Trustee’s net income Although beneficiary income is first derived by a trustee, and secondly by a beneficiary (once it has been vested in or paid to the beneficiary), it is only taxed once in the case of a complying trust (i.e. to the beneficiary). 8 Beneficiary income is included in the beneficiary’s income for the purposes of calculating their net income. 9 Beneficiary income is not included in the trustee’s income the purposes of calculating the trustee’s net income. However, when determining the deductions a trustee is allowed in an income year, beneficiary income is treated as trustee income. Beneficiaries are denied a 6 Section HC 7 of the ITA. 7 This is only the case for complying trusts (sections CW 53 and HC 20 of the ITA). Distributions of accumulated trustee income from foreign trusts are taxed at the beneficiary’s personal tax rate (sections CV 13 and HC 15 of the ITA). Distributions of accumulated trustee income or capital gains from non-complying trusts are taxed at a 45% tax rate (sections CX 59, HC 15 and Schedule 1, Part A, Clause 4 of the ITA). 8 This is only the case for complying trusts. A taxable distribution from a foreign or non-complying trust to a beneficiary may be taxed twice (e.g. first to the trustee as trustee income and again to the beneficiary). 9 Section CV 13(a) of the ITA. Page 6 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 deduction for any expenditure or loss incurred by the trustee in deriving the beneficiary income. 10 This means that the trustee’s net income is determined based on only trustee income (excluding any beneficiary income) less any deductions incurred in deriving both trustee and beneficiary income. Trustee’s net income = Trustee income less deductions (from deriving both trustee and beneficiary income) Corpus Definition: Corpus is property settled on a trust. 11 Corpus is used to provide benefits to the beneficiaries and can be used to derive income and capital gains. Distributions of any amounts other than beneficiary income, including corpus, capital gains, or trustee income from prior years, are exempt from tax to the receiving beneficiary. 12 10 Section DV 9 of the ITA. 11 Section HC 4 of the ITA. 12 This is only the case for complying trusts (sections CW 53 and HC 20 of the ITA). Distributions of accumulated trustee income from foreign trusts are taxed at the beneficiary’s personal tax rate (sections CV 13 and HC 15 of the ITA). Distributions of accumulated trustee income or capital gains from non-complying trusts are taxed at a 45% tax rate (sections CX 59, HC 15 and Schedule 1, Part A, Clause 4 of the ITA). Page 7 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 Trustee income flowchart For the 2024–25 and later income years, trustee income is subject to tax at the 39% trustee tax rate to address the under-taxation of trust income, unless special rules to mitigate over- taxation apply.

Page 9 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 Increasing the trustee tax rate to 39% Sections HC 7, HC 35, HC 40 and Clauses 3 and 6B of Schedule 1, Part A of the ITA The trustee tax rate has been increased from 33% to 39% for the 2024–25 and later income years. The 33% rate still applies if trustee income for the income year does not exceed $10,000 (after deductible expenses). Background The previous 33% trustee tax rate had been in place since 1989 and was intentionally chosen to align with the (then) top personal tax rate. In 2020, a new top personal tax rate of 39% for income over $180,000 was introduced for the 2021–22 and later income years. The trustee tax rate was not increased at that time. The previous 33% trustee tax rate meant that individuals were not subject to the 39% personal tax rate on distributed tax-paid trustee income, even if they earned over $180,000 in (combined) personal income and distributed tax-paid trustee income. This under- taxation of trust income undermined the fairness of the tax system. Due to the trustee tax rate being a final tax, it can also result in over-taxation. This does not depend on the amount of income earned by the trust, but arises when trustee income is taxed at a rate higher than the personal tax rates of the beneficiaries and settlors of the trust. Income of a trust can be taxed at a beneficiary’s personal tax rate if the income is paid or allocated to the beneficiary as beneficiary income, but this may not always be feasible. Key features • The trustee tax rate has been increased from 33% to 39%. • To help mitigate over-taxation, the 33% rate still applies if trustee income for the income year does not exceed $10,000 (after deductible expenses). • Amendments to clarify that beneficiary income subject to the minor beneficiary rule is subject to the 39% trustee tax rate have been made. Effective date The amendments apply for the 2024–25 and later income years (beginning 1 April 2024 for most trusts). Page 10 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 Detailed analysis De minimis Trusts with trustee income not exceeding $10,000 (after deductible expenses) are subject to a 33% tax rate on trustee income. Trusts with more than $10,000 trustee income (after deductible expenses) are subject to the 39% trustee tax rate on all of their trustee income. New section HC 40 of the ITA provides that a trust is a “de minimis trust” for an income year if the trustees have no more than $10,000 net income (trustee income less deductible expenses) for that income year. A de minimis trust is subject to a 33% tax rate on its trustee income. Any income treated as trustee income under the following rules is ignored when determining whether a trust is a de minimis trust: • The minor beneficiary rule in section HC 35 of the ITA (see page 10). • The corporate beneficiary rule in section HC 38 of the ITA (see page 11). Example 1: De minimis trust Big Bird is the sole beneficiary of an income-earning trust. Each year, the trustees earn $20,000 of income and have $2,000 of deductible expenditure. 2024–25 income year: Big Bird asks the trustees, Gonzo and Grover, for some income – he is struggling to make ends meet. They decide to distribute $12,000 to him as beneficiary income and retain the remaining $8,000 as trustee income. Gonzo and Grover can deduct expenses of $2,000, leaving net income of $6,000 (trustee income after deductible expenses). Because the net income of the trustees does not exceed $10,000, the trust is a de minimis trust, and the trustee income is taxed at 33%. 2025–26 income year: Big Bird again asks Gonzo and Grover for some income. They have heard that Big Bird hasn’t spent all his money from last year, so decide to only distribute $8,000 as beneficiary income. $12,000 is retained as trustee income. After deducting $2,000 of expenses, the trustees have net income of $10,000. Because the net income of the trustees does not exceed $10,000, the trust is a de minimis trust, and the trustee income is taxed at 33%. 2026–27 income year: Gonzo and Grover hear that Big Bird again hasn’t spent all his beneficiary income from the previous year. They decide to cut him off in the 2026–27 income year and retain all the income as trustee income. The trustees have $20,000 trustee income. After deducting $2,000 of expenses, Gonzo and Grover have net income of $18,000. Because the net income of the trustees exceeds $10,000, the trust is not a de minimis trust, and the trustee income is taxed at 39%. Page 11 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 Income year Trustee income (after deductible expenses) Is the trust a de minimis trust? Tax rate on all trustee income 2024–25 $6,000 Yes 33% 2025–26 $10,000 Yes 33% 2026–27 $18,000 No 39% Fragmentation Eligibility for the de minimis is determined on a per-trust basis, per income year. If a person has settled multiple trusts, each trust can separately qualify as a de minimis trust. However, settling multiple trusts, or fragmenting an existing trust into multiple trusts, to take advantage of the 33% tax rate for trustee income of a de minimis trust would raise tax avoidance concerns for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Minor beneficiary rule The “minor beneficiary rule” provides that beneficiary income derived by a minor (under 16 years old) is taxed at the trustee tax rate, unless certain exclusions apply such as: • the total amount of beneficiary income earned by the minor from the trust in the income year is $1,000 or less, • the trust paying the beneficiary income is a testamentary trust, or • all settlements on the trust were made by a person who is neither a relative or guardian of the minor (nor a person associated with a relative or guardian). For further information on the specific exclusions from the minor beneficiary rule, refer to Part 6 of Inland Revenue’s Interpretation Statement on the taxation of trusts: IS 24/01. The Act amends sections HC 7(2) and HC 35(2) to clarify that beneficiary income subject to the minor beneficiary rule is subject to the 39% trustee tax rate, regardless of whether the trust is a de minimis trust. Page 12 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 Corporate beneficiary rule Sections CD 44(7)(dc), CX 58B, HC 7, HC 17, HC 24, HC 38, LE 4B and YA 1 of the ITA. Beneficiary income derived by certain corporate beneficiaries is subject to the 39% trustee tax rate and treated as trustee income for the purposes of determining who pays the relevant tax and who provides the return of income. Background A company can be a beneficiary of a trust. Prior to the amendments in the Act, beneficiary income paid to a corporate beneficiary was taxed at 28%. This meant that corporate beneficiaries could be used to shelter income from the higher personal tax rates of the shareholders in those companies until such time that income was distributed to the shareholders. If the trustees of the trust making the distribution also own shares in the corporate beneficiary (in their capacity as trustees), the income allocation achieves nothing. The income effectively remains within the trust. The principal, or in many cases the only, effect of the allocation is to ensure that the income is taxed at 28% rather than the trustee tax rate. While a subsequent distribution of the income by the company to the trust will be taxable as a dividend (with imputation credits attached), such a distribution may never be made. Similar concerns arise if the shareholder of the corporate beneficiary is the settlor of the trust or a related trust. Key features To ensure that companies cannot be used to shelter income from the 39% trustee tax rate, the amendments introduce a “corporate beneficiary rule”. Beneficiary income earned by certain companies is subject to the 39% trustee tax rate instead of the 28% tax rate. Generally, companies not subject to the corporate beneficiary rule remain taxed at 28% on beneficiary income. Effective date The amendments apply for the 2024–25 and later income years (beginning 1 April 2024 for most trusts). Page 13 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 Corporate beneficiary rule flowchart This flowchart provides a simplified explanation of when an amount of beneficiary income earned by a company is subject to the new corporate beneficiary rule. Yes Beneficiary income from Trust A is taxed at 39%. Is there natural love and affection? Does a settlor of Trust A have natural love and affection for a person that has a voting interest or market value interest in the company? Is the company owned by the trust or a settlor? Do the trustees, or a settlor, of Trust A have a voting interest or market value interest in the company? Is the company owned by another trust? Do the trustees of another trust, Trust B, have a voting interest or market value interest in the company? Is there natural love and affection? Does a settlor of Trust A have natural love and affection for a settlor or beneficiary of Trust B? No No Yes Beneficiary income from Trust A is not subject to the corporate beneficiary rule. Ordinary beneficiary income rules apply. Is the company a close company? Do five or fewer people or trustees hold more than 50% of the voting interests in the company (when treating associated persons as one person)? Yes Start A company earns beneficiary income from a trust, Trust A. Is the company a: •tax charity, •Māori authority, or •securitisation trust beneficiary? No Yes No No No Yes Yes Page 14 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 Detailed analysis To buttress the 39% trustee tax rate, new section HC 38 provides that beneficiary income derived by certain corporate beneficiaries is subject to tax at the 39% trustee tax rate. Such beneficiary income amounts are also treated as trustee income for the purposes of determining who pays the relevant tax, and who provides the return of income. Taxing beneficiary income derived by certain close companies at the 39% trustee tax rate prevents the under-taxation that would otherwise arise if the income were taxed at the corporate tax rate. Definition: A company is a close company if five or fewer natural persons or trustees hold more than 50% of the voting interests in the company, treating associated persons as one person. Definitions: Generally, a person who holds shares issued by a company will have a voting interest in the company. A person’s market value interest in a company equals their share of the total market value of shares and options held in the company if there is a market value circumstance. Definition: The term natural love and affection is used to describe the motive of a person for an action driven not by a promise of something in return, but by the natural love and affection the person has for another. Natural love and affection is generally considered to exist between relatives, whether by blood, marriage, a non-spousal domestic relationship, or adoption. It can be present between close friends as well, although not ordinary acquaintances or colleagues. The corporate beneficiary rule applies if a close company earns an amount of beneficiary income from a trust (Trust A) and any voting interest or market value interest, directly or indirectly, in the company is held by at least one of the following: • Criteria 1: a settlor of Trust A, • Criteria 2: the trustees of Trust A, • Criteria 3: a person for whom a settlor of Trust A has “natural love and affection”, or • Criteria 4: the trustees of another trust (Trust B), if a settlor of trust A has “natural love and affection” for a settlor or a beneficiary of Trust B. Criteria 1 and 2: Settlor- and trustee-owned companies The corporate beneficiary rule applies to a close company if a settlor, or the trustees, of a trust have a voting interest or market value interest in the company, directly or indirectly. Page 15 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 This recognises that a settlor, or the trustees, of the trust have a degree of control over the company, and it could be used to shelter income from the 39% trustee tax rate. Criteria 3: Natural love and affection The corporate beneficiary rule also extends to close companies where a settlor of the trust has natural love and affection for a person that holds a voting interest or market value interest, directly or indirectly, in the company. Whether a person has natural love and affection for another person is subjective and can only be considered on a case-by-case basis. Limiting the corporate beneficiary rule to situations where a settlor, or the trustee, of a trust directly or indirectly controls a company would mean that the trustees would still be able to shelter income from the 39% trustee tax rate by allocating beneficiary income to a company that is owned by a person who is, for example, a relative or associate of a settlor of the trust. Criteria 4: Company owned by a different trust The corporate beneficiary rule also applies in situations where the close company is owned by the trustees of a different trust than the one paying the beneficiary income. This situation is not covered by Criteria 3 because it is not possible to have natural love and affection for trustees (even if those trustees are natural persons). Example 2: Corporate beneficiary owned by a different trust Kermit and Miss Piggy have natural love and affection for each other and are each separately the settlors of the Rainbow Connection Trust and the Karate Chop Trust, respectively. Karate Chop Trust is the sole shareholder of a close company, Sesame Solutions Ltd. Since Kermit has natural love and affection for Miss Piggy, if the trustees of the Rainbow Connection Trust make Sesame Solutions Ltd a beneficiary of the trust, then the company will satisfy Criteria 4. Any beneficiary income paid by the trustees of the Rainbow Connection Trust to Sesame Solutions Ltd will be subject to the corporate beneficiary rule and taxed at 39%. Sesame Solutions Ltd is a close company and is not a registered charity, Māori authority, or the beneficiary of a securitisation trust, so is not excluded from the corporate beneficiary rule. Page 16 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 Example 2 continued: Corporate beneficiary owned by a different trust Available capital distribution amount New section CD 44(7)(dc) provides that income subject to the corporate beneficiary rule is a capital gain amount in the formula for determining the available capital distribution amount (ACDA) for a share on liquidation of the company. This means that the amount of ACDA will be increased on liquidation of the company so that the income subject to the corporate beneficiary rule is not subject to tax again if it is distributed to the shareholders on liquidation. For most companies, capital gains cannot be distributed ‘tax-free’ to shareholders until liquidation, so any distribution (other than on liquidation) of corporate beneficiary income by the company will be subject to the ordinary dividend rules and subject to tax in the shareholders’ hands. Excluded income New sections CX 58B and HC 38(2)(a) provide that beneficiary income subject to the corporate beneficiary rule is excluded income in the hands of the corporate beneficiary. This is consistent with the treatment of minor beneficiary income in sections CX 58 and HC 35. No imputation credit A company will not receive an imputation credit for any tax paid by the trustees on an amount of beneficiary income subject to the corporate beneficiary rule. Sesame Solutions Ltd Karate Chop Trust Miss Piggy 100% shareholder settlor beneficiary The Rainbow Connection Trust Kermit settlor Natural love and affection Page 17 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 Use of tax credits New section LE 4B ensures that the trustees can use tax credits to satisfy the tax liability on beneficiary income subject to the corporate beneficiary rule. This treatment mirrors the existing provision in section LE 4 for income subject to the minor beneficiary rule. Exclusions Dividends within a wholly-owned group Section HC 38(3)(b) provides that the corporate beneficiary rule does not override the inter- corporate dividend exemption in section CW 10. The inter-corporate dividend exemption provides that a dividend is exempt income if it is paid between NZ resident companies within the same wholly-owned group. If a trustee derives an amount of income that is of a particular character in the hands of the trustee, the income will retain this character in the hands of the beneficiary when the amount becomes beneficiary income. This means that if a trustee earns dividend income and distributes that income as beneficiary income, it will retain its character as dividend income for the beneficiary. Page 18 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 Example 3: The corporate beneficiary rule and dividends within a wholly-owned group Oscar the Grouch, Count von Count, and Cookie Monster are the trustees of the Trash Can Trust. The trustees are the sole shareholders of the companies Count von Company Ltd and Cookie Jar Ltd. Both companies are beneficiaries of the trust. Count von Company Ltd pays a dividend of $100 to Trash Can Trust, and the trustees decide to distribute the $100 to Cookie Jar Ltd as beneficiary income. Since beneficiary income retains its character, the income is dividend income in the hands of Cookie Jar Ltd. Count von Company Ltd and Cookie Jar Ltd are both wholly-owned by the trustees of the Trash Can Trust. They have 100% common voting interests, so are a wholly-owned group of companies. The dividend from Count von Company Ltd to Cookie Jar Ltd, via Trash Can Trust, satisfies the inter-corporate dividend exemption requirements in section CW 10 since it was paid within a wholly-owned group of companies. This means that the dividend is exempt income for Cookie Jar Ltd and not subject to the corporate beneficiary rule. If imputation credits (and/or RWT) were attached to the dividend by the paying company, Count von Company Ltd, then a credit will arise in the imputation credit account of the recipient company, Cookie Jar Ltd. 100% shareholder beneficiary Cookie Jar Ltd 100% shareholder Trash Can Trust Count von Company Ltd beneficiary dividend beneficiary income (dividend) Wholly-owned group of companies Page 19 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 Securitisation trusts Section HC 38(1B)(c) excludes securitisation trust beneficiaries from the corporate beneficiary rule. This helps ensure that the rule does not impact the use of trusts in the securitisation industry. To achieve this, the amendments introduce three new definitions in section YA 1. Definition: A trust is a securitisation trust, for an income year, if from the establishment of the trust to the end of the relevant income year, the trust has only one beneficiary and that beneficiary is a company, and at all times during the income year, the trust: (a) operates to do one or more of the following: (i) guarantee liabilities of a financial institution (person A), who transferred some or all of their assets to the trust: (ii) guarantee liabilities of a company, incorporated in and resident in New Zealand, that is a member of a wholly-owned group of companies that includes person A: (iii) raise funds by issuing securities backed by its assets: (iv) raise funds by borrowing money backed by its assets; and (b) has interests in assets for the sole purpose of carrying out the trust’s operations described in paragraph (a); and (c) receives only funds that— (i) are used to acquire assets as described in paragraph (b): (ii) are derived from assets described in paragraph (b); and (iii) are incidental to the trust’s sole purpose described in paragraph (b); and (d) derives no exempt income; and (e) is a New Zealand resident; and (f) meets at least one of the following requirements: (i) the beneficiary of the trust is a lending person: (ii) the trust has its assets included in financial statements that are prepared using IFRSs. Definition: A person is a lending person: (a) whose main business activity is lending funds or leasing personal property to persons who are not associated with the person; or (b) who is a member of a group whose main business activity is lending funds or leasing personal property to persons who are not associated with any member of the group. Page 20 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 Definition: A beneficiary of a securitisation trust is a securitisation trust beneficiary. The definition of a securitisation trust is partially based on the existing definition of “debt funding special purpose vehicle” (DF SPV) in section YA 1, with some modifications to recognise that the DF SPV definition does not capture all relevant trusts in the securitisation industry. A securitisation trust is required to have only one beneficiary at any point in time. This does not necessarily need to be the same company throughout the trust’s existence. Unlike the DF SPV definition, the securitisation trust definition does not require all of the trust’s assets to be treated as assets of its originators, recognising that a securitisation trust may not necessarily be consolidated with the originator for financial reporting purposes. The securitisation trust is required to either (a) have a “lending person” as its beneficiary or (b) have its assets included in financial statements that are prepared using IFRSs. This ensures that the exclusion is targeted towards the securitisation industry and not available to any trust established for the sole purpose of raising funds by borrowing money backed by its assets, for example. Page 21 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 Deceased estates Section HC 8B and Clause 6B of Schedule 1, Part A of the ITA Deceased estates are excluded from the 39% trustee tax rate and remain subject to a 33% rate in the income year the estate was created, and the following three income years. Background Deceased estates are taxed as trusts, 13 which means income they derive is taxed at the trustee tax rate to the extent it is not beneficiary income. Most trusts can use existing rules to pay or allocate income as beneficiary income to mitigate over-taxation. However, deceased estates may not be able to use beneficiary income allocations to mitigate over-taxation if the beneficiaries of the deceased estate are not yet known, or potential claims against the deceased estate have not yet been resolved. Key features A deceased estate is excluded from the 39% trustee tax rate in the income year the estate was created and the following three income years. Instead, such deceased estates are subject to a 33% tax rate on their trustee income. Deceased estates are subject to ordinary trust tax rules outside this time period. This means a deceased estate could satisfy the criteria to be a de minimis trust. Effective date The amendments apply for the 2024–25 and later income years (beginning 1 April 2024 for most trusts). Detailed analysis New section HC 8B of the ITA provides that during the income year the estate was created and the following three income years, a deceased estate is subject to a 33% tax rate on its trustee income instead of the 39% trustee tax rate. If a deceased estate is not wound up by the end of the third income year following the income year the estate was created, it will be subject to the 39% trustee tax rate. However, 13 The definition of “trustee” in section YA 1 of the ITA includes an executor or administrator. Page 22 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 just like trusts, deceased estates can be de minimis trusts if they earn no more than $10,000 trustee income (after deductible expenses). These rules are not limited to deceased estates created after the enactment of the Act. Existing deceased estates are eligible provided they are still within the time limit (income year the estate was created, plus the three following income years). That is, the rules apply to deceased estates created on or after 1 April 2021. Example 4: Trustee income of an existing deceased estate Elmo died in August 2023, so his deceased estate was formed in the 2023–24 income year. Elmo’s estate earns income from a rental property on Sesame Street, with no deductible expenses. However, the trustee of his estate cannot distribute this income for many years after his death. This is because it is unclear who the beneficiaries of his estate are due to an ongoing dispute between Bert and Ernie. Elmo’s estate was created in the income year before new section HC 8B came into effect, when the trustee tax rate was 33%. Elmo’s estate is also eligible to apply the 33% tax rate for deceased estates on trustee income for the 2024–25 to 2026–27 income years, inclusive. In the 2027–28 income year (the fourth income year after the year during which the estate was created), Elmo’s estate no longer qualifies for the 33% tax rate for deceased estates. This means that trustee income earned by Elmo’s estate is subject to the 39% trustee tax rate (unless the deceased estate is a de minimis trust for that income year). The dispute over Elmo’s assets is finally resolved in the 2028-29 income year. The trustee of his estate can make beneficiary income allocations to Bert and Ernie, leaving $8,000 of trustee income. Elmo’s estate qualifies as a de minimis trust for this income year, so is subject to the 33% tax rate on its trustee income. Income year Trustee income Does the 33% rate for deceased estates apply? Is the trust a de minimis trust? Tax rate for trustee income 2023–24 $15,000 No No 33% 2024–25 $30,000 Yes No 33% 2025–26 $30,000 Yes No 33% 2026–27 $30,000 Yes No 33% 2027–28 $30,000 No No 39% 2028–29 $8,000 No Yes 33% Page 23 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 Disabled beneficiary trusts Section HC 39 and Clause 6B of Schedule 1, Part A of the ITA Trusts settled for one or more disabled beneficiaries are excluded from the 39% trustee tax rate and remain subject to a 33% tax rate on trustee income, provided certain criteria are met. Background Prior to the amendments, “disabled beneficiary trusts” were not defined in the Inland Revenue Acts. These targeted rules were introduced to help mitigate the risk of over-taxation for trusts settled for disabled people following the introduction of a 39% trustee tax rate. Key features Trustee income derived by the trustees of a trust is taxed at 33% if an eligible Government support payment for a disability is paid to, or on behalf of, each of the beneficiaries of the trust. • Support payments can be made for some, or all, of the relevant income year. • Beneficiaries can be added or removed, as long as there is at least one disabled beneficiary remaining. • The targeted rules do not have an income test, but three of the four eligible support payments are income-tested. • A disabled beneficiary under 16 years of age is excluded from the minor beneficiary rule. Effective date The amendments apply for the 2024–25 and later income years (beginning 1 April 2024 for most trusts). Detailed analysis Beneficiaries must meet “disabled beneficiary” definition The amendments allow trustee income derived by a trustee of a trust settled for a disabled person (or persons) to be taxed at a 33% rate, provided the trust has at least one “disabled beneficiary”. Page 24 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 Definition: A beneficiary is a disabled beneficiary for an income year if they derive (including where the payment is made to their carer on their behalf) one or more of the following support payments for at least part of the income year (or the income year in, or before, the person turned 65 years of age): • the Disability Allowance, • the Child Disability Allowance, • the Supported Living Payment on the ground of restricted work capacity, or • the JobSeeker Support Health and Disability (if this has been paid for at least 6 months). Table 4: Summary of eligible payments Name Detail Further information Disability Allowance Means tested weekly payment for people who have regular, ongoing costs because of a disability (e.g., medicine or visits to the doctor). Disability Allowance (workandincome.govt.nz) Child Disability Allowance Fortnightly payment made to the main carer of a child with a serious disability. It is paid in recognition of the extra care and attention needed for that child. Child Disability Allowance (workandincome.govt.nz) Supported Living Payment on the ground of restricted work capacity Means tested weekly payment for people who have, or are caring for someone with, a significant health condition, injury, or disability. Supported Living Payment (workandincome.govt.nz) Jobseeker Support Health and Disability Means-tested weekly payment for people who cannot work, or are working fewer hours because of a health condition, injury or disability Jobseeker Support (workandincome.govt.nz) 14 14 Also see: Income support for the person being cared for – A guide for carers (msd.govt.nz), Jobseeker Support cut-out points (current) – Map (workandincome.govt.nz) Page 25 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 Trust must only have disabled beneficiaries The amendments allow a disabled beneficiary trust to have multiple beneficiaries, provided they all meet the “disabled beneficiary” definition (ignoring any residual beneficiaries, who can only receive trust property if there are no longer any living disabled beneficiaries). Support payments can be made for some, or all, of the relevant income year To qualify, a beneficiary must have derived at least one of the four eligible Government support payments for at least part of the relevant income year (including where the payment is made to their carer on their behalf). This means trustee income derived by a trust settled for the care of a person who becomes disabled and starts receiving Government support part way through an income year can be taxed at the 33% rate for that income year. Ability to add/remove disabled beneficiaries Many trust deeds include a power to add or remove beneficiaries. The amendments allow disabled beneficiaries to be added or removed, as long as there is at least one disabled beneficiary remaining. Page 26 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 Energy consumer trusts Schedule 1, Part A, Clause 6B(c) of the ITA Energy consumer trusts are excluded from the 39% trustee tax rate and remain subject to a 33% tax rate on trustee income. Background Definition: A lines trust (or an energy consumer trust) is a trust that owns shares in an electricity distribution company. A lines trust is a trustee of a trust that has had (and continues to hold) shares allocated, transferred to or vested in it, being shares in: • an energy company as defined in section 2(1) of the Energy Companies Act 1992 under an approved establishment plan under that Act: • a company under section 76 of the Energy Companies Act 1992: • a company that received assets and liabilities of the Crown under section 16 of the Southland Electricity Act 1993. The beneficiaries of these trusts are the persons whose premises are connected to the energy company’s distribution network. These trusts have an increased risk of over-taxation as they may face administrative issues or restrictions in their trust deeds that impact their ability to make beneficiary income allocations. Key features Energy consumer trusts are excluded from the 39% trustee tax rate and remain subject to a 33% tax rate on trustee income. Effective date The amendment applies for the 2024–25 and later income years (beginning 1 April 2024 for most trusts). Page 27 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 Legacy superannuation funds Section YA 1 and Schedule 1, Part A, Clause 6(d) of the ITA “Legacy superannuation funds” are excluded from the 39% trustee tax rate. These funds are instead taxed at a 28% tax rate on all their income, the same as widely-held superannuation funds. Background Definition: A superannuation fund is defined in the ITA as a retirement scheme within the meaning of section 6(1) of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. This includes: • a registered scheme that is a KiwiSaver scheme or a superannuation scheme • a workplace savings scheme • a “Schedule 3” (single-person) scheme Definition: A widely-held superannuation fund is a superannuation fund that has 20 or more members (counting associated persons as one person). 15 Widely-held superannuation funds are taxed at a 28% rate on all their income. 16 If a superannuation fund is a trust and is not a portfolio investment entity (a PIE) or widely-held, it is subject to ordinary trust rules including the 39% trustee tax rate. Many widely-held superannuation funds are “restricted” schemes that are closed to new members. Over time, these funds would fall out of the widely-held superannuation fund definition due to declining membership. Superannuation funds have an increased risk of over-taxation as all their income is trustee income. 17 They cannot make beneficiary income allocations to mitigate over-taxation. Key features The amendments define a “legacy superannuation fund” as a scheme that previously qualified as a widely-held superannuation fund and is a restricted workplace savings scheme. 15 The definition of “widely-held superannuation fund” in section YA 1 of the ITA requires that the fund has 20 or more persons, as set out in HM 14(1) of the ITA. 16 Schedule 1, Part A, Clause 6(c) of the ITA. 17 Section HC 6(2)(a) of the ITA. Page 28 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 Legacy superannuation funds are subject to a 28% tax rate on all their income, the same as widely-held superannuation funds. 18 Effective date The amendments apply for the 2024–25 and later income years (beginning 1 April 2024 for most trusts). Detailed analysis The amendments introduce a new definition for a “legacy superannuation fund”. Definition: A trust is a legacy superannuation fund if it formerly satisfied the “widely-held superannuation fund” definition and is either: • a restricted workplace savings scheme, as designated by the Financial Markets Conduct (Designation of Restricted Schemes) Order 2016, or • treated as a registered scheme that is a superannuation fund by section 59A(1)(b) of the National Provident Fund Restructuring Act 1990. For the 2024–25 and later income years, legacy superannuation funds are subject to a 28% tax rate, similar to widely-held superannuation funds. This ensures that these funds are not worse off simply due to declining membership. Private family trusts operated as retirement savings vehicles and “Schedule 3” (single-person) schemes are not included within the legacy superannuation fund definition. This is because, generally, the settlors of these trusts retain a large degree of control over these trusts and do not need to invest on arm’s length terms. Providing a lower tax rate for these types of trusts would be inconsistent with the widely-held requirements for retirement savings vehicles like PIEs. A trust operated as a retirement savings vehicle that does not qualify for the widely-held superannuation fund or legacy superannuation fund definitions would still be eligible to be a de minimis trust (and able to apply the 33% tax rate) if trustee income for the income year does not exceed $10,000 (after deductible expenses). 18 Schedule 1, Part A, Clause 6(c) and(d) of the ITA. Page 29 of 30 Special report: 39% trustee tax rate | April 2024 Corpus and settlements on other trusts Section HC 4(3) of the ITA Amounts paid as beneficiary income and then settled on a new trust on the beneficiary’s behalf are included in the corpus of the new trust. Background A settlement by a trustee of a trust (Trust A) on another trust (Trust B) is excluded from corpus of Trust B to the extent to which, if it were distributed to a New Zealand-resident beneficiary of Trust A, it would be beneficiary income or a taxable distribution to that beneficiary. 19 This rule is intended to ensure that trustees cannot avoid paying tax on distributions of amounts accumulated in trusts simply by settling those amounts on other trusts and then distributing them as tax-free corpus. Trustees can make resettlements on behalf of beneficiaries. This involves: • a payment made by the trustee to the beneficiary for the purposes of the definitions of “beneficiary income” 20 and “distribution” 21 , and • a settlement by (trustees on behalf of) the beneficiary on the new trust. Key features The amendment clarifies the definition of corpus to ensure that a resettlement on behalf of a beneficiary is not excluded from corpus of the new trust. These settlements have not been made to avoid paying tax. The amendment ensures that such settlements are not subject to tax twice – first as beneficiary income (or a taxable distribution), then when the settlement is distributed to the beneficiary. Effective date The amendment applies for the 2024–25 and later income years (beginning 1 April 2024 for most trusts). 19 Section HC 4(3) of the ITA. 20 Section HC 6 of the ITA. 21 Section HC 14 of the ITA.

You requested the following: 1. Can you please provide me with a copy of the contract that the IRD entered into with Kantar Public to perform this work? In particular I wish to see what conditions were placed around the destruction of my personal information once the survey has been completed. 2. Please provide me with any legal advice that that was provided to support your decision to send my personal information to a third party. Your request for the Agreement that I nland Revenue has entered into with Kantar Public (formerly Colmar Brunton) is refused under section 9(2)(b)(ii) of the OIA, to protect the commercial position of the person who supplied the information or who is the subject of the information. Your request for the legal advice provided to support the sharing of information to a third party is also refused under section 9(2)(h) of the OIA, to maintain legal professional privilege. No public interest in releasing the withheld information has been identified that would be sufficient to outweigh the reasons for withholding. Use and destruction of Information Both Inland Revenue and Kantar Public are subject to the Privacy Act 2020. Information Privacy Principle (IPP) 10 states that, subject to specific exceptions, “personal information that was obtained in connection with one purpose may not use the information for any other purpose”. In addition, although Inland Revenue will not be making available a copy of it s contract with Kantar Public, I can confirm that the contract does contain strict confidentiality clauses regarding any information provided from Inland Revenue to Kantar. IPP 9 of the Privacy Act states that “an Agency that holds personal information must not keep that information for longer than is required for the purposes for which the information may lawfully be used.” Kantar has also committed to the ICC/Esomar International Code on Market, Opinion and Social Research and Data Analytics. Article 6(f) of the Code reflects the wording of IPP9, stating that “Personal data is to be held no longer than is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected or used.” Further, Inland Revenue itself is subject to the Public Records Act 2005, and the authority of the Disposal Authorities issued under that Act. A Disposal Authority sets out different categories of information together with how and when the information may be disposed of. The relevant Disposal Authorities for Inland Revenue are DA418 and GA6, which can be found on the website of Archives New Zealand at www.archives.govt.nz. Ref: 22 OIA 1777 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Disclosure of information to Kantar Inland Revenue must always use its best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system. The integrity of the tax system includes public perceptions of that integrity. The confidentiality of taxpayer information is a fundamental part of the integrity of the tax system and is a statutory obligation for all Inland Revenue personnel. There are limited exceptions (called “permitted disclosures”) to that confidentiality. One exception is in section 18D(2)(a)(iii) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which permits sensitive revenue information to be disclosed for the purpose of improving, researching or reforming the tax system. Researching the tax system is an important function because it is a means by which Inland Revenue may understand public perceptions of the integrity of the tax system (or aspects of it). Any such disclosure must be reasonable for that purpose, having regard to Inland Revenue’s obligation to protect the integrity of the tax syst em (as well as other factors). Any decision for disclosure on these grounds is always carefully considered by Inland Revenue. Right of Review If you disagree with my decisions on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decisions. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz. Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to as k the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman by email at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz.

Information requested 3.You have requested information on how easy it is for a child to get an IRD number. 4.You have also asked about ECE providers being given an opportunity to be taught the claims process. Applyi ng for IRD numbers for children 5.In recent years, we have received over 200,000 individual IRD number applications each year. Applying for an IRD number is a relatively straight forward process. 6.A parent can apply for an IRD number for their newborn child when they register the birth with Department of Internal Affairs. Many people now use the ‘SmartStart’ website to register the birth of their child. SmartStart is a website managed by the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA), providing information to expecting and new parents about the services and financial assistance available to them. There is no cost for registering a birth or for applying for an IRD number. 7.If an IRD number wasn’t issued as part of the DIA process, the parent or caregiver will need to complete an IRD number application for their child. 8.As part of the IRD number application process, the parent or caregiver will need to have identity documents for both themselves and their child. Appendix A Page 2 of 4 9. If the parent or caregiver and child are in New Zealand and the child is a New Zealand or Australian Citizen or holds a New Zealand or Australian resident visa, they can apply online or with an IRD number application form (IR595). Once they have applied, they will need to take the required identity documents to an AA driver licensing agent or to an Inland Revenue office to be verified. 10. If the child is not a New Zealand or Australian Citizen or does not hold a New Zealand or Australian resident visa, the parent or caregiver will need to complete a non- resident/offshore individual IRD number application (IR742) for their child and email it to us. As part of this we will confirm that their parent or caregiver applying for FamilyBoost is a New Zealand tax resident. 11. Once the application has been received and the identity documents have been verified, the parent will receive their child’s IRD number by text or email within 2 working days, or by post within 10 working days. Supporting Early Childhood Education providers with the claims process 12. There is no one-to-one training being provided to Early Childhood Education (ECE) providers, but we are providing them with all the information they need to support caregivers. 13. To date this has included: • a webinar and Q&A session, • FamilyBoost fact sheets, and • regular email updates with information on invoicing requirements, what caregivers need to submit a claim and tips to help caregivers with their claims. 14. When invited we are attending meetings with ECE industry bodies to discuss FamilyBoost and the registration and claims process. 15. Our External Relationship Managers are regularly engaging with the Student Management Software providers that support the ECE providers and sharing information that they can pass on to their ECEs. We will send further reminder emails when registrations and claims open. 16. We will also be providing them with instructions they can use to either assist caregivers with their claims or share with caregivers. The instructions will cover the different steps in myIR and what action they need to take. 17. The instructions are currently being tested with customers to ensure they are helpful and provide the information they need to complete their claim. FamilyBoost contingency plans 18. We have forecast up to 100,000 families may receive FamilyBoost during the first year, with up to 21,000 families receiving the full amount over the year. 19. FamilyBoost registrations will open in myIR on Tuesday 17 September. Caregivers can claim FamilyBoost for the July – September quarter in myIR from Tuesday 1 October. We will begin to see caregivers receiving payments from 4 October, allowing time to confirm income information. 20. Marketing and communications activities to support registrations and claims opening have already started and will continue through September and October. This includes advertising across digital and social media, radio and outdoor. From 17 September we will be suggesting to caregivers and ECE’s that caregivers register before claims open on 1 October, so they are ready to claim. Page 3 of 4 21. We have resourced based on the forecast figures, and we’ve been working to ensure we have our core work in a good position, in preparation for delivery of FamilyBoost. 22. As FamilyBoost is a new product, we don’t know how customers will behave when registering and claiming. We know that some caregivers may wait until claims open before registering for FamilyBoost. Queries to date also indicate that caregivers may choose to wait and make multiple claims together (for example four claims at once). 23. Caregivers may contact us for assistance with their first claim, but we anticipate this will decrease over time as they become more familiar with the claims process. 24. Our people are ready to support caregivers with their claims. If a caregiver brings their own device into our Front of House, we will be able to step them through the process on their device. If the caregiver does not bring a device, they will be talked through the process and given a copy of instructions to take with them. 25. We have a contingency plan prepared for if FamilyBoost contacts or uptake are higher than anticipated and a contingency plan for if uptake is lower than anticipated. For FamilyBoost purposes, uptake refers to caregivers who have made a claim and received a FamilyBoost payment. Potential actions if uptake is lower than anticipated 26. We can increase our advertising, this could include: • adding additional channels we aren't currently using (e.g. editorials in family- related magazines and other print publications), • increasing duration of advertising activity (e.g. running radio in longer bursts), • putting more money behind our advertising so it reaches more people at a higher frequency. 27. We can put out media releases which would be picked up and circulated by key media outlets with nationwide reach. 28. We can send more communications to Early Childhood Education providers directly. 29. We can also continue to liaise with community organisations, key industry bodies and other Government organisations that support caregivers to ensure they are promoting FamilyBoost to their customers. Potential actions if uptake or contacts are higher than anticipated 30. While FamilyBoost will be delivered by specific teams, it is a priority, and we can bring in people from the wider business as needed. 31. We can offer overtime to our people to respond to web messages and complete manual review work. Early life support 32. As part of our standard procedures, there will be an early life support period. During this period, we will be closely monitoring themes coming from our customers and people, so that we can quickly address any issues that may arise and opportunities to improve. 33. During the early life support period there will be standard reporting that will be created. We will share this with you on a weekly basis through the standard status report process. The report will include the following information: Page 4 of 4 • Registrations – number received and accounts registered • Claims accepted - received and processed (accepted) • Number of Claims and Registrations falling into manual review • Total amount of FamilyBoost paid out over all quarters and/or per quarter • How long to process claims from date received • How long to process registrations from date received • Call, web message and Front of House stats Sue Gillies Customer Segment Lead - Families s 9(2)(a) Appendix B Joint Report T2024/1960:Tax Policy Scorecard Update - Options around future of the Scorecard Page 2 Tax Policy Report: Tax Policy Scorecard Update - Options around future of the Scorecard Purpose of report 1. This report provides you with the regular update on the Tax Policy Scorecard’s balance, 1 the likely effect on the balance of upcoming changes, which changes officials have prioritised, and why. 2. This report also seeks decisions on your preferred option for managing the financial impacts of tax policy changes through the Scorecard. The Tax Policy Scorecard 3. The Scorecard is a memorandum account that allows the fiscal impacts of tax policy changes to be offset against one another, rather than being managed through Budget allowances or the between-Budget contingency. The Scorecard is expressed as a balance of the cumulative fiscal impact of all revenue-positive and revenue-negative policies managed against it. The balance covers all years from commencement of the Scorecard in 2008/09 to the end of the forecast period (which is currently 2027/28). 4. In November 2021, the then Ministers of Finance and Revenue agreed, in order to improve accountability and transparency, that: 2 a the Scorecard should be the default mechanism for managing the direct fiscal impacts of tax policy changes that improve the tax system, excluding structural changes, social policy, and departmental spending; and b the Scorecard should be broadly revenue-neutral over time, and its balance should not fall below zero nor exceed $200 million over the forecast period; and c Inland Revenue and the Treasury should report approximately 2-3 times each year on the Scorecard’s balance, the likely effect on the balance of upcoming changes, which changes officials have prioritised, and why. 5. The Scorecard provides a way for tax revenue to be reprioritised outside of the Budget process for the maintenance and improvement of the tax system. Tax policy and remedial changes managed against the Scorecard are by default traded-off against each other and not against other Budget priorities. The November 2021 report described this as a principled deviation from the Fiscal Management Approach. 3 6. Tax revenue changes that are managed against the Scorecard are included in the tax revenue forecasts with a corresponding impact on the operating balance before gains and losses (OBEGAL) and/or net core Crown debt. 1 The previous Scorecard update report was provided to you in February 2024 (Tax Policy Scorecard Update February 2024, T2024/472 refers). 2 Tax Policy Scorecard Review (T2021/1273, IR2021/551 refers). 3 Tax Policy Scorecard Review (T2021/1273, IR2021/551 refers). Joint Report T2024/1960:Tax Policy Scorecard Update - Options around future of the Scorecard Page 3 7. Changes that cannot be managed through the Scorecard should instead be considered through the Budget process. If Ministers consider that the change is sufficiently urgent and high-value, in exceptional circumstances, they can recommend to Cabinet to consider pre-committing the fiscal impacts against the Budget allowance or managing them through the between-Budget contingency (BBC). The Scorecard’s balance 8. The Scorecard’s balance was $27.232 million over the forecast period as of 29 February 2024 when officials last reported on it. 9. Since then, there have been 21 changes (largely connected to the current Annual Rates Bill) charged to it at a total net cost of $9.994 million as per the table in Appendix One, taking the balance to $17.238 million as of 19 September 2024. 10. The decline of the balance over this period has largely been driven by a single change (R&D Tax Incentive: filing under incorrect entity name), the other 20 changes have had a net impact of ~$1 million. 11. We note that, as has been the practice in previous years, the forecast period will roll out to include the 2028/29 year from October 2024. This roll-out will increase the Scorecard balance to $25.805 million over the forecast period. 12. There is currently one pending policy change (deductibility of Fonterra’s distributions, IR2024/273 refers), which could be charged against the Scorecard. If this change is agreed to, and charged against the Scorecard, this would bring the balance to $1.238 million ($0.805 million after the roll-out of the balance in October 2024). Issues arising from the low balance of the Scorecard 13. Between 2016 and 2023, the Scorecard remained broadly revenue-neutral, operating on a model of larger revenue-positive changes being offset by a stream of smaller revenue- negative changes. Since its inception in 2009 the Scorecard has never been funded from the centre (i.e. through Budget operating allowances). 14. The last significant revenue-positive change ($11 million per annum from 2024/25 onwards) managed against the Scorecard was in January 2023. 4 In August 2023, there was a significant revenue-negative change charged against the Scorecard, 5 costing $58 million over the forecast period. Since that change, the Scorecard balance has declined steadily from $52.232 million to $17.238 million (as noted above, an upcoming change could reduce the balance to $1.238 million, if agreed). 15. In recent times, within a tight fiscal environment, significant revenue-positive tax changes have been consolidated into the Budget process ( e.g. Crypto-Asset Regulatory Framework being managed against the Budget 2024 operating allowance instead of the Scorecard). In the meantime, revenue-negative tax changes have tended to be charged against the Scorecard. This practice is particularly problematic given the already low balance of the Scorecard. 4 Gig Economy (Income Tax Compliance) – IR2022/366 refers. 5 Extending deductibility of co-operative dividends - CAB-23-MIN-0397, DEV-23-MIN-0186 refers. Joint Report T2024/1960:Tax Policy Scorecard Update - Options around future of the Scorecard Page 4 16. The low balance of the Scorecard will make it increasingly difficult to progress revenue- negative tax policy changes that support the functioning and improvement of the tax system. A well-functioning tax system is important to the broader economy and is particularly important to taxpayers. Inland Revenue considers that trust in the system can be undermined where policy settings, or interpretation of existing legislation contrary to intended policy outcomes, result in situations where taxpayers are overpaying tax and the inability to manage the financial cost means that reasonable policy results cannot be achieved. 17. We note that issues will arise during the select committee process for the Annual Rates Bill that have financial implications, either through public submissions, or as matters raised by officials. Accordingly, d ecisions may need to be made with relative urgency on whether to progress changes with financial implications, and what funding mechanism to use. The Scorecard is the default mechanism to fund these changes, and in the absence of an appropriate alternative funding mechanism, important changes to the Bill may be constrained. 18. In general, Annual Rates Bill processes do not align well with the Budget cycle. Budget policy decisions, and associated funding requests, are typically approved in April prior to Budget announcements in May. Annual Rates Bill policy and remedial decisions ( and associated funding requests) are typically approved in June or July (and much later in the year for changes arising out of the select committee stage). 19. In the absence of out-of-cycle funding (which the Scorecard facilitates), the Bill process would need to have funding requests made significantly earlier. This would impact the Annual Rates Bill timeline, and the relevance and speed of delivery for proposed changes. The current timeline is framed around an August introduction date, with a four to six-month period for the Select Committee to consider the Bill, and enactment before 1 April of the following year. Options to manage the financial impacts of tax policy changes 20. Considering the low balance of the Scorecard and the potential issues covered above, officials have identified three options for managing the financial impacts of tax policy changes going forward: Option 1: Maintain the c urrent scope of the Scorecard and direct officials to report back on what revenue-positive tax policy changes from the Tax and Social Policy Work Programme (the Work Programme) could be managed against the Scorecard. (Officials' recommended option). Option 2: Limit the scope of the Scorecard as a funding mechanism to minor tax policy and remedial changes only (e.g. changes below $1 million per annum). This would involve directing officials to report back with further advice on amending the scope of the Scorecard. Option 3: Disestablish the Scorecard. This would involve directing officials to report back with further advice on disestablishing the Scorecard. Joint Report T2024/1960:Tax Policy Scorecard Update - Options around future of the Scorecard Page 5 21. Officials have outlined the options in further detail in the tables below: Option 1 – Maintain current scope Details Keep the Scorecard as the default funding mechanism for tax policy and remedial changes. Would require revenue from changes progressed through the Work Programme to be managed against the Scorecard. Impact on funding of changes Tax policy and remedial changes would be by default traded-off against each other and not against other Budget priorities. Would reduce the amount of revenue from tax policy changes that can be used to fund Budget priorities. Ministers retain discretion around which avenue to manage the financial impacts of tax policy and remedial changes (Scorecard or Budget operating allowance or the between-Budget contingency). Would not result in an increase in out-of-cycle funding requests. Impact on the tax system Prioritises the maintenance and improvement of the tax system. Remedial changes managed against the Scorecard will continue to only require Joint Ministers approval. This retains the ability to progress changes in a timely manner by avoiding the need to go through the Budget process or out-of-cycle funding process (both requiring Cabinet approval). Policy changes tend to need Cabinet approval. However, the Scorecard ensures that you retain the ability to progress these quickly without the need for an out-of-cycle funding request. Other considerations Ministers could manage a portion rather than the entire amount of revenue from a tax policy change against the Scorecard. Clear prioritisation of which tax policy and remedial changes are progressed would help to ensure that the Scorecard remains revenue- neutral over time. Additionally, a revenue-positive Work Programme would allow you to improve the balance of the Scorecard sufficiently to prevent these issues from recurring. Option 2 – Limit scope Details Any tax policy or remedial changes exceeding the set threshold (e.g. changes larger than $1 million per annum) would require funding through alternative mechanisms (such as the Budget operating allowance or the between-Budget contingency). Impact on funding of changes Minor tax policy and remedial changes would by default be traded-off against each other and not against other Budget priorities. Changes exceeding the set threshold would be traded-off against other Budget priorities. Joint Report T2024/1960:Tax Policy Scorecard Update - Options around future of the Scorecard Page 6 Remedial changes exceeding the set threshold would require Cabinet approval for funding (they only require Joint Ministers approval if managed against the Scorecard). This would make it difficult to progress these changes in a timely manner. Ministers retain ultimate discretion to manage the financial impacts of tax policy and remedial changes against the Scorecard or alternative funding mechanisms. Revenue from tax policy changes would be available to fund changes to the tax system with a cost larger than the set threshold and/or other Budget priorities through the Budget process. May result in an increase in out-of-cycle funding requests, particularly as Bill processes do not align well to the Budget cycle. Impact on the tax system Prioritises the maintenance and improvement of the tax system only through minor tax policy and remedial changes. Deprioritises changes that target maintenance and improvement of the tax system with costs that exceed the set threshold. May undermine trust in the tax system if the Government is unable to respond to issues in a timely manner. Other considerations Setting the threshold will create a relatively arbitrary cut-off point and will lead to further issues (such as whether the threshold should be inflation indexed). Diminishes the ability to reprioritise in the tax revenue space, for changes that exceed the set threshold, outside of the Budget process. In theory revenue-neutral or revenue-positive packages are possible for tax policy and remedial changes (outside of Budget). In practice, any change over the set threshold that is unable to be netted-off against other changes, at the time of approval, would require central funding. Option 3 – Disestablish Scorecard Details Disestablishing the Scorecard would mean that all tax policy and remedial changes would require funding through alternative mechanisms (such as the Budget operating allowance or the between- Budget contingency). Impact on funding of changes All tax policy and remedial changes would be traded-off against other Budget priorities. All tax policy and remedial changes would require Cabinet approval for funding. This would make it difficult to progress changes in a timely manner. Revenue from tax policy and remedial changes would be available to fund changes to the tax system and/or other Budget priorities. Joint Report T2024/1960:Tax Policy Scorecard Update - Options around future of the Scorecard Page 7 Would result in an increase in out-of-cycle funding requests, particularly as Annual Bill processes do not align well to the Budget cycle. Impact on the tax system Deprioritises the maintenance and improvement of the tax system. Would undermine trust in the tax system as the Government becomes less able to respond to tax issues in a timely manner. Other considerations Removes the ability to reprioritise in the tax revenue space, outside of the Budget process. In theory revenue-neutral or revenue-positive packages are possible for tax policy and remedial changes (outside of Budget). In practice, any change that is unable to be netted-off against other changes, at the time of approval, would require central funding. Tax and Social Policy Work Programme Implications 22. Officials have recently reported to you on the setting of the Work Programme. (TR2024/2482; IR2024/362 refers). 23. There are a number of tax policy changes being considered for the Work Programme that improve the tax system and are not structural or social policy changes and therefore would by default be managed against the Scorecard. 24. The current low balance of the Scorecard means that none of the revenue-negative changes can be charged without revenue-positive changes being managed alongside them. If you agree to Option 1, officials will report back to you on what revenue-positive tax policy changes from the Work Programme could be managed in whole or partially against the Scorecard. Managing revenue-positive tax policy changes against the Scorecard would have to be traded-off against funding other Budget priorities through the Budget process. 25. Progressing a revenue-positive Work Programme would allow you to improve the balance of the Scorecard sufficiently to prevent these issues from recurring, provided that there was also clear prioritisation of what revenue-negative items are progressed. 26. Inland Revenue considers the Scorecard to be important for the remedials aspect of the work programme. Outstanding remedial items with financial impacts will be more publicly visible if a remedial issues log is published (the Minister of Revenue has asked Inland Revenue to prepare a proposal for this). Inland Revenue expect that not progressing remedials in a timely manner because of their cost would result in complaints from stakeholders. Next steps 27. Officials will report back to you in line with the option you choose. 28. Officials propose to report in February 2025 on any further changes to the Tax Policy Scorecard’s balance, if you wish to continue to support its operation. Joint Report T2024/1960:Tax Policy Scorecard Update - Options around future of the Scorecard Page 8 Recommended Action We recommend that you: a note that Ministers previously instructed officials to provide regular updates on the balance of the Tax Policy Scorecard (“the Scorecard”); Hon Nicola Willis Hon Simon Watts Noted Noted b note that the Scorecard’s balance as of 19 September 2024 is $17.238 million over the forecast period; Hon Nicola Willis Hon Simon Watts Noted Noted c note that you have a pending decision that could reduce the balance of the Scorecard to $1.238 million over the forecast period ( IR2024/273 refers); Hon Nicola Willis Hon Simon Watts Noted Noted d note that the low balance of the Scorecard and the current fiscal environment (tension around managing any significant revenue-positive changes against the Scorecard or the Budget operating allowance) will make it increasingly difficult to progress revenue- negative tax policy changes that support the functioning and improvement of the tax system; Hon Nicola Willis Hon Simon Watts Noted Noted EITHER: e agree to maintain the current scope of the Scorecard and direct officials to report back on what revenue-positive tax policy changes from the Tax and Social Policy Work Programme could be managed against the Scorecard (Option 1 - Officials’ recommended option); Hon Nicola Willis Hon Simon Watts Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed OR e agree to limit the scope of the Scorecard as a funding mechanism to only minor tax policy and remedial changes (e.g. changes below $1 million per annum), and direct officials to report back with further advice on amending the scope of the Scorecard (Option 2); Hon Nicola Willis Hon Simon Watts Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed Joint Report T2024/1960:Tax Policy Scorecard Update - Options around future of the Scorecard Page 9 OR e agree to disestablish the Scorecard and manage the financial implications of all future tax policy and remedial changes against alternative funding mechanisms such as the Budget operating allowance or the between-Budget contingency, and direct officials to report back with further advice on disestablishing the Scorecard (Option 3).

This is because it relies on stylised scenarios and assumptions. Different assumptions could lead to different outcomes. 3.For example, Rashbrooke’s comparison focuses on salary and capital gains and does not consider the taxation of business income and retained earnings in companies. This is likely to be important as business income is important for top earners. 4.In addition, the OECD study includes social security contributions that are common in many other countries. However, it does not include consumption taxes such as GST which is higher in New Zealand (when accounting for its broad base in New Zealand) than some other countries. 5.Despite these observations, we can conclude that top earners in New Zealand who earn significant capital gains are likely to have relatively lighter taxation than in many other countries. However, it is challenging to draw broader conclusions about the overall taxation of top earners from the research. 1 Rashbrooke, M. (2024). High earner tax rates: New Zealand in context. School of Government, Victoria University of Wellington. 2 Hourani, D., Millar-Powell, B., Perret, S., & Ramm, A. (2023). The taxation of labour vs. capital income: A focus on high earners. OECD Taxation Working Papers No. 65. https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/04f8d936-en Appendix C Page 2 of 2 6. The report compares tax rates for high earners in New Zealand and nine other countries under different scenarios (100% salary, 100% capital gains, and a 50:50 split). New Zealand’s effective tax rate for a high earner with a 50:50 income split is 14%, significantly lower than the 28-44% range in comparator countries. 7. Rashbrooke presents the following table for someone earnings 5x the average wage in each individual country. Country Tax rate if income is 100% salary Tax rate if income is 100% capital gains Tax rate if half salary, half capital gains New Zealand 33% 0% 14% Australia 41% 17% 29% US 37% 20% 28% UK 42% 17% 28% Canada 45% 17% 31% Denmark 51% 42% 44% Norway 42% 31% 35% Germany 44% 26% 35% Belgium 55% 0% 26% Spain 37% 22% 26% 8.

Ref: 22OIA1566 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 22 February 2022 Dear Thank you for your response to Inland Revenue’s letter from our Ministerial and Escalated Complains team received on 24 January 2022. We have considered your questions as a request under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA). You requested the following: •Why is IRD not telling us how many payees are dying? •Why are we not able to see the average age of death of payees vs general public? •Is there any internal IRD report on cessation of payments due to death? •Is anyone in IRD looking at the difference in life expectancy between a child support payees and the general public? •If this data is already being collected. Is IRD passing this information on to the responsible government department? •Does IRD have processes in place to make sure they aren't causing harm? Is this measured? What reports are produced. Can I request these via an Official information act request? •IF there is no IRD report on deceased payees, can I please request this (non confidential data). How can I request this? Is there a list of what's able to be requested via an official information act request? Inland Revenue has a Memoranda of Understanding with Te Tari Taiwhenua/Department of Internal Affairs (DIA), where information shared under this agreement is used for the purpose of identifying deceased customers and verifying their details. The i nformation matching assessment must pass a number of validations to ensure that Inland Revenue has the correct person. This information is then used to update Inland Revenue’s system for both tax and social policy reasons, including date of death. As mentioned in the letter provided to you by on 17 January 2022, Inland Revenue does not hold information on the effect child support matters may impose on someone’s mental health, therefore no findings are able to be published in relation to this. However, we were a ble to look at the data we hold for the last 5 years and found that Inland Revenue ha s had 145,923 male \* liable parents during this timeframe. The current average age of a liable parent is 40 years, with the youngest being 17 and the eldest is 92. Of these 145,923 individuals, we have recorded 1,609 as ceasing obligation due to death, with the average age of death being 44 years. The cause of death is not known for all individuals as this information is not recorded by Inland Revenue. Information around the average age of death for males in New Zealand is available here: https://www.stats.govt.nz/topics/life-expectancy . \* Unless the individual has contacted Inland Revenue to update the gender that they identify as, the gender we are reporting on will be based on the identification documents used to apply for an IRD number. Often this is the gender assigned at birth as per their birth certificate. www.ird.govt.nz Page 2 of 3 Ref: 22 OIA1566 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Inland Revenue’s teams are very adept at working with our customers as they work right across all aspects of child support, from processing applications, taking phone calls regarding various types of queries, through to debt collection. We are proud of the fact that our staff genuinely care about our customers and strive to get the best outcomes for all parties involved, taking into account each individual’s personal circumstances. However, as mentioned by our people are not trained counsellors, and so if they believe an act of self-harm is a possibility, Inland Revenue staff are advised to contact the police. touched on the intention of the Child Support Act 1991 in his letter to you, and the legislation that Inland Revenue must work within. Our teams are empowered to do everything they can within the legislation to ensure that the best outcome is achieved for all parties involved, including for the qualifying children in the child support relationship. If a liable parent is struggling to pay their assessment, then Inland Revenue offers a number of options to help them. These include (but are not limited to): • Estimation of income: If a liable parent’s income drops 15% or more compared to the income used for the child support assessment, they may be able to estimate their income, which could reduce the amount they have to pay Inland Revenue. More information can be found on Inland Revenue’s website: https://www.ird.govt.nz/child-support/managing/income . • Administrative review: If a liable parent thinks that the amount we have worked out in our formula assessment does not take their special circumstances into account, they can apply for a child support review: https://www.ird.govt.nz/child- support/reviews-objections-exemptions/reviews. • Departure Order: If a liable parent is unhappy with the outcome of the administrative review, they can ask the Family Court for a Departure Order. Information on how to apply can be found on the Ministry of Justice’s website: https://www.justice.govt.nz/family/paternity-and-child-support/child- support/appeal-an -inland-revenue-decision. These options are also available to receiving carers. Inland Revenue understands that all our customers have complex lives, and we work with them around what options are available to them under the legislation we administer. From 1 April 2021, we stopped charging ongoing late payment penalties to overdue child support. We may be able to reduce or remove the penalties applied to a liable parents account from before this date if they contact us and arrange to pay, or set up a payment plan. More information about how to resolve child support debt can be found on Inland Revenue’s website: https://www.ird.govt.nz/child-support/managing/debt/liable-parents . You requested any reports written on deceased liable parents, reports on either cessation of child support payments due to death, or life expectancy of liable parents. No reports are produced in relation to your question as no government agency requires this type of reporting at this time.

www.ird.govt.nz 1 Ref: 22OIA1729 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 22April 2022 Dear Thank you for your Official Information Act 1982 request, received on 29 March 2022. Your request is in relation to the recruitment of middle to senior management staff at Inland Revenue. Your questions are listed throughout the response. Question 1: Would a candidate applying for a leadership/management type position in your organisation be required to do a task before the interview? (i.e. a phone screen, pre-test, etc) Or would the candidate have to complete a task after the interview such as - an aptitude test, numeracy/literacy or psychological profiling? Or are the interview and reference checking essentially the total recruitment process? Recruitment processes are tailored to each individual role, agreed in discussion between the Hiri ng Leader and the member of the Talent Team assigned to support the recruitment (the Recruiter). The Recruiter would usually screen candidates to confirm their understanding of the role, salary expectations and any additional questions as decided by the Recruiter and Hiring Leader before the interview. All candidates would complete an interview and be asked to provide at least one referee as a minimum. Depending on the nature of the role and the candidate pool (for example, senior and external candidates) candidates may also be asked to complete an additional task, exercise, presentation, or psychometric testing. The task would usually be part of the interview or post-interview. The Recruiter would then complete two reference checks for the preferred candidate. Question 2: How are applicants chosen to be interviewed? (See the options below from a to c) (a) A representative from Human Resources goes through the candidate pool of CV’s received? (b) A representative from HR and the hiring manager go through the candidates? (c) The hiring manager acting alone selects who is to be interviewed? Mostly B - The Hi ring Leader and the Recruiter agree on a shortlisting criteria and strategy in a briefing call. Depending on the nature of the role and the number of applicants, a Recruiter might create an initial longlist for the Hiring Panel to review and confirm a shortlist to interview. For some roles, the Hiring Panel would review all applications. Question 3: Does your organisation use ‘BEI’ type interviews for middle/senior leadership/management interviews? Question 4: If the answer to the above is ‘no’ how would you describe the type of interviews that are carried out? Inland Revenue’s interview s are based on its 12 People Capabilities and behaviour-based questions which relate to key requirements and capabilities of the role. C andidates are asked to provide specific examples of times when they have demonstrated a behaviour in 2 Ref: 22OIA1729 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] the past. Candidates are advised they are free to draw on examples from a wide range of previous experiences. Question 5: Is a representative from HR on the interview panel? (Never/Always/Some times?) Sometimes, this is role dependent. Question 6: For ‘BEI’ style interviews does each panel member score the candidate and then these scores are combined to tally up to a grand total score? Panel members agree on scores for each question together at the end of the interview, th e y do not tally up individual panel member scores. Question 7: Could a candidate who scores lower than the top scorer (e.g. came in second) still be considered the preferred candidate? In some instances, a candidate that scores lower than the top scorer can be the preferred ca n didate. Question 8: What are some of the factors or conditions that might give rise to the above in question #8 above? (I.e. – team fit, personality, how panel felt about them?) Other factors? • Motivation – I nland Revenue would like candidates to have a genuine motivation towards the role, the work for the department and the public sector. • Background checks – if a candidate’s background checks are not satisfactory post interview, then the second highest scoring candidate may be the preferred candidate for the role. • Complimentary skills and experience – Inland Revenue would like candidate’s skills and experience to compliment the team that they will be a part of. Question 9: Are those in your organisation who do the interviewing trained in the BEI interview method? The Talent or Recruitment team at Inland Revenue are able to offer guidance to panel mem bers who are less experienced in our interviewing process. There are also interview guides on rating scale information and guides for what to look for in quality responses available to the interview panel. Question 10: Once a candidate has been selected and employed by your organisation do you keep a record of how long he/she stays with the organisation? (length of tenure) Yes, Inland Revenue records the start date of each employee and keep a record of the length of tenure. Question 11: Or do you keep records of how that candidate is tracking regards their role? (good performance appraisals, improvements plans? Unsatisfactory performance?) Inland Revenue’s operates a performance approach which centres around regular coaching an d performance conversations between our people and their leaders. During these conversations, our people and their leaders discuss things that enable our people to perform now and into the future. This includes matters such as good performance, performance goals and incidences of unsatisfactory performance. Our people and their leaders are encouraged to take notes at these meetings to refer back to between and at subsequent meetings as a way to build on and develop the conversations. The outcomes and insights shared and gained at these meetings are used to inform organisational talent conversations and development planning. Essentially the insights are used and considered when considering capability needs, gaps and development opportunities. 3 Ref: 22OIA1729 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] In terms of unsatisfactory performance, leaders would discuss any instances of this with their leader. Continued unsatisfactory performance and performance improvement plans are recorded and formally agreed between the individual and the leader, with regular check-in and review meetings scheduled through-out the plan. Question 12: Have you ever surveyed applicants who have been interviewed as to how they feel about the BEI interview process? If so, please share these results. We have not surveyed applicants on t he BEI interview process. We are in the process of creating a candidate survey to obtain feedback on the overall recruitment process from applicants in the future. Question 13: Does your organisation ever use recruitment firms to source candidates? (I.e. this approach is sometimes use for specialist positions or senior management type roles) Yes, for some roles we reach out to recruitment agen cies to assist with sourcing for high volume, hard to fill or specialist positions. Question 14: The candidate pool since COVID-19 – March, 2020. In your view has the pool of candidates changed or got smaller since March, 2020. Has it taken longer to recruit for roles or have some roles remained vacant? Have there been other flow on effects since COVID-19 impacted in March 2020? The candidate pool in New Zealand has decreased with COVI D-19 due to the borders being closed and the vaccine mandates. Hiring Leaders have also become more open to candidates in different locations within New Zealand as well as part time, more remote working and different worker types e.g. Contingent Workers. Being more efficient in the recruitment process has been necessary for Inland Revenue to secure good candidates as they often have more than one offer. Publishing of OIA response Please note that Inland Revenue regularly publishes, on its website, responses to requests that may be of interest to the wider public. Your personal details or any information that would identify you will be removed prior to it being published. Thank you again for your request. I trust that the information provided is of assistance to you. Yours sincerely Eri na Clayton Enterprise Services, People & Workplace Services

www.ird.govt.nz Ref: 23OIA1673 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 7 February 2023 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 19 December 2023. You requested the following: ... for early childhood education providers, with data organised by financial year for the last 7 financial years where you have data available: Income data (average, range, median, etc) Company tax paid Unpaid tax debt With your request you provided some context, noting that your objective was to understand financial data for the early childhood education (ECE) sector and whether there was a declining or improving trend. You also supplied a list of ECE centres from a publicly available register but noted that these entities are not all necessarily taxpaying entities, as some will be structured into corporate groups and/or be tax exempt. Information being released Company tax For incomes and company tax we are releasing summary statistics from IR4 company tax returns where the customer has used a pre-school education industry code. The register, which you supplied, does not hold IRD numbers and could not easily be matched to Inland Revenue data without significant analytical effort. However, we do already hold industry codes (also known as business industry classification, or BIC codes) for our business customers. Codes with the first four characters “P801” cover the pre- school education sector. The information provided in tables 1 and 2 in the Appendix is filtered by taxpayers using this code, who are also structured as a company, and who filed an IR4 company tax return. Because your request is focussed on company tax, the information supplied does not include other entities such as partnerships, trusts, or unincorporated businesses which may be operating in this sector. We have interpreted your request to be for the last seven complete financial years. The seven-year period you have requested covers 2014/15 to 2020/21 as the most recent year for which complete information is available. Tax returns for 2021/22 are still being filed. This period incorporates a major systems change for Inland Revenue as part of our business transformation programme. Income tax returns for 2018/19 onwards were filed under the new system, and there is a structural break in the series volumes because customer accounts (i.e. branches) are now handled slightly differently. One consequence of this change is that there are now a greater volume of customer returns identified with nil taxable income. A structural change in overall volumes will affect statistics, such as means and medians, and will make any trends difficult to interpret. Because of this, we have provided the requested income and company tax data tables twice. Table 1 includes nil returns, and Table 2 excludes them. Table 2 may be more useful for your stated intent as it provides a more consistent time series, without being heavily impacted by the structural break from our systems migration. Ref: 23OIA1673 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The income variable provided is taxable income. This is calculated after any brought forward losses have been claimed which may have reduced taxable income to nil. Any current-year net loss is also treated as nil taxable income in these tables. The company tax variable is residual income tax. This is tax payable by the company directly and is net of any withholding tax credits from any income streams on which the tax has already been paid. Debt Aligning what we are providing for company tax, we are releasing debt information for companies that have used a pre-school education industry code. This information is provided in table 3 in the Appendix. To align with our standard debt reporting methodology, the debt information provided is the total value of debt as at the last day of each respective tax year, rather than the debt attributed to that tax year. The debt information has been separated by tax product including Income Tax, Employer (PAYE), GST. The remainder of smaller tax products have been grouped into the “Other” category. The average, median and quartile information provided applies to the total debt value. Information being refused Data related to income ranges (maximum amounts) is considered sensitive revenue and therefore refused under section 18(c)(i) of the OIA as making the requested information available would be contrary to the provisions of a specified enactment, namely Inland Revenue’s confidentiality obligation in section 18 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). Disclosure of this information does not fall within any of the exceptions to the confidentiality obligation listed in sections 18D to 18J of the TAA. Right of Review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz. Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman by email at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz. If you choose to have an internal review, you can still ask the Ombudsman for a review. Publishing of OIA response Please note that Inland Revenue regularly publishes responses to requests that may be of interest to the wider public on its website. We consider this response is of public interest so will publish this response in due course. Your personal details or any information that would identify you will be removed prior to it being published. Thank you again for your request. Yours sincerely Sandra Watson Policy Lead, Forecasting and Analysis
Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Kaupapa me te Tiaki i ngā Ture 55 Featherston Street PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 New Zealand T.04-890 1500 23 May 2022 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA) received 21 April 2022. You requested the following: Whether the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or Inland Revenue has received requests from individuals for tax relief in relation to lump sum back payments of weekly compensation under the Accident Compensation Act 2022 (either under section 176 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 or other relevant legislation) and, if so: 1.How many such requests the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or Inland Revenue have received in the last ten years 2.The outcomes of those applications (if any) from the past ten years, including whether tax relief was granted and the reasoning for the decision to grant or not grant tax relief 3.Copies of Inland Revenue's internal policies, guidelines, etc in relation to how back paid weekly compensation under the Accident Compensation Act that is paid in a lump sum should be taxed 4.Any correspondence between Inland Revenue and the Accident Compensation Corporation on the taxation of lump sum back paid weekly compensation under the Accident Compensation Act (this can be narrowed to correspondence in relation to the policy approach of taxing such payments, and can exclude correspondence relating to particular individual's payments/taxation) 5.Any advice, briefings, etc given to Inland Revenue or the Accident Compensation Corporation's relevant Minister(s) in relation to the taxation of lump sum back paid weekly compensation under the Accident Compensation Act On 22 April 2022, we asked you to clarify your request regarding the type of tax relief, the tax records you are seeking, and the type of correspondence you would be happy to receive, to which you replied: Question 1 - Yes, that is the tax relief I was meaning. I understand that to be under section 176 of the TAA as per my initial request, but there may be other relevant legislation I’m not aware of. Question 2 - I am after incidents where individuals have applied to the CIR for tax relief (ie, in the event of financial hardship) in relation to an ACC lump sum. Would the IRD have any record of such applications (even at a high level) without needing www.ird.govt.nz to go into individuals tax records? I do not really need information about the complaints. If this information cannot be gathered, even a summary or high level overview of how many people have applied for tax relief in relation to ACC lump sum payments and have not been successful will be fine. Question 3 - Yes, the internal file notes and reports you have referred to will be sufficient. Questions One & Two– Taxpayers who had received ACC lump sum payments and financial hardship relief As previously discussed in our email dated 27 April 2022, we endervoured to locate the specific information you requested on the number and outcome of any requests for tax relief for taxpayers who had received lump sum payments from ACC. We had previously noted that it was unlikel y someone who had received a lump sum payment would be given tax relief on the basis of hardship as they had just received funds to settle any tax liabilities that may be outstanding. We also noted that it would also be unlikely that a person was granted a hardship or other relief from tax payable on a lump sum payment from ACC as the way in which the law applies to such payments is clear and settled (i.e., that the lump sum amount is taxed in the year of receipt). If there were cases that intersected with these two features any hardship relief received would more likely be for other reasons. However, we did attempt to identify any cases that may fit within your request and, as expected, were unable to produce this information specifically. T o attempt to idenity those isolated cases would require us to go through individual tax records, which would require substantial efforts. Therefore, we have refused your request under section 18(f) of the OIA, as the information requested cannot be made available without substantial collation or research. Question Three – Internal guidelines on the taxation of ACC lump sum payments The following paragraphs are from our internal knowledge base for staff: If the taxpayer is entitled to a backdated payment, ACC will provide them with an information sheet explaining when a backdated compensation applies and how the amount is calculated. Taxpayers who were entitled to ACC weekly compensation but did not receive it, may be entitled to a backdated payment. Any backdated payment received from ACC is considered to be taxable income in the year in which the customer receives it. This can increase the taxpayer’s tax liability for the year and also impact their Working for Families entitlement, Child Support obligations, or student loan repayments. The lump sum is is taxed by ACC as normal under PAYE rules (being a current year receipt and taxable in the year of receipt as an extra pay). This amount is reflected in the employment information provided to Inland Revenue by ACC. Lump sum payments Lump sum payments (also called extra pays) include: •annual or special bonuses (regular bonuses aren't included and should be taxed as per normal) •cashed up holiday pay •retiring or redundancy payments •payments for accepting restrictive covenants •exit inducement payments •gratuities •remedial payments •lump sum holiday pay •employee share scheme benefits If a customer believes they will be overtaxed on their lump sum payment (usually if they have more than one job) they can apply for a special tax code. The employee can also elect to have their lump sum/bonus/allowance taxed at a higher rate, for example if they have another job or other untaxed income. The employee needs to advise the employer if they want a higher rate to apply and this rate is used in the calculation. Details required for calculation •Tax code •Payment frequency •Date of calculation •Lump sum figure (gross or net) •Last four weeks income from this employer More information on this can be found on Inland Revenue’s website (ird .govt.nz ) by searching for “Calculate PAYE for a lump sum payment.” The taxing of lump sums has been tested in the Courts. In Hollis v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/case-summaries/2021/csum-21-09), it was found that in cases involving backdated ACC payments, the taxpayer derives the income when it is received and that it cannot be spread back to earlier years to which the computation of income relates. The High Court case (Hollis v CIR (2010) 24NZTC 23,967 (HC) has become the leading authority in this area of law; a lump sum payment is taxed on a cash basis (i.e., in the year of receipt) in accordance with BD 3(2) of the Income tax Act 2007. Questions Four & Five – reports and correspondence relating to advice on ACC lump sum payments provided to Ministers The documents in scope are attached and in the table below. Some information is witheld under seciont 9(2)(a) of the OIA, to protect the privacy of natural persons.

Page | 1 Policy Commissioning Paper –taxation of lump sum payments Description of policy issue(s) This document summarises the following potential issues for consideration on the taxation of lump sum payments: • How fairness concerns arising from the current tax treatment of lump sum payments that span a number of tax years can be addressed; and • The more technical issue of back-dated lump-sums and how they should be treated for PAYE purposes (e.g., whether they should be treated as an extra pay) The tax treatment of lump sum payments is currently listed on the current tax work programme under business transformation. This paper recommends that this issues’ inclusion is re-affirmed on the tax policy work programme and that the project is allocated and progressed with a medium priority. This paper also recommends that the technical issue of whether back-dated payments should be treated as extra pay be included on the tax policy work programme with a low priority. Fairness concerns with the taxation of lump sum payments Under current tax law a lump sum employment income payment is subject to income tax (including PAYE) when the payment is made/received. Lump sum payments may include employment income that covers a number of income years, f or example, a lump sum payment of ACC weekly compensation which covers a number of tax years due to a dispute over entitlement. This gives rise to fairness concerns due to possible over-taxation in the year received compared to if the payment had been received in the relevant years that it relates to. One example of backdated lump sum payment which is commonly raised is ACC back-payments; these payments have been the subject of multiple ministerials over the past 2 years, and have been raised in submissions on tax bills. However, other payments with similar characteristics should also be considered, for example payments made by MSD. Whether back-dated payments should be treated as extra pay A recent IR interpretation of the law about the tax treatment of payments of back-dated holiday pay potentially raises policy issues about the tax treatment of a broader range of back-dated lump payments 1 , such as: • Whether back-dated lump sum remedial payments of entitlement under other enactments (such as minimum wage legislation) should also always be taxed as an extra pay; or • Whether all back-dated lump sum payments of salary or wages should be taxed as an extra pay. Recent changes to tax legislation clarified that back-dated remedial payments of entitlements under the Holidays Act 2003 and/or an employment agreement should be treated as extra pay for the purpose of the PAYE rules. This technical issue would consider whether this treatment should be extended to clarify this treatment for any other types of back-dated payments. 1 ht tps://www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/op-positions/op-position-calculating-paye-holiday.html Not in scope Page | 2 Policy context and purpose Ministerial engagement We have discussed the fairness concerns relating to lump sum payments with Ministers on several occasions. July 2017 This matter was discussed with Ministers in the context of the holiday pay entitlements being miscalculated by numerous employers in both the private and public sector and the need for employers to make remediation lump sum payments. The Cabinet paper Withholding tax treatment of backdated remedial payments of employment related entitlements (EGI-17-MIN-0228) noted that policy officials will consider the how potential fairness concerns arising from the timing of lump sum payments could be addressed as part of IR’s business transformation and officials would report back to Ministers in due course. February 2018: Officials reported to the Minister of Revenue in February 2018 seeking consideration for whether the matter should be included in the refreshed tax policy work programme. January 2019 CA ANZ raised the issue over-taxation of lump payments in their submission on the PAYE error correction and adjustment issues paper and suggested in relation ACC weekly compensation that recipients should have the option of having it taxed in the year it relates to or taxed when it is paid. Officials responded to the submission as follows: Officials consider that the issues need to be looked at in a wider framework to ensure other payments of a similar nature are also considered as part of potential options to create an ability to spread payments over years to which they relate for the purposes of tax. Officials note that this submission raises issues that would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Private sector comments/views Fairness issue As noted above, the issue was raised by CAANZ in their submission on the Taxation (Annual Rates Modernising Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Bill. OliverShaw in their submission on the BT individuals’ discussion document discussed the issue of the taxation of ACC lump sum payments spanning a number of tax years. This was in the context of personal service rehabilitation payments. This point was also raised in their submission on the Taxation (Annual Rates Modernising Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Bill. Back-dated payments treated as an extra pay Business NZ, in relation to the back-payment of holiday pay issue, emphasised the need for consistency of approach and indicated that they thought all back-dated payments of the types of payments included in the tax definition of salary or wages should be treated as an extra pay. Not in scope Page | 3 Public sector comments/views Both ACC and MSD have raised concerns with the tax treatment of back-payments of weekly compensation, benefits and NZ superannuation. MSD considers that they are required to apply to the tax rates that applied during the benefit and NZ superannuation entitlement period to any adjustment to benefits and NZ superannuation and are looking at changes their systems to reflect this. Framework and assumptions A well-established tax principle is that employment income is earned on a cash basis – that is when the payment is received / paid. This means that PAYE is withheld when the payment is made by an employer and is derived by the employee when the payment is received. The officials’ issues paper PAYE error correction and adjustment discussed the tax treatment of underpayments of PAYE income and noted the officials were not proposing to change the above principle 2 . The two issues arose in the context of the miscalculation of holiday pay. They are distinct issues and can be progressed separately. The fairness issue can be viewed a significant policy issue as it may impact on employers and employees and may require changes to a fundamental tax principle – this will depend on possible solutions. Fairness issue from lump sum payments which relate to multiple tax years A key trade-off in relation to the over-taxation and fairness issue will be where the compliance costs fall in terms of possible solutions – on the employer or the employee and what role can IR play. In addition, there is revenue / fairness trade-off as allowing this income to be spread over multiple years is likely to have revenue implications. It is important to provide a consistent framework which may be applied for all relevant lump sum payments, rather than addressing one type (e.g., ACC payments) in isolation. Clarification of back-dated payments as extra pay Tax rules should be simple to understand and provide certainty – treating all back-payments as an extra pay could reduce compliance costs and increase certainty. It is less likely that PAYE will be over-withheld if a lump sum payment is treated as an extra pay compared with salary or wages. If a lump sum payment is treated as salary or wages the calculation of the amount of tax to be withheld from the payment would be based on the assumption that the back-payment represented a permanent increase in salary or wages, rather than an additional one-off payment. The back-dated payments issue is more of technical issue clarifying the law to provide certainty and reduce compliance costs. 2 http://taxpolicy ird.govt.nz/publications/2017-ip-paye-error-correction/chapter-3 - Paragraphs 3.17 to 3 19. Not in scope Page | 4 Policy impact and quality Materiality Without undertaking evidential surveys of employers including ACC and MSD on the number and size of lump sum payments that span tax years we have limited information to assess the materiality of the issues. Scope Fairness issue There is the question of whether this issue should just focus on income tax or should it include social policy programmes administered by Inland Revenue. The inclusion of social policy programmes such as WfFTCs would broaden the scope of the project and depending on solutions could have a negative (fiscal impact on customers) in terms of back years. Types of lump sum payments which relate to back-years include: • accident compensation payments (ACC) • payments made by MSD • back-dated salary or wages ordered by the Employment Relations Authority or Employment Court There may also be other types of lump sum payments relating to back-years, including under pay equity legislation. The February report to the Minister discussed several options for an alternative tax treatment for lump sum payments. Two of the key issues are whether • Back-dated lump sum payments should be spread back over relevant income years. • If tax and social assistance (both IR and MSD administered) impacts should be separated If alternate treatments are warranted, an additional issue is who should have to obtain the alternative treatment: whether that is the payer, payee or if Inland Revenue is able to recognise these types of payments and intervene. If the payer (e.g., MSD or ACC) has to apply a different treatment for calculating the tax, it would incur administrative costs for these other agencies. PAYE treatment of Back-dated payments The scope should be limited to backdated-payments of PAYE income that could be treated as salary or wages. Interdependencies The BT individuals’ project is focusing on ensuring that withholding tax deducted during the year is more accurate. These two issues therefore have some interrelationship with this BT project. Policy approach and collaboration Timeframes and key milestones A decision is sought as to whether these matters should be included on the tax policy work programme. In terms of priority and the Government’s focus that everyone pay their fair share, according to their means, the fairness issue should have a higher priority than the back-dated Not in scope Page | 5 payment issue. If tax is over-withheld on back-dated payments the customer will receive a tax refund at the end of the year. Based on the above analysis, the following priority should be afforded to these issues: • Over-taxation /fairness – medium to high • Back-dated payments - low Collaboration Fairness - Some early collaboration with key stakeholder to better understand the problem definition and the options to address the potential over-taxation. This early collaboration would focus on the trade-off of where the compliance costs fall – the employer, the employee and Inland Revenue. Key stakeholders include CA ANZ, Business NZ, NZLS, CTG, ACC and MSD. There will be some merit in understanding the scope of START as to whether solutions that focus on the employee rather than the employer can be delivered. We have had initial conversations with SD&I around the potential impact of this project. It is important to keep SD&I involved in order to understand the opportunities or impacts from any potential solutions. A PIA may be required. Back-dated payments – Some early collaboration with key stakeholders to better understand the priority of issue would be beneficial. We are engaging with MSD currently on adjustments to benefit and NZ superannuation entitlements. There may be some merit in seeking some technical/legal advice on the scope of the current law in whether a back-payment of salary or wages is an extra pay or a payment of salary or wages. Recommendations It recommended that: (a) The fairness issue be included in the refreshed tax policy work programme with a medium priority (b) The lump sums being treated as an extra pay issue be included on the tax policy work programme as an unallocated issue with a low priority or be considered as a remedial item.

1 Ref: 21OIA1676 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 25 June 2021 Dear Ms Thank you for your Official Information Act (OIA) request of 25 May 2021, made to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development and transferred to Inland Revenue on 27 May 2021. You requested: An update of the Residential Time Series Graph information on residential rental income, last provided to us on 24 April 2018. This also included a table of the total Net Rental Income by Tax year from 1981. The information for tax years ended 2019 and 2020 would be sufficient. Before 2019/20, the rental income data was collated from the ‘net rents’ question on IR3 personal tax returns and, for other entities, from net profits where that entity had described their industry as residential rentals. Some commercial or other non-residential rental activity may be included in the personal data. For other entities, some other forms of business income may also be included. From 2019/20, residential property loss ringfencing 1 has applied. This new policy resulted in significant changes to income tax returns, specifically regarding ringfenced residential rental income or losses. Net ringfenced income is now explicitly disclosed on tax returns, and includes rental flows and net income derived from the disposal of (ringfenced) residential properties, particularly under the bright-line rules. Other rental income not caught by the residential rental ringfencing rules 2 remain with a similar treatment to prior years: information is collected as ‘other rents’ from natural persons on IR3 returns and ‘other business or rental activity’ from other entities. These fields do not include non-ringfenced property sales, which are asked for separately. The structural breaks in the data supply have affected the residential rental time series that we were previously able to provide. To respond to your request, two data series have been provided as Appendix A: one series with the ‘other rents’ data in 2019/20 excluded, and the second series with the ‘other rents’ data of 2019/20 included. For 2019/20, both series include the tax impact of the sale of ringfenced property, which was not included in previous years. The graphs for the corresponding data series are provided in Appendix B. 1 Ringfenced properties are primarily residential rentals. 2 Examples of non-ringfenced rental income are commercial rental properties (to the extent that our industry code approach did not filter these out), holiday homes taxed under the mixed-use asset rules, and rental properties, residential or otherwise, held on revenue account. 2 Ref: 21OIA1676 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Thank you for your request.

F D RS E TE N Page 2 of 4 Ref: 22OIA1496 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] and declined. While acknowledging your comments over the materiality in declining individual receipts, you will appreciate that where there is high automated processing of claims, these tolerances also need to be set in the context of all receipts received. Question 1 The following table illustrates the number of customers who meet the following criteria: • One or more non qualifying receipts were disallowed; and • Each receipt was for a value under $100; and • Replacement qualifying receipts were subsequently received and approved for the same value. Donation Tax Credit Returns Individual Receipts Customers Receipts 31/03/2020 304 637 31/03/2021 227 462 I have also provided an additional table which sets out: • the number and value of non-qualifying donation receipts where a donation tax credit claim was declined; and • the number of investigations initiated into suspected fraudulent donation claims. Donation Tax Credit receipts for the 12-month period ending 30 June 2021 Volume Value $ Ineligible donation receipts (rounded) 429,000 $14.2m Investigations into suspected fraudulent donation claims 962 $2.5m You will see from the two tables provided that for the periods highlighted, the volume of declined and subsequently resubmitted receipts is a very low component of declined claims. The highest volumes of ineligible receipts Inland Revenue receives claims for are in relation to: • Claims for childcare fees • Duplicate receipts • Claims for private memberships • Outside of eligible claim period • Not approved donee organisation • Receipt does not relate to claimant. Question 2 The information sought on the number of contacts made with specific donee organisations is refused under section 18(f) of the OIA in that the information requested cannot be made available without substantial collation or research. While declining this element of your request, Inland Revenue has progressively shifted our emphasis to a “Right from the Start” approach to compliance and has actively sought opportunities to intervene earlier through improved information and education together with simpler and easier to use systems and processes. F D RS E TE N Page 3 of 4 Ref: 22OIA1496 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Where we see customers get it wrong, either accidentally or deliberately, we have worked with key groups to reduce the need for post-filing audit and investigation. Inland Revenue has proactively worked with a wide range of approved donee organisations to increase their understanding of eligible donations and to assist them in ensuring that donation receipts issued to customers contain the relevant information to support subsequent donation tax credit claims. This includes regular liaison with government agencies such as the Department of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Education (including direct engagement with specific schools as needed) and other groups such as the Inter-Church Bureau. Question 3 I am unable to provide a cost (or estimated cost) relating to an accepted or disallowed donation tax credit claim and your request is refused under section 18(e) of the OIA that the document alleged to contain the information requested does not exist. This said, and within the context of my response on page 1, Inland Revenue’s new technologies have allowed for advanced automation of eligibility rules and consequential processes that are applied to individual receipts with a high level of accuracy. This means that non-qualifying receipts can be identified and appropriately excepted irrespective of value, in essence enabling automated level of application of the care and management provisions. Question 4 Working with customers to get their tax assessments, entitlements or claims right is Inland Revenue’s preferred approach. However, where all other avenues fail, we will act against those who deliberately attempt to defraud New Zealand’s revenue system. The table below shows the number of customers approved for prosecution in 2020 and 2021 relating to fraudulent donation tax credit claims. Year Approved for Prosecution Sentenced 2020 3 • 1 x guilty verdict. Sentenced to seven months home detention (with special conditions imposed). 2021 7 • 1 x guilty verdict. Sentenced to seven months and three weeks home detention. Right of Review If you disagree with my decision(s) on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision(s). To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz . Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision.

Ref: 22OIA1572 1 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 28 February 2022 Public Sector Carbon Neutrality Accountability Project Dear Ri Comer Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 29 January 2022. You requested: 1. Do you have a carbon neutral plan by 2025, and if so, what is the official wording of it? 2. Do you have a carbon neutral team or committee? If so, how many are in this team, and are they trained/experts? 3. How much carbon do you emit/how are your carbon emissions measured? 4. When do you plan to phase out coal? 5. Have you transitioned to EVs and or/hybrids? Have you begun to downsize your fleet size? 6. How far along are you in meeting the NABERSNZ rating requirement for large buildings? Inland Revenue has an Annual Review by Parliament’s Finance and Expenditure Committee (FEC). Information about our emissions and initiatives is in our responses to questions 110 and 113-119 inclusive (on pages 208 to 218) to FEC’s Annual Review 2020/21. You can read our responses on Parliament’s website by going to the link below and choosing View submissions and advice. 2020/21 Annual review of the Inland Revenue Department - New Zealand Parliament (www.parliament.nz) Question 1: If Inland Revenue has a plan to be carbon neutral by 2025, and the plan’s official wording Inland Revenue has a target to achieve carbon neutrality by December 2025, in line with the requirements of the Carbon Neutral Government Programme (CNGP). We do not yet have a formal plan. This part of your request is refused under section 18(e) of the OIA, as the document you requested does not exist. However, we are currently gathering emissions information and developing our reduction plan, and will next determine our reduction target. This information will be used to form our plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025. Ref: 22OIA1572 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Question 2: If Inland Revenue has a carbon-neutral team or committee; how many are in this team; and if they are trained/experts Inland Revenue is setting up a small team to deliver the requirements of the CNGP. The work falls under the leadership of the Service Leader, Commercial Services and Strategic Property. The team comprises one person permanently on a part-time basis, and two people full-time for a year and six months (at this stage) respectively. Other contributors come from Workplace Services, Finance Services, Commercial Services, Strategic Property and our Communications team. These team members and contributors are not trained experts in environmental sustainability. Our work is supported by external consultants who have expertise in measuring and verifying emissions, and completing energy efficiency assessments. Their input will help us to establish our emission reduction targets and our plan to achieve those targets. Although Inland Revenue does not have a carbon-neutral committee, the team reports on our strategy and progress to our governance groups. Question 3: How much carbon Inland Revenue emits, and how our carbon emissions are measured Inland Revenue’s largest emission sources are from using energy for our premises, air travel and vehicle fleet. In the 2020/ 21 financial year (1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021), the total emissions from these sources were 1,261 tonnes. The following table shows the breakdown of our carbon emissions. Our carbon emissions in 2020/21 have reduced from previous years. This is largely the result of reduced travel due to COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns, as well as reducing our property footprint (by consolidating office accommodation in some locations and releasing some floors in other sites, as leases allow). All values in the table have been rounded. We are in the process of identifying further emissions sources to measure, and are using the CNGP’s target-setting tool to record emissions, assess the emission reductions required and determine a reduction target. We source our energy and air travel emissions from external providers. We calculate emissions for our vehicle fleet using data from our fleet booking system and carbon conversion factors sourced online. Question 4: When does Inland Revenue plan to phase out coal? Inland Revenue does not use coal. Ref: 22OIA1572 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Question 5: If Inland Revenue has transitioned to EVs and/or hybrids, and if we have begun downsizing our fleet Inland Revenue purchased 28 electric vehicles (EVs) in March 2021, and t he electrical infrastructure and chargers necessary for those EVs has been installed in the relevant sites. We aim to phase out all our petrol-powered vehicles over the next two-to-three years. We regularly review the size of our fleet. We have reduced our fleet by 61 vehicles so far: by five vehicles in 2018, by 28 vehicles in 2019, and by 28 vehicles in 2021. We are also exploring other avenues for optimising our fleet, including sharing vehicles with other government agencies and using ride-share vehicles. This work will help us to determine how many vehicles we need for our organisation and how many vehicles need to be transitioned to EVs. Question 6: How far along I nland Revenue is in meeting the NABERSNZ rating requirement for large buildings We are required to commission annual National Australian Building Environmental Rating System New Zealand (NABERSNZ) building energy efficiency assessments for 11 of our 21 sites, as they are over 2,000 square metres. So far, we have rating outcomes for six buildings and are progressing three others. Assessments for the last two of the 11 sites, our two Auckland buildings, were affected by COVID-19 restrictions but are now being scheduled. Rights of review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz . Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision.

Regulatory Impact Statement | 3 consultation on the various options, or refinement of the proposed option. Section 1: Diagnosi ng the policy proble m W h a t i s t h e c o n t e x t b e h i n d t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m a n d h o w i s t h e st a t u s q u o e x p e c t e d t o d e v e l o p? The purpose of allowing deductions for business costs 1. Building depreciation – the decline in a building’s market value – warrants tax deductions for the same reasons that other business expenses like wages and depreciation on computers do. 2. Allowing deductions for business expenses ensures tax liability is based on ability to pay. It also ensures taxes are as neutral as possible across different forms of investment, ensuring investment flows to the most productive areas of the economy. 1 3. Economic depreciation is the fall in market value of an asset. In the context of a tax on income, supporting productivity means that tax deductions for depreciation mirror economic depreciation as closely as possible. Failure to allow tax depreciation for assets which fall in value results in an effective tax rate for those assets that is higher than the statutory rate. On the other hand, allowing tax depreciation for assets which do not fall in value may result in an effective tax rate for those assets that is lower than the statutory rate. Previous changes to building depreciation in New Zealand 4. New Zealand previously allowed tax depreciation on buildings on a widespread basis at a rate of 3% diminishing value (or 2% straight line) for buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This changed following an announcement in the 2010 Budget to reduce the rate to 0% from the 2011-12 income year. The removal of depreciation deductions applied to both new and existing buildings. Depreciation remained available for buildings with an estimated useful life of fewer than 50 years. 2 5. The decision in 2010 was supported by Treasury analysis of QV data on the value of land and buildings which suggested that buildings appreciated in New Zealand over the data period (1994 to 2008). Officials noted at the time that the weight of international studies indicated that buildings do depreciate. 3 1 In the absence of taxes, investment would flow to the most productive areas of the economy, maximising total welfare. Taxes, however, can distort people’s decisions, with the result that heavily taxed activities may receive less investment, even if they have higher risk-adjusted, pre-tax returns than other investments. The outcome is that capital is allocated less productively, and we are poorer and have lower income and growth than otherwise. 2 These buildings include barns, chemical works, fertiliser works, powder dryer buildings, tanneries, and hydroelectric powerhouses (treated as plant rather than buildings). 3 Probably the most widely quoted estimates are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the United States. These suggest economic deprecation rates of 3.14% for industrial buildings, 2.47% for commercial buildings, 1.14% for residential structures of 1 to 4 units and 1.4% for residential structures of 5 or more units. These Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 6.In 2019, the Treasury and Inland Revenue advised the government that reinstating building depreciation could improve productivity in New Zealand. This was supported by the weight of international evidence that long-lived buildings do depreciate, together with studies suggesting that New Zealand had a high effective tax rate (and high cost of capital) for investments in buildings compared to most OECD countries. 4 7.In 2020, depreciation for long-lived buildings (other than residential buildings) was reinstated from the 2020-21 income year at a rate of 2% diminishing value (or 1.5% straight line). This change was introduced as a component of an economic policy response to COVID-19 to improve productivity and stimulate business activity. W h a t i s t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m o r o p p o r t u n i t y? 8.The coalition Government’s fiscal plan includes a commitment to end depreciation for commercial buildings that was introduced in 2020 as part of a COVID-19 business support package. The Government wishes to remove building depreciation as a revenue generating measure. Changes would apply from the 2024/25 income year (beginning 1 April 2024 for most taxpayers). 9.The changes in 2020 reintroduced depreciation for non-residential buildings which include commercial buildings and industrial buildings. Whether a building is a non- residential building is determined based on the building’s predominant use. For more information on when building owners can currently claim depreciation see: Claiming depreciation on buildings (ird.govt.nz). 10.Since residential buildings are currently not depreciable for tax purposes, this would apply the same tax treatment to all buildings used for investment or business (other than certain short-lived buildings with an estimated useful life of less than 50 years). W h a t o b j e c t i v e s a r e s o u g h t i n r e l a t i o n t o t he p o l i c y p r o b l e m ? 11.The objective is to implement this change as part of the Coalition Government’s tax changes which includes personal income tax reductions. results are consistent with a number of other studies tha t have been undertaken in the United Kingdom and United States. Studies for Canada have tended to suggest higher rates of economic depreciation. For a comprehensive assessment as at 2018, see the following analysis from the secretariat to the Tax Working Group: Appendix C: Depreciation on Buildings: Further information on potential revenue reducing options - July 2018 - Information Release - Tax Working Group - New Zealand. 4 This was explored in depth in Inland Revenue’s Long-term Insights Briefing “Tax, foreign investment and productivity”. Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 Section 2: Deciding upon an option to addres s the policy proble m W h a t c r i t e r i a w i l l b e u s e d to c o m p a r e o p t i o n s to t h e s t a t u s q u o ? 12. The options will be evaluated against the traditional tax policy criteria of efficiency, equity, integrity, fiscal impact, compliance and administration costs, and coherence. These are described below. a. Efficiency: Taxes should be, to the extent possible, efficient and minimise (as much as possible) impediments to economic growth. That is, the tax system should avoid unnecessarily distorting the use of resources (e.g., causing biases toward one form of investment versus another) and imposing heavy costs on individuals and firms. b. Equity: The tax system should promote fairness. The burden of taxes differs across individuals and businesses depending on which bases and rates are adopted. Assessment of both vertical equity (the relative position of those on different income levels or in different circumstances) and horizontal equity (the consistent treatment of those at similar income levels, or similar circumstances) is important. c. Revenue integrity: The tax system should be sustainable over time and minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and arbitrage. d. Fiscal impact: Tax reforms need to be affordable given fiscal constraints, and the tax system must raise sufficient revenue to support the Government’s fiscal strategy. e. Compliance and administration costs: The tax system should be as simple and low cost as possible for taxpayers to comply with and for the Inland Revenue Department to administer. f. Coherence: Individual reform options should make sense in the context of the entire tax system. While a particular measure may seem sensible when viewed in isolation, implementing the proposal may not be desirable given the tax system as a whole. 13. Some of these criteria trade-off with each other so there is some subjectivity to coming to an overall recommendation. The discussion under option 2 provides more information on the exact nature of how the proposal rates against the criteria which helps us to arrive at an overall judgement. W h a t s c o p e w i l l o p t i o n s b e c o n s i d e r e d w i t h i n ? 14. Options are constrained by the coalition Government’s fiscal plan which includes removing building depreciation. We have not been asked to provide advice on alternative options. In addition, we have only considered the impacts of this proposal compared to the status quo, not the suite of tax changes as a whole. Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 W h a t o p t i o n s a r e b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d? Option One – Status Quo 15. Continue to allow depreciation deductions for buildings (other than residential buildings) with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more at a rate of 2% diminishing value (or 1.5% straight line). Option Two – Remove building depreciation 16. The proposal to remove building depreciation could be done in a similar manner to the removal of building depreciation in 2010 (including subsequent remedials). This would mean that: a. changes to depreciation rates for buildings would apply to existing and newly acquired buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. b. special depreciation rates would not be allowed for taxpayers who can establish that they have a different useful life than generally applies. However, depreciation would remain available for buildings with a shorter estimated life e.g., barns, chemical works, dairy sheds, fertiliser works, fowl houses, and tanneries. c. previous depreciation deductions on buildings would remain recoverable if the building is sold for more than its tax book value. This means building depreciation would technically be deducted at a rate of 0%. d. taxpayers would be unable to claim a disposal loss deduction if a building is sold for less than its tax book value (except for certain buildings acquired before August 2009). This is because land and buildings are usually sold together, and it is difficult to establish how much of a total loss or gain is attributable to loss on the building itself. e. building owners would be able to depreciate building fit-out. 17. The main difference between the current proposal and the changes in 2010 is that the depreciation rate for residential buildings is currently 0% and so does not need to change. 18. Efficiency: The denial of deductions for building depreciation will impact the profitability of investments and cause investors to underinvest in buildings relative to other investments where business costs continue to be deductible. 19. In our last Long-Term Insights Briefing, we noted that under some assumptions made by the OECD (including that non-residents demand a 3% real return on their capital), New Zealand was likely to have had the highest hurdle rate of return for investment in commercial and industrial buildings for the 38 countries in the OECD. This was when New Zealand allowed 2% depreciation on these buildings. Denying depreciation deductions will drive up these hurdle rates of return even higher and make New Zealand a less attractive location for investment. 20. This tax distortion does not only impact building owners. To the extent that the additional cost is passed on and there is less investment, it also impacts any business that needs to use a building and the customers of such a business. It thereby negatively impacts productivity more generally. Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 21. Equity: A fundamental principle of New Zealand’s tax system is not to advantage any form of investment relative to other forms of investment, unless there is an over-riding reason for doing so. The goal is to ensure horizontal equity and reduce tax-driven distortions by ensuring that tax is as neutral as possible across different forms of investment. 22. Restricting building depreciation deductions may be considered unfair (violates horizontal equity) as it disallows a deduction for industries whose business rely more heavily on buildings. This tax outcome will have a corresponding negative effect on the balance sheets of those affected. 23. Users of buildings would be at greater risk if safety upgrades such as seismic strengthening are made less frequently due to the inability of the owner to depreciate the cost of the upgrade, although safety regulations are more likely to drive this investment than tax settings. 24. Revenue integrity: Based on the simplicity of the change and past experience implementing the change, it should have little overall impact on revenue integrity. 25. Fiscal impact: The expected revenue gain from this option is $2.31 billion over the forecast period (2024/25 to 2027/28). This estimate is based on a number of assumptions, such as the portion of buildings in some industries being outside of the tax base (e.g., owned by the government). To the extent these assumptions are wrong, the estimate of fiscal cost would also be incorrect. 26. Compliance and administration costs: In addition to paying more taxes, there may be some initial compliance costs for building owners as they separate building fit-out from the rest of the building for depreciation purposes. There will be a transitional rule for owners who have not previously recorded fit-out separately and do not wish to obtain a new valuation. 27. Historically, taxpayers who have elected not to separate out the fit-out costs from the building itself have done so to reduce their compliance costs. Their rationale is generally that while they may not get the full deductions for depreciation, the loss of a deduction is offset by the compliance cost savings. That logic no longer applies at a 0% depreciation rate for buildings, so there will be an increase in taxpayers’ compliance costs. However, those costs are minimised by the transitional rule for fit- out. 28. If taxpayers decide to undertake a complete audit of their fit-out to record them separately from the building, Inland Revenue will need to be mindful of the valuation methodology used by taxpayers/valuers to ensure the costs are based on historic cost, less depreciation claimed to that point. 29. Removing building depreciation deductions would also involve increased initial administration costs for Inland Revenue. This includes providing guidance and support for taxpayers to comply with rules changes. 30. Coherence: Removing building depreciation deductions will decrease the coherence of the tax system. A principle underlying the tax system is that generally only the amount of income after deducting any associated costs is taxable. This policy would create an exception to that general rule. 31. It should also be noted that regularly changing the rules on building depreciation affects taxpayer expectation about the predictability of the tax rules and has the potential to undermine certainty in the tax system with flow-on effects to business investor confidence.

31 March due date extensions
============================

2021 income tax returns
-----------------------

It remains important to file income tax returns as soon as possible. However, if you've been affected by COVID-19, we will not charge any late filing penalties if you file your return late, but before 31 May 2022. 

### Time bar for 2021 income tax returns

Late income tax return filings will have the effect of extending the time bar in s 108 to 31 March 2027 (instead of 31 March 2026). In these circumstances, as at 31 March 2026 we will close any review or other compliance activity for any 2020-21 income tax return which is: 

*   due on or before 31 March 2022 and is filed after 31 March but before 31 May 2022 due to the impact of COVID-19 
*   not subject to any existing exclusions from the standard 4 year time bar 
*   not subject to a dispute started by notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) issued before 1 January 2025 and either: 
    *   involved alleged tax avoidance
    *   has tax in dispute of over $200 million. 

We may ask you to clarify the cause of any delay in filing. This is limited to the effects of COVID-19. 

Extension of time arrangements for tax agents
---------------------------------------------

If your filing percentage is under 90% on 31 March 2022, and you're:

*   a monitored tax agent - your account manager will be in touch to discuss your situation
*   not a monitored tax agent - your filing percentages will not be monitored this year. 

We want to work with tax agencies to help them and their clients in whatever way we can. Because our system sends automatic notifications, if you are not currently monitored and receive a letter about monitoring, please ignore this. 

CFC and FIF disclosures
-----------------------

Generally controlled foreign companies (CFC) and foreign investment fund (FIF) disclosure forms are filed at the same time as the relevant income tax return or by the due date for that income tax return.

If you've been affected by COVID-19, we will not take any compliance action, or charge penalties or interest, if you file your CFC or FIF disclosure by 31 May 2022. To be eligible for this relief, the relevant income tax return must be filed.

If your tax agent has applied for deferred status for your 2021 income tax return, we'll apply the same extension to the due date for any CFC or FIF disclosures required.

Losses and subvention payments
------------------------------

### Offsetting losses

If a loss offset election is to be made for the 2021 tax year (which would normally have to be made by 31 March 2022) and you are affected by COVID-19, we'll allow the loss offset if all of the following conditions are met.

*   The relevant companies meet the requirements to transfer losses to another company.
*   The relevant companies file their income tax returns as soon as practicable, but by 31 May 2022 at the latest.
*   An election to offset the loss is provided to us by the 31 May 2022 (if not notified in the relevant company's income tax return).

### Subvention payments

If a subvention payment is to be made for the 2021 tax year (which would normally have to be paid and notified by 31 March 2022) and you are affected by COVID-19, we'll allow it if all of the following conditions are met.

*   The relevant companies meet the requirements to transfer losses to another company.
*   The relevant companies file their income tax returns as soon as practicable, but by 31 May 2022 at the latest.
*   A notice of the subvention payment is provided to us by 31 May 2022 (if not notified in the relevant company's income tax return).
*   The subvention payment is made as soon as practicable, but by 31 May 2022 at the latest.

Look-through company elections
------------------------------

Look-through company (LTC) elections for new companies, or companies that were previously non-active, for the 2021 income year are normally due 31 March 2022. We've extended this date to 30 June 2022.

LTC elections for the 2023 tax year for existing companies (those previously required to file an income tax return) are due before the start of the company's 2023 tax year (this would usually be 31 March 2022).

However, we can accept late LTC elections if there are exceptional circumstances outside the control of the owners and they are signed and dated in the 2023 income year. We consider being affected by COVID-19 to be an exceptional circumstance. It is important to note the election must be filed as soon as possible and not left to later in the year merely for convenience.

Trading stock on hand
---------------------

We will allow a late 2022 stocktake if you are affected by COVID-19, provided it is carried out as soon as practicable and no later than 31 May 2022. The 2022 closing stock figure needs to be reconstructed by adjusting for post-balance date sales and purchases – those made between balance date and the late stocktake date.

Example - late stocktake

Wiremu’s Home Appliances Ltd sells and repairs kitchen appliances. It has a standard balance date of 31 March. At the end of the 2022 income year, the company was required to value its trading stock. However, as a result of COVID-19, it had to shut down its business and was unable to undertake the stocktake on 31 March 2022.

On 25 April 2022, the company reopens its business and undertakes a late stocktake. It has kept a record of all amounts of post-balance date sales and purchases. Using the cost valuation method, it adjusts the late stocktake figure (to reconstruct what would have been the amount of closing stock at the end of 2022), by adding back the cost of post-balance date sales and deducting the cost of post-balance date purchases.
Regulatory Impact Statement | 2 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] donate, distorts donation behaviour and is widely perceived to be unfair. Businesses may delay donating their trading stock until it has a low or nil market value. In the case of perishable goods such as food, this means the donations are typically not accepted by charities and ultimately add to food wastage. Alternatively, businesses may incur costs by entering sponsorship agreements with recipients so they effectively receive a market value in advertising, which is not something all charities are prepared to do. In many other cases, the valuation rule is simply not complied with when goods are donated. We consider the valuation rule has two issues which justify legislative reform. • Issue one: in relation to disposals that are made in the ordinary course of business, the valuation rule over-reaches where the disposal is between non-associated parties. It imposes income tax where there is unlikely to be an integrity concern to address. • Issue two: in relation to disposals that are not made in the ordinary course of business and which are donations, the valuation rule also over-reaches. However, there are also integrity concerns if the valuation rule is not applied to certain donations, such as donations made to individuals or overseas organisations. The compromise that we think balances these concerns is to not apply the valuation rule where the donations are made to approved donee organisations, Donee organisations are generally registered charities that apply their funds wholly or mainly to charitable purposes in New Zealand, or charities that carry out their charitable purposes overseas and have been specifically approved to be donee organisations by Parliament. Removing the valuation rule for donations made to donee organisations would resolve the over-reach for most donations, ensure the tax concessions for donated trading stock and donations of money are consistently targeted, and minimise integrity risks. Government intervention is required to address these two issues In 2021, the Government enacted emergency provisions as part of the COVID-19 response to temporarily support businesses to donate their trading stock and to temporarily remove the application of the rule to non-associated person transactions. 1 This relief meant that during COVID-19 as well as future emergency events agreed by the Minister of Revenue, donations to donee organisations and public authorities would be excluded from the valuation rule, as would be disposals to non-associated parties. Other donations would be removed from the valuation rule and subject to a valuation rule equivalent to cost or opening book value. This relief addresses the two issues outlined above for times of emergency; however, it is due to expire on 31 March 2024. We consider that providing this relief solely in emergency times does not provide a comprehensive answer to the long-standing issues with the application and effect of the rule, which, although they may be more pronounced in an emergency context, exist at all times. We have considered nine different options to address these two issues In relation to issue one, we considered three different options to address the over-reach where there is a disposal between non-associated parties including the status quo option. In relation to issue two, we considered six different options to address the disincentive to donate trading stock including the status quo option. 1 The changes were included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act. The relief was effective from 17 March 2020. Regulatory Impact Statement | 3 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] All options we considered other than the status quo option are regulatory options. Non- regulatory options could not address either issue given the problems stem from unclear legislation and inappropriate policy settings. To address both issues, our preferred option is to (in effect) make the temporary emergency relief permanent for disposals of trading stock to non-associated persons (option two), and to remove the valuation rule for donations of trading stock to donee organisations (option six). We consider this combination of options best reflects general income tax principles while protecting against integrity risks and minimising compliance costs for taxpayers. This approach also aligns, to a large extent, with the current concessionary framework for donations of money, which limits donation deductions to donee organisations. We have consulted with the public on the problem and possible solutions We initially undertook targeted consultation on the problem in 2020 ahead of the enactment of the temporary emergency response provisions. In July 2023 we publicly released an Officials’ Issues Paper outlining our view of the problem and the possible options to address the issues. 2 We received fifteen submissions on the paper and met with submitters to discuss their submissions and our proposed approach to address them between September and December 2023. All submissions supported reform in this area to better reflect taxpayer practice and general income tax principles, although there were some differing views on the best way to achieve this objective. There were differing views on the problem definition. A number of submitters agreed with officials’ view (communicated in the issues paper) that the valuation rule can result in an over-reach in relation to disposals of trading stock that are not donations between non- associated persons (issue one). Others thought that the current valuation rule did not over- reach, because they did not consider the provision would apply to general business disposals of trading stock. We consider these opposing views reflect general uncertainty as to how and when the valuation rule should apply, and point to the need for legislative reform. Some submitters preferred an additional concession for associated person disposals where a disposal to an associated person is also subject to FBT or deemed dividend rules, because they were concerned a “double tax” can arise. We believe the complex interaction with these rules could raise integrity issues if the valuation rule does not apply to these associated party transactions. In addition, double tax concerns for deemed dividends can be addressed by affected businesses through the use of the imputation rules. However, it is an issue we will continue to monitor and will consider in future reviews of the FBT and deemed dividend rules. Several submitters who represent large businesses noted that a legislative response involving donations could be problematic without an appropriate “gift” definition. They took the view all disposals of their trading stock were business transactions, with some being both altruistic as well as good for business. We agree that the tax status of some disposals 2 Disposals of trading stock at below market value – an officials’ issues paper, July 2023, Inland Revenue, available at: https://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/consultation/2023/2023-ip-disposal-tradingstock-below- mktvalue Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section 1: Diagnosi ng the policy proble m W h a t i s t h e c o n t e x t b e h i n d t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m a n d h o w i s t h e st a t u s q u o e x p e c t e d t o d e v e l o p? 1. When a person disposes of trading stock at below market value a special rule in the Income Tax Act 2007 (the ITA) deems them to derive the market value of the trading stock on the date of the disposal (the valuation rule). Further, an amount equal to the market value of the trading stock at the time of disposal is treated as expenditure incurred by the transferee in acquiring the trading stock. 2. The valuation rule has been a long-standing feature of the ITA. A key rationale for the rule is the potential for tax minimisation arrangements to take place in its absence. Without the rule, trading stock could be sold at a deep discount to an associated person for example, allowing the transferor and transferee to benefit from the transferee’s lower rate when they in turn dispose of the property. However, we consider the rule is unnecessarily wide, resulting in unprincipled tax outcomes in relation to disposals of trading stock between non-associated parties. 3. Since before the COVID-19 pandemic, taxpayer representatives have sought revisions to the valuation rule, citing unfairness and concerns that the rule acts as a disincentive to businesses wanting to donate their trading stock. 4. Over the past two decades three separate legislative overrides to the valuation rule have been enacted to address some of these concerns. The overrides mean that a full deduction of the cost of the trading stock was recognised without any deemed income. Most recently, a temporary override was put in place from 2020 for a four-year period to support businesses as part of the Government’s COVID-19 response. This override ends on 31 March 2024. As part of this reform, provision was also made for the temporary relief to be switched on in relation to future emergencies. 5. Although the temporary measures put in place for the COVID-19 response and potential future emergencies did alleviate some of the more immediate concerns of taxpayers, we consider a more permanent solution that also applies in non-emergency times is necessary. 6. In August 2023 we released a public issues paper on the problem and possible solutions to the valuation rule. We received fifteen submissions – the majority from taxpayer representatives, three from large businesses and two from not-for-profit organisations. This, as well as our targeted consultation in 2020 with six taxpayer representatives and one large not-for-profit, has informed our understanding of the problem definition and our analysis of the options. W h a t i s t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m o r o p p o r t u n i t y? 7. We have identified two related issues with the valuation rule: • Issue one: in relation to disposals that are made in the ordinary course of business, the valuation rule over-reaches where the disposal is between non-associated parties. It imposes income tax where there is unlikely to be an integrity concern to address. • Issue two: in relation to disposals that are not made in the ordinary course of business and which are donations, the valuation rule also over-reaches. However, there are also integrity concerns if the valuation rule is not applied to certain donations, such as donations made to individuals or overseas organisations. The compromise that we think balances these concerns is to not apply the valuation rule where the donations are made to approved donee organisations, Donee organisations are generally registered charities that apply their funds wholly or mainly to charitable purposes in New Zealand, or charities that carry out their Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] charitable purposes overseas and have been specifically approved to be donee organisations by Parliament. Removing the valuation rule for donations made to donee organisations would resolve the over-reach for most donations, ensure the tax concessions for donated trading stock and donations of money are consistently targeted, and minimise integrity risks. 8. While submitters all agreed that there were issues with the valuation rule, there were differing views on the exact nature of those issues. For example, some submitters did not consider that the valuation rule would apply to arm’s-length business transactions, and therefore did not consider that the rule could be said to ‘over-reach’ by deeming someone to derive income above the amount economically derived by them. However, other submitters considered the valuation rule did result in over-reach (described as ‘issue one’ in this paper). We consider this uncertainty points to the need for a permanent legislative solution. The Tax Counsel Office is considering the need for guidance to assist with the interpretation of these changes. 9. In general, our consultation in 2020 and 2023 highlighted that to many businesses the valuation rule is unintuitive and unfair and, perhaps as a result, anecdotal evidence suggests that compliance with the rule may be low. W h a t o b j e c t i v e s a r e s o u g h t i n r e l a t i o n t o t he p o l i c y p r o b l e m ? 10. The main objective of this work is to determine a fair and principled approach to the taxation of trading stock disposed of at below market value and the taxation of donated trading stock. 11. A fair and principled approach should protect the revenue base, support taxpayer compliance and withstand the test of time, removing the need for ad-hoc changes to respond to specific emergencies. Section 2: Deciding upon an option to addres s the policy proble m W h a t c r i t e r i a w i l l b e u s e d to c o m p a r e o p t i o n s to t h e s t a t u s q u o ? 12. We have used the following criteria to assess the options against our objectives: • Revenue integrity. Does the option minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and tax evasion? • Efficiency. Does the option raise tax revenue in a way that minimises distortions and costs to the economy? • Compliance costs: Does the option minimise costs for taxpayers? • Coherence: Does the option make sense within the entire tax system? 13. To the extent that there are trade-offs between these criteria their weighting will be determined in light of the overarching objective of determining a ‘fair and principled approach’ to the taxation of disposals of trading stock at below market value and donations of trading stock. Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] W h a t s c o p e w i l l o p t i o n s b e c o n s i d e r e d w i t h i n ? 14. The scope of feasible options is limited to some extent by New Zealand’s long-standing tax policy settings. These settings have been established in line with a broad-base low- rate framework. This framework supports the consistent application of tax across the economy in a non-distortive manner, and thus any departure, including the provision of concessionary treatment, requires strong justification. 15. These settings rule out any options that significantly deviate from the framework in a manner that is unjustified. What is justifiable in this context is informed by the scope and nature of any current concessions, and the connection between the deviation and the pursuit of wider societal imperatives. W h a t o p t i o n s a r e b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d? 16. We have separated out the options as they relate to the two issues with the valuation rule. These options were included in the public issues paper published in August 2023 and our analysis is informed by feedback from submitters on the options. 17. Other than the status quo option, the options are all regulatory in nature. We did not consider any non-regulatory options because the identified issues arise from unclear legislation and policy settings. The following options relate to disposals that are made in the ordinary course of business: Option One – Status quo 18. Option one would maintain the status quo. When the emergency relief ceases in March 2024, businesses would be required to return deemed income at market value when they dispose of their trading stock at below market value to both associated and non- associated parties (outside of limited emergency times). 19. This option ensures there is a backstop principle for goods exchanges. It promotes revenue integrity by protecting the revenue base from the artificial reduction of business profits through transfers of trading stock in ways that result in an incorrect reflection of the real income generated by the business. 20. However, it does not address the identified over-reach in relation to non-associated transactions. Where parties are not associated, we do not consider a valuation rule is necessary; businesses transacting at an arm’s-length are free to set prices as they see fit and not have these interfered with, unless there is something in the nature of tax avoidance which can be dealt with separately under other provisions in the ITA. Option Two – Limit the valuation rule to associated person transactions (officials’ preferred option) 21. To address the identified over-reach, option two would limit the valuation rule to cases where trading stock is disposed at below market value to an associated person. 22. This option recognises that transfers of trading stock between non-associated persons that are below market value and are not donations are nonetheless made by the business for a valid business purpose and therefore the price set by the parties should stand. Any revenue integrity concerns arising from transactions between non- associated persons can be dealt with by the general anti-avoidance rule in the ITA. This option also aligns with some taxpayers’ current view of the operation of the valuation rule. 23. It would reduce compliance costs for businesses not dealing with associated persons who would no longer have to apply the valuation rule. Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Option Three - Retain the deemed market value adjustment and deem the adjustment to be an expense of the taxpayer for non-associated disposals 24. Under this option, the valuation rule would continue to apply as in option two for associated person disposals. For disposals to non-associated persons, the valuation rule would also continue to apply, however, the market value adjustment would be deductible to the transferor provided the disposal met the general permission. The effect of this would be to allow a net deduction for the opening value of the trading stock disposed of at below market value where the disposal was connected with the derivation of business income. 25. Officials considered this option could support revenue integrity by ensuring any deductions have a connection with the derivation of income. However, submitters pointed out that a disposal that was not a donation, and was not to an associated person, would generally have a connection with income (and thus meet the general permission). Hence they did not support this option as it would increase their compliance costs for no real gain in terms of revenue integrity. The following options relate to disposals of trading stock that are not made in the ordinary course of business and are donations Option Four – Status quo 26. Option four would retain the status quo in relation to donations. A person making a donation of trading stock would be treated as deriving the market value of the trading stock, apart from in limited emergency times when the concessionary relief may be switched on. 27. The relief turns off the valuation rule for donations. For businesses donating trading stock to approved donee organisations and public authorities, a concessionary (compared to a cash donation requirement) net deduction is allowed during the emergency period. For businesses donating trading stock to other persons that are not associated, the business is instead deemed to derive income equal to the cost of the trading stock, resulting in neither a net deduction nor net income for tax purposes. 28. This option recognises that during times of emergency there may be a more pressing need for donations of trading stock and a greater desire on the part of businesses to donate. This targets the relief to short periods of time and so generally maintains the broad base low-rate system. 29. However, the option does not address the disincentive to donate outside of limited emergency times. It also results in administration and compliance costs as the relief must be turned on and off and treatment adjusted accordingly. Option Five – Make the temporary relief permanent 30. Option five would make the temporary relief apply at all times (i.e. outside of emergencies such as floods, earthquakes, and pandemics). 31. This option removes the disincentive to donate by introducing a permanent broad concession. However, it lacks coherence with current settings as it is more concessionary than current concessions for donations of money, which are limited in several ways for integrity and fiscal reasons. This is because the temporary relief was mainly developed with the COVID-19 emergency context in mind and with the understanding that it would apply for limited periods only. A sustainable permanent option should more closely align with the current concessionary regime for donations of money. Regulatory Impact Statement | 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Option Six – Make the temporary relief permanent for donations to donee organisations only (officials’ preferred option) 32. Option six would align the temporary relief with the current donation deduction framework to a large extent, by limiting the relief so that it is only available in relation to donations of trading stock to donee organisations. The concession would be available for all types of trading stock, in contrast to the temporary relief which excluded land and timber. This would remove the current disincentive to donate trading stock to donee organisations whilst utilising an existing integrity measure (the requirements for becoming a donee organisation) to protect the revenue base. The rationale for this relief is the same as the rationale for providing relief for donations of money, which is to encourage and reinforce giving by lowering the cost of giving. 33. Unlike the rules for donations of money made by companies and Māori authorities, this option does not require the net donation deduction to be capped to the donor’s net income. While a cap would align this option more closely with the donation rules, the compliance and administrative costs and complexity of applying a cap to all businesses subject to the valuation rule, including trustees and sole traders, would outweigh the benefits of alignment. We consider that a restriction of the concession to donee organisations is sufficient to address integrity concerns in the case of trading stock disposals. 34. We do not consider that a permanent concession should be extended to include donations to public authorities, as is available under the temporary relief. This would create an inconsistency with the existing donation framework and was only introduced as a temporary measure due to COVID-19 and the donations being made to hospitals. Option Seven – Make the temporary relief permanent for donations to donee organisations subject to several limitations 35. Option seven limits the relief provided in option six for donations to donee organisations to further align the relief with the current donation deduction framework: • In relation to donations of trading stock to donee organisations, the valuation rule would continue to apply; however, a deduction would also be available for the market value adjustment (provided the donation is made to a donee organisation). The net effect of this is to allow a deduction for the opening value of the donated trading stock. This deemed deduction approach would also allow Inland Revenue to monitor use of the concession to ensure businesses comply with the rules and there is no unanticipated abuse of the concession that would warrant application of the avoidance provisions and/or a policy response. However, this approach would not reduce compliance costs for businesses that want to donate their trading stock. • The value of the deduction available to businesses that donate their trading stock to donee organisations would be limited to the net income of the business in the income year the donation is made (if the donee is not an individual) or otherwise their taxable income. 36. This option would ensure the tax rules for donations of trading stock align with the broad donation framework, and that they do not act as a disincentive for businesses donating trading stock to donee organisations. 37. However, this option does not reduce compliance costs for businesses, who are still required to determine the market value of their trading stock upon donating it and return this as income. Compared to the status quo, they are additionally required to claim this market value amount as an expense in order to receive a net deduction. Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Submitters have pointed out that, from a compliance perspective, it would be simpler for businesses to not return any income in relation to the donation, which would also remove the need to create a deemed expense. 38. The imposition of a cap on the value of deductions would also increase compliance costs for businesses compared to the temporary relief, as they would be required to keep track of the value of trading stock donated to donee organisations. Option Eight – Deem all donors to derive income at cost or opening value of the donated trading stock 39. Option eight removes the direct cost of donated trading stock from the tax base entirely (rather than allowing a concession for any donation of trading stock). This is achieved by changing the valuation rule from a market value adjustment to a lower of cost or opening value adjustment. The effect of this option is that the deduction and deemed income net off so that there is minimal tax impact on the making of a donation (the donor would still deduct overhead and indirect costs relating to the trading stock). This treatment would be available for all donations of trading stock, no matter the recipient. 40. This option reduces compliance costs for businesses compared with the status quo, to the extent that it is easier to identify the cost of the trading stock compared to market value. It also maintains the broad-base low-rate framework. However, it would create a significant inconsistency between goods used for private consumption and goods subject to deemed dividend rules (which remain subject to market value calculations) compared to goods which are donated (which would be subject to a cost adjustment). This could create integrity and coherence issues. Further, the requirement to make a cost adjustment for all donation disposals will continue to impose compliance costs on businesses. Option Nine – Provide specific relief for donations of food only 41. Option nine was also considered as a narrow concession for donations of food only that addresses the environmental impact of the current rules. Under the status quo, businesses that donate food may in some cases have a tax liability if the market value of the donation is greater than its opening value. Because food is perishable, this disincentive may result in increased food waste. 42. This would create a more limited concession; however, it would not address the disincentive to donate other types of trading stock with equal benefit to the community.

We consider that a combination of option two and six would best achieve the objective of a fair and principled approach to the taxation of trading stock disposed of at below market value and the taxation of donated trading stock. 44. This combination of options removes the over-reach of the current valuation rule by limiting its application to disposals of trading stock to associated persons, the taking of trading stock for private use and donated trading stock. It also addresses the disincentive to donate trading stock to donee organisations specifically, by turning off the valuation rule (allowing a net deduction for the opening value of the donation) when trading stock is donated to a donee organisation. 45. We consider this approach to donations of trading stock strikes the right balance between achieving alignment with the current rules for donations (and thus protecting the revenue base) and limiting compliance costs for businesses. Although it does not achieve complete alignment with the settings for donations of money (unlike option seven which allowed for monitoring of the deductions claimed by businesses and required the value of deductions claimed to not exceed a net income cap), we consider the requirement for the donation to be to a donee organisation for the business to access the concession sufficiently addresses any integrity concerns, whilst also appropriately limiting compliance costs for businesses. 46. In relation to disposals that are not donations, we consider this combination of options sufficiently addresses revenue integrity concerns by protecting the tax base from artificial transfers of trading stock between associated parties for their timing benefits, whilst promoting efficiency and reducing compliance costs for disposals to non- associates that we consider to be of low-to-no risk from a revenue integrity perspective.

Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 12. Most people do not experience any negative effects from online gambling. However, gambling can be highly addictive and can lead to harm to individuals and the wider community. The proportion of people who sought help for gambling harm related to online gambling has almost doubled between 2018 and 2022. 7 Online casino gambling is likely to be at least as harmful as Class 4 gaming machines, with harmful features such as the continuous nature of play, 24/7 accessibility and its appeal to young people. W h a t i s t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m o r o p p o r t u n i t y? 13. Offshore online casino websites face lower taxes compared to New Zealand casinos and gaming machines as well as the taxes that apply to online casinos in the UK and some European countries. This may allow online casinos to offer more attractive odds or promotions to New Zealand gambling customers. To the extent that this encourages gambling activity to be conducted through online casinos, it will result in reduced tax revenues compared to if the gambling had been conducted through New Zealand operators. It is also likely to result in an increase in overall gambling harm given the accessibility of online gambling and that unlike New Zealand licenced operators, offshore providers are not required under New Zealand regulation to employ any harm minimisation practices. 14. That said, many online casinos comply with gambling regulations in other countries which include taxes and harm minimisation, so if New Zealand customers gamble using these compliant operators, harm minimisation will be better compared to non-compliant operators. 15. Regardless, offshore providers are likely to result in increased gambling harm given that, unlike New Zealand licenced operators, they are not subject to New Zealand gambling regulations which require harm minimisation practices. Online gambling is likely to be at least as harmful as gaming machines (pokies). It has features which increase the risk of harm such as the continuous nature of play, its 24/7 accessibility on mobile phones and other devices, and its appeal to young people and other vulnerable members of society. 16. Previous surveys indicate that online gambling is more prevalent among Māori, young people (aged 16 to 24 years), men, and Pacific women, than other population groups. 8 The status quo is expected to have a larger impact on these groups. However, due to data limitations we have not attempted to quantify the impacts for particular segments of gambling consumers. 17. Due to the time constraints mentioned in the constraints section, we have not publicly consulted on the problem or the specific tax options analysed in this RIS with stakeholders, including gambling operators, community groups, or specific populations of gamblers. Instead, we have relied on information from the Department of Internal Affairs gambling officials who have insights about these stakeholders and information provided through previous consultation or public comment. 18. The Department of Internal Affairs publicly consulted on regulating online gambling in 2019. While the focus of that consultation was on potential regulations to minimise harm, 7 Intervention services data, Ministry of Health, 2022 8 The Ministry of Health’s Health and Lifestyles survey found that Māori are more likely to gamble on online casino websites than non-Māori. The rate of Māori gambling on online casino websites has been increasing significantly over the years, from 1.3 percent in 2012 to 4.7 percent in 2020. 32 percent of people accessing clinical services who recorded online gambling as one of the types of gambling causing them harm identified as Māori. While data is limited, evidence suggests that young people (aged 16 to 24 years) and men may also be relatively more likely to have gambled on online casino websites. Pacific women were significantly more likely to gamble online than non-Pacific women, but Pacific men were less likely to gamble online than non-Pacific men. Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] some submitters commented on applying taxes to online gambling operators. 9 One submitter noted the additional revenue from online gambling operators would result in more tax revenue and ensure more gambling activity is conducted through compliant operators (compared to non-compliant operators). Two submitters suggested a taxation system based on gross betting revenue. These submitters believed this would be the most effective method of collecting tax. One submitter stated the taxation rate should be competitive for operators and not exceed global best practice rates. 19.SkyCity, which operates four of New Zealand’s six casinos, has made public comment that “SkyCity supports the taxation of the online gaming market”. 10 W h a t o b j e c t i v e s a r e s o u g h t i n r e l a t i o n t o t he p o l i c y p r o b l e m ? 20.The objectives are to increase tax collection and to minimise gambling harm. 21.There is a trade-off. If the proposed taxes have high compliance costs, some of the affected operators may choose to respond by blocking or reducing promotions to their New Zealand customers or by not complying with the taxes or other regulations. This may lead to New Zealand customers conducting more gambling activity through non- compliant operators which would reduce tax collection and increase gambling harm (as non-compliant operators are less likely to apply harm minimisation measures such as promoting problem gambling services).

Will it protect the sustainability of the gambling tax base going forward? Will the proposed taxes maximise the gambling activity that is conducted through compliant operators (compared to non-compliant operators)? •Harm minimisation: Does the option minimise the harm caused by problem gambling? Does it channel New Zealand gambling customers towards compliant operators who implement harm minimisation measures? •Fairness: Will the option be perceived by stakeholders as improving fairness? Would online casino operators face similar taxes as New Zealand gambling providers, other types of offshore businesses, and the taxes which apply to online casino gambling in other countries? Do the options avoid unintended distortions to competition, consumer, or business decisions? •Compliance costs: Do the options encourage online casino operators to comply with their tax obligations with low compliance costs? Do they minimise the additional compliance costs which would be imposed on operators by the option? 9 Microsoft Word - Online Gambling - Summary of Submissions (dia.govt.nz), page 36. 10 Online casinos ‘aggressively targeting’’ New Zealand (newsroom.co.nz). 10 October 2022. Regulatory Impact Statement | 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] •Coherence: Do the options make sense in the context of New Zealand’s overall tax system including how offshore businesses are generally taxed? Is the option consistent with New Zealand’s international tax and trade agreements. •Administration costs: Are the options possible for Inland Revenue to implement in the necessary timeframe and administer without substantial ongoing administration costs? W h a t o p t i o n s a r e b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d? Option One: Status quo 23.Option one is the status quo where the only tax applying to offshore casino websites is GST. 24.Accordingly, these websites face significantly lower taxes compared to New Zealand casinos and gaming machines that they compete with. This may allow online casinos to offer more attractive odds or promotions to New Zealand gambling customers. To the extent that this encourages gambling activity to be conducted through online casinos it will result in reduced tax revenues and contributions to New Zealand community groups. It is also likely to result in an increase in overall gambling harm given the accessibility of online gambling and that unlike New Zealand licenced operators, offshore providers are not required by New Zealand regulation to employ any harm minimisation practices (although they may do so voluntarily or because they comply with harm minimisation regulations imposed by other countries). 25.These problems are expected to become worse over time as the amount of gambling conducted by New Zealanders on offshore casino websites continues to grow (we have forecast it may grow by 5% each year). Option Two: Tax consistently with New Zealand casinos 26.Option 2 would aim to tax online casinos in the same manner as casinos that are physically located in New Zealand. These taxes are GST, a 4% casino duty on gross betting revenue (GBR) and a 28% income tax on profits. Officials estimate this would equate to an effective tax rate of approximately 26% of GBR. 11 27.To the extent that online casinos have similar characteristics and compete with New Zealand casinos this option would improve fairness. New Zealand casinos provide gambling to people who are in New Zealand (including tourists), whereas online casinos are based offshore and can offer a wide range of gambling products to customers in many countries. New Zealand casinos are also different from online casinos because they have exclusive casino licences, are more regulated, employ many New Zealand staff and offer many other services besides gambling. 28.Although it is technically possible to apply income tax to online casinos which are located offshore, we are not aware of any other country that does this. Instead, they apply gaming duties, which are consumption taxes on GBR. 29.Current international tax settings generally only impose income tax on non-resident business income when it is generated through a physical presence in New Zealand. In this regard, option 2 would provide less fair and coherent taxation of online casinos compared to how other offshore businesses are taxed. 30.New Zealand’s 40 double tax agreements prevent New Zealand from collecting income tax on non-resident businesses from these treaty partners unless the income is attributable to a physical presence in New Zealand. Currently, most online casinos are in jurisdictions such as Malta and Gibraltar which New Zealand does not have double 11 Because GST on gambling is collected on a GST-inclusive basis, it is equivalent to a 13% tax on GBR. The 26% of GBR comprises 13% for GST plus 4% for casino duty plus 9% for income tax (28% income tax on an assumed profit of 33% of GBR is 28% x 0.33 = 9%). Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] tax agreements with. However, there is a risk that an online casino could be relocated so it is a tax resident of one of the 40 treaty partners. It may be possible to require online casinos to be located in New Zealand in order to legally provide gambling to New Zealanders, but such a requirement could potentially be challenged under a relevant trade agreement. 31. Applying income tax would also impose compliance costs on the affected casinos as they would need to calculate their New Zealand-sourced profits and comply with international tax rules. To avoid incurring these compliance costs it is likely that some online casinos would choose to leave the New Zealand market by blocking New Zealand customers, rather than become liable for New Zealand income tax. This could lead to more gambling activity being conducted with non-compliant operators who are less likely to use harm minimisation measures which could increase gambling harm compared to the status quo. 12 32. Because it would require Inland Revenue to monitor and enforce income tax and international tax rules, option 2 would have higher administrative costs than the status quo and option 3. Option Three: Tax consistently with gaming machines 33. This option would seek to tax online casinos consistently with gaming machines. This approach would improve fairness by ensuring online casinos pay similar gaming duties to the gaming machines (pokies) operating in pubs and clubs. 34. These gaming machines are subject to GST and a 20% gaming machine duty on GBR. Income subject to the 20% gaming machine duty is exempt from income tax. 35. Compared to option 2, which involved a low 4% rate of gaming duty and income tax, applying a higher rate of gaming duty (20% under option 3 or 12% under option 4) and not applying income tax would be simpler and more coherent with international tax policy settings. It would also be more consistent with the fact that some European countries apply gaming duties (but not income tax) to offshore online gambling. 36. Under option 3, the total tax collected would be 33% of GBR (a combination of GST 13 and gaming machine duty) which would be higher than taxes imposed by larger online gambling markets in the United Kingdom (21% of GBR) and European countries (ranging from 11% in Belgium to 29% in the Netherlands). 37. Because it imposes the highest overall tax rate, option 3 may collect more revenue than options 2 and 4 but is likely to have the biggest negative impact and downside risk on the amount of gambling activity that occurs through compliant online casino operators. 38. Imposing a high overall tax rate could make the New Zealand market much less profitable for online casinos. This significantly increases the risk that some online casino providers may choose to block or reduce promotions to New Zealand customers and focus on attracting customers from other countries instead. In response, New Zealand customers may shift their gambling activity to non-compliant online casino providers who do not pay any New Zealand taxes (including GST), which would result in a loss of tax revenues. 39. This behaviour would also undermine harm minimisation. Non-compliant operators are unlikely to implement any measures to mitigate harm (such as promoting problem gambling services). In contrast, compliant operators may voluntarily implement or comply with harm minimisation measures required by other countries. 12 Tax compliant operators are more likely to implement harm minimisation measures voluntarily or because they comply with harm minimisation regulations imposed by other countries. 13 Because GST on gambling is collected on a GST-inclusive basis, it is equivalent to a 13% tax on GBR. i.e. if a gambler bets and loses $115, GST of $15 (13% of the $115 of gross betting revenue) is collected. Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 40. Option 3 would impose compliance costs on online casino operators compared to the status quo. These compliance costs include one-off costs of changes to IT systems and commercial practices to account for the new gaming duty (or block New Zealand customers if they choose to leave the New Zealand market). These implementation costs are expected to be low for those operators which already have similar systems in place for collecting GST. 41. Option 3 is expected to have slightly higher administration costs compared to the status quo as it would require Inland Revenue to implement systems changes and allocate compliance resources to assist the affected operators and their tax agents to comply with the new gaming duty. Option 4: Align with tax rates imposed in other countries (officials’ preferred option) 42. This option would seek to tax online casinos at a rate that is in line with the tax that other jurisdictions apply to online casinos. 43. Under option 4, services provided by online casinos would remain subject to GST in New Zealand. It is proposed that a new gaming duty of 12% would apply on top of the GST. This would result in online casinos paying the equivalent to a 25% tax on GBR. 44. An overall tax rate of 25% would put New Zealand near the midpoint of jurisdictions that impose gaming duties on online casino operators. Spain and Portugal apply a 25% tax rate while Denmark (28%) and the Netherlands (29%) apply higher rates. Other countries apply lower tax rates, including Belgium (11%), Italy (20%), UK (21%), Sweden (22%) and the Czech Republic (23%). 45. The main advantage of ensuring that the overall tax rate and compliance costs are internationally comparable is that it reduces the risk of online casinos responding to the higher costs and reduced profitability of operating in the New Zealand market by blocking or reducing promotions to their New Zealand customers. This reduces the corresponding risk that New Zealand customers shift their gambling activity to non-compliant online casinos, who do not pay taxes and are unlikely to implement harm minimisation measures. 46. In the racing and sports betting context, online betting providers are subject to both GST and 10% point of consumption charges in New Zealand. It is noted that this level of taxation (a 23% total tax rate) did not appear to cause any online racing and sports betting providers to leave the New Zealand market. However, the nature of the racing and sports betting market may be different than the online casino market. 47. A total tax of 25% would be a similar overall tax rate as option 2 (tax consistently with New Zealand casinos which is estimated to be roughly 26% of GBR). However, option 4 would have lower compliance costs and is expected to collect more tax revenue than option 2. 48. A disadvantage of option 4 is that it may be perceived as less fair by some gambling stakeholders compared to options 2 or 3. This is because 12% would be less than the 20% gaming machine duty which applies to gaming machines in pubs or clubs. It could be opposed by these gaming machine operators or lead to lobbying to reduce the rate of gaming machine duty to align it with offshore websites. Also, as the proposed 12% gaming duty would be more than the 4% casino duty, New Zealand casinos may seek policy changes to apply a lower 4% duty on gaming conducted through their offshore websites on the basis that they see this as being part of their casino, rather than a separate type of gambling activity. Other countries such as the UK have different gaming duty rates for online gambling (21%) compared to casinos (a progressive 15%-50% structure increasing with GBR) and gaming machines (5% to 25% depending on the cost to play and prize value). 49. As with option 3, option 4 would impose some one-off compliance costs for online casinos from changes to IT systems and commercial practices to account for the new gaming duty, although these costs are expected to be low for those providers which Regulatory Impact Statement | 13 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] W h a t o p t i on i s l i k e l y t o b e s t a d d r e s s t h e p r o b l e m , m e e t t h e p o l i c y o b j e c t i v e s , a n d d e l i v e r t h e h i g h e s t n e t b e n e f i t s? 50. Officials recommend taxing online casino operators in line with the tax rates imposed in other countries (option 4). 51. While option 4 would mean online casinos would face lower tax rates than New Zealand casinos or gaming machines, tax collection and fairness would still be significantly improved compared to the status quo. Compared to the other reform options, option 4 is expected to lead to the most gambling activity being conducted with compliant operators. For this reason, it would significantly improve tax collection without undermining the Government’s harm minimisation objective. 52. Options 2 or 3 would involve a higher risk of New Zealand gamblers moving to non- compliant operators as the overall costs imposed on operators which complied with New Zealand’s tax rules would be significantly higher than the taxes applied by other countries. Compliant operators could put less effort into attracting New Zealand customers and may respond by choosing to block New Zealand customers from accessing their websites rather than face the high tax costs. This makes it likely that more New Zealand gamblers would gamble using non-compliant operators who do not comply with taxes and are unlikely to implement any harm minimisation measures. Regulatory Impact Statement | 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section 3: Delivering a n option H o w w i l l t h e n e w a r r a n g e m e n t s b e i m p l e m e n t e d? 53. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the implementation and ongoing administration of the online casino taxes which would apply from 1 July 2024. Inland Revenue will need to update its systems and allocate compliance resources to assist the affected operators and their tax agents to comply with the changes. Inland Revenue has estimated it will cost $1.5m of capital costs in 2023/24 and annual operating costs of $0.5m in staff resources and $0.3m of depreciation each year to implement and administer the gaming duty proposal. 54. Inland Revenue will provide information to increase awareness and support taxpayers to comply with the new rules. This will include producing a relevant Tax Information Bulletin item and updating guidance on Inland Revenue’s website. 55. There is an implementation risk that some online casino operators may not have sufficient time before 1 July 2024 to adjust their systems and commercial practices to comply with the new requirements and may block their New Zealand customers or become non-compliant. This risk can be reduced by aligning the design of new taxes closely with existing GST obligations (e.g., imposed on GBR and quarterly filing) and by announcing and legislating the changes shortly after Cabinet decisions have been made. Accordingly, the overall impact of this risk is considered low. H o w w i l l t h e n e w a r r a n g e m e n t s b e mo n i t o red, ev a l u a ted, a n d re v i e wed? 56.

Inland Revenue regularly reviews tax settings on an ongoing basis and provides advice and updates to the Government accordingly.

$5 million of "loans" found to be income after all
==================================================

2010 case note - property developer who lived on 'loans' and drawings from companies held to have avoided income tax - capital, journal entry, structure.

Case

TRA Decision 3/2010

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994

### Summary

A property developer who lived largely on "loans" and other drawings from his various companies was held to have thereby avoided income tax.

### Impact of decision

Tax avoidance jurisprudence has moved very quickly in New Zealand since the Supreme Court decisions in _Glenharrow_ and _Ben Nevis_. In this case the Authority has applied the relatively new test of "parliamentary contemplation" as well as the more conventional BG1 analyses to a somewhat extreme fact pattern. The Commissioner considers the decision to largely turn on its own facts.

### Facts

The disputant is a property developer and entrepreneur. During the period 1991 to 2002 he was involved in projects worth, at least, hundreds of millions of dollars. Over that period he paid less than $20,000 net income tax. The disputant did, however, avail himself of loans from entities he controlled. These "loans" amounted to $5,094.442 over the 12-year period. The Commissioner considered the loans and the mechanisms by which the disputant and his entities accounted for profits or gains, to be a tax avoidance arrangement. The disputant was assessed in his personal capacity for income equivalent to the unrepaid loans over the 12-year period.

His Honour Judge Barber described the disputant's business method:

*   \[11\] I understood that these projects, involving developing land on revenue account, were effected in separate trusts and, at the end of each project, the profit was distributed to the next trust development project, which would be in start-up at that stage and so on and so on. Some projects seem to be the erection (or renovation) of buildings on land for resale but, very often, for retention by the disputant's group as a letting enterprise.
*   \[12\] Simply put, in order for the disputant and his family to live in the manner he wished, there were constant and very regular drawings by the disputant from his entities. Generally, no salary was paid to him, and the drawings were treated by his accountants, and for the purposes of his tax position, as loans of capital. Mr Lennard's strong submission is that capital was the character of the advances by these group entities to the disputant over the said 12 years.
*   \[13\] As I understand it, the said technique applied by the accountants and advisers for the disputant, leading to him not appearing to receive earnings, continued unnoticed by the IRD for many years until one of the development projects led to significant losses for the particular group entity ... In examining the fallout from that failure, the regular and systematic drawings taken for living by the disputant, and set out in the relevant book-keeping as loans, showed up, possibly, because creditors saw them as an asset of the lender trust entity to be repaid by the disputant.
*   \[14\] The disputant's group operated in a tax efficient manner. Virtually no income tax was paid. It is submitted for the defendant that the arrangement was a device whereby the disputant could live off funds obtained from his entities without paying any tax and that there is no other objective rationale for the arrangement.

Some "repayments" were made by book entry into various loan accounts whenever the Group realised a capital gain:

*   \[56\]... Most repayments were by journal entry. If any trust obtained a capital benefit, this could be distributed to the disputant by journal entry and immediately utilised by him again, by journal entry, in repayment of a loan. In economic terms it means that when an entity obtains a capital amount, the loan can be reduced by that amount with his entities still having the funds available for other projects. That after the repayment the funds may be in a different disputant entity is not significant. The disputant confirmed under cross-examination that there was no difficulty in moving funds within the group and that it is done "all the time".

### Decision

The Authority embarked upon a comprehensive BG1 analysis in order to determine whether the purported loaned capital receipts were in fact income in the hands of the disputant.

His Honour held that there was a tax avoidance arrangement which consisted of:

*   \[a\] the disputant borrowing funds from the trust, the said company and other associated entities/trusts;  
    \[b\] a fundamental component of the arrangement was the terms on which such amounts were loaned to the disputant, including no defined date for repayment;  
    \[c\] no (or only slight, depending on the income year) taxable distributions or amounts being paid by the associated entities/trusts to the disputant; the repayments of the loans that were made were sourced from non-taxable distributions received from his associated entities.

The arrangement was held to have avoided tax by virtue of the control the disputant had over all his trading entities:

*   \[35\] In theory, the disputant must repay the loans but, since he controls the associated entities, he can control when and to what extent demand for payment is made. The repayment can be indefinitely deferred. He could control whether interest was charged; and it did not seem to be. The repayments were merely circular flows of funds that have no economic effect on the disputant's entities other than that the loan balance is reduced or cancelled. The money for the repayment was provided by the disputant's entities and with the repayment being returned to those entities, although not necessarily the same entity.

Judge Barber agreed with the Commissioner's submission that there could be no commercial rationale for such structuring and arrangement and that it could only be explained in terms of tax benefits. For example, when the Group needed funding for another project, it would take on high-interest commercial finance rather than call in the interest-free loan made to the disputant. At \[61\]:

*   The arrangement is explicable in terms of tax. The arrangement has enabled the disputant to avoid falling within the specific provisions relating to assessability of payment/reward for services, in particular sections CD 5 and CH 3 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The arrangement has also avoided the provisions which assess beneficiary income or, where a company, dividends. Even if I could find that the arrangement had a commercial purpose, the tax benefit is sufficiently significant for it to be a purpose other than a merely incidental purpose.

Regarding the time bar, it was submitted for the disputant that section 108 requires that there be an omission of "income ... of a particular nature ... or derived from a particular source". The disputant claimed that as the Commissioner had reconstructed the loans as income, and that the disputant had returned certain items of income in his tax returns, then the particular nature/source test was satisfied. His Honour held otherwise:

*   \[105\] The section is directed at the failure to mention income, not a failure to characterise it as income. In _Cross v CIR_ \[1987\] 9 NZTC 6,101, at 6,111, Somers J considered that the exception does not require a taxpayer to return an amount as income if the taxpayer asserts that it is not income, but it must be mentioned for the exception to not apply:  
    _"It would be an unreasonable construction of section 24(2) to hold that it requires the taxpayer to return that as income which he asserts is not income. If, however, he omits all mention of the gain which subsequently is found to be assessable income, section 24(2) will apply. The subsection is not directed to a failure to characterise the advantage as income but the failure to mention it at all. It is the latter omission which enables an amended assessment to be made after the four-year period has expired."_

The Authority confirmed the Commissioner's assessments and agreed that a 100% shortfall penalty should also apply to the disputant for taking an abusive tax position.

Ref: 22OIA1755 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6 May 2022 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 5 April 2022. You requested: In early 2013, Geof Nightingale and Struan Little presented a flowchart at an IFA session. The flowchart outlined a framework for how tax legislators should approach retrospective tax legislation. I'm requesting any documents or information that the IRD might have pertaining to this. The flowchart you mention was presented by Struan Little as a think-piece at the International Fiscal Association (IFA) session you refer to in your request. Please note that it was never formally adopted by Inland Revenue or the Treasury (the joint advisors on tax policy), or by Ministers. There are two documents in the scope of your request. The first, Taking a fixed tax position in a changing world – a personal perspective, is published on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website. The document is therefore withheld under section 18(d) of the OIA, as it is publicly available. You can read it here: https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/en/publications/2003/2003-other-oliver-speech-nzica. The second document, Retrospective Legislation – Guiding Principles Flowchart – For discussion only, is an expanded version of the flowchart that was presented at the IFA session. The document did not go further as an official document, and has not been updated since 2015. The document is released to you in full and is attached. Rights of review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz. Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman by email at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz. Publishing of OIA responses Please note that Inland Revenue regularly publishes responses to OIA requests that may be of interest to the wider public on its website. If this response is published, your personal details or any information that would identify you will be removed beforehand. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Retrospective Legislation – Guiding Principles Flowchart For discussion only (start here) Revenue No Error Gap Yes No No Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes No No No No No Coherence Neither Is the amendment: -a coherence change or -addressing a revenue risk? (See note 1) Is the fiscal cost of prospective legislation acceptable? (See note 2) Have taxpayers self-assessed on a contrary basis? Is the revenue risk from existing assessments acceptable? (See note 5) Is the amendment: -filling a gap in a regime or -fixing an obvious error? (Note 3) Consider fully retrospective application (see note 7) Default position: Prospective legislation only (see note 6) Have taxpayers self- assessed on a contrary basis? Is amendment taxpayer-friendly? Consider date of announcement /introduction application date (see note 8) Consider retrospective application with savings provision for returns filed prior to announcement (see note 9) Is taxpayer position common practice or widely accepted as correct? Do taxpayers have an objectively rational and legitimate expectation that their position be preserved? (See note 4) Released under the OIA \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] General Note This flowchart contains guiding principles only and is not designed to be prescriptive. It is recognised that the facts and circumstances of each case are likely to be unique - and variations between cases may legitimately prompt a response that differs from the “standard”. However, it is intended to be a helpful tool for ensuring that the right questions are asked when retrospective application dates for law changes are being considered. Note 1 – Coherence For the purposes of this note “coherence” means a change that supplements the legislation - in particular a relatively newly enacted regime. It either “fills gaps” in such a regime or confirms well-documented policy intent. In theory, such changes will include those covered by the Income Tax Act rewrite project. Note 2 – Acceptable fiscal cost Whether the anticipated fiscal cost of a prospective amendment is “acceptable” will need to factor in contingencies such as whether the amendment could result in taxpayers trying to amend existing assessments or cause a behavioural shift between announcement and enactment. It may be that a behavioural shift is viewed in retrospect after the GTTP has commenced (see note 8). Note 3 – Obvious error An “obvious error” is one that effectively renders the legislation unworkable – a defect that needs to be remedied, such as a cross-referencing error. It is not legislation that, on its face, can have two possible interpretations. Note 4 – Legitimate and rational expectations Does the person have a legitimate and rational expectation that the result they achieve through their interpretation was intended or is it a windfall gain at the expense of the tax base? An indicator may be whether the interpretation adopted accords with or contradicts the published policy behind the legislation. Note 5 – Risk of existing assessments The revenue risk represented by existing assessments will require legal input. Some taxpayers may have filed returns based on weak legal analysis. If the Department is confident of winning a dispute based on existing legislative wording, the combined effect of a savings provision and a Department judicial victory will effectively be the same as fully retrospective legislation. This will generally be more palatable than fully retrospective legislation. On the other hand, if the Department’s legal position is weak, but the revenue risk posed is substantial, fully retrospective legislation may still be considered. Note 6 - Prospective legislation In “prospective legislation” is included some legislation that may be strictly retrospective but, because of the delay in the passage of a bill through Parliament, takes effect shortly before Royal Assent. For example, an income tax change that takes effect on 1 April 2013 may not be enacted until June 2013. Because the returns for the 2013/14 year do not have to be prepared until 2014, the change can reasonably be regarded as prospective in substance. However, this should be avoided where possible and, in particular, should not leave taxpayers in a position where they have to file returns without the benefit of settled law. This legislation is subject to the full generic tax policy process. Released under the OIA \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Note 7 – Fully retrospective legislation “Fully retrospective” means retrospective without exception. The actual application date will be fact specific, but can include: the date a particular regime or Act came into force, the date of a previous amendment that created the issue, or the date before which taxpayers cannot seek to amend existing assessments. “Fully retrospective” also includes legislation that has the same effect – for example, legislation that requires taxpayers to reverse out advantages accrued under existing legislation. These amendments will not follow the full GTTP, but will be subject to public scrutiny at the select committee phase, where any anomalies with the details can be addressed. Note 8 – Date of government announcement/introduction This note treats announcement and introduction as synonymous on the understanding that either will be the first time the proposed amendment is announced to the taxpaying community. It may be that consultation on an issue has raised the possibility of an unacceptable behavioural shift. A ‘date of announcement’ change may therefore come after the first consultation stage of the GTTP and what was to be a prospective change becomes a date of introduction amendment to mitigate the risk resulting from the behavioural shift. Date of announcement/introduction changes will ideally: • Follow the GTTP as to the detail, while recognising that the select committee phase might be the most appropriate forum for debate • Be backed by Ministerial statement • Provide business certainty to the extent possible by setting out the scope of the change and transactions/parties affected (proposed legislation for complex issues will be present for date of introduction changes but should also be considered for announcement amendments) • Be enacted as soon as possible to avoid taxpayers having to file returns on uncertain legal position (i.e., having to choose between existing legislation and announced amendment). Note 9 – Savings provisions for returns filed before announcement This category presupposes that announcing a change will prompt a behavioural shift that is undesirable from a revenue and/or efficiency perspective. Where this behavioural shift is not considered likely or to have adverse consequences, a savings provision for returns filed before enactment can be considered instead. As mentioned above (note 5), saving filed returns also allows the Department to pursue taxpayers through the tax disputes process if it is considered that their position is legally questionable. Similar rules should apply as for date of announcement amendments (note 8, above). Two variations on this type of amendment are: • When an amendment affects an agreement, “returns filed” can be modified to “agreements entered into”. However, grand-parenting existing arrangements should only be used when the affected arrangements are relatively short. This keeps the period when two sets of rules are running in parallel to a minimum. • When the revenue risk is greater, “returns filed” can be modified to taxpayers that have commenced dispute proceedings in respect of a particular interpretation.

Income tax returns are due 7 July
=================================

Get your income tax return right and file on time
=================================================

Find out whether you need to file and what recent changes may affect how you complete your income tax return for the tax year ended 31 March 2024.

If you've received an income tax return but believe you don't need to file one (for example if you've only earned salary and wage income and no additional untaxed income), please send us a message in myIR or call us so we can update your details.

Know what to file
-----------------

Show all

Individuals

You need to complete an individual income tax return at the end of the tax year if you received more than $200 (before tax) in income that we have not been told about.

We generally know about any taxed income you received during the year, like from salary or wages. But we do not always know about untaxed income. You'll need to declare any untaxed income, like from:

*   self-employment
*   overseas
*   rental property including Airbnb and Bookabach
*   taxable property sales
*   'under the table' cash jobs
*   an estate, trust, or partnership

Non-resident individuals

You'll need to pay tax to New Zealand on the income you earn from New Zealand sources if you're a non-resident.

We generally know about any taxed income you received during the year, like from salary or wages. But we do not always know about untaxed income. You'll need to complete a non-resident individual income tax return if you:

*   received income from New Zealand that was not taxed
*   received income from New Zealand that was taxed at the wrong rate, or
*   had losses or [excess imputation credits](/api/glossary/item?id={1E50FAAC-3A37-42C5-A03F-17B749D56F25})
     carried forward from the previous year.

Companies

If your company is a New Zealand resident for tax purposes, and is active in New Zealand, you'll need to complete a company income tax return at the end of the tax year.

You may need to give us financial information about your company in your tax return, or in other financial reports.

[Financial reporting for companies](/managing-my-tax/record-keeping/financial-reporting-for-companies)

If you're no longer trading, you still have to file returns unless you complete a non-active company declaration.

Trusts and estates

You need to complete a trust and estate income tax return if you are a trustee of a trust, or the executor or administrator of a deceased person's estate, to account for any income the trust or the estate earns.

[Trusts and estates](/roles/trusts-and-estates)

If you meet the criteria, you can declare a trust as non-active. If your application is approved, you will not have to file income tax returns for your trust.

[Cease a trust or estate](/roles/trusts-and-estates/cease-a-trust-or-estate)

In 2022 changes were made to the annual reporting requirements for trusts. Most trusts are now required to provide more information in their tax returns. Check what additional information you need to provide.

Partnerships and look-through companies

Partnerships file partnership and look-through company income tax returns each year. These returns show how much profit or loss was shared between each partner.

Partnerships do not pay income tax on their profits. Instead, the profit or loss is shared between the partners. The partners separately pay income tax on any profit, and they can also claim any partnership losses against their own personal income.

Each partner also needs to file their own Individual income tax return showing their partnership income or losses.

Clubs and societies

New Zealand clubs and societies must file a Clubs or societies income tax return every year unless they have an income tax exemption.

Your club or society may be able to claim tax benefits if it's being run as a not-for-profit. This could include paying less or no tax and not having to file income tax returns. Your club or society needs to meet certain requirements and you'll need to apply to us to be approved as a not-for-profit.

Financial support might affect how you file your return
-------------------------------------------------------

If you received a leave subsidy payment during the 2024 tax year you’ll need to declare the income on your income tax return. This includes payments that you may have received through another entity (e.g. a company, partnership, or trust).

If you file in myIR, the leave subsidy you have received should appear automatically in the 'Government subsidies' field of your return. You just need to check the amount is correct.

[Leave subsidies](/covid-19/business-and-organisations/employing-staff/leave-subsidies)

Claiming mortgage interest for residential rental properties
------------------------------------------------------------

Interest limitation rules apply to residential rental properties unless an exclusion or exemption applies.

If you own a residential rental property and purchased it before 27 March 2021, the ability to deduct interest as an expense remains at 50% for the period 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024.

If the property was purchased on or after 27 March 2021, no interest can be claimed.

There are some exclusions and exemptions from the rules. For example, main homes, property development and new builds.

Talk to a professional or find out more on our website.

[Property interest limitation rules](/property/renting-out-residential-property/residential-rental-income-and-paying-tax-on-it/property-interest-rules)

If you’re claiming interest expenses (deductions), you need to complete the interest fields in your income tax return as well as completing your IR3R. Please copy the amounts from your IR3R to the relevant fields in your income tax return.

If you’ve sold a property that meets the bright-line property rule, then you’ll need to complete an IR833 alongside your tax return and include any share of profit in your return. The share of profit can be found at box 12 of your IR833 and needs to be added to the net bright-line profit (excluding losses) field in your tax return.

750,000 automatic tax refunds for wage and salary earners next year – the biggest tax change in 20 years
========================================================================================================

**03 August 2018**

Inland Revenue (IR) expects that next year, about 750,000 tax refunds will be automatically generated for wage and salary earners who don’t usually apply to get their tax back.

Speaking to the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee (last Wednesday), Inland Revenue Commissioner Naomi Ferguson said that, subject to legislation before the committee being passed, this would be the biggest change to individual tax in nearly 20 years.

Ms Ferguson said it hasn’t been mandatory for wage and salary earners to fill out an IR personal tax summary (PTS) but if they had and it had indicated a refund, they could have filed a return and received that refund.

“In the new system all wage and salary earners’ tax will be calculated and refunds sent automatically,” she said. “About 110,000 more, who also haven’t been filing, will have an amount to pay – they'll be notified automatically.”

“Getting a refund, if you’re entitled to one, will be a whole lot simpler because it will be done for you,” she said. “The only reason for contacting IR now will be to tell us about any additional income information that we need to know.

“Put simply, IR will now look at the information we have about an individual and if we’re confident we have all their information, we’ll calculate and finalise their tax position for the year and generate an automatic refund - so there’s no need for a PTS, making it a very simple process for wage and salary earners.

“But it’s still a big change from what so many people have become used to.

“It will be very important that everyone has made sure the details we hold about them – bank account number, contact details and so on – are fully up to date so the new system works well for them. We’ll be communicating widely to make sure customers know what’s changing, when, and what they need to do,” she said.

Other changes that will come into effect from April 2019 include:

*   making it easier to manage income tax and Working for Families, which includes some changes to myIR for both businesses and individuals
*   reporting of PAYE information every payday for employers – which is now voluntary – becomes compulsory, and
*   more regular reporting of investment income information becomes voluntary – and then mandatory a year later.
