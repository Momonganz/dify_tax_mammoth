As part of a wider consultation process, Inland Revenue have commissioned colmar brunton to undertake both qualitative and quantitative research with businesses and tax agents to seek their input. This report presents the findings of the quantitative research. Telephone surveys of 1611 small businesses and 400 tax agents were conducted between 25 November and 13 December 2002. The maximum margins of error at a total sample level are +/-2.4% and +/-4.9% respectively. A summary of the salient points is provided below. Current practices 82% of the research participants in this research use a tax agent. Businesses most commonly use the services of tax agents for filing end of year income returns (80%), ahead of filing GST returns (19%), filing FBT returns (17%), advice only (15%) and filing employer monthly schedules (8%). Reasons why businesses use a tax agent for filing employer monthly schedules and GST returns most commonly relate to issues of convenience (e.g. saving time) as well as the expertise and/or perceived lack of expertise of the business. Among quarterly FBT filers, 44% are aware that they use the flat rate calculation, 18% know that they use the full multi-rate calculation and 3% know that they use the short form multi-rate calculation; 13% know that they use the multi-rate but are not sure which form and 22% donï¿½t know what calculation they use. Payroll practices 10% of small employers use a payroll company or tax agent to process their PAYE. Small employers that donï¿½t use a payroll company generally do not feel they have enough employees for it to be worthwhile (39%) or feel it is easy to do themselves (38%); cost is an issue for 19%. 19% of small employers use a payroll package. Direct credit is the most common payment method among small employers (61%); 31% pay by cheque. Compliance costs Inland Revenue is the government department considered to have the greatest impact on businesses in terms of compliance costs (70% of businesses name Inland Revenue as the biggest impact and 15% as the second biggest impact) ACC ranks second in terms of compliance costs; 12% consider them to have the biggest impact and 46% the second biggest impact. Tax-related compliance costs faced by Inland Revenue vary with no one or two costs dominating across the business community. By a small margin, the most common costs relate to provisional tax payments not being aligned to cash flow and the time spent filling in a large number of Inland Revenue forms. The results for each type of tax-related compliance cost are illustrated below. Figure  SEQ Figure \\\* ARABIC 1: Tax Related Business Compliance Costs  EMBED MSGraph.Chart.8 \\s  Base: Total Sample (N=1,611) Source: Small Business Survey Reducing compliance costs Without prompting, both businesses and tax agents were asked to name the one thing that Inland Revenue could do to reduce tax-related compliance costs. Suggestions are extremely wide ranging. Most commonly they relate to: less paper/written documentation (9% of businesses and 13% of tax agents) a more lenient penalties system (7% of businesses and 8% of tax agents) simplification of the tax systems and rules generally (7% of businesses and 6% of tax agents) amalgamation of taxes and payments (6% of businesses, 11% of large employers and 12% of tax agents) changes to payment dates, especially a common date (5% of businesses and 8% of tax agents) development of electronic products (5% of businesses and 5% of tax agents) financial assistance/incentives (5% of businesses) changes to the provisional tax system (5% of businesses) revision of FBT (9% of large employers and 10% of tax agents). GST and provisional Tax Frequency of filing GST The options of monthly, quarterly, and four-monthly filing of GST were tested with participants. None of the options hold strong appeal. Of these options, quarterly filing is most favoured with 33% of businesses rating their chances of taking up this option as at least good (19% rated their chances as high). Tax agents appear to be more strongly in favour of quarterly filing with 43% of agents rating their chances of recommending quarterly filing to their clients as at least good (20% of agents rated their chances as high). Frequency of filing provisional tax The options of monthly, two-monthly and quarterly filing of provisional tax were tested. Again, none of these hold widespread appeal. Among businesses, monthly filing holds greater appeal with 32% rating their chances of taking up this option as at least good (21% rate their chances as high). Tax agents tend to show a slightly stronger preference for quarterly filing (29% rate their chances of recommending this as at least good and 10% as high). Tying provisional tax to GST The concept of paying provisional tax and GST together, with last yearï¿½s tax liability and total sales used to determine the rate for paying provisional tax in the current year, holds considerable appeal; 48% of businesses rate their chances of taking up this option as at least good with 29% indicating a high likelihood. Tax agents are less favourable in their support for this concept with 34% rating their chances of recommending such an initiative as at least good (and 16% rating their chances as high). Additional results for tax agents are: 34% of agents believe the concept of tying provisional tax to GST would benefit none of their Non-Individual GST registered clients. Thirty-three percent of agents believe it would benefit more than 30% of these types of clients. Tax agent support for the concept is higher if there is a guarantee that the total provisional tax paid is held to 105% of a clientï¿½s Residual Income Tax; 41% indicate at least a good prospect of recommending the option to their clients if the tax is fixed compared to 30% if the tax is not fixed. Forty-two percent of agents believe this initiative would benefit more than 30% of their Individual GST registered clients who can use ï¿½safe-harbourï¿½ if the tax is fixed. If it is not fixed, 35% of agents believe more than 30% of these clients would benefit. Businesses who are supportive of the concept of tying provisional tax to GST most commonly request filing two-monthly (50%). In contrast, tax agents tend to prefer quarterly filing over two-monthly filing (40% and 35% respectively). Voluntary provisional tax payments Both businesses and tax agents show strong support for voluntarily paying provisional tax payments in the first year of business (for a tax discount): 64% of businesses (who have been in business for three or less years) rate their prospects of doing this, if they were in a position of starting up a new business again, as at least good; 45% rate their chances as high 78% of tax agents rate their chances of recommending this option to their clients as at least good; 55% rate their chances as high. Around two-thirds of businesses and tax agents suggest a tax discount of 10% or less. PAYE and FBT There is significant appeal among employers (with less than $15,000 PAYE) in filing employer monthly schedules every two months; 51% rate their chances of taking up this option as at least good with 34% rating their chances as high. Employers that offer their staff fringe benefits find appeal in the concept of transferring the responsibility of calculating their FBT to Inland Revenue by providing fringe benefit information with their employer monthly schedules. Preference, however, tends to be for doing this on a quarterly basis; 47% of businesses rate their chances of taking up this concept as at least good if it is done on a quarterly basis (27% rate their chances of doing this as high). Payment dates One payment date to cover all tax revenues is strongly favoured with the large majority of businesses (79%) indicating that there is at least a good chance that they would support this (64% rate their chances as high). There is also significant support among tax agents for one payment date although it appears to be weaker than among businesses; 48% of tax agents rate their idea at least a six (on a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is a very bad idea and 10 is an excellent idea). Businessesï¿½ preference is for the last day in the month to be the common due date (43% request the last day, 15% between the 20th and the last day, and 28% suggest the 20th). Around one-half of businesses believe that it would be more difficult to file GST on time if the payment date is the 20th. Tax agents are even more concerned in this regard with 64% saying that it would be more difficult for their clients that file GST on a payments basis to pay on time, and 61% feel this would be more difficult for their clients that file GST on an invoice basis. Advisory service 13% of businesses that have been in existence for three years or less have received an individual Advisory Service visit and 7% have attend an Advisory seminar. Nearly half (48%) of those that have received an individual visit say that a follow-up visit would have been useful. 40% of tax agents have clients that have used Inland Revenueï¿½s Advisory Service. 40% of tax agents recommend to their clients that they use Inland Revenueï¿½s Advisory Service. There is a positive correlation between use and recommendation. E-enablement Businessesï¿½ use of computers and the Internet 84% of businesses have computer access. This varies by business type from 68% for partnerships to 100% for large employers. 75% of businesses have Internet access. Again, this varies by business type from 53% for partnerships to 95% for large employers. Businessesï¿½ use of existing electronic products 18% of employers use ir-File. Use correlates strongly with size of business in terms of number of employees; 71% of employers with more than 20 employees use ir-File. The most common reasons given for not filing employer schedules electronically relate to a belief that the current system is easier or better (29%), lack of awareness that ir-File exists (17%) and lack of knowledge about computers and how ir-File works (19%). 27% of businesses use Inland Revenueï¿½s website (49% of large employers and 31% of companies use the website). 12% of businesses make electronic tax payments (23% of large employers do this). Businessesï¿½ likely uptake of e-enablement products There is considerable support for the various e-enablement products proposed. There is greatest appeal in: accessing information about their account with Inland Revenue on-line (63% of businesses rate their chances of using this in the next 12 months as at least good with 51% rating their chances as high) corresponding with Inland Revenue staff over the Internet securely (52% at least good, 39% high) Considerable appeal is also evident for: an on-line tool that provides binding rulings on complex technical issues such as whether a person is an employee or independent contractor (48% at least good, 34% high) filing returns over the Internet (47% at least good, 37% high); the most common request is for GST returns to be able to be filed electronically calculators and tools on-line that they can use to help with complex calculations such as FBT (46% at least good, 36% high) making tax payments via Internet banking (43% at least good, 34% high). Potential up-take of each of these options is notably high among large employers and to a lesser extent companies. Tax agentsï¿½ prospects of recommending the e-enablement products to their clients are also high although tax agents rank the suitability of these products differently than businesses: Tax agents are most in favour of their clients: making tax payments electronically (72% rate their chances of recommending this to their clients as at least good and 54% rate their chances of recommending as high) on-line account access (69% at least good, 55% high) Tax agents are least supportive of their clients using on-line tools that provide binding rulings on complex technical issues (40% at least good and 12% high). Among businesses, barriers to using the e-enablement products relate to belief of a better or easier alternative (34%), failure to see the relevance or benefit of the products to their business (20%), lack of knowledge about computers (21%), lack or cost of software/hardware (18%), and fears and concerns about the new systems (e.g. security) (18%). Inland Revenue can best support businesses in taking up the e-enablement products by: sending an Inland Revenue person to visit their business to show them how to use the electronic tools (50%) providing assurances about security (45%) approving standard software packages (44%) making available written communications to explain the tools (44%) providing assurances about penalties (39%) holding seminars to explain the tools (31%). Agentsï¿½ use of existing products 88% of agents have access to the Internet Tax agents currently most commonly use Inland Revenueï¿½s website (79%) ahead of e-file (24%), ir-File (20%), electronic tax payments (20%), on-line tools (15%), and filing GST returns on-line (4%). Agentsï¿½ reasons for not using the electronic products most commonly relate to a failure to see the benefit or relevance of them to the agentsï¿½ business or clients (44%), a better or easier alternative (27%) and the lack or cost of hardware or software - especially a Pacnet connection (21%). Inland Revenue can best support agents in taking up the products by providing standard software packages approved by Inland Revenue (61%) and accepting e-file data over the Internet rather than by Pacnet connection (55%). Agentsï¿½ likely uptake of e-enablement products Tax agents indicate strong support for taking up e-enablement products within the next 12 months. The most popular products are: Looking up their clientsï¿½ account details on-line (90% rate their chances of taking up this option as at least good with 84% rating their chances as high) On-line tools that provide binding rulings on complex technical issues (79% at least good, 61% high) Corresponding with Inland Revenue staff over the internet (78% at least good, 63% high). Notable support is also given for: Filing Income Tax returns on-line (70% at least good, 58% high) Calculators and tools on-line that can be used to help with complex calculations such as FBT (68% at least good, 53% high) Filing GST returns on-line (67% at least good, 54% high) Filing FBT returns on-line (56% at least good, 46% high). Unpaid tax collector role In the context of how Inland Revenue can best recognise businessesï¿½ role as a tax collector of GST and PAYE on behalf of the Government, businesses rated a number of ideas using a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is not at all important to their relationship with Inland Revenue and 10 is extremely important. The following are considered to be of high importance: More tolerant treatment in terms of penalties and interest for those that have a good record (mean score of 9.1.) Inland Revenue answering their telephone calls more quickly (8.9) When calling Inland Revenue, the staff person giving their name and contact details so they can contact them again (8.4) Reply paid envelopes (8.0). A thank-you letter is considered to be of relatively low importance (mean score of 3.5). Call centres 28% of businesses are aware of the Call Centresï¿½ full opening hours 40% of businesses choose the line depending on the tax revenue that their enquiry relates to. Information Two-thirds of businesses feel that the amount of information that Inland Revenue provides on businessesï¿½ tax rights and responsibilities throughout the year is about right (66%); 19% feel it is too much and 10% feel it is not enough. Businesses hold most confidence in receiving correct and accurate information from their tax agent (mean score of 8.3 using a scale from 0 to 10 where 0 is not at all confident and 10 is extremely confident), followed by Inland Revenueï¿½s booklets and newsletters (7.3) and written correspondence (7.6). Least confidence is held in Inland Revenueï¿½s call centres (5.8). A similar pattern emerges in looking at tax agentsï¿½ views. Processes dealing with not filing returns 56% of small employers that have periods with no employees find Inland Revenueï¿½s processes in dealing with information about this as either very or quite adequate; 22% find the processes to be inadequate. Tax agent issues Tax agents identify a wide range of issues that they perceive to be a waste of their time and/or to contribute unnecessarily to their clientsï¿½ fees. These issues tend to fall into three general categories: Inland Revenue errors ï¿½ most commonly incorrect statements of account and assessment (11%), transferring dollars into wrong period (6%), transferring money into wrong tax type (5%). The complexity of Inland Revenue processes and requirements ï¿½ most commonly FBT (8%) and the need to provide information in writing (3%). The inadequacy of Inland Revenue processes ï¿½ most commonly delays in follow-up correspondence (4%), and Inland Revenueï¿½s phone system (2%). Most agents consider Inland Revenueï¿½s processes for dealing with registering or deregistering agentsï¿½ clients for particular types to be very adequate (22%) or quite adequate (62%); 13% feel that these processes are quite inadequate. A year-end summary of GST and PAYE returns and payment data submitted by an agentï¿½s client holds great appeal; using a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is a very bad idea and 10 is an excellent idea, 72% of agents rate this idea as at least an eight. Conclusions and recommendations This section provides colmar bruntonï¿½s research conclusions and recommendations. These have been formulated by drawing together key learnings from both the qualitative and quantitative research phases. A range of initiatives are needed to reduce compliance costs The nature and impact of tax-related compliance costs clearly vary considerably within the small business community. Whilst one or two issues (i.e. provisional tax payments not being aligned with cash flow and the time spent filling in large numbers of Inland Revenue forms) appear to be more widely experienced than others, no strong pattern of prioritisation emerges. Perhaps partly in line with this, no single proposed initiative attracts universal appeal. These findings reinforce Inland Revenueï¿½s expectation, at the outset of this programme of change, that a range of initiatives will be required. And, indeed, a number of the initiatives tested in this research hold strong appeal with notable proportions of the small business community, suggesting that progression and further developmental work is certainly warranted. The initiatives that hold significant potential for reducing the tax-related compliance costs of the small business community are outlined below. Single payment date Of all the concepts tested, the proposition of a single payment date to cover all tax revenues received the most widespread vote of approval. We recommend, however, that this initiative only be implemented if it is feasible for the due date to be made the last day in the month. The research indicates that asking GST registrants to file GST by the 20th of the month will cause considerable concern. Voluntary provisional tax payments This suggestion also has the potential to reduce compliance costs for new businesses. Both businesses and tax agents strongly support this concept. However, a discount of at least 10% appears to be required for many to take up the option. Inland Revenue calculating FBT Around half of large employers find the concept of providing Inland Revenue with information on a quarterly basis, to enable Inland Revenue to calculate the FBT, appealing. Like the other initiatives tested in this research, however, not all employers favour this concept. It therefore needs to be optional. It should also be noted that employers in this research gave their approval in conceptual terms only. Taxpayers in this research, and other research projects we have conducted for Inland Revenue, call for simplicity. The implications of this are not limited to ensuring that the existing employer schedule does not become excessively complex. By simplicity, taxpayers also talk about the need for information to be targeted and tailored to their needs. So, for example, it may well be that employers that do not offer fringe benefits to their staff, or wish to take up the proposed initiative, would prefer not to be faced with an employer schedule that allows for this additional information to be incorporated. Due to these types of issues, we recommend that the processes involved in effectively implementing this concept be tested at a practical level. Finally in regard to this concept, this research indicates that to overcome businessesï¿½ distrust in Inland Revenueï¿½s ability to provide accurate information, any FBT invoice will need to be accompanied by a statement that clearly shows how the FBT has been calculated. Tying provisional tax to GST There is considerable potential for this option to reduce the compliance costs of businesses that struggle with cyclical cash flows. At a conceptual level, this initiative holds much appeal. This initiative is the most complex initiative tested as part of this research project and as such some participants found the concept quite difficult to grasp. Whether businesses elect this option will depend on: how it is implemented and communicated in practice (up-take will be hampered by overly complex processes and/or communications) the advice and recommendation of a businessï¿½s tax agent (this appears in part to depend on whether the total provisional tax paid is guaranteed to be held to 105% of a clientï¿½s Residual Income Tax). Agents appear to view this proposed initiative less favourably than businesses. One of their key reservations is whether turnover on its own sufficiently reflects profit (e.g. in a labour intensive business). This issue is also raised by businesses. On the other hand, however, both agents and businesses acknowledge the need for this initiative to avoid becoming overly complex. Given these issues, we suggest that this initiative needs further testing once it has been developed in more detail. The research findings point to this initiative being introduced on a two-monthly filing basis as best meeting small businessesï¿½ needs. Frequency of filing Note, this research tested a number of different options for frequency of filing GST and provisional tax with mixed reaction. Whilst some businesses consider less frequent filing would reduce their compliance costs, other businesses believe this contravenes best practice principles (ie. doing it early, regularly and as the information comes to hand). Filing employer schedules every two months This proposition finds favour with around half of small employers. Some also feel that less frequent filing of PAYE contravenes best practice principles, but this tends to be less of an issue than it is for GST. E-enablement The research findings regarding e-enablement products strongly support Inland Revenueï¿½s focus in this area. Businesses, even those not currently ï¿½electronically literateï¿½, see this as the way of the future. And, more importantly, predicted levels of up-take of these products reinforce this. On-line account access holds particular appeal for both businesses and tax agents. Some businesses see this product as a solution to their frustrations with the perceived untimely and complex nature of the current statements. Whilst this research suggests that on-line account access should be a high priority, the current statements also need to be reviewed (as the on-line product does not appeal to all). This research shows that businesses currently sit along a continuum of stages in readiness to take up electronic products. A framework of these stages is illustrated below. The tasks that Inland Revenue need to undertake to shift businesses along the stages of behaviour change vary depending on what stage a business is currently at. Figure  SEQ Figure \\\* ARABIC 2: Stages of Behaviour Change  A significant number of businesses appear to be in the Pre-contemplation stage; this is evident from the number of businesses that comment that they fail to see the relevance or benefit of the electronic products to their business. It will be important here for Inland Revenue to clearly communicate how electronic transactions will benefit the business. For those further along the continuum (i.e Contemplation), as well as communicating the benefits it will be important to overcome perceived costs/risks of the systems. In particular, this research indicates that businesses need reassurances about security of the systems and penalties (should the ï¿½systemï¿½ cause them to miss a deadline). Increasing the influence of others (tax agents are key here) and addressing self-efficacy issues are especially important for those in the Preparation stage. This research has highlighted a strong desire for an Inland Revenue staff person to visit the business to show them how to set up the systems and use the products. Expand the Advisory Service Expansion of Inland Revenueï¿½s Advisory Service would fulfil two needs: More follow-up visits for new businesses. Many new businesses feel that one visit is insufficient. For some of these businesses, follow-up visits would ideally occur a few months after the initial visit as they have had a chance to put in practice initial advice and processes. Educating businesses on new initiatives and products. There may be a need to up-skill Advisory service staff to be able to effectively assist businesses with new initiatives such as e-enablement products. Recognise their role as unpaid tax collectors This research has highlighted a number of ways in which Inland Revenue can improve their relationship with the small business community and better recognise their role as unpaid tax collectors. Of top priority, in the eyes of taxpayers, is more tolerant treatment in terms of penalties and interest. (The qualitative research details the specific principles that businesses feel should underpin the penalties and interest system). Many of the issues and ideas raised in this research have significant policy and service implications. Other ideas, such as prepaid envelopes, may not involve big changes to the tax system, but are gestures of goodwill that have the potential to make a positive impact on small businessesï¿½ perceptions of Inland Revenue including the value that they perceive the Department places on the small business community. Appreciate small businessesï¿½ varying needs This research has highlighted a number of key challenges for Inland Revenue in implementing a programme of change. Indeed, we believe the following issues are critical to the success of the programme. Small businesses desire flexibility A strong theme in this research is the desire for Inland Revenue to be flexible. ï¿½Flexibilityï¿½you canï¿½t have strict down the line rules because there is always something that fits outside of them and there is always a situation that occurs in businesses that throws all the good plans out the window.ï¿½ (Small business) Flexibility is also about recognising that small businesses are not all alike. They differ not only in terms of the physical and financial characteristics of their business, but also in terms of the approaches they take to their bookwork and their levels of confidence, knowledge and anxiety. This has a number of implications. First and foremost, small businesses (and tax agents) call for new initiatives to be optional. Providing options is not just about acknowledging that new initiatives may not meet the business needs of some businesses. It also recognises that some businesses are strongly resistant to change because the current system is familiar and they are fearful of any change. (The types of support that these businesses require in taking on new initiatives are different to those required by businesses that are keen to embrace change; this is addressed later in this section). Herein lies a dilemma. Whilst businesses demand options, there is a real danger of overwhelming businesses with ï¿½yet more optionsï¿½. This could lead to businesses feeling like the ï¿½loadï¿½ is heavier than it was before the changes (this is a fear of the Reassurance Seekers and the Reluctant Acceptors). Inland Revenue will need to consider these opposing tensions carefully for each proposed initiative. Different needs require different types of support Further, for any initiatives to be implemented successfully, Inland Revenue must deliver different types and levels of support to cater for different needs. Small businesses vary in the level of anxiety they experience in dealing with tax and Inland Revenue and the extent to which they feel their relationship with Inland Revenue is an equal one versus Inland Revenue being in control. This is also closely linked to the extent to which businesses embrace or resist change. Four different sets of small business needs are illustrated in the following diagram. Figure  SEQ Figure \\\* ARABIC 3: Small Business Needs  Letï¿½s take the Reassurance Seeker as an example. These businesses lack knowledge and confidence in dealing with tax. Hence, they tend to be quite dependent on their tax agent. Although resistant to change, because they fear not being able to cope, the Reassurance Seeker can see potential benefits to their business in a number of the proposed initiatives. However, to cope with taking up these initiatives they will need to be walked through the change process step by step. Their driving need is to feel supported and reassured in the process of change. One of the best ways that this can be achieved is via a face-to-face visit from an Inland Revenue person. In this way, Inland Revenue can build the Reassurance Seekerï¿½s confidence and show that the Department is willing to listen. Tax agents Tax agents clearly play a critical role in small businesses meeting their tax obligations. Some groups of businesses (e.g. the Reluctant Acceptors) are more dependent on their agent than other groups. Nevertheless, this research indicates that tax agents will significantly influence the decisions of small businesses in taking up the initiatives that Inland Revenue proceed with. This has a number of implications: The predicted levels of uptake among businesses outlined in this report are likely to be over-estimates given that agents generally show less enthusiasm for the initiatives than the business community. Consultation and communications with tax agents will be critical for the effective execution of the initiatives. One element of this would appear to be about finding ways of working with agents so that the agentsï¿½ advisory role is not devalued in any way. There is the potential for some agents to feel protective of their ï¿½territoryï¿½ with Inland Revenue implementing this programme of change. On a final note, this research also points to areas where Inland Revenue can improve their relations with tax agents. These tend to relate to process issues (and are outlined in detail in this report and the qualitative research report). Based on the research findings, we also recommend that Inland Revenue provide a year-end summary of client transactions for agents. Background and Objectives Inland Revenue, in partnership with Treasury, has embarked on a major exploration into ways of reducing the compliance costs of small businesses. This exploration is at the request of the Minister of Revenue and is in line with Inland Revenueï¿½s Statement of Intent; in particular that Inland Revenueï¿½s desired future involve taxpayers meeting their obligations of their own accord ï¿½ and Inland Revenue making this easy. From previous research, Inland Revenue has identified the following areas where compliance cost reductions could be made for small businesses: The time involved in completing the sheer volume of returns and payments that businesses must send to Inland Revenue each year (steady state activity) The ï¿½one-offï¿½ processes and services that Inland Revenue provides when business start or stop ongoing operations (exceptions to steady state) Concern that the penalties and interest regime donï¿½t have regard to businessesï¿½ (generally good) compliance history, or acknowledge their ï¿½unpaid tax collectorï¿½ role Prompt access to knowledgeable Inland Revenue inquiry services staff Greater ability to transact tax business electronically The costs incurred in acquiring accounting services for year-end Income Tax return filing. These costs are primarily incurred for the precise profit determination required by tax law, but this level of accuracy is often superfluous to small business information needs. It is envisaged that a comprehensive approach and mix of interventions will be required including improvements to administrative processes and greater use of electronic technology, as well as legislative changes. Inland Revenue are undertaking a consultation process with the business community to seek their input. Primary research with businesses and tax agents is one component of this consultation process. Inland Revenue have commissioned colmar brunton to undertake two primary research phases: qualitative and quantitative research with both small businesses and tax agents. The broad objectives of both phases of the research are to: understand and prioritise common tax-related compliance cost issues, as perceived by small business operators identify and discuss possible solutions to those small business tax-related compliance cost problems understand compliance cost problems specific to those business operators who have recently ended or set up a new operation or entity identify barriers to the implementation of new electronic solutions to be offered by Inland Revenue, and how these might be overcome determine probable take up rates of any solutions that Inland Revenue is able to offer to reduce compliance costs. This report presents the findings of the quantitative research phase. Findings from the qualitative research phase are presented in a separate report. Research Methodology Telephone surveys of 1611 small businesses and 400 tax agents were conducted between 25 November and 13 December 2002. All interviews were conducted using CATI (Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing). Due to the number of information areas to be covered with businesses, two versions of the questionnaire were used for the business survey. A core set of questions (considered to be of higher priority) was included in both questionnaire versions. The business survey was piloted with 15 businesses to test for respondent understanding of the questions. The tax agent questionnaire was pre-tested qualitatively in six in-depth face-to-face qualitative interviews. Contact lists were provided by Inland Revenue for both the business and tax agent surveys. Inland Revenue used specific criteria in drawing the sample for this research to reflect those businesses that are of particular interest to Inland Revenue in undertaking this programme of research and consultation. Hence, the business survey is representative of these groups of businesses rather than of all businesses. The criteria used in selecting businesses for participation in this research is detailed in the table below along with the number of interviews achieved. Quotas were set to ensure sufficient numbers of interviews were achieved in each group to enable robust sub-group analysis. Sample SizeMaximum margin of errorLarge employer (Filed both EMS and quarterly FBT return for month of June 2002/balances were non-zero) 301+/- 5.6%Small employer (Filed EMS and have less than 10 employees for month of June 2002, and not active for FBT)318+/- 5.5%Individual (Self-employed and have a provisional tax liability on their 2001 return with RIT of more than $2,500)279+/- 5.9%Company (Filed GST return for the March 2002 period and have a provisional tax liability on their 2001 return with RIT of more than $2,500)280+/- 5.9%Partnership (GST turnover of between $100,000 and $1.2 million per annum/No provisional tax liability)275+/- 5.9%Trust (Filed GST return for the March 2002 period and have a provisional tax liability on their 2001 return with RIT of more than $2,500)158+/- 7.8%Total businesses1,611+/- 2.4%Total tax agents400+/- 4.9%Total number of interviews2,011n/aNote: all businesses with an annual GST turnover of more that $1.2 million per annum were excluded. Questions that were included in only one version of the business questionnaire carry a higher margin of error. The average interview lengths for the surveys were: 13 minutes for one version of the business survey 15 minutes for the other version of the business survey 18 minutes for the tax agent survey. The response rates to the surveys were: 39% for businesses 40% for tax agents.

Attention: Author(s): colmar brunton Social Research Agency Contact: Issue Date: 5 Februrary 2003 Prepared for: Inland Revenue FINAL QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH REPORT PAGE 1 colmar brunton Executive Summary At the request of the Minister of Revenue, Inland Revenue in partnership with Treasury, are looking at ways to reduce the compliance costs of small businesses. As part of a wider consultation process, Inland Revenue have commissioned colmar brunton to undertake both qualitative and quantitative research with businesses and tax agents to seek their input. This report presents the findings of the quantitative research. Telephone surveys of 1611 small businesses and 400 tax agents were conducted between 25 November and 13 December 2002. The maximum margins of error at a total sample level are +/-2.4% and +/- 4.9% respectively. A summary of the salient points is provided below. Current practices â¢ 82% of the research participants in this research use a tax agent. Businesses most commonly use the services of tax agents for filing end of year income returns (80%), ahead of filing GST returns (19%), filing FBT returns (17%), advice only (15%) and filing employer monthly schedules (8%). â¢ Reasons why businesses use a tax agent for filing employer monthly schedules and GST returns most commonly relate to issues of convenience (e.g. saving time) as well as the expertise and/or perceived lack of expertise of the business. â¢ Among quarterly FBT filers, 44% are aware that they use the flat rate calculation, 18% know that they use the full multi-rate calculation and 3% know that they use the short form multi-rate calculation; 13% know that they use the multi-rate but are not sure which form and 22% donât know what calculation they use. Payroll practices â¢ 10% of small employers use a payroll company or tax agent to process their PAYE. Small employers that donât use a payroll company generally do not feel they have enough employees for it to be worthwhile (39%) or feel it is easy to do themselves (38%); cost is an issue for 19%. â¢ 19% of small employers use a payroll package. â¢ Direct credit is the most common payment method among small employers (61%); 31% pay by cheque. Compliance costs â¢ Inland Revenue is the government department considered to have the greatest impact on businesses in terms of compliance costs (70% of businesses name Inland Revenue as the biggest impact and 15% as the second biggest impact) ACC ranks second in terms of compliance costs; 12% consider them to have the biggest impact and 46% the second biggest impact. â¢ Tax-related compliance costs faced by Inland Revenue vary with no one or two costs dominating across the business community. By a small margin, the most common costs relate to provisional tax payments not being aligned to cash flow and the time spent filling in a large number of Inland Revenue forms. The results for each type of tax-related compliance cost are illustrated below.

Suggestions are extremely wide ranging. Most commonly they relate to: â¢ less paper/written documentation (9% of businesses and 13% of tax agents) â¢ a more lenient penalties system (7% of businesses and 8% of tax agents) â¢ simplification of the tax systems and rules generally (7% of businesses and 6% of tax agents) â¢ amalgamation of taxes and payments (6% of businesses, 11% of large employers and 12% of tax agents) â¢ changes to payment dates, especially a common date (5% of businesses and 8% of tax agents) â¢ development of electronic products (5% of businesses and 5% of tax agents) â¢ financial assistance/incentives (5% of businesses) â¢ changes to the provisional tax system (5% of businesses) â¢ revision of FBT (9% of large employers and 10% of tax agents). GST and provisional Tax Frequency of filing GST The options of monthly, quarterly, and four-monthly filing of GST were tested with participants. None of the options hold strong appeal. Of these options, quarterly filing is most favoured with 33% of FINAL QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH REPORT PAGE 3 colmar brunton businesses rating their chances of taking up this option as at least good (19% rated their chances as high). Tax agents appear to be more strongly in favour of quarterly filing with 43% of agents rating their chances of recommending quarterly filing to their clients as at least good (20% of agents rated their chances as high). Frequency of filing provisional tax The options of monthly, two-monthly and quarterly filing of provisional tax were tested. Again, none of these hold widespread appeal. Among businesses, monthly filing holds greater appeal with 32% rating their chances of taking up this option as at least good (21% rate their chances as high). Tax agents tend to show a slightly stronger preference for quarterly filing (29% rate their chances of recommending this as at least good and 10% as high). Tying provisional tax to GST The concept of paying provisional tax and GST together, with last yearâs tax liability and total sales used to determine the rate for paying provisional tax in the current year, holds considerable appeal; 48% of businesses rate their chances of taking up this option as at least good with 29% indicating a high likelihood. Tax agents are less favourable in their support for this concept with 34% rating their chances of recommending such an initiative as at least good (and 16% rating their chances as high). Additional results for tax agents are: â¢ 34% of agents believe the concept of tying provisional tax to GST would benefit none of their Non- Individual GST registered clients. Thirty-three percent of agents believe it would benefit more than 30% of these types of clients. â¢ Tax agent support for the concept is higher if there is a guarantee that the total provisional tax paid is held to 105% of a clientâs Residual Income Tax; 41% indicate at least a good prospect of recommending the option to their clients if the tax is fixed compared to 30% if the tax is not fixed. â¢ Forty-two percent of agents believe this initiative would benefit more than 30% of their Individual GST registered clients who can use âsafe-harbourâ if the tax is fixed. If it is not fixed, 35% of agents believe more than 30% of these clients would benefit. Businesses who are supportive of the concept of tying provisional tax to GST most commonly request filing two-monthly (50%). In contrast, tax agents tend to prefer quarterly filing over two-monthly filing (40% and 35% respectively). Voluntary provisional tax payments Both businesses and tax agents show strong support for voluntarily paying provisional tax payments in the first year of business (for a tax discount): â¢ 64% of businesses (who have been in business for three or less years) rate their prospects of doing this, if they were in a position of starting up a new business again, as at least good; 45% rate their chances as high â¢ 78% of tax agents rate their chances of recommending this option to their clients as at least good; 55% rate their chances as high. â¢ Around two-thirds of businesses and tax agents suggest a tax discount of 10% or less. FINAL QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH REPORT PAGE 4 colmar brunton PAYE and FBT â¢ There is significant appeal among employers (with less than $15,000 PAYE) in filing employer monthly schedules every two months; 51% rate their chances of taking up this option as at least good with 34% rating their chances as high. â¢ Employers that offer their staff fringe benefits find appeal in the concept of transferring the responsibility of calculating their FBT to Inland Revenue by providing fringe benefit information with their employer monthly schedules. Preference, however, tends to be for doing this on a quarterly basis; 47% of businesses rate their chances of taking up this concept as at least good if it is done on a quarterly basis (27% rate their chances of doing this as high). Payment dates â¢ One payment date to cover all tax revenues is strongly favoured with the large majority of businesses (79%) indicating that there is at least a good chance that they would support this (64% rate their chances as high). â¢ There is also significant support among tax agents for one payment date although it appears to be weaker than among businesses; 48% of tax agents rate their idea at least a six (on a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is a very bad idea and 10 is an excellent idea). â¢ Businessesâ preference is for the last day in the month to be the common due date (43% request the last day, 15% between the 20 th and the last day, and 28% suggest the 20 th ). â¢ Around one-half of businesses believe that it would be more difficult to file GST on time if the payment date is the 20 th . Tax agents are even more concerned in this regard with 64% saying that it would be more difficult for their clients that file GST on a payments basis to pay on time, and 61% feel this would be more difficult for their clients that file GST on an invoice basis. Advisory service â¢ 13% of businesses that have been in existence for three years or less have received an individual Advisory Service visit and 7% have attend an Advisory seminar. â¢ Nearly half (48%) of those that have received an individual visit say that a follow-up visit would have been useful. â¢ 40% of tax agents have clients that have used Inland Revenueâs Advisory Service. â¢ 40% of tax agents recommend to their clients that they use Inland Revenueâs Advisory Service. There is a positive correlation between use and recommendation. E-enablement Businessesâ use of computers and the Internet â¢ 84% of businesses have computer access. This varies by business type from 68% for partnerships to 100% for large employers. â¢ 75% of businesses have Internet access. Again, this varies by business type from 53% for partnerships to 95% for large employers. Businessesâ use of existing electronic products â¢ 18% of employers use ir-File. Use correlates strongly with size of business in terms of number of employees; 71% of employers with more than 20 employees use ir-File. FINAL QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH REPORT PAGE 5 colmar brunton â¢ The most common reasons given for not filing employer schedules electronically relate to a belief that the current system is easier or better (29%), lack of awareness that ir-File exists (17%) and lack of knowledge about computers and how ir-File works (19%). â¢ 27% of businesses use Inland Revenueâs website (49% of large employers and 31% of companies use the website). â¢ 12% of businesses make electronic tax payments (23% of large employers do this). Businessesâ likely uptake of e-enablement products There is considerable support for the various e-enablement products proposed. There is greatest appeal in: â¢ accessing information about their account with Inland Revenue on-line (63% of businesses rate their chances of using this in the next 12 months as at least good with 51% rating their chances as high) â¢ corresponding with Inland Revenue staff over the Internet securely (52% at least good, 39% high) Considerable appeal is also evident for: â¢ an on-line tool that provides binding rulings on complex technical issues such as whether a person is an employee or independent contractor (48% at least good, 34% high) â¢ filing returns over the Internet (47% at least good, 37% high); the most common request is for GST returns to be able to be filed electronically â¢ calculators and tools on-line that they can use to help with complex calculations such as FBT (46% at least good, 36% high) â¢ making tax payments via Internet banking (43% at least good, 34% high). Potential up-take of each of these options is notably high among large employers and to a lesser extent companies. Tax agentsâ prospects of recommending the e-enablement products to their clients are also high although tax agents rank the suitability of these products differently than businesses: â¢ Tax agents are most in favour of their clients: - making tax payments electronically (72% rate their chances of recommending this to their clients as at least good and 54% rate their chances of recommending as high) - on-line account access (69% at least good, 55% high) â¢ Tax agents are least supportive of their clients using on-line tools that provide binding rulings on complex technical issues (40% at least good and 12% high). Among businesses, barriers to using the e-enablement products relate to belief of a better or easier alternative (34%), failure to see the relevance or benefit of the products to their business (20%), lack of knowledge about computers (21%), lack or cost of software/hardware (18%), and fears and concerns about the new systems (e.g. security) (18%). FINAL QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH REPORT PAGE 6 colmar brunton Inland Revenue can best support businesses in taking up the e-enablement products by: â¢ sending an Inland Revenue person to visit their business to show them how to use the electronic tools (50%) â¢ providing assurances about security (45%) â¢ approving standard software packages (44%) â¢ making available written communications to explain the tools (44%) â¢ providing assurances about penalties (39%) â¢ holding seminars to explain the tools (31%). Agentsâ use of existing products â¢ 88% of agents have access to the Internet â¢ Tax agents currently most commonly use Inland Revenueâs website (79%) ahead of e-file (24%), ir- File (20%), electronic tax payments (20%), on-line tools (15%), and filing GST returns on-line (4%). â¢ Agentsâ reasons for not using the electronic products most commonly relate to a failure to see the benefit or relevance of them to the agentsâ business or clients (44%), a better or easier alternative (27%) and the lack or cost of hardware or software - especially a Pacnet connection (21%). â¢ Inland Revenue can best support agents in taking up the products by providing standard software packages approved by Inland Revenue (61%) and accepting e-file data over the Internet rather than by Pacnet connection (55%). Agentsâ likely uptake of e-enablement products Tax agents indicate strong support for taking up e-enablement products within the next 12 months. The most popular products are: â¢ Looking up their clientsâ account details on-line (90% rate their chances of taking up this option as at least good with 84% rating their chances as high) â¢ On-line tools that provide binding rulings on complex technical issues (79% at least good, 61% high) â¢ Corresponding with Inland Revenue staff over the internet (78% at least good, 63% high). Notable support is also given for: â¢ Filing Income Tax returns on-line (70% at least good, 58% high) â¢ Calculators and tools on-line that can be used to help with complex calculations such as FBT (68% at least good, 53% high) â¢ Filing GST returns on-line (67% at least good, 54% high) â¢ Filing FBT returns on-line (56% at least good, 46% high). Unpaid tax collector role In the context of how Inland Revenue can best recognise businessesâ role as a tax collector of GST and PAYE on behalf of the Government, businesses rated a number of ideas using a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is not at all important to their relationship with Inland Revenue and 10 is extremely important. The following are considered to be of high importance: â¢ More tolerant treatment in terms of penalties and interest for those that have a good record (mean score of 9.1.) â¢ Inland Revenue answering their telephone calls more quickly (8.9) â¢ When calling Inland Revenue, the staff person giving their name and contact details so they can contact them again (8.4) FINAL QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH REPORT PAGE 7 colmar brunton â¢ Reply paid envelopes (8.0). A thank-you letter is considered to be of relatively low importance (mean score of 3.5). Call centres â¢ 28% of businesses are aware of the Call Centresâ full opening hours â¢ 40% of businesses choose the line depending on the tax revenue that their enquiry relates to. Information â¢ Two-thirds of businesses feel that the amount of information that Inland Revenue provides on businessesâ tax rights and responsibilities throughout the year is about right (66%); 19% feel it is too much and 10% feel it is not enough. â¢ Businesses hold most confidence in receiving correct and accurate information from their tax agent (mean score of 8.3 using a scale from 0 to 10 where 0 is not at all confident and 10 is extremely confident), followed by Inland Revenueâs booklets and newsletters (7.3) and written correspondence (7.6). Least confidence is held in Inland Revenueâs call centres (5.8). A similar pattern emerges in looking at tax agentsâ views. Processes dealing with not filing returns â¢ 56% of small employers that have periods with no employees find Inland Revenueâs processes in dealing with information about this as either very or quite adequate; 22% find the processes to be inadequate. Tax agent issues â¢ Tax agents identify a wide range of issues that they perceive to be a waste of their time and/or to contribute unnecessarily to their clientsâ fees. These issues tend to fall into three general categories: - Inland Revenue errors â most commonly incorrect statements of account and assessment (11%), transferring dollars into wrong period (6%), transferring money into wrong tax type (5%). - The complexity of Inland Revenue processes and requirements â most commonly FBT (8%) and the need to provide information in writing (3%). - The inadequacy of Inland Revenue processes â most commonly delays in follow-up correspondence (4%), and Inland Revenueâs phone system (2%). â¢ Most agents consider Inland Revenueâs processes for dealing with registering or deregistering agentsâ clients for particular types to be very adequate (22%) or quite adequate (62%); 13% feel that these processes are quite inadequate. â¢ A year-end summary of GST and PAYE returns and payment data submitted by an agentâs client holds great appeal; using a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is a very bad idea and 10 is an excellent idea, 72% of agents rate this idea as at least an eight. FINAL QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH REPORT PAGE 8 colmar brunton Conclusions and recommendations This section provides colmar bruntonâs research conclusions and recommendations. These have been formulated by drawing together key learnings from both the qualitative and quantitative research phases. A range of initiatives are needed to reduce compliance costs The nature and impact of tax-related compliance costs clearly vary considerably within the small business community. Whilst one or two issues (i.e. provisional tax payments not being aligned with cash flow and the time spent filling in large numbers of Inland Revenue forms) appear to be more widely experienced than others, no strong pattern of prioritisation emerges. Perhaps partly in line with this, no single proposed initiative attracts universal appeal. These findings reinforce Inland Revenueâs expectation, at the outset of this programme of change, that a range of initiatives will be required. And, indeed, a number of the initiatives tested in this research hold strong appeal with notable proportions of the small business community, suggesting that progression and further developmental work is certainly warranted. The initiatives that hold significant potential for reducing the tax-related compliance costs of the small business community are outlined below. Single payment date Of all the concepts tested, the proposition of a single payment date to cover all tax revenues received the most widespread vote of approval. We recommend, however, that this initiative only be implemented if it is feasible for the due date to be made the last day in the month. The research indicates that asking GST registrants to file GST by the 20 th of the month will cause considerable concern. Voluntary provisional tax payments This suggestion also has the potential to reduce compliance costs for new businesses. Both businesses and tax agents strongly support this concept. However, a discount of at least 10% appears to be required for many to take up the option. Inland Revenue calculating FBT Around half of large employers find the concept of providing Inland Revenue with information on a quarterly basis, to enable Inland Revenue to calculate the FBT, appealing. Like the other initiatives tested in this research, however, not all employers favour this concept. It therefore needs to be optional. It should also be noted that employers in this research gave their approval in conceptual terms only. Taxpayers in this research, and other research projects we have conducted for Inland Revenue, call for simplicity. The implications of this are not limited to ensuring that the existing employer schedule does not become excessively complex. By simplicity, taxpayers also talk about the need for information to be targeted and tailored to their needs. So, for example, it may well be that employers that do not offer fringe benefits to their staff, or wish to take up the proposed initiative, would prefer not to be faced with an employer schedule that allows for this additional information to be incorporated. Due to these types FINAL QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH REPORT PAGE 9 colmar brunton of issues, we recommend that the processes involved in effectively implementing this concept be tested at a practical level. Finally in regard to this concept, this research indicates that to overcome businessesâ distrust in Inland Revenueâs ability to provide accurate information, any FBT invoice will need to be accompanied by a statement that clearly shows how the FBT has been calculated. Tying provisional tax to GST There is considerable potential for this option to reduce the compliance costs of businesses that struggle with cyclical cash flows. At a conceptual level, this initiative holds much appeal. This initiative is the most complex initiative tested as part of this research project and as such some participants found the concept quite difficult to grasp. Whether businesses elect this option will depend on: â¢ how it is implemented and communicated in practice (up-take will be hampered by overly complex processes and/or communications) â¢ the advice and recommendation of a businessâs tax agent (this appears in part to depend on whether the total provisional tax paid is guaranteed to be held to 105% of a clientâs Residual Income Tax). Agents appear to view this proposed initiative less favourably than businesses. One of their key reservations is whether turnover on its own sufficiently reflects profit (e.g. in a labour intensive business). This issue is also raised by businesses. On the other hand, however, both agents and businesses acknowledge the need for this initiative to avoid becoming overly complex. Given these issues, we suggest that this initiative needs further testing once it has been developed in more detail. The research findings point to this initiative being introduced on a two-monthly filing basis as best meeting small businessesâ needs. Frequency of filing Note, this research tested a number of different options for frequency of filing GST and provisional tax with mixed reaction. Whilst some businesses consider less frequent filing would reduce their compliance costs, other businesses believe this contravenes best practice principles (ie. doing it early, regularly and as the information comes to hand). Filing employer schedules every two months This proposition finds favour with around half of small employers. Some also feel that less frequent filing of PAYE contravenes best practice principles, but this tends to be less of an issue than it is for GST. E-enablement The research findings regarding e-enablement products strongly support Inland Revenueâs focus in this area. Businesses, even those not currently âelectronically literateâ, see this as the way of the future. And, more importantly, predicted levels of up-take of these products reinforce this. FINAL QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH REPORT PAGE 10 colmar brunton On-line account access holds particular appeal for both businesses and tax agents. Some businesses see this product as a solution to their frustrations with the perceived untimely and complex nature of the current statements. Whilst this research suggests that on-line account access should be a high priority, the current statements also need to be reviewed (as the on-line product does not appeal to all). This research shows that businesses currently sit along a continuum of stages in readiness to take up electronic products. A framework of these stages is illustrated below. The tasks that Inland Revenue need to undertake to shift businesses along the stages of behaviour change vary depending on what stage a business is currently at. F IGURE 2: STAGES OF BEHAVIOUR CHANGE Behavioural StageTask 1. Educate 6. Reward / Remind Pre-contemplation Businesses do not feel that transacting with IRD is currently appropriate or relevant for them Contemplation Businesses are actively thinking about transacting electronically and feel it could be appropriate for them Preparation Businesses are keen to transact electronically with IRD and need to put in place whatever is required to start Action Businesses have transacted electronically with IRD for the first time or first several times Maintenance Businesses are committed to transacting electronically with IRD 2. Increase the benefits 3. Decrease the costs 4. Increase influence of others 5. Improve self-efficacy A significant number of businesses appear to be in the Pre-contemplation stage; this is evident from the number of businesses that comment that they fail to see the relevance or benefit of the electronic products to their business. It will be important here for Inland Revenue to clearly communicate how electronic transactions will benefit the business. For those further along the continuum (i.e Contemplation), as well as communicating the benefits it will be important to overcome perceived costs/risks of the systems. In particular, this research indicates that businesses need reassurances about security of the systems and penalties (should the âsystemâ cause them to miss a deadline). Increasing the influence of others (tax agents are key here) and addressing self-efficacy issues are especially important for those in the Preparation stage. This research has highlighted a strong desire for FINAL QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH REPORT PAGE 11 colmar brunton an Inland Revenue staff person to visit the business to show them how to set up the systems and use the products. Expand the Advisory Service Expansion of Inland Revenueâs Advisory Service would fulfil two needs: â¢ More follow-up visits for new businesses. Many new businesses feel that one visit is insufficient. For some of these businesses, follow-up visits would ideally occur a few months after the initial visit as they have had a chance to put in practice initial advice and processes. â¢ Educating businesses on new initiatives and products. There may be a need to up-skill Advisory service staff to be able to effectively assist businesses with new initiatives such as e-enablement products. Recognise their role as unpaid tax collectors This research has highlighted a number of ways in which Inland Revenue can improve their relationship with the small business community and better recognise their role as unpaid tax collectors. Of top priority, in the eyes of taxpayers, is more tolerant treatment in terms of penalties and interest. (The qualitative research details the specific principles that businesses feel should underpin the penalties and interest system). Many of the issues and ideas raised in this research have significant policy and service implications. Other ideas, such as prepaid envelopes, may not involve big changes to the tax system, but are gestures of goodwill that have the potential to make a positive impact on small businessesâ perceptions of Inland Revenue including the value that they perceive the Department places on the small business community. Appreciate small businessesâ varying needs This research has highlighted a number of key challenges for Inland Revenue in implementing a programme of change. Indeed, we believe the following issues are critical to the success of the programme. Small businesses desire flexibility A strong theme in this research is the desire for Inland Revenue to be flexible. âFlexibility...you canât have strict down the line rules because there is always something that fits outside of them and there is always a situation that occurs in businesses that throws all the good plans out the window.â (Small business) Flexibility is also about recognising that small businesses are not all alike. They differ not only in terms of the physical and financial characteristics of their business, but also in terms of the approaches they take to their bookwork and their levels of confidence, knowledge and anxiety. This has a number of implications. First and foremost, small businesses (and tax agents) call for new initiatives to be optional. Providing options is not just about acknowledging that new initiatives may not meet the business needs of some businesses. It also recognises that some businesses are strongly resistant to change because the current system is familiar and they are fearful of any change. (The types of support that these businesses require in taking on new initiatives are different to those required by businesses that are keen to embrace change; this is addressed later in this section). FINAL QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH REPORT PAGE 12 colmar brunton Herein lies a dilemma. Whilst businesses demand options, there is a real danger of overwhelming businesses with âyet more optionsâ. This could lead to businesses feeling like the âloadâ is heavier than it was before the changes (this is a fear of the Reassurance Seekers and the Reluctant Acceptors). Inland Revenue will need to consider these opposing tensions carefully for each proposed initiative. Different needs require different types of support Further, for any initiatives to be implemented successfully, Inland Revenue must deliver different types and levels of support to cater for different needs. Small businesses vary in the level of anxiety they experience in dealing with tax and Inland Revenue and the extent to which they feel their relationship with Inland Revenue is an equal one versus Inland Revenue being in control. This is also closely linked to the extent to which businesses embrace or resist change. Four different sets of small business needs are illustrated in the following diagram. F IGURE 3: SMALL BUSINESS NEEDS Letâs take the Reassurance Seeker as an example. These businesses lack knowledge and confidence in dealing with tax. Hence, they tend to be quite dependent on their tax agent. Although resistant to change, because they fear not being able to cope, the Reassurance Seeker can see potential benefits to their business in a number of the proposed initiatives. However, to cope with taking up these initiatives they will need to be walked through the change process step by step. Their driving need is to feel supported and reassured in the process of change. One of the best ways that this can be achieved is via a face-to-face visit from an Inland Revenue person. In this way, Inland Revenue can build the Reassurance Seekerâs confidence and show that the Department is willing to listen. FINAL QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH REPORT PAGE 13 colmar brunton Tax agents Tax agents clearly play a critical role in small businesses meeting their tax obligations. Some groups of businesses (e.g. the Reluctant Acceptors) are more dependent on their agent than other groups. Nevertheless, this research indicates that tax agents will significantly influence the decisions of small businesses in taking up the initiatives that Inland Revenue proceed with. This has a number of implications: â¢ The predicted levels of uptake among businesses outlined in this report are likely to be over- estimates given that agents generally show less enthusiasm for the initiatives than the business community. â¢ Consultation and communications with tax agents will be critical for the effective execution of the initiatives. One element of this would appear to be about finding ways of working with agents so that the agentsâ advisory role is not devalued in any way. There is the potential for some agents to feel protective of their âterritoryâ with Inland Revenue implementing this programme of change. On a final note, this research also points to areas where Inland Revenue can improve their relations with tax agents. These tend to relate to process issues (and are outlined in detail in this report and the qualitative research report). Based on the research findings, we also recommend that Inland Revenue provide a year-end summary of client transactions for agents. FINAL QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH REPORT PAGE 14 colmar brunton Background and Objectives Inland Revenue, in partnership with Treasury, has embarked on a major exploration into ways of reducing the compliance costs of small businesses. This exploration is at the request of the Minister of Revenue and is in line with Inland Revenueâs Statement of Intent; in particular that Inland Revenueâs desired future involve taxpayers meeting their obligations of their own accord â and Inland Revenue making this easy. From previous research, Inland Revenue has identified the following areas where compliance cost reductions could be made for small businesses: 1. The time involved in completing the sheer volume of returns and payments that businesses must send to Inland Revenue each year (steady state activity) 2. The âone-offâ processes and services that Inland Revenue provides when business start or stop ongoing operations (exceptions to steady state) 3. Concern that the penalties and interest regime donât have regard to businessesâ (generally good) compliance history, or acknowledge their âunpaid tax collectorâ role 4. Prompt access to knowledgeable Inland Revenue inquiry services staff 5. Greater ability to transact tax business electronically 6. The costs incurred in acquiring accounting services for year-end Income Tax return filing. These costs are primarily incurred for the precise profit determination required by tax law, but this level of accuracy is often superfluous to small business information needs. It is envisaged that a comprehensive approach and mix of interventions will be required including improvements to administrative processes and greater use of electronic technology, as well as legislative changes. Inland Revenue are undertaking a consultation process with the business community to seek their input. Primary research with businesses and tax agents is one component of this consultation process. Inland Revenue have commissioned colmar brunton to undertake two primary research phases: qualitative and quantitative research with both small businesses and tax agents. The broad objectives of both phases of the research are to: 1. understand and prioritise common tax-related compliance cost issues, as perceived by small business operators 2. identify and discuss possible solutions to those small business tax-related compliance cost problems 3. understand compliance cost problems specific to those business operators who have recently ended or set up a new operation or entity 4. identify barriers to the implementation of new electronic solutions to be offered by Inland Revenue, and how these might be overcome 5. determine probable take up rates of any solutions that Inland Revenue is able to offer to reduce compliance costs. This report presents the findings of the quantitative research phase. Findings from the qualitative research phase are presented in a separate report. FINAL QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH REPORT PAGE 15 colmar brunton Research Methodology Telephone surveys of 1611 small businesses and 400 tax agents were conducted between 25 November and 13 December 2002. All interviews were conducted using CATI (Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing). Due to the number of information areas to be covered with businesses, two versions of the questionnaire were used for the business survey. A core set of questions (considered to be of higher priority) was included in both questionnaire versions. The business survey was piloted with 15 businesses to test for respondent understanding of the questions. The tax agent questionnaire was pre-tested qualitatively in six in-depth face-to-face qualitative interviews. Contact lists were provided by Inland Revenue for both the business and tax agent surveys. Inland Revenue used specific criteria in drawing the sample for this research to reflect those businesses that are of particular interest to Inland Revenue in undertaking this programme of research and consultation. Hence, the business survey is representative of these groups of businesses rather than of all businesses. The criteria used in selecting businesses for participation in this research is detailed in the table below along with the number of interviews achieved. Quotas were set to ensure sufficient numbers of interviews were achieved in each group to enable robust sub-group analysis. Sample Size Maximum margin of error Large employer (Filed both EMS and quarterly FBT return for month of June 2002/balances were non-zero) 301 +/- 5.6% Small employer (Filed EMS and have less than 10 employees for month of June 2002, and not active for FBT) 318 +/- 5.5% Individual (Self-employed and have a provisional tax liability on their 2001 return with RIT of more than $2,500) 279 +/- 5.9% Company (Filed GST return for the March 2002 period and have a provisional tax liability on their 2001 return with RIT of more than $2,500) 280 +/- 5.9% Partnership (GST turnover of between $100,000 and $1.2 million per annum/No provisional tax liability) 275 +/- 5.9% Trust (Filed GST return for the March 2002 period and have a provisional tax liability on their 2001 return with RIT of more than $2,500) 158 +/- 7.8% Total businesses 1,611 +/- 2.4% Total tax agents 400 +/- 4.9% Total number of interviews 2,011 n/a Note: all businesses with an annual GST turnover of more that $1.2 million per annum were excluded. Questions that were included in only one version of the business questionnaire carry a higher margin of error. FINAL QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH REPORT PAGE 16 colmar brunton The average interview lengths for the surveys were: â¢ 13 minutes for one version of the business survey â¢ 15 minutes for the other version of the business survey â¢ 18 minutes for the tax agent survey. The response rates to the surveys were: â¢ 39% for businesses â¢ 40% for tax agents. A more detailed breakdown of the call data is appended.

### Easier tax for small businesses - research results

Paying provisional tax and GST together, and basing provisional tax on GST turnover, is attractive to many small businesses according to market research released today by Associate Revenue Minister David Cunliffe.

"The research represents the most extensive consultation the government has undertaken on tax compliance costs facing small and medium-sized businesses," Mr Cunliffe said.

"Small businesses say paying provisional tax three times a year does not necessarily match their cash flow. For this reason, many of those surveyed saw advantages in paying provisional tax and GST together, and basing provisional tax on a percentage of GST sales."

"Businesses and tax agents also showed strong support for the idea of new small businesses paying provisional tax in their first year of business, rather than paying tax on first-year income afterwards."

"These are some of the findings we have used to develop proposals in a discussion document aimed at making tax easier for small businesses, to be released next week."

"Recent legislative changes have dealt with other findings - such as the reported need for a more flexible system that takes account of taxpayers' changing circumstances and good compliance history, and for less severe penalties and interest."

"Likewise, improvements in Inland Revenue's call centres over the last two years and increased on-line tax services go a long way towards addressing the problem of businesses having difficulty getting information or help," Mr Cunliffe said.

The quantitative research undertaken late last year by Colmar Brunton surveyed 1611 small businesses and 400 tax agents, for which maximum margins of error were +/-2.4 per cent and +/-4.9 per cent respectively.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Tax change to encourage talent to NZ

Foreigners and returning New Zealanders who have been away at least ten years may be given a tax holiday on their overseas income in a measure to assist businesses to attract talented people to work in New Zealand.

The provision would apply only to people who came here to work as employees and only to income earned offshore. Income earned in New Zealand would still be subject to tax.

Revenue Minister Michael Cullen signalled the move today in an address to the Institute of Chartered Accountants National Tax Conference, saying details would be announced within the next few weeks with the release of a discussion document on reducing the tax barriers to international recruitment.

"I tested the proposal with members of the Institute's London branch on my recent overseas trip and got a very warm reception," he said.

The proposal expands upon an idea in the Tax Review 2001. The Review recommended exempting for seven years the overseas income of foreign nationals who become residents in New Zealand for tax purposes.

The government has yet to make a decision on how long the exemption should apply for but is considering expanding it to include expatriate New Zealanders returning to take up jobs here.

"It can be difficult for New Zealand to compete on wages with much larger economies to attract the highly skilled to work here. And to the extent that New Zealand businesses have to pay higher salaries to compensate for the New Zealand tax liability of an individual's offshore investment, the business rather than the individual will be the ultimate beneficiary of the change."

Other measures canvassed in the speech to reduce the obstacles to international investment included whether the profits from the sale of certain shares should be exempted from New Zealand tax when the investors were exempt from tax in their own jurisdiction.

Dr Cullen said this should assist the flow of venture capital to New Zealand by removing a disincentive for investors who were tax exempt in their own country but became subject to our tax when they sold their New Zealand shares.

"The government is also considering recommendations from the private sector liaison group on research and development to change the depreciation rules to deal with "black hole" R&D expenditure.

"I hope to include in the next taxation bill a provision that will make the cost of failed patent applications and failed resource management consent applications immediately deductible."

Dr Cullen said that after much thought and consultation, the government had decided not to proceed with the Tax Review's recommendation of a discounted tax rate for new foreign direct investment.

"Introducing a tax differential on FDI subject to the date of the investment would not be sustainable because it would be too difficult to police the boundaries and the costs of implementation would likely outweigh any benefits.

"But the government remains determined to increase the flow of FDI to New Zealand and will explore options to achieve this through the interdepartmental steering group on promoting New Zealand's international links and inter-connectedness.

"Given the high level of interest in this particular recommendation, I am making public the officials' report on which the government's decision is based," Dr Cullen said.

SPEECH NOTES

### Speech to the 2003 Tax Conference of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand

Thank you once again for the opportunity to speak to your annual conference.

As always, the government's tax policy work programme is very full in the year ahead. It deals with issues ranging from tax simplification, through to matters such as taxation of retirement savings, to the review of fringe benefit tax. One of the key features of New Zealand's tax policy-making process is that reforms are signalled in advance and are well known before they become law. This means that, unlike many of my predecessors as Revenue Minister, I do not generally have the opportunity to make surprise announcements about them. This I think is a good thing.

Another key feature of the process is that the priorities within the tax policy agenda should be and are heavily influenced by the wider economic context. As much as a tax system can be a thing of beauty in itself, it is there at the end of the day to gather revenue in the most effective way - to fund the wider government work programme - and to ensure the minimum of distortion to decisions regarding business, investment and employment.

The government has constructed a framework within which we can pursue higher sustainable growth through an emphasis on innovation. This growth and innovation framework has three core elements.

Firstly, we want to strengthen the foundations that are the necessary conditions for successful economic performance in an uncertain and ever-changing world. This means we need sound government finances, a competitive economy, a cohesive society, a healthy and skilled population, sound environmental management, a strong research base and a globally connected economy.

The second element of the framework is that we will build more effective innovation, through a mix of attracting and developing talent, creating new venture investment funds, making better linkages between tertiary institutions, industry and communities and by increasing global connectedness.

Finally, we are developing areas where our natural advantages and aptitudes give us scope to boost growth and innovation. These are biotechnology, information and communications technology and the creative industries. These sector level competencies have applications across a range of industries.  
My remarks today need to be considered in the context of these economic policy priorities.

I would like to concentrate on policy developments in relation to New Zealand's international tax rules, which will be very much in the spotlight over the next few weeks.

Much of the government's focus in the international tax area is on strengthening our global connectedness by reducing the extent to which tax is a barrier to New Zealand doing business with the rest of the world.

This may be a matter of strengthening the Closer Economic Relations agreement with Australia and working towards bilateral reforms; extending our network of double tax agreements with trading partners; making sure that our tax laws are in line with those of other countries; or removing obstacles to the inflow of capital into New Zealand, whether venture or human capital.

Legislation which is scheduled to be enacted before Christmas brings into effect New Zealand's part in a landmark agreement between Australia and New Zealand to remove a tax impediment to trans-Tasman investment. The problem is a long-standing one, often known as "triangular taxation", which can result in the double taxation of investments in companies that operate in both countries.

Successive New Zealand governments have attempted to resolve the problem, which, by its very nature, requires a bilateral solution. I am therefore very pleased that we have progressed to the point of legislating in both countries to remove an obstacle to doing business together. It is particularly fitting that it has happened in the year of the twentieth anniversary of our signing of the Closer Economic Agreement.

Peter Costello and I have agreed to meet annually, recognising the importance that issues within our respective portfolios have for both economies and for the trans-Tasman relationship. The main focus of the meetings is to encourage trans-Tasman business through the co-ordination of business, regulatory and tax law. Our second meeting in this series comes up in February. Although the agenda has not been set, we will doubtless be looking at a wide range of issues that affect both countries.

Double tax agreements have an important role to play in reducing the extent to which tax is an obstacle to cross-border trade and investment. We are making progress on several fronts.

Last month, in Dubai, I signed a double tax agreement with the United Arab Emirates, New Zealand's first with a Middle Eastern country. It will provide opportunities for investment into New Zealand by the United Arab Emirates, and vice versa, and covers the operation here of the Emirates Airlines. The agreement is expected to come into force once both countries have legislated for it.

The Russia-New Zealand double tax agreement came into effect on 4 July of this year, with the completion of domestic ratification procedures in Moscow. It has become our twenty-seventh double tax agreement.

A double tax agreement between South Africa and New Zealand is expected to come into force later this year once New Zealand has given effect to it by Order in Council.

The first steps in negotiating a double tax agreement with Chile have been completed, and the agreement is expected to be signed by both governments before the end of the year.

The Tax Review 2001 suggested that New Zealand should introduce a lower tax rate for foreign direct investment to encourage economic growth. Specifically, it recommended that the company rate be reduced from 33 per cent to 18 per cent, and that non-resident withholding tax on dividends be reduced from 15 per cent to 2 per cent. It favoured an approach whereby the reductions would apply only to new foreign direct investment, so as to reduce the fiscal costs of the proposal.

After much consideration and consultation, the government has decided not to implement that particular recommendation. Applying different tax rates to foreign direct investment that depend upon the date of the investment is not sustainable as a permanent feature of the tax system. Moreover, the costs of implementing such a measure, even on a temporary basis, are likely to outweigh the benefits - especially in view of the mobile nature of the investment that it would likely attract.

This decision should not be interpreted as a lack of government interest in encouraging foreign investment. That is certainly not the case. But before any further work can be done on the issue of tax incentives for foreign investment, we need to deal first with the fundamental question of whether it is necessary to subsidise that investment, either directly or through the tax system, as a means of increasing the flow of capital to New Zealand.

This is part of a much broader issue of economic development that will be examined by an interdepartmental steering group as part of a range of work to promote New Zealand's international links.

The Tax Review also recommended that individuals with no previous connection to New Zealand who become residents for tax purposes should be taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income for the first seven years - in other words, tax on their overseas income should be exempted for that period.

There is no doubt that New Zealand's tax system is more comprehensive than that of other countries in relation to offshore investment. In some ways, this fact reflects the efficient design of New Zealand's tax system. However, some people who come here to work may find themselves facing tax on offshore income that they might not have faced had they made a different choice of residence. These extra tax costs faced by highly skilled overseas recruits may in many instances already be passed on to New Zealand businesses in the form of higher remuneration.

The skills needed for a flourishing, knowledge-based economy are in demand throughout the world. The people who have these skills are increasingly mobile, and New Zealand businesses have to be able to compete with businesses in other countries to attract them to work here.

In recent months the government has been developing the idea of a temporary exemption from tax on overseas income for these people, with the focus on reducing costs for New Zealand businesses. We are also considering widening it to include returning New Zealanders who have been out of the country for at least ten years and are coming back to work here.

Details will be announced within the next few weeks, when we release a discussion document setting out proposals for reducing the tax barriers to international recruitment.

A similar problem exists in the area of international venture capital - overseas investment in small, unlisted companies in New Zealand. We want to facilitate the flow of venture capital into New Zealand, but tax can be a barrier. The problem is that investors who may be exempt from tax in their own jurisdictions may find themselves subject to New Zealand tax when they sell their shares. This may create a problem for them because they have no access to tax credits owing to their tax-exempt status in their country of residence.

Over the next few weeks, tax policy officials will be consulting with key players, including your Institute, on a broad proposal to exempt profits from sales of certain shares from New Zealand tax when the investor is exempt from tax in its own jurisdiction.

The government is also considering recommendations to make certain changes to the depreciation rules to address "black hole" research and development expenditure. These are recommendations of the private sector liaison group that was set up to help monitor the effectiveness of the new research and development tax rules and identify areas that can be improved. The particular "black hole" expenditure concerns expenditure on failed patent applications and r & d expenditure that is capitalised but is not depreciable because either the resultant asset is not depreciable or the project is abandoned.

The government will soon be releasing an issues paper that presents options to reform the taxation of New Zealanders' investments in offshore equity. One of these options will be a version of the risk-free return method suggested by the Tax Review in 2001.

As you will all be aware, the problems with this area of our tax law have been highlighted recently by the wide media coverage of the Australian unit trust issue. This issue, while important, is only one amongst a number of problems with the tax rules applying to portfolio investment in offshore equities. The options that will be presented in the issues paper are an attempt to address all the main problems identified in this complex area.

In relation to the Australian unit trust issue, in August I announced in a media statement that the government would move to prevent New Zealand investors using certain overseas funds to escape tax.

Another occasion on which I have announced that the tax law will change is in relation to the "masthead" issue - which apparently involved sale and leaseback transactions meant to allow tax deductions for what are effectively repayments of principal. No government could accept such a result, so I announced that we would change the law so that this could not happen. Consultation on this change will also take place shortly.

I mention these examples because they appear to have raised some concerns about the government's commitment to the generic tax policy process - that we were moving towards legislating by means of press statement. I can understand the reasons for the concern. But both announcements involved revenue protection measures requiring a rapid response. Faced with revenue risks from widely publicised transactions that were clearly contrary to policy intent, the government chose to announce the law changes, and then to proceed to consultation before introducing legislation. In the circumstances, would the critics have preferred early legislation with no consultation? I think our approach in these two instances serves to protect the policy making process, rather than undermine it.

You can rest assured that the government remains committed to the generic tax policy process. And, as is normal under the process, the forthcoming issues papers and consultative documents will ask for submissions on the options presented. I would urge all those with an interest in these areas to consider the options and give us your views.

I would like to turn briefly to the Lawyers and Conveyancers Bill, aspects of which have been of concern to your Institute. The government's intention, when introducing the bill, was to clarify current law and open up conveyancing to more competition - it was not intended to shut accountants out of the legal services market. My colleague the Minister of Justice has recently written to you to confirm that the bill is not intended to deny accountants the opportunity to undertake - for example - tax work, and changes to reflect this intention are expected to made by the select committee following consideration of submissions on this issue.

As I said at the outset, the tax policy work I have described today is not being done in isolation, but as part of the government's wider economic framework.

I might also add that I think all of us could do a better job of selling the advantages of our tax system overseas. It is stable and robust. It is also open, honest, transparent and not anywhere near as complex as tax systems in many other countries. We do not have high compliance costs compared with those of other developed countries. Our business taxation rates compare well with those of other countries, in light of the fact that we do not have a separate payroll tax, as some other countries have. Nor do we have a general capital gains tax, death duties or stamp duty. And our generic tax policy process, in the words of the Tax Review, "has allowed tax policy in New Zealand to develop more rationally and smoothly than in many other countries."

So perhaps next time you find yourself "selling" New Zealand to international colleagues or clients, you may want to mention some of the advantages of our tax system, which can so easily be taken for granted.

The government's goal - which I am sure that the Institute of Chartered Accountants wholeheartedly supports - is to ensure that New Zealand offers sound and attractive investment opportunities for international investors. Consultation with tax practitioners and the free and frank exchange of ideas has played an important role in the progress we have made to date, and I am sure that the tax policy issues I have outlined today will be advanced in that same spirit.

Thank you.
In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 1 10 September 2003 Minister of Finance and Revenue cc: Associate Minister of Finance (Hon Trevor Mallard) Associate Minister of Finance and Revenue (Hon David Cunliffe) Taxing inbound investment Executive summary The Tax Review recommended that the Government dramatically reduce headline tax rates on foreign direct investment (FDI) as a means of stimulating economic growth. The Review favoured an approach (Policy Option 2) whereby the rate reduction would apply only to new FDI so as to reduce the fiscal cost of the proposal. Officials did not support the McLeod proposal, concluding that targeting new FDI was unworkable except as a transitional measure and that there was insufficient evidence to suggest that a rate reduction for all FDI would produce the magnitude of spill-over benefits required to offset the fiscal cost of the proposal. You released that report for further consultation. We received a range of submissions â mostly in support of introducing Policy Option 2, either as a permanent solution or on a trial basis. Submitters believe that Policy Option 2 is âworth a puntâ even if only for a limited period. They think that, at best, it could net New Zealand considerable benefits. At worst, the initiative would be a low cost experiment. Officialsâ analysis of the points raised in submissions are contained in Annex 1 of this report. A description of each of the submissions is contained in Annex 2. Notwithstanding these submissions, we confirm our view that Policy Option 2 is not a workable solution and recommend that it not be implemented. This is because applying different tax rates to FDI depending on the date of the investment is not sustainable as a permanent feature of the tax system. We do accept that it is theoretically possible to introduce a temporary tax concession for new FDI. However, the Government would need to be committed to removing the concession after a fixed period of time, say, seven to ten years. The main danger with this approach is that lobbying to extend or broaden the concession beyond that period would undoubtedly be intense. Firms that are attracted to this type of concession are usually able to move their business to another jurisdiction with ease and so can lobby effectively for an extension of the concession. We are sceptical about whether the Government would be able to terminate the In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 2 tax concession in practice. Also, we believe the costs of such a measure would outweigh the benefits â especially in view of the inherently mobile nature of the investment that it would likely attract. Accordingly, we do not recommend that Policy Option 2 be adopted as a temporary measure. Over the past few months we have compared the McLeod proposal with other options for reducing tax on FDI, either in relation to headline rates or effective tax rates. These options would attempt to target tax-sensitive FDI. They would also all involve fiscal economic costs. Before any further work can be done on the issue of tax incentives, however, the Government needs to address the primary issue of whether it actually wants to subsidise FDI (either directly or through the tax system) as a means of increasing the flow of FDI to New Zealand. A key related issue is whether the Government wants to target particular forms of FDI (for example, attempt to aim at those that deliver the most spill-over benefits) or particular sectors, because targeting might be better achieved through grants rather than tax incentives. These are fundamentally economic development issues rather than tax policy issues. Both the Treasury and the Ministry of Economic Development are working on FDI and are currently collaborating with each other, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and others as part of a range of work to promote New Zealand's global connectedness. An interdepartmental Steering Group on Global Connectedness (whose role is to coordinate work leading up to the GIF component of the 2004 budget) is setting up several working groups including one on FDI. We recommend that FDI as an economic development issue be considered within this working group and within the context of the Governmentâs broader âGlobal Connectednessâ initiative. However, responsibility for any advice on decisions that have tax policy implications should remain with Inland Revenue and Treasury. We have consulted with the Ministry of Economic Development on this report. Recommended action It is recommended that you: (a) Agree that the Government should not implement Policy Option 2, recommended by the McLeod Committee. Agreed/Not Agreed (b) Agree that Treasury and the Ministry of Economic Development continue to explore the importance of FDI to the economy and ways to reduce barriers to investment in New Zealand, within the context of the Governmentâs broader âGlobal Connectednessâ initiative. Agreed/Not Agreed In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 3 (c) Refer this report to the Minister of Economic Development. Referred Richard Lynch Carmel Peters for Secretary to the Treasury Portfolio Manager, Policy Inland Revenue Department Hon Dr Michael Cullen Minister of Finance and Revenue In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 4 Background 1. The Tax Review recommended that the Government consider reducing the tax burden on FDI as a means of attracting more FDI. It recommended doing so in a way that dramatically reduced headline rates as follows: â¢ reduce the company rates for non-residents from 33% to 18%; and â¢ reduce the non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rate on dividends from 15% to 2%. 2. Two options were advanced as a way forward. Policy Option One was to apply the lower rate to all FDI. Policy Option 2 (the Tax Reviewâs preferred option) was to apply the lower rate only to new FDI. 3. Officials reported to the Government on the Tax Reviewâs recommendations in a report dated 3 May 2002 (T2002/610; PAD2002/93 (the May report)). The report was released at the ICANZ conference in October 2002 so that further consultation with the private sector could be undertaken. Seven submissions were received in total, being from David Patterson, Rob McLeod, and John Shewan (the practitionersâ submission), KPMG, ICANZ, the Corporate Taxpayer Group, Vodafone, Fonterra, and Business New Zealand. Review of submissions 4. The May report considered the extent to which New Zealand would gain from implementing the Tax Reviewâs recommended changes to the current tax treatment of FDI. It focused on the links with the Governmentâs strategy for building an economy capable of sustaining higher growth rates. It discussed the costs and benefits of FDI to New Zealand. The report described the economic framework for deciding how a small, open economy should tax inbound investment in general and described how FDI and other inbound investment is taxed. 5. The report then analysed the Tax Reviewâs recommendations to reduce FDI in light of the underlying economic framework. Officials concluded that targeting a low rate at new FDI would be unworkable, except as a transitional measure. Therefore the rate reduction had to be evaluated on the assumption that it would apply to all FDI. Officials then argued that an across-the-board reduction in tax was unlikely to produce sufficient benefits to New Zealand to offset the welfare costs of raising the revenue on other productive activity in New Zealand. 6. A range of submissions were received in response to the May report. By and large, submissions did not dispute the underlying economic framework upon which the current taxation of inbound investment (including FDI) is based. (Accordingly, we do not revisit the question of whether New Zealand applies the correct economic analysis to the taxation of FDI. Nor do we restate those principles. Rather we take as a given that the principles described in the May report that underpin New Zealandâs international tax regime as it applies to inbound investment are broadly correct.) In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 5 7. Submissions did, however, challenge officialsâ assessment of whether the Reviewâs proposed changes to the current tax treatment of FDI should be adopted as a way of attracting more FDI (or a particular amount of FDI). Broadly, the submissions traversed the following matters: â¢ the relative importance of attracting more FDI to New Zealand; â¢ whether headline rates should be changed to attract more FDI; â¢ whether the new/old distinction inherent in Policy Option 2 is workable; and â¢ whether Policy Option 2 would disadvantage domestic industry. 8. Annex 1 contains a summary of submissions. Annex 2 analyses the submissions on each of the above points. We also analyse key aspects of those submissions in the body of this report. 9. In our view, submitters did not substantially challenge the conclusion reached by officials in the May report that the costs of lowering the tax rate on all FDI would exceed the benefits that would likely be generated by such an approach. As discussed below, however, there was a general concern amongst submitters that officials had overstated the cost and understated the benefits associated with lowering tax rates. 10. The key point of difference that emerges between the conclusions in the May report and submissions is around the question of whether the Government should proceed with Policy Option 2. Submitters were not unanimous on this point. Business New Zealand and Fonterra did not support the 18% rate for new FDI. KPMG and Business New Zealand both favoured lowering the corporate rates generally â although KPMG supported Policy Option 2 in the absence of lowering the corporate rate. 11. By contrast, the practitionersâ submission, ICANZ, Corporate Taxpayer Group and Vodafone New Zealand gave broad support to the adoption of Policy Option 2 in one form or another. These submissions disagreed with officialsâ views that a ânew/old distinctionâ could not be implemented on a permanent basis. Notwithstanding these submissions, we still hold to the view that it is not viable for the Government to offer a low rate limited to new FDI, as a permanent feature of the tax system. Tax rates are a fundamental feature of our income tax system. Levying different rates of tax purely on the basis of whether the investment was made before or after a specific date is inherently arbitrary and therefore unsustainable. Although some submitters argue that businesses would tolerate this level of arbitrariness in exchange for the perceived overall benefits of lower rates, we do not believe that businesses would find a dual rate acceptable in the long run. 12. Submitters also said that if the Government was not prepared to lower the tax rate for new FDI on a permanent basis it should move to consider whether a ânew/oldâ distinction should be made as a temporary incentive to attract new FDI. Consequently, the process of consultation has, in our view, narrowed the debate on the Tax Review proposal to the issue of whether Policy Option 2 is worth pursuing as a temporary measure. In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 6 Policy Option 2 as a temporary measure Could Policy Option 2 be implemented as a temporary measure? 13. Some submitters said that even if the new/old distinction is unsustainable in the long term that it should be introduced for a limited period of time, possibly as an initial step towards a more permanent low tax rate for all FDI. Others suggested that the lowering of the rate for FDI could be staggered to reduce the cost of such a move. 14. The practitionersâ submission advocated a âwait and seeâ approach. They envisaged three possible outcomes in the seven to ten-year period following the introduction of the 18% rate for new investment: â¢ continue with the regime if it works or; â¢ align rates as the general company tax rate trends down or if the number of businesses in the existing business category becomes very small; â¢ abandon it after ten years if it does not produce the anticipated benefits for New Zealand. 15. By contrast, ICANZ favoured Policy Option 2 being introduced for a finite period of time. ICANZ considers that this would allow its costs and benefits to be evaluated and allow the drafting of robust criteria and anti-avoidance legislation to minimise the risk of exploitation. ICANZ notes, however, that several issues that would need to be explored to determine the feasibility of such a scheme including the transportability of FDI at the expiry of the finite period and the impact this would have on the New Zealand economy. 16. The Government could proceed with this initiative by being clear at the outset that the measure was temporary and would be removed after a fixed period. (In order to be transparent about this a sunset clause would need to be inserted into the legislation.) 17. This raises the question of whether, in order to proceed with Policy Option 2 as a temporary measure, the Government needs to determine, at the outset, whether the rate would increase to the corporate rate or be aligned at some new lower rate for FDI. Our view is that the Government could adopt the position that it is guaranteeing a low rate for new FDI for a fixed period. At the end of the fixed period the rate would move back to the normal corporate rate unless the Government decided otherwise, based on an objective evaluation of the net benefits of the lower rate. Should Policy Option 2 be implemented as a temporary measure? 18. While implementing Policy Option 2 is technically feasible, we do not recommend such an approach. There is a risk that, as a practical matter, it will be extremely difficult for the Government to terminate the concession â even if it has produced little in the way of spill- over benefits. We would expect lobbying to extend the concession and possibly broaden the ambit of the concession to intensify closer to the date the concession is due to expire. Businesses that are attracted to a jurisdiction offering a temporary, concessionary tax rate are In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 7 usually able to demonstrate that they will relocate out of the jurisdiction if the concession is not extended. This gives rise to a serious risk that a low tax rate for FDI will continue to exist, or even be extended, when it is undesirable for it to do so. 19. The May report focused primarily on the costs and benefits of lowering the tax rate on all FDI. The same principles apply in considering whether to lower the tax rate for new FDI on a temporary basis. In other words, the Government should pursue Policy Option 2 on a temporary basis only if it believes that the reduction in tax on new FDI will produce sufficient benefits to New Zealand to offset the welfare costs of raising revenue on other productive activity in New Zealand over that period. 20. The Tax Review and the May Report estimated that the static revenue cost of lowering tax rates on new FDI was a maximum of $50 million per annum. This calculation assumes no growth in FDI and treats all flows of FDI as ânewâ investment. This cost would compound each year and would need to be collected elsewhere in the economy. 21. Submitters had a general concern that officials had overstated the fiscal and economic costs of the Tax Review proposals whilst down-playing the expected benefits of the rate reduction. Concerns were also raised in relation to the consistency of the assumptions underlying the numerical illustration in Table 3, which demonstrates the potential effects of the proposed reform. This issue is discussed further in Annex 1. 22. In terms of the costings, submitters were critical of the fact that the costings were static and did not take account of second round effects. The difficulty is that second round effects are usually linked to behavioural responses, which cannot be predicted with any certainty. Consequently, the revenue effects are simply too speculative to quantify. Accordingly, we prefer to rely on static costings whilst recognising their limitations. In any event, the economic costs of imposing a higher tax on other productive activity to make up the revenue shortfall are likely to be more significant than the fiscal costs, although more difficult to estimate and identify. 23. On the positive side of the ledger, submitters were convinced that attracting more FDI would produce substantial fiscal and economic benefits. They said fiscal benefits would include income tax on FDI that would otherwise not have come to New Zealand and an increase in the PAYE and GST take associated with the new FDI. More importantly, they envisage that the economic benefits associated with an increase in FDI (spill-over benefits) would more than offset the fiscal and economic cost associated with the rate reduction. 24. We agree with submitters that the benefits associated with new FDI come in the form of higher incomes for New Zealanders, tax on those incomes, and tax on the returns to foreign investors. The difference in views between officials and submitters is with regard to the extent of the benefits that would be generated by Policy Option 2. This, in turn, stems from the different judgments made by submitters and officials as to how much new FDI would come to New Zealand as a result of a major decrease in tax rates. 25. As we explained in our May report, the level of sensitivity depends on the investorâs circumstances. If a reduction in New Zealand tax does not result in an increase in the In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 8 investorâs after-all-taxes profit because it reduces the availability of a usable tax credit to the investor, that investor will not be encouraged by the rate reduction. On the other hand, if the investorâs after-all-taxes profit is increased because the investor is resident in a country that exempts incoming dividends or is unable to use, or fully use, the tax credit, the taxpayer will be encouraged to invest in New Zealand. The extent to which that encouragement translates to an investor choosing New Zealand as an investment destination will depend on how much tax rates matter to that investor relative to other non-tax factors, including infrastructure, political stability, and location advantages. Overseas evidence on the sensitivity of FDI to tax incentives is inconclusive. However, recent studies suggest that the level of sensitivity of FDI is only moderate but increasing. 1 26. Furthermore, the necessarily temporary nature of the proposal means only mobile FDI is likely to be attracted to New Zealand as a result of this initiative. This has adverse implications in terms of spill-over benefits. Mobile FDI is unlikely to result in the establishment of long term sustainable businesses in New Zealand that produce higher value- added products and/or establish linkages between New Zealand businesses and overseas markets. Our judgment is that the costs, when both economic and fiscal costs are taken into account, would outweigh the benefits. Accordingly, we are unable to recommend adoption of Policy Option 2 as a temporary measure. 27. If the Government is interested in investigating Policy Option 2 further, officials should report to the Government on key design issues including: (a) how the approval process would work; (b) the scope of the concession, in particular, whether the concession should be available to significant extensions of existing FDI or activities which are the same as activities currently carried on in New Zealand; (c) whether the incentive should be targeted at specific industries such as biotechnology and information and communication technology, which are the industries currently targeted by the Growth and Innovation Framework taskforces; (d) whether New Zealand investors should also be eligible for the same type of incentive; and (e) whether the concession should be gradually phased out. Future direction of FDI policy 28. There are other potential tax options, currently in use around the world, which could be used to try and attract FDI to New Zealand. These include tax incentives designed to lower the effective tax rate and tax holidays for FDI. 1 Rosanne Altshuter, Harry Grubert and T Scott Newton âHas U.S. Investment Abroad Become More Sensitive to Tax Rates?â NBER Working Paper No. W6383, January 1998. In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 9 29. Some countries provide tax incentives to lower the effective tax rate â for example, concessionary research and development rules, concessionary depreciation rules or loss carry-forward. We do not favour these approaches to attract FDI because they can distort investment decisions towards particular activities. Moreover, tax incentives designed to lower the effective tax rate do not address the Tax Reviewâs perception that the tax deterrent to FDI in New Zealand is high headline rates. 30. Another approach is a tax holiday. Tax holidays usually involve the provision of tax relief or a tax exemption for a limited period of time running from the commencement of the investment. Sometimes tax holidays are limited to green-fields investment. Other conditions can be imposed â for instance, requiring a minimum amount of expenditure. 31. Tax holidays have been criticised by fiscal experts, however 2 they give rise to the same type of problems as Policy Option 2 implemented as a temporary measure. That is, they tend to attract primarily short-term investments which can move quickly between jurisdictions, creating the danger that the firm will exit at the end of the holiday. Moreover, targeting of tax holidays raises definitional problems and targeting by sector raises additional problems of how to treat firms engaged in both qualifying and non-qualifying activities. 32. There are other options that could be pursued in the context of our own international tax regime, including: (a) targeting investors who cannot use foreign tax credits either because they are investing from a jurisdiction that exempts foreign dividends or because the entity itself cannot utilise the foreign tax credits, â for example, an Approved Issue Levy (AIL) type of approach could be used for equity; (b) modifying the foreign investor tax credit regime so that the credit is available prior to the repatriation of dividends; (c) reviewing the Foreign Investor Tax Credit rules to determine whether simplification and improvements could be made. 33. We have not considered any of these options in any detail. In addition, the Treasury is also concerned that portfolio equity is arguably âover taxedâ relative to FDI. 34. All the options would involve some (possibly substantial) fiscal cost and potentially some economic cost depending on the extent to which the Government wants to target certain activities or certain taxpayers. To some extent there is a trade-off between fiscal and economic costs. For instance, targeting the tax incentive to specific activities (say, the task force activities) might reduce fiscal costs but runs the risk of increasing economic costs by distorting investment decisions. 35. Before any further work can be done on the issue of tax incentives, however, the Government needs to address the primary issue of whether it actually wants to subsidise FDI (either directly or through the tax system) as a means of increasing the flow of FDI to New 2 For example: Jacques Morisset in âTax Incentives: Using Tax Incentives to Attract Foreign Direct Investmentâ View Point, World Bank, January 2003; and W. Stephen Clark âTax Incentives for Foreign Direct Investment: Empirical Evidence on Effects and Alternative Policy Optionsâ Canadian Tax Journal (2000) Vol . 48, No. 4. In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 10 Zealand. A key related issue is whether the Government wants to target particular forms of FDI (for example, attempt to aim at those that deliver the most spill-over benefits) or particular sectors, because targeting might be better achieved through grants rather than tax incentives. These are fundamentally economic development issues rather than tax policy issues. 36. Both the Treasury and the Ministry of Economic Development have a role in developing FDI policy and are currently collaborating with each other, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and others as part of a range of work to promote New Zealandâs global connectedness. An interdepartmental Steering Group on Global Connectedness (whose role is to coordinate work leading up to the GIF component of the 2004 budget) is setting up several working groups including one on FDI. We recommend that FDI as an economic development issue be considered within this working group and within the context of the Governmentâs broader âGlobal Connectednessâ initiative. However, responsibility for any advice on decisions that have tax policy implications should remain with Inland Revenue and Treasury. Moreover, if you wish to explore any of the options in outlined above in paragraphs 29 and 32 these should be directed to tax policy officials. 37. We have consulted with the Ministry of Economic Development on this report. In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 11 ANNEX 1 THE MAIN THEMES IN THE SUBMISSIONS THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF ATTRACTING MORE FDI TO NEW ZEALAND Submissions 1. Submissions were generally of the view that New Zealand needs more FDI. They emphasised the importance of increased levels of FDI in promoting economic growth. Submissions also focused on the advantages of FDI, such as spill-over effects in the form of increased expertise. Many felt that the officialsâ report did not place enough importance on these spill-over effects. Submissions also focused on the danger of doing nothing to attract new FDI or retain existing FDI. KPMG and the Corporate Taxpayer Group questioned the assumption that the corporate tax base and current levels of FDI would be retained in the absence of such initiatives as a lower tax rate for FDI. 2. The Tax Review 2001 believed that New Zealand needs more FDI, and this is also the operating assumption of the practitionersâ submission. Business New Zealand maintained that New Zealand has done poorly in recent years in growing business investment and attracting FDI. Vodafone New Zealand and KPMG emphasised the need for New Zealand to compete within multinational enterprises for regional company business. ICANZ submitted that encouragement of FDI is crucial to the growth of the New Zealand economy. Officialsâ comments 3. Officials agree that in most situations FDI is beneficial to New Zealand. New Zealand will continue to need and attract FDI. 4. FDI provides capital without having to rely on domestic savings. It can also provide spill-over benefits including technology transfers from foreign companies, offshore networks and human capital accumulation. Not all FDI generates positive spill-overs, and it is not possible ex ante to identify which FDI will generate these benefits. To be beneficial to New Zealandersâ increased FDI must produce benefits to New Zealanders over and above the return provided to the foreign investor. This is likely to be in the form of higher incomes for New Zealanders through more or better jobs than exist in the absence of FDI. 5. It is, however, very difficult to identify optimal levels of FDI for the New Zealand economy. Further, attracting FDI inevitably imposes costs on the New Zealand economy and cannot be viewed in isolation or as an end in itself. Therefore the question is not whether New Zealand needs more FDI but whether the benefits of attracting FDI above current levels will outweigh the costs and therefore result in a welfare gain for New Zealand. In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 12 SHOULD HEADLINE RATES BE CHANGED TO ATTRACT FDI? Are headline rates important? Submissions 6. Most submitters recommended a lower corporate tax rate to reduce the overall tax burden faced by business generally. They accepted, however, that this is not on the Governmentâs agenda. 7. Submitters also commented on the importance of low headline rates relative to low effective rates. They recognised that effective tax rates on foreign investment can currently be reduced (through various mechanisms) to well below the 33% headline rate. There is concern, however, that the current headline rates are discouraging foreign investors from considering New Zealand as an investment destination. The effective rate is considered not visible enough to potential investors. By aligning effective and headline rates more closely it is considered that New Zealand could âstand out from the crowdâ among competing capital importing nations. 8. The Corporate Taxpayer Group and the practitionersâ submission both contend that investment decisions are often based on headline rates. They stress the fact that headline rates have an impact on investorsâ attitudes, especially in relation to initial investment decisions, and that the 33% rate prevents New Zealand being considered any further. 9. The practitionersâ submission, along with Business New Zealand and KPMG, contend that New Zealandâs statutory corporate tax rate is now comparatively high, especially in the Asia/Pacific region, making New Zealand unattractive for investors at first glance and preventing further analysis of New Zealand as a destination for FDI. These submissions also point out that calculating the effective tax rate can be difficult especially for new investors and that schemes such as Foreign Investor Tax Credit (FITC), designed to reduce the tax on non-residents, are not well understood. This inability to access the effective rates increases the need for a reduction in headline rates. 10. KPMG and Business New Zealand refer to increasing international tax competition among countries in support of their submission that New Zealand needs to lower its headline rates to âstand out from the crowdâ in an increasingly competitive environment. Officialsâ comments 11. There are several points in submissions that need to be addressed. First, New Zealandâs corporate tax rate is within international norms â albeit at the higher end of international norms. 3 3 Other headline corporate rates are as follows: Australia 30%, Canada 23% (reducing to 21% by Jan 2004), Ireland 12.5%, Japan 30%, Singapore 22%, UK 30%, US 35%. These rates represent the main federal headline rates. In the case of Japan, Canada and the US, state and local taxes significantly increase the statutory tax rate. In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 13 12. Second, officials agree that headline rates have a role to play in investment decisions. Low headline rates are more accessible and provide a higher level of clarity for investors in determining their potential tax liability than do low effective rates. There is a range of effective rates because different investors will achieve different rates depending on their financial structure, their ability to debt fund their activities, and their appetite for tax planning. Consequently determining the effective rate involves a high level of complexity and will vary from taxpayer to taxpayer. 13. Of the total pool of investors who consider New Zealand as a potential destination for FDI, some investors will eliminate New Zealand as a candidate purely on the basis of headline rates. Others will undertake more research to determine the relevant effective rate. There is no reliable information on the proportion of those potential investors that reject New Zealand based on headline rates. 14. In 1999 the Treasury contracted KPMG to conduct a survey of businesses in Australia, the US and the UK, concerning the supply of foreign tax credits. It appeared that respondents had a good understanding of New Zealandâs FITC rule, although not all were using them effectively. Furthermore, those responding already held investments in New Zealand. Accordingly, the survey may not be a good indicator for potential investors who are yet to invest in New Zealand. 15. In any event, the conventional wisdom is that in most case it is the underlying economics of the investment that initially drives the investment, rather than tax. In those marginal situations where tax is the key issue some investors will make the effort to determine potential host country effective tax rates. In other cases decisions will be made on the basis of their headline rates. 16. Third, as mentioned above, the Tax Reviewâs proposal was predicated on the notion that the Government should pursue closer alignment of statutory and effective rates. However, the issue cannot be reduced solely to a debate about whether it is better to have a low statutory rate or a low effective rate, or whether the statutory rate should be aligned with the effective rate. This is because a lower statutory rate usually leads to an even lower effective tax rate. 17. Currently, the statutory corporate tax rate is 33%, with the effective tax rate on FDI ranging between 0% to 21.5% (assuming a certain level of debt funding). The Tax Review observed that a reduction in headline rates to 18% would lead to effective tax rates of between 0 and 14.5%. (These figures also assumed some tightening of the current treatment of debt.) As a result, lowering the headline rate results in a lower effective rate which, in turn, gives rise to fiscal costs. 18. The practitionersâ submission argues that low headline rates may not lead to a reduction in effective tax rates if multinationals respond by substituting debt with equity. This argument rests on the notion that multinationals have flexibility in the relative proportions of debt and equity allocated to the various jurisdictions in which investments are made. In this context, a multinational will âover allocateâ lowly taxed debt to high tax jurisdictions and âunder allocateâ highly taxed equity to low tax jurisdictions â thus achieving an optimal tax In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 14 rate for its global activities. It is thought that if New Zealand became a âlow taxâ jurisdiction, multinationals would respond by reducing their level of debt financing into New Zealand and increasing their level of equity. 19. Officials accept that some multinationals may restructure in response to a headline rate reduction, in such a way that their effective tax rate in New Zealand does not change significantly but their global rate of tax does. But this type of response will depend very much on the ability of multinationals to juggle their debt in this fashion and cannot be predicted with any certainty. It also depends on any particular multinationalâs desire to do so as in many cases their New Zealand investments may be small in proportion to their overall investments. Will a lower headline rate result in an increase in the rate of return for a foreign investor? Submissions 20. The practitionersâ submission and the Corporate Taxpayer Group indicated that in certain circumstances a reduction in New Zealand tax rates would increase the rate of return to the foreign investor. This includes where the home jurisdiction exempts dividends from FDI in New Zealand (such as Australia). It also includes the situation where the investorâs home country grants foreign tax credits and: â¢ the investor defers repatriation of income and retains the income within New Zealand at a lower rate of tax than in their home country; or â¢ the investor cannot fully utilise foreign tax credits because: â the foreign investor has excess foreign tax credits (either from pooling of foreign earnings or because the investorâs home jurisdiction has a lower tax rate than New Zealand) and therefore the reduction of New Zealand tax produces an absolute benefit for the investor; or â the investor has losses in their home jurisdiction. 21. Submitters concluded that in many instances a reduction in the New Zealand tax rate on FDI would produce an increase in the after-all taxes rate of return and not just provide a benefit to foreign treasuries. Officialsâ comment 22. Officials agree with the analysis above. There will, however, be situations where the reduction in New Zealand rates will merely reduce the underlying foreign tax credits available to the foreign investor from a jurisdiction that offers foreign tax credits, therefore it will have no impact on the after-all taxes return of the foreign investor. In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 15 23. One reason this whole issue is difficult to analyse is that we do not have good information about how effective our FITC rules are. We acknowledge that some investors may not be able to fully utilise any foreign income tax credits, but we do not know how widespread this problem is. If this is problematic, it should be addressed. Developing a better understanding of this issue is one possible direction of future work. 24. While not considering it a major threat, officials note that, in response to New Zealand lowering its rates on FDI, some countries may take unilateral action, the effect of which would be to increase the foreign tax on income from investment in New Zealand, thereby negating the beneficial effect of the rate reduction. Is FDI sensitive to a change in the after-all taxes rate of return? Submissions 25. Most submissions indicated that FDI was sensitive to a change in the after-all taxes rate of return and therefore sensitive to tax, although few submissions addressed this point in any detail. 26. Vodafone New Zealand considers that its own opportunities for new investment would be greatly improved if New Zealand had a more attractive tax regime. It considers that the current headline rates create a barrier to its competing for regional group company business. KPMG also addresses the issue of foreign-owned corporate taxpayers being unable to compete for business with other subsidiaries because of the high tax cost it faces in New Zealand, compared with branches in other parts of the world. 27. The ICANZ submission accepts the finding of officials that there is no reliable evidence on the marginal sensitivity of FDI, while noting that overseas studies indicate that FDI is becoming more sensitive to tax over time. 28. The practitionersâ submission is inclined to the view that there are good reasons to be conservative about assuming that all FDI is highly elastic. This is the reason the Tax Review focused the suggested concession only on new FDI. The submission considers that the key factors affecting the elasticity of FDI are the availability of substitutable investments, the transaction costs of switching from New Zealand and the availability of foreign tax credits for New Zealand tax paid. 29. The practitionersâ submission characterises new investment as marginal investment. In their view, with some limited exception, investment in new activities does not generally contain rents. Moreover any new investor into existing activities will not contain rents because the market will capitalise rents into the entry price of the investment. The practitionersâ submission did not consider that new FDI will be inelastic owing to high relocation costs or the availability of foreign tax credits. 30. While recognising that the elasticity or sensitivity of particular FDI cannot be known, the practitionersâ submission concludes that because new investment does not contain rents, new investment is tax sensitive. In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 16 Officialsâ comment 31. The extent to which FDI is sensitive to a change in the after-all taxes rate of return is difficult to determine and depends on a large number of factors. It is likely that FDI ranges from highly tax-sensitive to highly tax-insensitive. There is no reliable New Zealand evidence on the marginal sensitivity of FDI. International research suggests that the sensitivity elsewhere is moderate but growing over time. 32. Overseas studies indicate that tax is just one of many potential factors that affect the location and amount of FDI. A countryâs overall economic characteristics are more important for attracting FDI. The available evidence suggests that political, macroeconomic and social stability are critical factors, with quality of infrastructure, openness to trade, size of the domestic market and a transparent and administratively certain tax regime being more important than tax incentives. Thus, while tax is one factor affecting FDI that the government has influence over, it is not the most important factor. 33. One factor that does determine the sensitivity of FDI is the issue of economic rents or above normal rates of return. Research suggests that FDI is almost invariably associated with the earning of rents, of one of two types: â¢ firm-specific rents, where a company uses a particular factor, such as a patent or unique way of doing business to earn higher than normal rates of return; or â¢ country-specific rents, where a firm uses the location of investment to earn above normal returns. 34. In general, rent-earning capital is less sensitive to tax than investments earning normal rates of return. Of the two types of rents, location-specific rents are probably less sensitive to tax, since by definition the investment must be in the specific location to earn the rent, but both are likely to be somewhat tax insensitive. 35. Officials believe that some, if not a majority, of FDI in New Zealand is earning firm- specific rents and will therefore be relatively insensitive to tax. We hold this view, in part, because New Zealand has few location-specific advantages compared to other small, open economies like Singapore and Ireland. The Ministry of Economic Development has argued that spill-overs may be greater where FDI is used to exploit international markets. However, this may not be the same as tax sensitivity, as it is possible that this opportunity is based on, say, New Zealand biotechnology that is generating rents. Thus it is possible to have both rents and spill-overs. 36. New investment is at best likely to be only an imperfect proxy for tax sensitive investment. While lowering the tax impost on FDI is likely to increase the amount of FDI, and therefore it is tempting to argue that this "new investment" is tax sensitive, some of this investment would have entered New Zealand anyway. The real question is whether the benefits of obtaining this additional investment outweigh the economic and fiscal costs of tax forgone on new investment that would have come anyway. In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 17 37. While lowering the tax impost on FDI is likely to increase the amount of FDI, and therefore it is tempting to argue that this ânew investmentâ is tax sensitive, some of this investment would have entered New Zealand anyway, and it fails to address the question of whether the benefits of this new investment outweighs the costs of attracting this investment. Therefore new investment is at best likely to be only an imperfect proxy for tax-sensitive investment. 38. Given that foreign investors are continuously seeking new markets and developing new technologies and products, there are always likely to be rents available â albeit in some situations temporarily. In addition, depending on where in their life cycle existing firms are, some are likely to enter New Zealand at a future date, even though they may only earn a normal rate of return. Consistency of assumptions underlying the example in Table 3 Submission 39. The practitionersâ submission draws attention to an apparent contradiction in the data used to for the purposes of the illustration in Table 3 of the potential effects of the proposed reduction in tax rates on income from FDI: ... we understand that Officialsâ estimates at Table 3 of this paper contain an inherent contradiction in that the model used to calculate the benefits of the reform has assumed that the 18% tax rate results in a tax reduction of only $250 million and thus necessarily underestimates the benefits if the tax reduction is in fact $500 million. We ask that Officials reconsider their estimates and make public the basis on which they are calculated (particularly as regards the $500 million) and assess their reliability before this Option is discarded. Officialsâ comment 40. The purpose of Table 3 was to illustrate the potential effects of reducing tax rates on FDI using the limited data available and a set of assumptions. Its was not intended to generate an accurate estimate of the net effect of the proposed reform for the purposes of determining whether or not to implement the proposed reform, since the detailed information required to undertake such an accurate assessment does not exist. 41. As outlined in more detail below, the apparent contradiction noted by practitioners arises due to the use of different approaches and data sets to estimate the extent to which the proposed reform would increase tax revenue by increasing FDI and reduce tax revenue by decreasing the effective tax rate on income from FDI. 42. In order to estimate the extent to which the increase in FDI would increase tax revenue, the example used Statistics New Zealand data on the stock of FDI, National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) estimates of the elasticity of FDI to changes in after-tax rates of return, and various assumptions about the pre-tax rate of return, the debt/equity ratio, the effective tax rates on income from debt and equity investments, and the rate of NRWT. In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 18 43. By contrast, in order to estimate the extent to which the reduction in the effective tax rate on income from FDI reduces tax revenue, the example used data on actual tax revenue collected from FDI. (In this regard, we note that we have greater confidence in the accuracy of that actual tax revenue data, as opposed to theoretical estimates of the amount of potential revenue Inland Revenue should be able to collect given the level of capital stock estimated by Statistics NZ and the set of simplifying assumptions outlined above.) 44. As suggested by practitioners, we have re-worked the example using a more consistent set of assumptions. It is important to note, however, that this does not alter the views reached by officials on this option. The critical question is still whether the proposed reform would actually generate a sufficiently large increase in FDI, tax revenue, and external benefits to offset the estimated fiscal cost of this option, which is estimated to be in the order of $500 million. There is still too much uncertainty surrounding the potential benefits of the proposed reform to warrant the introduction of such a reform at this time. Original calculations 45. For the purposes of estimating the extent to which such a tax reduction would increase the level of FDI, it was assumed in the example that: â¢ the stock of FDI in New Zealand is $50b (this was sourced from Statistics NZ) and the income from all of that FDI would be subject to the reduced tax rate; â¢ implementation of the Reviewâs recommendations would reduce the after-tax rate of return on FDI by approximately 8 per cent. This estimate was obtained by assuming that: Â the pre-tax rate of return is 8 per cent; Â the debt/equity ratio is 50 per cent; Â the effective tax rate on debt is 10 per cent; Â the effective tax rate on equity is reduced from 33 per cent to 18 per cent by the introduction of the Reviewâs recommendations; Â the rate of NRWT on dividends is 2 per cent; Â the average effective tax rate before reform is 21.5 per cent (i.e. \[0.5\*0.1\] + \[0.5 \* 0.33\]); Â the average effective tax rate post-reform is 14.82 per cent (i.e. \[0.5 \* 0.1\] + \[0.5 \* 0.18\] + \[0.5 \* 0.02 \* (1 - 0.18)\]); Â implementation of the Reviewâs recommendations would increase the post tax rate of return on FDI from approximately 6.3 per cent (i.e. 0.08 \* \[1 â 0.215\] ) to approximately 6.8 per cent (i.e. 0.08 \* \[1 â 0.1482\]); Â consequently, implementation of the reviewâs recommendations would increase the after tax rate of return by approximately 0.5 percentage points (i.e. approximately 6.8 â 6.3) or by approximately 8 per cent (i.e. approximately 0.5/6.3) 4 ; â¢ a one per cent increase in the after tax rate of return produces a 2.8 per cent increase in FDI (this obtained from an NBER study); 4 Note that this figure is approximately 8.5% if we do not round off the after tax rates of return of 6.3% and 6.8% to one decimal place. In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 19 â¢ consequently, the estimated 8 per cent increase in the after tax rate of return would increase FDI by approximately 22 per cent (i.e. 2.8 \* 8) 5 ; â¢ consequently, the estimated 22 per cent increase in FDI would increase the stock of FDI by approximately $11 billion (i.e. $50b \* \[1 + 0.22\] â $50b) 6 ; â¢ consequently, the $11 billion increase in FDI would increase tax revenue by approximately $130 million 7 assuming an 8 per cent pre-tax rate of return and an effective tax rate of 14.82 per cent (i.e. 11 \* 0.08 \* 0.1482\]). 46. By contrast, for the purposes of estimating the extent to which such a tax reduction would reduce tax revenue, officials used data on the actual taxes paid in respect of dividends and interest flowing to foreign investors (i.e. NRWT and Foreign Investor Tax Credits) to estimate the underlying profits generated by foreign investment and hence the cost of the proposed change in effective tax rates. This process yielded an estimate of $500 million 47. Overall, the example therefore concluded that: â¢ the net effect of the proposed reform would be to reduce tax revenue by approximately $370 million (i.e $500m â $130m) 8 ; and â¢ the estimated increase in FDI would have to produce more than $370 million 9 of additional benefits to New Zealand to produce a net overall benefit. 48. It is this difference in approach, outlined above, that is responsible for the apparent contradiction noted by practitioners. If we had estimated the fiscal cost of the reform using Statistics NZ data on FDI and the simplifying assumptions outlined above, the estimated cost would have been less than $500m. For example if we assume that FDI does not increase following implementation of the Reviewâs recommendations, we would expect the reduction in tax revenue to be approximately $250 million (i.e. $50b x 0.5 per cent) 10 . 49. Since the assumptions underlying the example are consistent with a fiscal cost of less than $500m, practitioners have expressed concern that the example underestimates the potential increase in tax revenue generated by the proposed reform and have asked officials to recalculate the example using a more consistent set of assumptions (i.e. a set of assumptions consistent with a fiscal cost of $500m). Revised calculations 50. There are numerous amendments that could be made to the assumptions underlying the example that would increase the potential fiscal cost of the proposed reform to approximately $500 million including: â¢ increasing the assumed stock of FDI from $50 billion to approximately $75.6 billion. Under this assumption, the reform would have to produce additional benefits of 5 Note that this figure is approximately 24% assuming an 8.5% increase in the after tax rate of return. 6 Note that this figure is approximarely $12b assuming a 24% increase in FDI. 7 Note that this figure is approximately $141m assuming a $12b increase in FDI. 8 Note that this figure is approximately $359m assuming a $12b increase in FDI. 9 Note that this figure is approximately $359m assuming a $12b increase in FDI. 10 Note that this figure is approximately $267m if we do not round off the after tax rates of return of 6.3% and 6.8% to one decimal place. In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 20 approximately $287 million to offset the estimated net revenue loss. However, such an assumed stock of FDI is significantly higher than that suggested by Statistics NZ estimates; â¢ increasing the assumed responsiveness of FDI to an increase in the after tax rate of return from 24 per cent to approximately 87 per cent. Under this assumption, the reform would produce a net benefit of approximately $16 million. However, such an assumed elasticity is much higher than the NBER estimate. Even if the reform produced a 30 to 40 per cent increase in FDI, there would still be a significant net fiscal cost that would have to be offset by additional spill over benefits. For example, if the reform resulted in $15 billion of new FDI (i.e. a 30% increase in FDI) there would be a net reduction in tax revenue of $322 million. Similarly, if the reform resulted in an additional $20 million of FDI (i.e. a 40% increase) then the net reduction in tax revenue would be $263 million; â¢ increasing the assumed pre-tax rate of return from 8 per cent to approximately 12.1 per cent. Under this assumption, the reform would have to produce additional benefits of approximately $287 million to offset the estimated net revenue loss; or â¢ changing the assumed debt/equity ratio from 50/50 to approximately 31/69. Under this assumption, the reform would have to produce additional benefits of approximately $266 million to offset the estimated net revenue loss. 51. However, although it may be possible to improve the consistency of the assumptions underlying the example set out in Table 3, such amendments do not alter the conclusions reached by officials on this option for reform. The key question is still whether lowering tax rates would actually result in an increase in FDI that is sufficient to produce an increase in tax revenue and additional benefits that are more than sufficient to offset the reduction in tax revenue that arises from that reduction in tax rates. As noted in the text following Table 3 of the report: The answer to this question turns on the accuracy of the assumptions that drive the result. In other words, to be confident of this result we would need to be much more confident than we are about: â¢ The accuracy of (i) the current effective tax rate and (ii) the new effective tax rate. These effective tax rates are themselves based upon assumptions about average debt:equity ratios of FDI; â¢ The level of the stock of FDI in New Zealand; â¢ The elasticity of FDI into New Zealand; â¢ Whether New Zealand would attract the right sort of FDI â i.e. FDI that brings benefits to New Zealand. These are matters on which there is currently little information. Consequently, it is impossible to predict the outcome of lowering effective tax rates on FDI with any certainty. 52. As a result, in view of the significant uncertainty surrounding the magnitude of the benefits of lowering taxes, officials still hold the view that there is currently insufficient evidence to suggest that such a reform would be of net benefit to New Zealand. In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 21 IS THE NEW/OLD DISTINCTION WORKABLE? Distinguishing new investment from old investment Submissions 53. In the absence of a lowering of the general corporate tax rate, most submissions favoured the Tax Reviewâs Policy Option 2. Generally, submitters felt that even if the new/old distinction is unsustainable in the long term, it should be introduced for a limited period of time, as an initial step towards a more permanent low tax rate for all FDI. 54. The practitionersâ submission addressed in detail the issue of how new FDI would be identified for the purposes of targeting it with a lower tax rate. In their view, the new tax rates would only apply to activities begun after a certain date or to significant expansions after a certain date. 55. The practitionersâ submission sees the distinction between new and old being based on an agency approval system, with a âknow it when you see itâ type of test. It does not anticipate a problem of uncertainty with the test as it considers that a majority of cases will not fall near the distinguishing line. It suggests that the test could be modelled along the lines of the British Columbian or Czech arrangements. The major tests in distinguishing new investment from old investment under the British Columbian model include: â¢ the degree of similarity of products and services with existing products or services; â¢ the degree of similarity of income producing assets with existing income producing assets; â¢ continuity of operations between new business and existing business; and â¢ whether continuity of customers and employees remain the same as an existing or prior business. 56. There is a suggestion that in the case of expansions of existing businesses, other requirements, such as a minimum level of investment, might be imposed. 57. The rate would be available only to non-resident owned activities or to the extent an activity is non-resident owned. The 18% rate would be quarantined to non-resident investors where a company has both resident and non-resident shareholders. Officialsâ comment 58. According to the practitionersâ submission, the way to make a new/old distinction work, whilst protecting the existing FDI base, is not to pursue a detailed statutory standard conferring rights to status as a ânew activityâ but rather to confer broad administrative discretion on the IRD/IPA to approve the status. This approval process would be binding and would be subject only to administrative review. In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 22 59. The rationale for a broad administrative discretion is to protect the existing base of FDI from reconstituting itself as new FDI within the rules by achieving a form over substance result. We accept that such an approach has these advantages. However, the disadvantages that arise with broad administrative discretions of this nature are as follows: â¢ The administration of the approval is inherently subjective. This subjectivity may result in inconsistency in the allocation of approvals. â¢ Compared with statutory rules, an approval process is also a deterrent for applicants. The subjectivity of the process means that applicants are not assured of being granted the lower rate. Accordingly, the value of the tax relief will be discounted to reflect the uncertainty that the investment will be eligible for the tax relief. Furthermore, it imposes an added compliance cost for doing business in New Zealand at the lower rate. â¢ Guidelines would need to be developed which may have some of the problems the approval process is trying to avoid. â¢ There are difficulties associated with designing an approval system that is unable to be challenged in the courts. 60. That an approval process can be designed is not in dispute. However, the mechanics of such a process are not straightforward and may impose added costs and complexities to the scheme. Should the new/old distinction could be implemented as a permanent feature of the tax system? Submissions 61. The issue of whether the new/old distinction can be made to âworkâ, focuses, in part, on whether tax rates can be targeted solely at new FDI, as a permanent feature of our tax system. 62. In the May report, officials indicated that it would be possible to target new FDI only for a limited period of time, say, five to ten years. On that basis we concluded that the new/old distinction would be unworkable, except as a transitional measure to a lower rate for all FDI. 63. KPMG disputed officialsâ views that the new/old distinction would be eroded over time. As with the practitionersâ submission, KPMG considers that leakage from old to new investment could be minimised through the use of a specialist body appointed to manage and monitor entry into the lower tax regime. In addition, KPMG considered that some leakage of existing FDI to new investment may not be entirely undesirable as it will ensure existing FDI is not attracted elsewhere. 64. The practitionersâ submission also disagreed with officialsâ views that the new/old distinction is unsustainable in the medium to long term for several reasons. First, it is argued In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 23 that there is logical economic rationale for limiting the test to new investors, and this will protect the regime from political pressure. The 18% rate will retain businesses in New Zealand and attract new businesses. These beneficial outcomes should ensure that the 18% rate remains economically and politically viable. Second, it is argued that countries with tax holidays, even lasting ten to twenty years, use such a test. Officialsâ comments 65. We do not agree with submissions that suggest that it would be possible to provide for a lower tax rate for new FDI on a permanent basis. The main reason is that it is not viable to sustain tax rate differences that are predicated solely on whether investment was made before or after a particular date (being the date of application of the rate to the ânewâ investment). Just how long a new/old distinction would endure in the face of the political pressures that would likely be brought to bear is a judgment call. Even if the weight of opinion supported the introduction of a low rate for new FDI, we expect that lobbying for extensions of the regime to existing FDI or other activity would intensify in the short to medium term. 66. Furthermore, we would expect the boundary would erode over time as capital stocks were replaced and the inherent difficulties associated with the approval process gradually became more pronounced. Officials remain convinced that the new/old distinction would become unsustainable after a period of, say, five to ten years. 67. We believe the practitionersâ submission overstates the precedent value of tax holiday systems in other countries. Overseas evidence on the success of such regimes in attracting investment is at best mixed. Moreover, of those examples provided in the submission only a minority focus solely on whether the activity undertaken by the investor is ânewâ (Korea, Philippines, and India). (Others are focused on whether the investor is a new investor into the country.) Those countries that do adopt a ânew/oldâ distinction also have the additional protection of a time limit on the tax relief provided by the tax holiday. This means that if the approval is given in error the consequences are capped by the time limit associated with the holiday. By contrast, the Tax Reviewâs proposal, at least in theory, involves a permanent distinction â thus putting all the base maintenance pressure on the effectiveness of the ânew/oldâ criterion. Whether a new/old distinction could be implemented as a temporary measure Submissions 68. Most submitters consider that even if the new/old distinction is unsustainable in the long term, should be introduced for a limited period of time, possibly as an initial step towards a more permanent low tax rate for all FDI. Several submitters suggested that the lowering of the rate for FDI could be staggered to reduce the cost of such a move. 69. ICANZ is in favour of Policy Option 2 being introduced for a finite period of time. It considers that this would allow its costs and benefits to be evaluated and allow the drafting of robust criteria and anti-avoidance legislation to minimise the risk of exploitation. ICANZ notes, however, that several issues that would need to be explored to determine the feasibility In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 24 of such a scheme, including the transportability of FDI at the expiry of the finite period and the impact this would have on the New Zealand economy. 70. The practitionersâ submission envisages three possible outcomes in the seven to ten-year period following the introduction of the 18% rate for new investment: â¢ continue with the regime if it works; or â¢ the Government can align rates as the general company tax rate trends down or if the number of businesses in the existing business category becomes very small; or â¢ abandon it after ten years if it doesnât produce the anticipated benefits for New Zealand. Officialsâ comments 71. If the Government wished to proceed with this initiative, it should be clear at the outset that the measure is a temporary one. In other words, the Government should proceed on the basis that the concession would be removed after a fixed period. (In order to be transparent about this, a sunset clause would need to be inserted into the legislation.) 72. This raises the question of whether, in order to proceed with Policy Option 2 as a temporary measure, the Government would need to determine, at the outset, whether the rate would increase to the corporate rate or be aligned at some new lower rate for FDI. Our view is that the Government could adopt the position that it is guaranteeing a low rate for new FDI for a fixed period. At the end of the fixed period the rate would move back to the normal corporate rate unless the Government decides otherwise, based on an objective evaluation of the net benefits of a lower rate. 73. While implementing Policy Option 2 on a time limited basis is technically feasible, officials do not support such an approach. There is a risk that, as a practical matter, it would be extremely difficult for the Government to terminate the concession â even if it has produced little in the way of spill-over benefits. We would expect that lobbying to extend the concession and possibly broaden the ambit of the concession would intensify closer to the date the concession was due to expire. Businesses that are attracted to a jurisdiction offering a temporary, concessionary tax rate are usually able to demonstrate that they will relocate out of the jurisdiction if the concession is not extended. This gives rise to a serious risk that a low tax rate for FDI will continue to exist, or even be extended, when it is undesirable for it to do so. Whether Policy Option 2 should be implemented as a temporary measure Submissions 74. The May report focused primarily on the costs and benefits of lowering the tax rate on all FDI. The same principles apply in considering whether to lower the tax rate for new FDI on a temporary basis. In other words, the Government should pursue Policy Option 2 on a temporary basis only if it believes that the reduction in tax on new FDI will produce In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 25 sufficient benefits to New Zealand to offset the welfare costs of raising revenue on other productive activity in New Zealand over that period. 75. The Tax Review and the May Report estimated that the static revenue cost of lowering tax rates on new FDI was a maximum of $50 million per annum. This calculation assumes no growth in FDI and treats all flows of FDI as ânewâ investment. This cost would compound each year and would need to be collected elsewhere in the economy. 76. Submitters had a general concern that officials had overstated the fiscal and economic costs of the Tax Review proposals whilst down-playing the expected benefits of the rate reduction. In terms of the costings, submitters were critical of the fact that the costings were static and did not take account of second-round effects. 77. On the positive side of the ledger, submitters were convinced that attracting more FDI would produce substantial fiscal and economic benefits. They said fiscal benefits would include income tax on FDI that would otherwise not have come to New Zealand and an increase in the PAYE and GST take associated with the new FDI. More importantly, they envisage that the economic benefits associated with an increase in FDI (spill-over benefits) would more than offset the fiscal and economic cost associated with the rate reduction. Officialsâ comments 78. In relation to the nature of the costings, the difficulty is that second round effects are usually linked to behavioural responses, which cannot be predicted with any certainty. Consequently, the revenue effects are simply too speculative to quantify. Accordingly, we prefer to rely on static costings whilst recognising their limitations. In any event, the economic costs of imposing a higher tax on other productive activity to make up the revenue shortfall are likely to be more significant than the fiscal costs, although more difficult to estimate and identify. 79. We agree with submitters that the benefits associated with new FDI come in the form of higher incomes for New Zealanders, tax on those incomes, and tax on the returns to foreign investors. The difference in views between officials and submitters is with regard to the extent of the benefits that would be generated by Policy Option 2. This, in turn, stems from the different judgments made by submitters and officials as to how much new FDI would come to New Zealand as a result of a major decrease in tax rates. 80. As we explained in our May report, the level of sensitivity depends on the investorâs circumstances. If a reduction in New Zealand tax does not result in an increase in the investorâs after-all-taxes profit because it reduces the availability of a usable tax credit to the investor, that investor will not be encouraged by the rate reduction. On the other hand, if the investorâs after-all-taxes profit is increased because the investor is resident in a country that exempts incoming dividends or is unable to use, or fully use, the tax credit, the taxpayer will be encouraged to invest in New Zealand. The extent to which that encouragement translates to an investor choosing New Zealand as an investment destination will depend on how much tax rates matter to that investor relative to other non-tax factors, including infrastructure, political stability, and location advantages. Overseas evidence on the sensitivity of FDI to tax In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 26 incentives is inconclusive. However, recent studies suggest that the level of sensitivity of FDI is only moderate but increasing. 11 81. Furthermore, the necessarily temporary nature of the proposal means only mobile FDI is likely to be attracted to New Zealand as a result of this initiative. This has adverse implications in terms of spill-over benefits. Mobile FDI is unlikely to result in the establishment of long-term sustainable businesses in New Zealand. Our judgment is that the costs, when both economic and fiscal costs are taken into account, would outweigh the benefits. Accordingly, we are unable to recommend adoption of Policy Option 2 as a temporary measure. WOULD POLICY OPTION 2 DISADVANTAGE DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES? Submissions 82. Fonterra and Business New Zealand believe that a lower rate should not be introduced only for new foreign direct investment. Fonterraâs view was based on the belief that it would create a competitive advantage for new FDI at the expense of New Zealand residents. Business New Zealand believes it is inappropriate to lower rates on FDI while New Zealand companies face high rates. It believes a lowering of the general rate is more appropriate. 83. The practitionersâ submission addressed the issue of perceived unfairness or competitive advantage if a lower rate is introduced for FDI. It submitted that the answer to the criticism of unfairness is that the country as a whole will be better off. It also points out that under the current system, non-residents may be taxed at a lower rate than residents and that it is not aware of any evidence that this differential produce adverse effects for New Zealand businesses. Officialsâ comments 84. Whether a lower tax rate affects other firmsâ ability to compete in the market turns on the issue of the economic incidence of that tax: who, in reality, bears the burden? Put another way, does income tax on non-residents result in: â¢ higher prices charged to the non-resident firmsâ customers? â¢ lower wages paid to its employees? â¢ lower returns to the non-resident owners of that capital? â¢ a higher cost of capital in the host country, leading to less overall investment and lower real wages in the economy in general? 85. While judging the economic incidence of taxes is not a simple matter, what evidence there is suggests that in small open economies like New Zealand it is the last of these alternatives. In other words, the burden of income taxes on non-residents falls on the 11 Rosanne Altshuter, Harry Grubert and T Scott Newton âHas U.S. Investment Abroad Become More Sensitive to Tax Rates?â NBER Working Paper No. W6383, January 1998. In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 27 economy generally, through a higher cost of capital. This was the evidence when New Zealand reduced its taxes on non-residents, in the form of the FITC rules introduced in 1991. On introduction, the rule had an immediate impact on the cost of capital, but did not seem to lead to a reduction in prices charged by non-resident owned firms. 86. The next likely alternative is that the burden falls on the non-resident owners, especially if they are earning economic rents that can be taxed away without altering the level of investment. 87. We consider that the least likely alternative is the former - that taxes on income are passed-through to consumers in the form of higher prices. It is this alternative that submitters have in mind when they refer to effects on the competitiveness of domestic firms. 88. Competitive advantage is a specific economic term referring to a situation where a market player has the ability to distort the market by, for example, charging a lower than market price. While it appears a reduced tax rate for non-residents will not lead to market- changing behaviour, the reduced tax rate may allow foreign companies to attain a financially stronger position and grow faster than their New Zealand counterparts. This may allow these foreign companies to take advantage of opportunities before New Zealand competitors are in a position to exploit them. In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 28 ANNEX 2 SUMMARY OF SUBMISSIONS ON THE OFFICIALSâ REPORT ON FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT The practitionersâ submission prepared by Rob McLeod, David Patterson and John Shewan 1. The practitionersâ submission is a comprehensive submission on the merits of adopting Policy Option 2. Two of the authors participated in the Tax Review and their views are in line with the McLeod Committee. 2. The basis for the practitionersâ submission is the Governmentâs stated objectives of achieving higher levels of growth necessary to move New Zealand back to the top half of the OECD on a GDP per capital basis. They believe the government needs to attract more FDI in order to achieve these aims. They stressed the importance of headline rates to help New Zealand âstandout from the crowdâ and support the adoption of the 18% rate for new activities to the extent they are owned by non-residents because it is (in their view) preferable to any other alternative, including the status quo, which they emphasise will not achieve these objectives. 3. The practitionersâ submission concedes the benefits of Policy Option 2 cannot be proved in advance but considers the small cost of the proposal will ensure the move is welfare enhancing while recommending Policy Option 2 as a permanent measure. If this proposal is not advanced, however, they would like to see the 18% rate introduced for a limited time period (possibly seven to ten years) for new activities which meet a national interest criteria. 4. The submission considers that new FDI is marginal investment and therefore does not harbour rents. In the absence of rents they believe that FDI is sensitive to tax and therefore taxing such investment creates high deadweight costs. They also believe that such investment produces significant positive externalities. 5. The practitionerâs submission considers that investors would be likely to substitute equity for debt if an 18% rate were introduced. They believe that this would significantly offset officialsâ estimated cost of the proposal. 6. The submitters outline the key features of the 18% rate for new investment. The rate would be available only to non-resident owned activities or to the extent an activity is non- resident owned. It would apply only to activities or significant expansions commenced after a certain date. The 18% rate would be quarantined to non-resident investors where a company has both resident and non-resident shareholders. The 18% rate would not be available for existing FDI. In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 29 7. They disagree with officialsâ conclusions that the new/old distinction is unsustainable and comment that officials have provided no evidence to support their view. They base their opinion mainly on the fact that many other countries operate some form of the new/old distinction through tax holiday incentives. The submitters see the distinction being operated in New Zealand through an agency approval system with a âknow it when you see itâ type test. They do not anticipate a problem of uncertainty with the test as they point out that a majority of cases will not fall near the distinguishing line. 8. The submission suggests that the test could be modelled along the lines of the British Columbian or Czech arrangements. The major tests in distinguishing new investment from old investment under the British Columbian model include the degree of similarity of products and services, income producing assets, customers and employees and the continuity of business. 9. They do not consider that the new/old distinction is unsustainable for several reasons. Firstly, countries with tax holidays which last for ten to twenty years use such a test. Secondly, there is logical economic rationale for limiting the test to new investors, and this will protect the regime from political pressure. Lastly, the 18% rate will retain businesses in New Zealand and attract new businesses to the extent that the 18% rate will remain economically and politically viable. 10. The group anticipates three broad outcomes if the 18% rate for new investment is introduced: â¢ the government can align rates as the general company tax rate trends down or if the number of businesses in the existing business category becomes very small; â¢ keep the regime if it works; or â¢ abandon it after ten years if it doesnât work. 11. They summarise the advantages of Policy Option 2 when compared with other options, as follows: â¢ the proposal results in the lowering of important headline rates; â¢ the response of foreign investors is measurable and therefore the government can monitor as a type of controlled experiment; â¢ the proposal encourages investors to substitute equity for debt thus reducing the cost of the initiative; â¢ the rate is narrowly targeted and is consistent with government policy. 12. The submission discounts the anticipated problems with introducing such a regime. It also argues that the tax reduction will not benefit foreign treasuries, rather than the investors, either because the tax regimes of those countries which are the main sources of FDI in New Zealand either exempt foreign income (for example, Australia), or the investors have excess foreign tax credits. The submission further argues the adverse reaction of other countries to the introduction of the low rate would not be significant as many countries have similar In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 30 concessionary regimes. They contend that the perception of discriminatory treatment of old FDI will be offset by the fact that New Zealand as a whole will be economically better off. 13. The submission promotes the 18% rate for new investment over any alternatives, which it dismisses as not targeted narrowly enough and therefore too expensive, not providing the benefits of FDI, or risking national welfare reduction. Business New Zealand 14. Business New Zealand favours a reduction in the overall tax rate, particularly a lowering of the corporate tax rate for all businesses over time from 33% to 20%. However, it does not support a low rate for FDI only. Business New Zealand feels New Zealand has done poorly in recent years at growing business investment and attracting and retaining FDI. It also feels that the government needs to recognise the important role that higher levels of investment, both foreign and domestic, play in obtaining a higher rate of economic growth. Business New Zealand stresses the need for an internationally competitive tax system and the need for dynamic rather than static forecasting methods. Vodafone New Zealand and Vodafone Group Services 15. Vodafone supports an 18% tax rate for new investment into New Zealand by non- residents. As part of a global group, Vodafone New Zealand must compete within the group for regional company business such as the provision of group service centres or the development of new technology. Vodafone New Zealand feels it would be better placed to be considered for these opportunities within the Asia Pacific region if New Zealand had a more attractive tax regime which encouraged foreign investment. Vodafone Group Services has confirmed that it is in the process of establishing regional centres for several activities and has restated that a competitive tax environment would greatly increase the attractiveness of New Zealand as a location for these activities. Corporate Taxpayer Group 16. The Corporate Taxpayer Group generally supports a lower tax rate for FDI. The submission takes issue with a number of specific assumptions and comments made in the May report. Of the more important issues, the Corporate Taxpayer Group believes that the report does not address the following satisfactorily: â¢ the possibility of a new/old distinction for an initial limited period of time; â¢ the possibility of a loss of FDI if a lower tax rate is not implemented; â¢ the benefits of spill-over effects; and â¢ the cost calculations, which are static. 17. The submission also notes that investors may still be sensitive to New Zealand tax in a number of situations where tax credits are available and that unilateral action in response to New Zealand cutting tax rates on FDI is unlikely. The Corporate Taxpayer Group is of the opinion that the fact that the effect of lowering the tax rate is impossible to predict is not a In Confidence T2003/1566; PAD2003/175: Taxing inbound investment Page 31 reason to do nothing. The submission considers that the initial fiscal impact of introducing a lower FDI rate will eventually be offset by increased FDI and long-term benefits. It also suggests that this cost can be addressed by staggering the rate reduction. KPMG 18. KPMG is of the view that New Zealandâs traditional tax policy approach and defensive approach to tax competition discourages investment, especially in cases where tax costs are important. It considers the New Zealand rate is high and is contrary to international trends. KPMG notes the actions of other countries, particularly New Zealandâs Asia Pacific neighbours, in taking initiatives through their tax systems to encourage FDI. 19. KPMGâs preference is for a lower corporate rate, and it emphasises that the headline rate is important. However, in the absence of a reduction in the headline rate, KPMG favours Policy Option 2. It challenges the assumption that the corporate tax base will be maintained in the absence of positive initiatives and notes that not all new FDI has an associated tax cost. KPMG raises the same point about regional opportunities for group companies in New Zealand as Vodafone. ICANZ 20. ICANZ considers that the encouragement of FDI is crucial to the growth of the New Zealand economy. While recognising the limitations of Policy Option 2, ICANZ recommends that this option be seriously considered as a âstep upâ solution for a finite period. ICANZ considers that the introduction of such a regime would allow its costs and benefits to be assessed and robust legislative criteria to be formed while reducing the risk involved in introducing Policy Option 2. ICANZ notes several issues to be considered in introducing such a policy for a finite period of time. ICANZ also comments on the need for new tax treatment of intellectual property and inbound royalties. Fonterra 21. Fonterra does not support an 18% tax rate for new FDI. Fonterra feels that a reduced rate on FDI would give foreign investments a competitive advantage over New Zealand residents. It considers exporters should get similar treatment to FDI as they produce similar or better benefits to New Zealand. It considers a simplified tax system is the best way to attract investment into New Zealand and, like ICANZ, comments on the tax treatment of intellectual property rights and royalties. Fonterra also comments that low headline rates do not influence whether it invests offshore or not.

Tax changes to encourage venture capital
========================================

The government is proposing tax changes to encourage venture capital investment into New Zealand companies early in their life cycles, Revenue Minister Michael Cullen said today in a speech to the NZ Venture Capital Association. They include exempting from tax the profits from the sale of shares when the investors are exempt from tax in their own jurisdiction, and removing a tax barrier to resident partners investing alongside non-resident partners through a special partnership structure.

SPEECH NOTES

### Speech to NZ Venture Capital Association 2nd Annual Conference

**Robert Laidlaw Room, The Heritage Hotel, 35 Hobson Street, Auckland**

Thank you for your welcome and for the opportunity to address this second annual conference of the New Zealand Venture Capital Association. I would like to congratulate the association on the progress made during the last two years. With the appointment of Chris Twiss as Executive Director, and the publication of the first "NZ Venture Capital Monitor" the Association is well on the way towards becoming an essential part of the New Zealand investment market.

My session is entitled 'Public policy and the development of the New Zealand venture capital and private equity industry'.

It is worth recalling that, even as late as five years ago, there would have been very little to say on this subject. Under the logic that drove public policy in the late 1980s and 1990s venture capital was seen as a quintessentially private enterprise, and hence not a matter for direct government involvement.

Instead, the role adopted by successive governments extended no further than attempting to run a sound economic policy, maintaining a tidy framework of commercial law and taxation, and cheering from the sidelines as the invisible hand of the markets moved capital around to its most efficient distribution. Or failed to do so, as the case may be.

If â as happened with annoying frequency â New Zealand businesses were not able to access the venture capital they needed to turn new technologies and products into successful business ventures, then there was nothing government could do except wring its hands and hope for more propitious circumstances in future.

Thankfully, public policy has shifted. The intellectual debate has moved, such that we now understand much better how, in small trading economies such as ours, there needs to be cooperative interplay between capital markets and government initiatives. A well-functioning venture capital market is as much about culture as about economics. It requires interaction between research scientists and engineers, entrepreneurial business people and investors who are willing to commit long-term to a new venture.

That may happen spontaneously in a large economy. (Although the respective histories of Silicon Valley, Oxfordshire, Northern Italy and the Bangalore region of India suggest a more complex chain of causation.) In a small economy such as ours, however, it is more likely that a successful venture capital market will be made rather than born, and it will be made by the concerted effort of investors, researchers, industry and â last but not least â government.

The policy shift then is towards a smarter style of government intervention; intervention in partnership with the private sector, addressing specific structural and cultural obstacles to the growth and maturity of the venture capital market in the New Zealand economy.

No-one in my government is advocating a return to the days when ministers of the Crown acted as venture capitalists themselves, spending large sums of public money on best guesses and hunches. As I said, partnership is the key to our approach, without any slackening of the rigour that any diligent investor would put into research and analysis.

During our term of office, we have sought to develop a balanced set of policies that create an environment in which the local venture capital market can grow and mature. There are three main elements:

1.  First of all, creating a stable macro-economy, and hence strengthening the fundamentals which will make New Zealand an attractive place to invest;
2.  Secondly, remoulding our tax and regulatory regimes to provide greater clarity and certainty for investors; and
3.  Thirdly, becoming an active player in the process of bringing new ventures to the market, by a combination of better targeted expenditure on research and technology and a new partnership with the private sector aimed at boosting the level of venture capital available to New Zealand businesses.

On the macro-economy, we now have a stable platform in the form of a robust and growing economy. The New Zealand economy has been one of the best performing economies in the OECD in recent years.

The headline numbers tell the story. The economy grew by 4.3 per cent in the year to March 2003. Employment has grown in each of the last twelve consecutive quarters, so we now have an unemployment rate of 4.7 per cent, which is the lowest since 1987 and is very low by OECD standards. To give you a benchmark, the unemployment rate was 6.3 per cent when this government took office at the end of 1999. Inflation is well under control. Consumer prices rose by a very modest 1.5 per cent in the year to June.

This strong performance has not been a result of any fiscal stimulus. We are running strong surpluses, and spending and debt are falling as a percentage of GDP. In the 1999 fiscal year spending in the core Crown sector was 33.8 per cent of GDP. In the current financial year it is expected to be 31.1 per cent. Gross debt was 33.8 per cent of GDP. This year it is forecast to fall to 25.7 per cent.

What is interesting about these results is that our economy has not been impacted by a prolonged period of international uncertainty and stagnation. Normally, our economic fortunes are largely determined by external factors. But not only has our recent performance been much more stable than that in most other countries, it has been stable at the upper end of relative international economic performance.

Time will tell whether we have succeeded in creating an economy that is less prone to external shocks. From the present perspective things look good. We are moving towards the kind of economy that is better able to attract and sustain investment, including venture capital.

However, this needs to be combined with tax and regulatory regimes that provide clarity for investors and reflect international best practice. That is why, on the regulatory front, this government has embarked upon a review of securities legislation, and why we have been quick to review tax rules that impact upon venture capital.

I have recently announced broad proposals aimed at encouraging venture capital investment in New Zealand companies early in their life cycle. There are two major areas of change.

The first is a proposal to remove barriers to international venture capital investment by providing certain non-residents with an exemption on any tax that they may face on the profits they derive from realising shares in small, unlisted New Zealand companies. The exemption will be available to non-residents that are tax exempt in their own jurisdiction and, as a result, cannot claim in their own jurisdiction a credit for New Zealand tax paid.

The exemption will be available to residents of the majority of countries with which we have a double tax agreement.

To target venture capital, it is proposed that the exemption will be available only for equity investments in small, unlisted New Zealand resident companies that are not involved in certain excluded activities, such as property investment.

Secondly, we are proposing some changes to the taxation of special partnerships. It is suggested that the tax provisions that prevent resident special partners from offsetting partnership losses against other income be repealed provided that the deferred deduction tax rules that are currently before the House are passed in their current form. This will remove a tax barrier to resident partners investing alongside non-resident partners via a special partnership structure.

These changes are similar in many respects to the recent changes to the Australian tax treatment of venture capital.

Officials are currently consulting on these proposals with interested parties. It is intended that the final proposals will be included in the first tax bill of 2004, with application from 1 April 2004.

The third element of this government's venture capital policy has been active participation in the process of bringing new ventures to the market. We established the $100 million New Zealand Venture Investment Fund in 2001, with a mandate to accelerate the development of the venture capital market in New Zealand.

As you are aware, through VIF the Government is investing up to NZ$100 million in innovative New Zealand businesses with high growth potential. Importantly, the Fund invests through individual investment funds (VIF Seed Funds) operated by private sector fund managers appointed by VIF. These funds include capital raised from the private sector to at least twice the level of the VIF contribution.

VIF now has contracts with four seed fund managers and I think most of them are represented here today. Through VIF $139.5 million combined private and public sector venture capital has been committed for investment in young New Zealand companies so far, $93 million of it private funding and $46.5 million from VIF. Of the $53.5 million of VIF capital still available for investment, $25 million has been earmarked for biotech investment and the remaining $28.5 million will be invested either with existing or new VIF Seed Funds.

To date four companies have received capital through the VIF Programme, with a total of $12 million (of VIF and private capital) invested in the VIF Seed Funds.

Despite the perception encouraged by some portions of the media, venture capital is not easy money for risky business propositions. Given the level of risk involved, venture capital investments are made only after careful and rigorous analysis of the company concerned, the product and the market. This does not lend itself to hasty investment decisions. Scores of business plans and investment opportunities will be considered, before a decision is made to invest.

Having said that I, like you, look forward to seeing strong investment progress being made by the VIF Seed Funds over the next two to three years. It is vital that promising NZ companies with the potential to be global winners have access to the capital and the management skills to help them achieve this.

The last two years have been exceedingly challenging for raising venture capital. There has been a marked slowdown in global investment in the last two years, including the United States and Australia. New Zealand has not been immune to this.

But New Zealand is still doing exceedingly well. The Australian Venture Capital Journal recently pointed out that despite international conditions New Zealand has just had its 'second best year' in venture capital fund raising and it attributed that to the focus and stimulation provided by the VIF Programme and the VIF Seed Fund managers. The Programme has attracted a high level of private investment in challenging times.

The Journal also commented that the impact of VIF will next be felt in the level of investment activity in our market, because nearly all new capital raised is available for investment.

And the future looks promising for further new, institutional and pension fund investment in the New Zealand venture capital markets. Both the Government Superannuation Fund and the New Zealand Superannuation Fund have indicated that a portion of their funds will be invested in venture capital. Whether that investment is made onshore or offshore is a matter for them to decide. Both are at an early stage of implementing their investment strategies, and, of course, are required to make decisions independently on the basis of the best available advice. But the signs are promising. Availability of high quality investment products in the New Zealand venture capital markets will help them make that decision.

On the other side of the investment equation, there is still a need for young New Zealand companies seeking venture capital to demonstrate that the investment has good prospects for success.

Recent policy initiatives have been aimed at improving our game in this regard.

This year we announced a Pre-Seed Accelerator Fund of more than $19 million over the next four years to invest in pre-seed projects; that is, those that fall between grant-funded research and the seed stage of development, where venture capital would normally cut in. This will aid the commercialisation of research in Crown Research Institutes, tertiary education institutions and their subsidiaries, and over time it will boost the number and quality of projects seeking venture capital.

We also boosted the support programme for business incubators by $1.6 million, committing an additional $6.4 million over four years to lift the proficiency and scale of New Zealand incubators to internationally recognised standards. We now have 15 incubators, and the companies they support have in the last 18 months raised more than $10 million in private funds.

In addition, we recently launched a number of new initiatives in biotechnology arising out of the government's response to the Biotech Taskforce. The taskforce recommended an ambitious 10-year vision of increasing the value of biotechnology exports from the current $250 million to more than $1 billion a year. The government has taken all but a few of the taskforce's specific recommendations on board. For example:

*   A new $12 million fund will be established to support trans-Tasman joint ventures in biotechnology. This will offer partnership funding to New Zealand and Australian companies working together on biotechnology development, manufacturing and marketing.
*   A $2.3 million programme will support best practice in commercialising biotechnology research, to support the flow of good ideas from our laboratories to our markets.
*   We will also be spending $1.2 million over four years to get better statistical information on the biotechnology sector, to track its growth; since, as we all know, accurate information is the lifeblood of a venture capital market.
*   Today VIF will receive proposals from parties interested in establishing a VIF Biotech Fund. There is $25 million available for co-investment alongside private investors, in selected privately managed Biotech funds.

  
So, to sum up, we are firmly committed to the development of the New Zealand venture capital and private equity industry. We have, I believe, put in place a sensible set of measures which will bear fruit in the medium to long term.

I have to stress that this is still a work in progress. We need time to bed in initiatives such as the Venture Investment Fund and the Pre-Seed Accelerator Fund. And no doubt there are other issues to be addressed in tax and regulation.

We recognise the need to keep open the channels of communication in order to fine tune the mix of policies and remain alert to obstacles that may arise in areas such as taxation and business law.

For this reason I look forward to your questions and to receiving feedback from the rest of today's conference.

Thank you.
