1 IR719 October 2023 Application for a higher maximum pooling value About this form If you depreciate items of depreciable property using the pooling method there is a statutory maximum pooling value of $5000 for each item. However, you can apply for a maximum pooling value higher than this by completing this form. We take the following factors into consideration when deciding whether to approve your application: –whether the items you wish to include under a higher maximum pooling value are relatively similar in nature; –whether your compliance costs will be materially reduced by pooling the items; and –how often you acquire and dispose of that class of item. Fees are payable for this application. Notes concerning fees, as well as the process and timeframe for responding to this application, are contained at the end of this form. Further information about depreciation is contained in the booklet Depreciation - a guide for businesses - IR260.

IR776 August 2020 Disputing an assessment What to do if you dispute an assessment 2DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Introduction While we make every effort to apply the tax laws fairly and correctly, there may be a time when you disagree with your tax assessment. If that happens, this guide explains what you need to know and what options you have to resolve the disagreement. Where you disagree with the amount assessed, there is a process to follow so your rights are protected. This process is important, because your dispute may have to be heard by a court if you and Inland Revenue are unable to resolve it. In all cases we try to reach an agreement with you before there is a need for you to dispute an assessment formally. There are times when Inland Revenue may make an assessment without first sending a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA). These include, but are not limited to: • • When an assessment is amended with agreement between Inland Revenue and a taxpayer to correct a tax position previously taken by a taxpayer. • • The assessment reflects an agreement reached between Inland Revenue and the taxpayer. • • An assessment is made from the direction of the courts or Taxation Review Authority. • • The assessment results from an income tax assessment. There’s a different dispute procedure if you receive a NOPA from Inland Revenue – for more information see our guide Disputing a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) - IR777. How to use this guide We’ve set out the disputes resolution process from when you first want to dispute an assessment or Inland Revenue decision to what happens after a challenge is resolved in court. In Part 10 there is a summary of the time limits that you must meet in the process, and some important points to remember. Inland Revenue Acts grant various powers and responsibilities to the Commissioner – not to Inland Revenue as an organisation. In practice the Commissioner delegates powers and responsibilities to other Inland Revenue staff. That’s why we’ve used “Inland Revenue” and “we” in this guide to describe action taken in the Commissioner’s name. During the disputes process you may get letters or other documents that use the Commissioner as legal authority. The information in this guide is based on current tax laws. 3 ird.govt.nz Go to our website for information and to use our services and tools. • • Log in or register for myIR - manage your tax and entitlements online. • • Calculators and tools - use our calculators, worksheets and tools, for example, to check your tax code, find filing and payment dates, calculate your student loan repayment. • • Forms and guides - download our forms and guides.

This may then place an assessment in dispute. The disputes resolution process can take some time, and can also include late payment penalties, non- payment penalties and interest. Because of this, we try to settle disagreements before the dispute stage. If you’ve made a simple error in your return, you can: • • correct errors, such as the transposition of numbers or arithmetical mistakes, by telephone or in writing • • self-correct errors – if you have made a small error in a GST return, you may self-correct it in a later period. Late claim of GST If you can not claim GST now (for example, no tax invoice), you can claim it in a future period. You can only make a late GST claim on expenditure incurred in the previous two years. Exceptions to this two-year rule include: • • inability to obtain a tax invoice • • disputed payments for expenditure • • mistakenly treating a supply as non-taxable • • clear mistakes or simple oversights. Make sure you know what’s going on It’s important you understand exactly what any adjustments are for. Ask us for an explanation straightaway in any of these situations. • • You’re not sure about any part of a letter or decision. • • You think an adjustment or an assessment is incorrect. • • You think we’re taking too long to reply. Part 2 explains the disputes resolution process and how to proceed with your dispute. 7 Part 2 – The disputes resolution process and you If your disagreement with Inland Revenue has not been resolved as set out in Part 1, you may want to have your point of view considered through the disputes resolution process that applies to: • • assessments issued under tax legislation, including your self-assessment • • disputable decisions that are not assessments. The procedures do not apply to assessments issued to paying parents under the Child Support Act 1991. In this part we tell you what you must do if you disagree with an assessment. The process is designed to resolve disagreements as quickly as possible by early identification of all issues, disclosure of the facts and evidence, and consultation between you and Inland Revenue. We explain the steps of the disputes procedure and what you must do. If you wish to proceed with a dispute, we recommend you seek independent advice from an accountant or other professional tax advisor. This is especially important if complex issues are involved. Note There are time limits built into the process that apply to you and to Inland Revenue. If you do not respond within the time limits you will have to pay the tax calculated. Part 10 contains a summary of the time limits for disputing an assessment. Steps in the disputes resolution process The disputes resolution process usually goes through the steps set out on the following pages. Sometimes there are special circumstances that mean this is not appropriate. We’ll tell you if we consider the dispute should be handled differently, and how you should proceed. The chart on page 13 summarises these steps. Inland Revenue postal addresses If you know the name and address of the Inland Revenue staff member who is dealing with your case, send all your correspondence and forms to that person. Otherwise use one of the following: ReturnsGeneral correspondence Inland Revenue PO Box 39090 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 Inland Revenue PO Box 39010 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 For a full list of addresses go to ird.govt.nz/contact-us 8DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Notice of proposed adjustment If you’ve received a notice of a tax assessment or decision without first receiving a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) from us, and you disagree, or want to make adjustments to your self-assessment, you must issue us with a NOPA. If you’re sending us a NOPA to your self-assessment you must do so within four months of the date your return is received by Inland Revenue – the self-assessment date. You’ll find this on the return acknowledgment form that we sent you after processing your return. If you’re sending us a NOPA in response to an assessment made by Inland Revenue you must send it to us within four months of the date of issue of the notice of assessment. Note If you have not filed a return for the period of disputed assessment, you can not issue a NOPA. You must file the return along with your NOPA. We’ll accept a late NOPA if there is an exceptional circumstance (page 11). If you do not send us a NOPA within the applicable period you are considered by law to have accepted the assessment or disputable decision. Your NOPA must be in the prescribed format and identify all of the following: • • the proposed adjustment(s) • • the facts and tax laws that support the adjustment you are proposing • • how the law applies to the facts • • the documents you intend to rely on. You can either use a Notice of proposed adjustment - IR770 form or create your own. However, if you choose to create your own document, we recommend you attach the IR770 cover sheet and follow the format of our form as this will help to make sure you meet all the requirements of a NOPA . Part 3 has details on how to complete a NOPA. If Inland Revenue accepts all the contentions in your NOPA we’ll make an amended assessment. However, if we disagree with any part of your proposed adjustment, we’ll issue a notice of response within two months of the date you issued your NOPA. Commissioner’s notice of response Our notice of response (NOR) will state concisely why the proposed adjustment is rejected and specify how it could be altered so agreement is possible. It will contain: • • the facts or legal arguments in your NOPA we disagree with • • why we consider those facts or legal arguments are incorrect • • further facts and legal arguments we rely on • • how the legal arguments apply to the facts • • the quantitative adjustments by which your proposed adjustment could change as a result of the facts and legal arguments we rely on. 9 If you disagree with part or all of the NOR you must write to tell us within two months of the date it was issued. If you do not, you’re considered to have accepted Inland Revenue’s position. If no agreement is reached at this stage, the dispute will usually move to the conference stage. Conference stage The conference is held to identify and clarify the facts and issues, and to allow any disputed facts to be resolved. A conference provides an opportunity for the parties to state the facts and define the issues clearly and concisely. A conference may be in the form of a meeting (or series of meetings), or a phone call. The Inland Revenue staff member you’ve been dealing with will contact you to arrange the conference. They’ll also offer to have a senior Inland Revenue staff member act as facilitator for the conference. The facilitator will have had no previous involvement with the dispute. If no agreement is reached at the conference stage we’ll usually issue a disclosure notice. If all or some of the issues are resolved during the conference, the issues on which the agreement is reached will be recorded and an assessment made if necessary. A disclosure notice will be issued to deal with any issues remaining in dispute. Suspension of a dispute pending a separate test case Provided you and Inland Revenue agree in writing, your dispute can be suspended pending the outcome of a test case in the High Court. For such a dispute to be suspended, the facts and questions of law in the dispute must be significantly similar to those of the court proceeding that has been designated as a test case. Once agreement is reached the dispute is suspended pending the outcome of the test case in the courts and you’re not required to continue with the disputes procedures (for example, you do not have to file a statement of position, or have your dispute considered by our Adjudication Unit). Your dispute is suspended until the earliest of the following occurs: • • the court makes its decision about the test case • • the test case is otherwise resolved • • your dispute is otherwise resolved. If we suspend your dispute pending the outcome of a test case we’ll advise you of the outcome of that test case. If that results in an amended assessment you may accept that assessment, or begin challenge proceedings. Further information about test case court proceedings can be found in Part 7. 10DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Disclosure notice A disclosure notice requires you to send your statement of position to Inland Revenue within two months from the date of issue. Although the disclosure notice is usually issued at the end of the conference stage, it may be issued at any time after the NOPA. You must respond to the disclosure notice within two months of the date of issue unless there is an exceptional circumstance (page 11). If you do not, you are considered to have accepted our NOR and the assessment will be confirmed. If you are considered to have accepted the assessment, you can not challenge it in court. Statement of position Your statement of position must be in the prescribed format, and contain all the following: • • an outline of the facts you intend to rely on • • an outline of the documentary evidence you intend to rely on • • an outline of the issues you consider will arise • • the propositions of law you intend to rely on. When you respond with your statement of position, we have two months to issue our statement of position. It will contain all the following: • • an outline of the facts we intend to rely on • • an outline of the documentary evidence we intend to rely on • • an outline of the issues we consider will arise • • the propositions of law we intend to rely on. Part 4 has more information about completing your statement of position. If there is still a disagreement on some issues at the end of the disclosure stage, the case will usually be sent to our Adjudication Unit for consideration, regardless of the issue or amount of tax involved. Exclusion rule The issuing of a disclosure notice and the two statements of position brings into effect the “exclusion rule”. This rule prevents issues and propositions of law not raised in the statements of position from being raised in any subsequent challenge, unless both sides agree. There is a provision that allows judicial discretion to admit previously undisclosed material in very limited circumstances. Make sure we receive all your correspondence Once you’ve written your NOPA, rejection of Inland Revenue’s NOR or statement of position, either deliver it or post it to us. If you’re posting any of these notices, send them to the staff member you’ve been dealing with. If you do not have a contact name or address, use one of the postal addresses on page 7. 11 Late actions (exceptional circumstances) There are time limits throughout the disputes resolution process that must be met. If you do not take the required action within the applicable timeframe, you are considered by law to have accepted our position unless we consider that exceptions apply. Exceptional circumstances are events outside the control of you or your agent, that could not have been reasonably anticipated. Exceptional circumstances may also arise if we consider the lateness is minimal, or results from one or more statutory holidays falling in the response period. Late actions, such as filing a dispute document late, may be accepted providing you can show your intention to enter into, or continue with, a dispute and you send the required information to Inland Revenue as soon as reasonably practicable. Adjudication The adjudicator is an independent officer from within Inland Revenue who will take a fresh look at the application of the law to the facts of the case. If the adjudicator agrees with Inland Revenue’s position the assessment will be confirmed. The adjudicator will consider the facts, evidence, propositions of law and issues raised in the statements of position. The adjudicator is not an investigator and will not search for missing facts or evidence. Usually the adjudicator will not contact you or the Inland Revenue staff member involved in the dispute, except to clarify a point. If contact is made both parties involved will be advised, and the reasons why contact is necessary outlined. When the adjudicator reaches a decision a copy will be given to you and the staff member involved. If you’re dissatisfied with the adjudicator’s decision you may start proceedings before the TRA or the High Court. You have two months from the date of the notice of assessment or challenge notice to file proceedings. The adjudicator’s decision At the end of the disputes process the adjudicator must make a decision. The decision will be in writing and include a written report giving the grounds for the decision. If your dispute goes to the adjudication stage there are four possible outcomes. 1. The adjudicator fully agrees with your position If the adjudicator agrees in full, you’ll receive an amended notice of assessment to replace the one you disputed. This new assessment will take into account any tax already paid. 2. The adjudicator partly agrees with your position If the adjudicator agrees in part, you’ll receive an amended notice of assessment to replace the one you disputed. This assessment will agree with the parts of your dispute the adjudicator has allowed, but it will not agree with those points they consider are incorrect. 12DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT You may take further steps to continue with the part of your dispute that the adjudicator has disagreed with. There are some specific actions you must take to continue with that part of your dispute. These are explained in Part 6. 3. The adjudicator disagrees with your position If the adjudicator disagrees with all parts of your argument there will be no new assessment, and you’ll receive a letter stating we consider the existing assessment to be correct. If you want to continue with your dispute there are some specific further actions you must take. These are explained in Part 6. 4. The adjudicator can not make a decision If the adjudicator considers both parties have failed to consider an issue or section that could affect the outcome of the dispute, both parties will be advised and the file will be referred back to the staff member handling the case. Continuing your dispute If the adjudicator disagrees with all or part of your position, you’ll receive a letter containing a section similar to: “If you wish to continue with your dispute, you must file proceedings before the Taxation Review Authority or High Court within two months of the date of this letter: The courts have limited authority to accept an application after two months have expired. The only instance in which they may accept a late application is if your application is late due to circumstances completely beyond the control of you or your agent.” Parts 5 and 6 explain the different courts you can have your challenge heard in, and how to take your case to court. Statutory time bars Generally there are set time periods (time bars) for disputing an assessment. In most cases the law does not allow us to proceed with the dispute outside of these time periods. However, time bars can be waived in some circumstances. Waiving the time bar • • The time bar can be waived for a total agreed period or periods of up to 12 months after the expiry of the relevant four-year period, from the date of assessment. • • The time bar can be waived for a further six months from the end of the period referred to above on written notice being given by the taxpayer. • • During the waiver period Inland Revenue must not investigate issues between the taxpayer and Inland Revenue that weren’t identified and known to both parties before the start of the period. 13 Flowchart: Disputes resolution process commenced by you In Inland Revenue’s favour Event Conference Disclosure notice Adjudication Finalisation Inland Revenue issues an assessment Conference takes place Inland Revenue issues disclosure notice and statement of position Inland Revenue amends statement of position to address any new matters in customer’s statement of position Case referred to adjudication Adjudicator determines issues Assessment issued – end of process End of process End of process Assessment issued End of process Assessment issued End of process Assessment issued – taxpayer may challenge in court No No No Ye s Ye s Yes Ye s In customer’s favour In customer’s favour In customer’s favour In Inland Revenue’s favour In Inland Revenue’s favour Customer issues N O PA Customer accepts Inland Revenue’s contentions Ye s No Disputed issues resolved Customer issues statement of position Is issue resolved?

The NOPA must be in the prescribed form and contain the following details: • • the date of issue of the notice • • your name and IRD number • • your address and preferred contact details (phone, email, fax or post). The second part of the NOPA must contain: • • the tax adjustments you propose • • the facts and tax laws that support your adjustments • • how the law applies to the facts • • the documents you intend to rely on. Completing the NOPA Date of issue Show the date the NOPA is issued to Inland Revenue. Full name of taxpayer Show your full name here. If the adjustment is for a company, partnership or other organisation, show the name of the organisation. IRD number of taxpayer Show your IRD number here. If the adjustment is for a company, partnership or other organisation, show the IRD number of the organisation. Address and contact details Show your address and contact details here. If the adjustment is for a company, partnership or other organisation, show the address and contact details of the organisation. If you have an agent or would like to be contacted at a different address from your postal address, show how and where you would like to be contacted. Identify the proposed adjustments Include the tax type, return period and the amount of tax payable or refundable resulting from the adjustment, along with a description of the adjustment required. 15 The facts and laws that support your adjustment Please provide a statement of the facts and laws that you consider make the adjustment necessary in sufficient detail to inform Inland Revenue of the grounds for your proposed adjustment. You should identify the laws that relate to your proposed adjustment. These should refer to the relevant Act (for example, the Income Tax Act 1994, the Income Tax Act 2004, the Income Tax Act 2007 or the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985) and section(s) that support your adjustment. If you do not know the tax laws relevant to your proposed adjustment, please provide as much information about the adjustment as soon as possible so we can establish which section(s) of the relevant Acts apply. Also provide any legal arguments or principles that support your proposed adjustments. This can be any information on the application of the law that relates to your proposed adjustment(s), for example, references to tax laws, court decisions or Inland Revenue policy statements. When referring to a case as support for your proposed adjustment a summary of the applicable legal principle is required. Just referring to a case without the supporting principle could make your NOPA invalid. How the law applies to the facts You must relate the law and the legal principles in support of your proposed adjustments to your factual circumstances to ensure that the facts logically support the proposed adjustments. Documents supporting the adjustment Attach the documents you intend to rely on that are significantly relevant to the issues and that you’re aware of at the time you issue your NOPA. Where the evidence is oral it’s not necessary to give the name of the witnesses who may give evidence for you if the matter proceeds to court. Finalising and sending your NOPA Once you have completed and dated your NOPA, send or deliver it to us straightaway. If you have been in contact with an Inland Revenue staff member about the assessment or other issue you are disputing, address it to that person. Otherwise, send it to one of the postal addresses on page 7. Note You must send us your NOPA within four months of the date your assessment was issued or your self-assessed return was received by Inland Revenue. If you do not meet this deadline your NOPA can not be considered unless exceptional circumstances apply (page 11). If you have not furnished a return and the Commissioner makes a default assessment, you must furnish the outstanding return and send us a NOPA in respect of the default assessment otherwise you can not dispute the Commissioner’s default assessment. 16DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Note If your dispute relates solely to a research and development tax credit claim, different time limits apply. See the R&D tax credit information at ird.govt.nz/research-development Once Inland Revenue receives your NOPA As soon as we receive your NOPA and have confirmed that it’s valid we’ll acknowledge it by letter. If it’s not valid and the NOPA deadline has not passed, we’ll contact you with details of the action you must complete before the deadline expires, to make your NOPA valid. The staff member reviewing your NOPA will consider the points made to determine if the adjustment you have requested is allowed under the legislation. If they decide that your adjustment is allowed we’ll tell you your NOPA has been accepted, and make an amended assessment in due course. If they do not agree with your proposed adjustment we’ll issue a NOR rejecting your proposed adjustment. Inland Revenue’s NOR will outline why we consider that your proposed adjustment can not be accepted. To be valid, Inland Revenue’s NOR must be issued within two months of the date on your NOPA. For example, if your NOPA was sent 10 April 2019, the last date for issuing Inland Revenue’s NOR is 9 June 2019. You may contact us to provide further information in support of the NOPA, provided this is within the response period. If Inland Revenue rejects your NOPA If Inland Revenue rejects your NOPA and you disagree with our NOR, you must write to us rejecting it. You must do this within two months of the date we issue our NOR. The dispute will usually then proceed to the conference stage. 17 Part 4 – Preparing your statement of position Purpose of the statement of position If Inland Revenue issues you with a disclosure notice, you must issue a statement of position. The statement of position is your formal and final notification of what adjustments you consider should be made and why. It’s important because if the dispute can not be resolved and ultimately goes to court, only those issues and propositions of law raised in the statements of position can be raised in challenge. This is the exclusion rule mentioned on page 10. Format of the statement of position We strongly recommend you get professional advice before completing your statement of position. When you respond with your statement of position you must do so in the prescribed format. You can use either our Statement of position (SOP) - IR773 form or create your own statement of position. However, we recommend you at least follow the format of our form to make sure you meet all the requirements. The statement of position must contain the following details: • • the date of issue • • your name and IRD number • • your address and preferred contact details (phone, email, fax or post). The second part of the statement of position must contain the: • • outline of the facts relied on • • outline of the documentary evidence in support of the facts • • outline of the issues arising • • propositions of law relied on. Completing the statement of position Date of issue Show the date the statement of position is issued (sent) to Inland Revenue. IRD number of taxpayer Show your IRD number here. If the adjustment is for a company, partnership or other organisation, show the IRD number of the organisation. Full name of taxpayer Show your full name here. If the adjustment is for a company, partnership or other organisation, show the name of the organisation. 18DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Address and contact details Show your contact address, phone, email and fax numbers here. If the adjustment is for a company, partnership or other organisation, show their contact details. If you have an agent or would like to be contacted at a different address from your postal address, show how and where you would like to be contacted. Outline of the facts relied on Set out the facts on which you intend to rely. This should be similar to the information on your NOPA. Outline of the documentary evidence relied on Set out the documentary evidence that you would intend to rely on if the case were to proceed to court. State the type and date of the document (if known) and any other unique identifying factor. Where the evidence is oral, it’s not necessary to give the name of the witness who may give evidence for you if the matter proceeds to court, but you should still identify the evidence the witness may be giving.. Outline of the issues arising State the legal questions arising from the proposed adjustments (these are what the court is being asked to decide about), including the application of the laws the proposed adjustment is based on. State the relevant sections of the legislation if possible. You may raise several issues about one proposed adjustment. The propositions of law relied on List the propositions of law you consider support your proposed adjustment, along with any case authorities from which those propositions arise. A proposition of law is a statement about the application or interpretation of the law. It may be based on statutes or case law, or other opinion. Propositions of law may also include a statement on the application or interpretation of law that has not been considered by the courts before. Wherever possible, you should state the authority for the proposition of law relied on, for example, the particular case it is drawn from. 19 Finalising and sending your statement of position We strongly recommend you seek professional advice before finalising your statement of position. Once you have completed your statement of position, send or deliver it to the Inland Revenue staff member you’ve been dealing with. Send it to them as soon as you’ve completed it so they can consider it fully and send a reply back to you within the two-month response period. You can add information to your statement of position at any time if we agree. We’ll only approve this in limited circumstances, for example, the Commissioner will consider the materiality and relevance of the additional information in its capacity to resolve the dispute. Note You must issue your statement of position within two months of the date we issued the disclosure notice. If you do not meet this deadline your statement of position can not be accepted, unless exceptional circumstances apply (page 11). Once Inland Revenue receives your statement of position As soon as we receive your statement of position we’ll generally acknowledge it by letter. The staff member who sent you the disclosure notice will consider the points made in your statement of position and determine if the adjustment you have requested is allowed under the legislation. If they decide that your adjustment is allowed under the legislation we’ll tell you that your adjustment has been accepted, and make an amended assessment in due course. If they still do not agree with your proposed adjustment we’ll send you a statement of position. This will be issued within two months of the date of issue of your statement of position. If you disagree with the statement of position, the matter will be referred to an adjudicator. We may seek your agreement to add information to the statement of position at any time. An example of when we may ask to do this is if there has been an additional conference after the statements of position have been issued. Part 5 gives details of which court your dispute may go to if the adjudicator rejects your position. 20DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Part 5 – The courts Here we talk about the courts and tribunals which you may take your dispute to if you do not accept all or part of the adjudicator’s decision. We also explain your rights of appeal if you disagree with a decision of the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) or High Court.

Most people have their challenge heard before the TRA for the following reasons. • • The TRA is less formal than the High Court. • • The cost is generally lower than for hearings in the High Court. • • The less formal nature of the TRA means you may more easily present your challenge yourself. • • Costs are not usually awarded, but in certain circumstances the TRA can award costs to the parties involved in the dispute. • • TRA hearings are not open to the public. • • The TRA judges are tax specialists. • • In certain circumstances the filing fee may be waived, remitted or refunded in full or in part, on application to the Registrar of the Authority. Challenging the adjudicator’s decision You may wish to challenge the adjudicator’s decision under the TRA’s jurisdiction. Features of the jurisdiction are: • • no limit on tax in dispute • • decisions are published without disclosing taxpayer details • • decisions may be appealed. There is a filing fee for lodging a notice of claim in the TRA jurisdiction. In certain circumstances this fee may be waived by the TRA. The High Court The High Court is more formal than the TRA. Hearings are open to the public and the Court may award costs. You may present your challenge to the High Court yourself, although we recommend you get professional legal assistance as a knowledge of court procedures is important. Companies, however must have a legal representative. Decisions the TRA or High Court can make After hearing your dispute, the TRA or High Court will make one of these decisions: • • allow your challenge in full • • allow it in part • • disallow it • • reduce the assessment. 22DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Your appeal rights if the decision goes against you If you disagree with a TRA or High Court decision, you may appeal against it to a higher authority if you have sufficient grounds. We have the same appeal rights. Appealing a decision TRA decisions You can appeal a decision of the TRA to the High Court, as long as it involves: • • a question of law, or • • a question of fact, if the amount of disputed tax, duty or tax credit is $2,000 or more, or if the amount of disputed loss is $4,000 or more. If you want to appeal a TRA decision to the High Court, you must lodge a notice of appeal in the High Court within 20 working days after the date of the decision. Copies must be served on the TRA and Inland Revenue (go to page 25 for contact details). If your case does not meet any of the conditions shown above, the TRA decision is final. High Court decisions You can appeal a High Court decision to the Court of Appeal. If you want to do this, you must lodge a notice of appeal in the Court of Appeal within 20 working days after the date of the decision. Copies must be served on the High Court and Inland Revenue (go to page 25 for contact details). Court of Appeal decisions An appeal to the Supreme Court is allowed only with the leave of the Supreme Court. There is no monetary limit, but leave will be granted only in matters of general public importance or if it’s of general commercial significance. The final decision The final decision will be: • • a court decision that can not be appealed, or • • a decision that neither you nor Inland Revenue decide to appeal within the required timeframes. The timetable on page 34 explains the sequence and timing for appealing court decisions. 23 Part 6 – Court proceedings Filing proceedings with the TRA If you wish to challenge an assessment or a disputable decision that is not an assessment under the TRA’s jurisdiction, you must prepare and file a notice of claim outlining your case. You must do this within two months of the issue date of: • • the adjudicator’s decision • • an assessment or amended assessment that is based on the adjudicator’s decision, whichever is appropriate in your circumstances. Your notice of claim must be prepared in the format set out in the Taxation Review Authority Regulations 1998. When you file the notice of claim under the TRA’s jurisdiction, you must also provide three copies and pay a filing fee to the TRA (go to page 25 for contact details for the TRA). In certain circumstances the TRA may waive the fee. Once you have filed your notice of claim with the TRA you must also personally serve a copy of the notice on Inland Revenue (refer to “Service of proceedings” on page 25). Directions conference and hearings in the TRA Following the filing of your notice of claim and our notice of defence and before a TRA judge hears your case, there must be a preliminary directions hearing at a place and time appointed by the TRA. At this hearing the TRA will want to know various details including how long Inland Revenue and you (or your agent) think the hearing will last. Both you (or your agent) and Inland Revenue must attend the directions hearing. If you do not attend, your challenge is deemed to be withdrawn unless you later get the leave of the TRA to proceed with the hearing. The TRA may permit you and/or Inland Revenue to attend by way of a telephone conference. As soon as possible after the directions hearing, the TRA will send to your “address for service” a notice recording its directions. If no date for your challenge has been set at that hearing, either you or Inland Revenue may then ask the TRA to set a date for your challenge to be heard. The TRA will then send you a notice that sets a time and date for the hearing. At the hearing, you may present your challenge personally or be represented by a solicitor, accountant, or other person of your choice. However, the TRA suggests it’s in your own interests to seek professional assistance to present your challenge, especially if questions of law are involved. TRA hearings are not open to the public, and in most cases costs are not awarded. The exception to this is if either party does not appear at the hearing, or abandons or settles the dispute without giving adequate notice. The TRA can also award costs if it dismisses a challenge as being frivolous, vexatious or for the purposes of delay. The TRA may also award costs for filing fees in certain circumstances. After a hearing the TRA will issue its written decision and send you a copy. 24DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Filing proceedings in the High Court High Court challenges must also be filed within two months of the issue date of: • • the adjudicator’s decision • • an assessment or amended assessment based on the adjudicator’s decision, whichever is appropriate in your circumstances. Your statement of claim must describe your course of action, in sufficient detail, to clearly inform the Court and Inland Revenue about the facts of your claim. It’s not essential, but we strongly recommend you get professional assistance. If we issued a disclosure notice as part of the disputes process, your statement of claim may not refer to any facts, propositions of law or issues not disclosed in the statements of position. File your statement of claim in the Registry of the High Court closest to where you live. A notice of proceeding, in the format prescribed by the High Court rules, must be filed along with every statement of claim. As set out in the High Court schedule of charges, there is also a filing fee payable. Once your statement of claim and notice of proceeding have been filed with the Court, you must personally serve a copy on the Legal Services of Inland Revenue (refer to “Service of proceedings” on page 25). We must file a statement of defence and serve it on you within 30 days of the date your statement of claim and notice of proceedings was served. The statement of defence either admits or denies the allegations of fact in the statement of claim. It also sets out any further facts we consider are relevant to the issues, and the issues that we require to be determined by the Court. We’re also limited to those issues and propositions of law disclosed in the statements of position under the disclosure notice procedure. Proving your position It’s up to you to prove your position. Whether you’ve taken your case to the TRA or the High Court, you must prove: • • the assessment or other disputable decision is wrong • • why the assessment or other disputable decision is wrong • • the amount by which the assessment or other disputable decision is wrong. This is called the “burden of proof ”. If we issued a disclosure notice as part of the disputes process you can refer only to those issues and propositions of law you disclosed in your statement of position. If your dispute is about shortfall penalties for evasion or a similar act we have charged, we have to prove the assessment is correct. In this situation our evidence is presented first at the hearing and it’s not your responsibility to prove our assessment is wrong. 25 Contact details for the Taxation Review Authority • • Postal Taxation Review Authority Tribunals Unit Ministry of Justice Private Bag 32001 Panama Street Wellington 6146 • • Delivery Taxation Review Authority Tribunals Unit Level One AMP Building 86 Customhouse Quay Wellington 6011 Service of proceedings All proceedings in the TRA and High Court must be served on Inland Revenue in one of the following ways: • • Postal Legal Services Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 • • Delivery Legal Services Inland Revenue Level 5 Asteron House 55 Featherston Street Wellington 6011 26DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Part 7 – Test cases Sometimes, when there are several court proceedings about the same issue, we’ll designate one of them as a test case to decide the issue for all of them. If there are several cases similar to yours, we may decide to designate your case as a test case to be heard in the High Court. If we decide to do this, we’ll notify you of this decision and request the case be transferred to the High Court if filed in the TRA. If you file proceedings for your case to be heard before the TRA or the High Court, we may tell you there is a test case already before the Courts and that we wish to “stay” (delay) your case until the test case is settled. This will only happen if we consider the test case is likely to determine all or most of the issues in your case. Your case can be stayed after you have filed your notice of claim or statement of claim with the TRA or the High Court, respectively. If you do not want your case delayed until the test case is decided, you can write to us saying you want your challenge to proceed. It will then carry on unless we get an order from the High Court. If we stay your case pending the outcome of a test case, we’ll tell you the outcome of that test case. You may accept that decision, or you may continue with your challenge. 27 Part 8 – Paying the tax in dispute When you have a dispute, the amount of your tax calculation will usually be different from the amount assessed. The difference between your calculation and the assessment is called the “tax in dispute”. If you start the disputes resolution process, initially you must still pay all your tax, including the tax in dispute, by the due date on the assessment. However, if we notify you that we disagree with your position before the due date, and you decide to take your case to court, you may defer payment of the tax in dispute (if any) while the dispute is being resolved. If you have already paid all the tax in dispute (either directly to Inland Revenue or through your PAYE deductions), you can ask us to refund it to you. Note If you defer payment of tax in dispute, use-of-money interest continues to be charged and is payable should part or all of the original assessment be confirmed. The tax in dispute you can defer paying until the TRA or the courts decide your challenge is called “deferrable tax”. When the adjudicator writes to tell you they disagree with your position, they will also tell you what the deferrable tax amount is. If we consider there is a risk you will not pay the tax in dispute if your challenge in the court is unsuccessful, you can be required to pay the tax in dispute. We will not refund any tax in dispute already paid. Note Provisional tax You may be calculating your provisional tax for the following year based on your residual income tax (RIT) for the year you are making the challenge for. In this situation, you can not reduce your provisional tax to take into account the tax in dispute – you must base it on the calculation of your RIT. Where Inland Revenue makes an assessment to increase a taxpayer’s RIT after the due date for payment, it will be treated as not having been increased for provisional tax purposes. Unsuccessful challenges When the deferrable tax is due If your challenge was unsuccessful you must pay the deferrable tax by the 30th day after what’s called “the day of determination of final liability”. This means the day the final result of your challenge is settled, and is the latest of: • • the day we receive written notice from you to advise that you are withdrawing your challenge • • the day the TRA, High Court, Court of Appeal or Supreme Court makes the final decision on the challenge • • the day you receive written notice from us to say we’re withdrawing our defence to your challenge. 28DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Interest payable If a challenge is unsuccessful, they’ll be interest due on any deferrable tax you have not paid. The amount of interest payable is calculated for each day in the interest period using this formula: T × R 365 Where: T is the unpaid tax which interest is payable on R is your paying rate applying on the day – check out our website for the current rate. Late payment penalties If you have not paid the deferrable tax plus the interest calculated under this formula 30 days after the day of determination of final liability, a further late payment penalty may be added to the outstanding amount as follows. We will charge you a late payment penalty if you miss a payment, but if you have a good payment history with us we may contact you before we do this. Otherwise, we’ll charge an initial 1% late payment penalty on the day after the due date. We’ll charge a further 4% penalty if there’s still an amount of unpaid tax (including penalties) seven days after the due date. Every month the amount owing remains unpaid after the due date a further 1% incremental penalty may be charged. Go to ird.govt.nz/penalties for more information. Non-payment of employer deductions If your deferrable tax is from Employment information which is subject to non-payment penalties, and is not paid by 30 days after the day of determination of final liability, we’ll send you a reminder letter. If the overdue amount is not paid or an instalment arrangement agreed to, we will charge you a 10% employer’s withholding payment penalty. Every month an amount remains outstanding a further 10% penalty will be charged. If, after we’ve imposed the penalty, you pay in full or enter into an instalment arrangement, the last penalty is reduced to 5%. 29 Successful challenges Interest payable by Inland Revenue If your challenge is successful, Inland Revenue refunds any tax in dispute you paid and also pays you interest on it. Interest is calculated for each day in the interest period using this formula: T × R 365 Where: T is the overpaid tax interest is payable on R Inland Revenue’s paying rate applying on the day – check out our website for the current rate. For all years, the interest period ends on the earlier of: • • the date the tax is refunded • • the date the tax is transferred to another account • • the date you can claim the refund. Note We will not pay or charge interest or penalties if the overpaid/underpaid amount is $100 or less. Any interest you receive is taxable income, so you must include it in your tax return the year you receive it. For more information on interest and penalties check our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. 30DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Part 9 – Other assessments and decisions you may dispute There are many types of decisions by Inland Revenue you can dispute – however, we will usually issue a NOPA before making either an amended assessment or a disputable decision you are likely to disagree with. If we do issue you with a NOPA you disagree with, the disputes process is slightly different to that described in this guide. For more information, see our guide Disputing a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) - IR777. The following pages cover some of the types of assessments or disputable decisions you may dispute. Income tax assessments Income tax assessments are the most common type Inland Revenue issues or acknowledges. They cover: • • income tax • • Working for Families Tax Credits • • fringe benefit tax. Note This is not a complete list of the types of assessment you may dispute. Income tax decisions There are a number of Inland Revenue decisions about income tax you can dispute. Examples include: • • whether a natural person is a New Zealand tax resident • • disputing an assessment on the grounds that a PAYE determination is incorrect in law or fact. International tax The procedures are the same as for disputing an income tax assessment. If you disagree with an assessment of income tax, including attributed controlled foreign company (CFC) or foreign investment fund (FIF) income, as part of your self-assessment, you should dispute the assessment. 31 Goods and services tax (GST) You may dispute GST assessments of tax payable or refunds, including your self-assessment, if we have not issued a NOPA for the assessment. You may also dispute certain decisions we make about GST and ask them to be reviewed. These include decisions about: • • a registered person’s request to change GST taxable periods • • details of a tax invoice • • whether a person must register for GST, or the cancellation of a GST registration • • group registrations • • a registered person’s accounting basis. There are some Inland Revenue decisions you may not dispute. These include decisions about: • • late payment penalties • • refunds, relief from GST, late filing penalties and recovery of GST • • the effective start date for certain categories of taxpayers • • varying the due date of returns • • record keeping. If you’re issuing a NOPA to your self-assessment you must do so within four months of the date your return is received by Inland Revenue – the self-assessment date. You’ll find this on the return acknowledgment form we sent you after processing your return. If you’re issuing a NOPA in response to an assessment made by Inland Revenue you must send it to us within four months of the date of issue of the notice of assessment. 32DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Student loans Studylink transactions If you disagree with any Studylink transactions, send a written objection explaining why you disagree, to: Student Loan Manager Studylink Centre Freepost 113907 Private Bag 11070 Palmerston North The loan manager must receive your objection within 31 days of the date you are notified. The loan manager will consider your objection and notify you whether or not it has been allowed. If you disagree with the loan manager’s decision, you can ask for your objection to be considered by the Chief Executive of the Ministry of Social Development. You must request this in writing within 21 days of the loan manager’s decision. Send your objection to: The Chief Executive Ministry of Social Development PO Box 1556 Wellington The Ministry of Social Development (MSD) will write to you with a decision. If you do not agree with that decision, you can apply to the Disputes Tribunal or District Court to have your objection decided. You must do this within 30 days of MSD’s decision. For more information on disputes, read the Review and Appeal process on the StudyLink website www.studylink.govt.nz Inland Revenue transactions Borrowers If you disagree with any Inland Revenue transactions, you may dispute any of the following: • • a repayment obligation (assessment) • • your student loan balance • • a disputable decision, eg, your New Zealand based or overseas based borrower status, outcome of an application for a student loan special deduction rate or student loan repayment deduction exemption, decision on a significant under- or over-deduction, and decision on relief • • interest charged • • penalties charged. The disputes procedures are the same as for income tax assessments for borrowers. 33 Employers If you disagree, you can dispute: • • your repayment deduction amount • • any penalties charged on your account • • any interest charged on your account. The disputes procedures for employers are the same as for PAYE. Note The interest on deferred tax in dispute (page 28) only applies to deferred amounts of repayment deductions, penalties, penal assessments and penal charges. Deferred amounts of student loan assessments will continue to attract the normal interest chargeable on any amount of loan balance not overdue. Child support Paying parents and custodians The process for objecting to child support assessments is different from the process described in this guide. If you wish to object to the amount of child support you have to pay you should first lodge a notice of objection with us. Our guideHelping you to understand child support - IR100 explains how to do this. If you still wish to challenge our decision, you will need to apply to the Family Court. Our guide Helping you to understand child support and the Family court - IR174 explains how to do this. Employers If you disagree, you can challenge your deduction determination. The disputes procedures are the same as for income tax assessments for paying parents and custodians, and as for PAYE determinations for employers. Note The interest on deferred tax in dispute only applies to deferred amounts of deductions and penalties. Shortfall penalties We may charge you shortfall penalties if you failed to meet your tax obligations. We usually issue a NOPA (notice of proposed adjustment) before assessing for shortfall penalties, but if we do not, you can dispute the assessment. Gift duty The gift duty disputes procedures are the same as those for income tax. 34DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Part 10 – Time limits for disputing an assessment The following table summarises the time limits for each step you must take to go right through the disputes process. The earlier parts of this guide explain in detail what you must do and how much time you have for each step. Decision you wish to appeal Action Time limit you must meet Where to lodge your action Inland Revenue issues a notice of assessment or you want to make an adjustment to your self-assessment Furnish the return then issue a NOPA Four months from the relevant date on the notice Inland Revenue Inland Revenue issues a notice of response Reject the notice of response in writing Two months from the date on the notice of response Inland Revenue Inland Revenue issues a disclosure notice File your statement of position Two months from the date on the disclosure notice Inland Revenue Inland Revenue confirms the assessment You can file proceedings with the TRA or the High Court Two months from the date of rejection of your adjustment TRA or High Court, as appropriate Decision of TRAYou can appeal a TRA decision to the High Court 20 working days from when the TRA issues its written decision High Court High Court decisionYou can appeal the High Court decision to the Court of Appeal 20 working days from when the High Court delivers it written decision Court of Appeal Court of Appeal decision You may be able to appeal the Court of Appeal’s decision to the Supreme Court 20 working days from when the Court of Appeal delivers its written decision Supreme Court Note If your dispute relates solely to a research and development tax credit claim, different time limits apply. See the R&D tax credit information at ird.govt.nz/research-development 35 Before you begin Planning, preparation and presentation is very important. These points below will help you. Make yourself clear Prepare your notices in a way that is clear and easy to understand. Know your purpose The aim of your dispute should be to prove the assessment (or decision) is incorrect. You must know: • • details of the items you intend to adjust • • the facts and laws (including tax laws) that support the adjustment you’re proposing • • how the law applies to the facts • • the evidence you intend to rely on. Know your time limits There are timeframes throughout the disputes resolution process you must meet if your dispute is to succeed. Late actions will be accepted only in exceptional circumstances. Know when your payments are due Read Part 8 of this guide about paying the tax in dispute. Progression For each step you decide to take in the disputes resolution process, check you’ve made all the necessary preparations. Professional assistance We recommend you get independent advice from an accountant or other professional tax advisor if you wish to proceed with your dispute. This is especially important if complex issues are involved. Because of the nature of the disputes resolution process, Inland Revenue staff can not help you to prepare your NOPA, NOR, statement of position or any other documents for use in a dispute. 36DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT For more help Need to speak with us?

IR776 December 2023 Disputing an assessment What to do if you dispute an assessment 2DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Introduction While we make every effort to apply the tax laws fairly and correctly, there may be a time when you disagree with your tax assessment. If that happens, this guide explains what you need to know and what options you have to resolve the disagreement. Where you disagree with the amount assessed, there is a process to follow so your rights are protected. This process is important, because your dispute may have to be heard by a court if you and Inland Revenue are unable to resolve it. In all cases we try to reach an agreement with you before there is a need for you to dispute an assessment formally. There are times when Inland Revenue may make an assessment without first sending a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA). These include, but are not limited to: • • When an assessment is amended with agreement between Inland Revenue and a taxpayer to correct a tax position previously taken by a taxpayer. • • The assessment reflects an agreement reached between Inland Revenue and the taxpayer. • • An assessment is made from the direction of the courts or Taxation Review Authority. • • The assessment results from an income tax assessment. There’s a different dispute procedure if you receive a NOPA from Inland Revenue – for more information see our guide Disputing a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) - IR777. How to use this guide We’ve set out the disputes resolution process from when you first want to dispute an assessment or Inland Revenue decision to what happens after a challenge is resolved in court. In Part 10 there is a summary of the time limits that you must meet in the process, and some important points to remember. Inland Revenue Acts grant various powers and responsibilities to the Commissioner – not to Inland Revenue as an organisation. In practice the Commissioner delegates powers and responsibilities to other Inland Revenue staff. That’s why we’ve used “Inland Revenue” and “we” in this guide to describe action taken in the Commissioner’s name. During the disputes process you may get letters or other documents that use the Commissioner as legal authority. The information in this guide is based on current tax laws. 3 ird.govt.nz Go to our website for information and to use our services and tools. • • Log in or register for myIR - manage your tax and entitlements online. • • Calculators and tools - use our calculators, worksheets and tools, for example, to check your tax code, find filing and payment dates, calculate your student loan repayment. • • Forms and guides - download our forms and guides.

This may then place an assessment in dispute. The disputes resolution process can take some time, and can also include late payment penalties, non- payment penalties and interest. Because of this, we try to settle disagreements before the dispute stage. If you’ve made a simple error in your return, you can: • • correct errors, such as the transposition of numbers or arithmetical mistakes, by telephone or in writing • • self-correct errors – if you have made a small error in a GST return, you may self-correct it in a later period. Late claim of GST If you can not claim GST now (for example, no tax invoice), you can claim it in a future period. You can only make a late GST claim on expenditure incurred in the previous two years. Exceptions to this two-year rule include: • • inability to obtain a tax invoice • • disputed payments for expenditure • • mistakenly treating a supply as non-taxable • • clear mistakes or simple oversights. Make sure you know what’s going on It’s important you understand exactly what any adjustments are for. Ask us for an explanation straightaway in any of these situations. • • You’re not sure about any part of a letter or decision. • • You think an adjustment or an assessment is incorrect. • • You think we’re taking too long to reply. Part 2 explains the disputes resolution process and how to proceed with your dispute. 7 Part 2 – The disputes resolution process and you If your disagreement with Inland Revenue has not been resolved as set out in Part 1, you may want to have your point of view considered through the disputes resolution process that applies to: • • assessments issued under tax legislation, including your self-assessment • • disputable decisions that are not assessments. The procedures do not apply to assessments issued to paying parents under the Child Support Act 1991. In this part we tell you what you must do if you disagree with an assessment. The process is designed to resolve disagreements as quickly as possible by early identification of all issues, disclosure of the facts and evidence, and consultation between you and Inland Revenue. We explain the steps of the disputes procedure and what you must do. If you wish to proceed with a dispute, we recommend you seek independent advice from an accountant or other professional tax advisor. This is especially important if complex issues are involved. Note There are time limits built into the process that apply to you and to Inland Revenue. If you do not respond within the time limits you will have to pay the tax calculated. Part 10 contains a summary of the time limits for disputing an assessment. Steps in the disputes resolution process The disputes resolution process usually goes through the steps set out on the following pages. Sometimes there are special circumstances that mean this is not appropriate. We’ll tell you if we consider the dispute should be handled differently, and how you should proceed. The chart on page 13 summarises these steps. Inland Revenue postal addresses If you know the name and address of the Inland Revenue staff member who is dealing with your case, send all your correspondence and forms to that person. Otherwise use one of the following: ReturnsGeneral correspondence Inland Revenue PO Box 39090 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 Inland Revenue PO Box 39010 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 For a full list of addresses go to ird.govt.nz/contact-us 8DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Notice of proposed adjustment If you’ve received a notice of a tax assessment or decision without first receiving a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) from us, and you disagree, or want to make adjustments to your self-assessment, you must issue us with a NOPA. If you’re sending us a NOPA to your self-assessment you must do so within four months of the date your return is received by Inland Revenue – the self-assessment date. You’ll find this on the return acknowledgment form that we sent you after processing your return. If you’re sending us a NOPA in response to an assessment made by Inland Revenue you must send it to us within four months of the date of issue of the notice of assessment. Note If you have not filed a return for the period of disputed assessment, you can not issue a NOPA. You must file the return along with your NOPA. We’ll accept a late NOPA if there is an exceptional circumstance (page 11). If you do not send us a NOPA within the applicable period you are considered by law to have accepted the assessment or disputable decision. Your NOPA must be in the prescribed format and identify all of the following: • • the proposed adjustment(s) • • the facts and tax laws that support the adjustment you are proposing • • how the law applies to the facts • • the documents you intend to rely on. You can either use a Notice of proposed adjustment - IR770 form or create your own. However, if you choose to create your own document, we recommend you attach the IR770 cover sheet and follow the format of our form as this will help to make sure you meet all the requirements of a NOPA . Part 3 has details on how to complete a NOPA. If Inland Revenue accepts all the contentions in your NOPA we’ll make an amended assessment. However, if we disagree with any part of your proposed adjustment, we’ll issue a notice of response within two months of the date you issued your NOPA. Commissioner’s notice of response Our notice of response (NOR) will state concisely why the proposed adjustment is rejected and specify how it could be altered so agreement is possible. It will contain: • • the facts or legal arguments in your NOPA we disagree with • • why we consider those facts or legal arguments are incorrect • • further facts and legal arguments we rely on • • how the legal arguments apply to the facts • • the quantitative adjustments by which your proposed adjustment could change as a result of the facts and legal arguments we rely on. 9 If you disagree with part or all of the NOR you must write to tell us within two months of the date it was issued. If you do not, you’re considered to have accepted Inland Revenue’s position. If no agreement is reached at this stage, the dispute will usually move to the conference stage. Conference stage The conference is held to identify and clarify the facts and issues, and to allow any disputed facts to be resolved. A conference provides an opportunity for the parties to state the facts and define the issues clearly and concisely. A conference may be in the form of a meeting (or series of meetings), or a phone call. The Inland Revenue staff member you’ve been dealing with will contact you to arrange the conference. They’ll also offer to have a senior Inland Revenue staff member act as facilitator for the conference. The facilitator will have had no previous involvement with the dispute. If no agreement is reached at the conference stage we’ll usually issue a disclosure notice. If all or some of the issues are resolved during the conference, the issues on which the agreement is reached will be recorded and an assessment made if necessary. A disclosure notice will be issued to deal with any issues remaining in dispute. Suspension of a dispute pending a separate test case Provided you and Inland Revenue agree in writing, your dispute can be suspended pending the outcome of a test case in the High Court. For such a dispute to be suspended, the facts and questions of law in the dispute must be significantly similar to those of the court proceeding that has been designated as a test case. Once agreement is reached the dispute is suspended pending the outcome of the test case in the courts and you’re not required to continue with the disputes procedures (for example, you do not have to file a statement of position, or have your dispute considered by our Adjudication Unit). Your dispute is suspended until the earliest of the following occurs: • • the court makes its decision about the test case • • the test case is otherwise resolved • • your dispute is otherwise resolved. If we suspend your dispute pending the outcome of a test case we’ll advise you of the outcome of that test case. If that results in an amended assessment you may accept that assessment, or begin challenge proceedings. Further information about test case court proceedings can be found in Part 7. 10DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Disclosure notice A disclosure notice requires you to send your statement of position to Inland Revenue within two months from the date of issue. Although the disclosure notice is usually issued at the end of the conference stage, it may be issued at any time after the NOPA. You must respond to the disclosure notice within two months of the date of issue unless there is an exceptional circumstance (page 11). If you do not, you are considered to have accepted our NOR and the assessment will be confirmed. If you are considered to have accepted the assessment, you can not challenge it in court. Statement of position Your statement of position must be in the prescribed format, and contain all the following: • • an outline of the facts you intend to rely on • • an outline of the documentary evidence you intend to rely on • • an outline of the issues you consider will arise • • the propositions of law you intend to rely on. When you respond with your statement of position, we have two months to issue our statement of position. It will contain all the following: • • an outline of the facts we intend to rely on • • an outline of the documentary evidence we intend to rely on • • an outline of the issues we consider will arise • • the propositions of law we intend to rely on. Part 4 has more information about completing your statement of position. If there is still a disagreement on some issues at the end of the disclosure stage, the case will usually be sent to our Adjudication Unit for consideration, regardless of the issue or amount of tax involved. Exclusion rule The issuing of a disclosure notice and the two statements of position brings into effect the “exclusion rule”. This rule prevents issues and propositions of law not raised in the statements of position from being raised in any subsequent challenge, unless both sides agree. There is a provision that allows judicial discretion to admit previously undisclosed material in very limited circumstances. Make sure we receive all your correspondence Once you’ve written your NOPA, rejection of Inland Revenue’s NOR or statement of position, either deliver it or post it to us. If you’re posting any of these notices, send them to the staff member you’ve been dealing with. If you do not have a contact name or address, use one of the postal addresses on page 7. 11 Late actions (exceptional circumstances) There are time limits throughout the disputes resolution process that must be met. If you do not take the required action within the applicable timeframe, you are considered by law to have accepted our position unless we consider that exceptions apply. Exceptional circumstances are events outside the control of you or your agent, that could not have been reasonably anticipated. Exceptional circumstances may also arise if we consider the lateness is minimal, or results from one or more statutory holidays falling in the response period. Late actions, such as filing a dispute document late, may be accepted providing you can show your intention to enter into, or continue with, a dispute and you send the required information to Inland Revenue as soon as reasonably practicable. Adjudication The adjudicator is an independent officer from within Inland Revenue who will take a fresh look at the application of the law to the facts of the case. If the adjudicator agrees with Inland Revenue’s position the assessment will be confirmed. The adjudicator will consider the facts, evidence, propositions of law and issues raised in the statements of position. The adjudicator is not an investigator and will not search for missing facts or evidence. Usually the adjudicator will not contact you or the Inland Revenue staff member involved in the dispute, except to clarify a point. If contact is made both parties involved will be advised, and the reasons why contact is necessary outlined. When the adjudicator reaches a decision a copy will be given to you and the staff member involved. If you’re dissatisfied with the adjudicator’s decision you may start proceedings before the TRA or the High Court. You have two months from the date of the notice of assessment or challenge notice to file proceedings. The adjudicator’s decision At the end of the disputes process the adjudicator must make a decision. The decision will be in writing and include a written report giving the grounds for the decision. If your dispute goes to the adjudication stage there are four possible outcomes. 1. The adjudicator fully agrees with your position If the adjudicator agrees in full, you’ll receive an amended notice of assessment to replace the one you disputed. This new assessment will take into account any tax already paid. 2. The adjudicator partly agrees with your position If the adjudicator agrees in part, you’ll receive an amended notice of assessment to replace the one you disputed. This assessment will agree with the parts of your dispute the adjudicator has allowed, but it will not agree with those points they consider are incorrect. 12DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT You may take further steps to continue with the part of your dispute that the adjudicator has disagreed with. There are some specific actions you must take to continue with that part of your dispute. These are explained in Part 6. 3. The adjudicator disagrees with your position If the adjudicator disagrees with all parts of your argument there will be no new assessment, and you’ll receive a letter stating we consider the existing assessment to be correct. If you want to continue with your dispute there are some specific further actions you must take. These are explained in Part 6. 4. The adjudicator can not make a decision If the adjudicator considers both parties have failed to consider an issue or section that could affect the outcome of the dispute, both parties will be advised and the file will be referred back to the staff member handling the case. Continuing your dispute If the adjudicator disagrees with all or part of your position, you’ll receive a letter containing a section similar to: “If you wish to continue with your dispute, you must file proceedings before the Taxation Review Authority or High Court within two months of the date of this letter: The courts have limited authority to accept an application after two months have expired. The only instance in which they may accept a late application is if your application is late due to circumstances completely beyond the control of you or your agent.” Parts 5 and 6 explain the different courts you can have your challenge heard in, and how to take your case to court. Statutory time bars Generally there are set time periods (time bars) for disputing an assessment. In most cases the law does not allow us to proceed with the dispute outside of these time periods. However, time bars can be waived in some circumstances. Waiving the time bar • • The time bar can be waived for a total agreed period or periods of up to 12 months after the expiry of the relevant four-year period, from the date of assessment. • • The time bar can be waived for a further six months from the end of the period referred to above on written notice being given by the taxpayer. • • During the waiver period Inland Revenue must not investigate issues between the taxpayer and Inland Revenue that weren’t identified and known to both parties before the start of the period. 13 Flowchart: Disputes resolution process commenced by you In Inland Revenue’s favour Event Conference Disclosure notice Adjudication Finalisation Inland Revenue issues an assessment Conference takes place Inland Revenue issues disclosure notice and statement of position Inland Revenue amends statement of position to address any new matters in customer’s statement of position Case referred to adjudication Adjudicator determines issues Assessment issued – end of process End of process End of process Assessment issued End of process Assessment issued End of process Assessment issued – taxpayer may challenge in court No No No Ye s Ye s Yes Ye s In customer’s favour In customer’s favour In customer’s favour In Inland Revenue’s favour In Inland Revenue’s favour Customer issues N O PA Customer accepts Inland Revenue’s contentions Ye s No Disputed issues resolved Customer issues statement of position Is issue resolved?

The NOPA must be in the prescribed form and contain the following details: • • the date of issue of the notice • • your name and IRD number • • your address and preferred contact details (phone, email, fax or post). The second part of the NOPA must contain: • • the tax adjustments you propose • • the facts and tax laws that support your adjustments • • how the law applies to the facts • • the documents you intend to rely on. Completing the NOPA Date of issue Show the date the NOPA is issued to Inland Revenue. Full name of taxpayer Show your full name here. If the adjustment is for a company, partnership or other organisation, show the name of the organisation. IRD number of taxpayer Show your IRD number here. If the adjustment is for a company, partnership or other organisation, show the IRD number of the organisation. Address and contact details Show your address and contact details here. If the adjustment is for a company, partnership or other organisation, show the address and contact details of the organisation. If you have an agent or would like to be contacted at a different address from your postal address, show how and where you would like to be contacted. Identify the proposed adjustments Include the tax type, return period and the amount of tax payable or refundable resulting from the adjustment, along with a description of the adjustment required. 15 The facts and laws that support your adjustment Please provide a statement of the facts and laws that you consider make the adjustment necessary in sufficient detail to inform Inland Revenue of the grounds for your proposed adjustment. You should identify the laws that relate to your proposed adjustment. These should refer to the relevant Act (for example, the Income Tax Act 1994, the Income Tax Act 2004, the Income Tax Act 2007 or the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985) and section(s) that support your adjustment. If you do not know the tax laws relevant to your proposed adjustment, please provide as much information about the adjustment as soon as possible so we can establish which section(s) of the relevant Acts apply. Also provide any legal arguments or principles that support your proposed adjustments. This can be any information on the application of the law that relates to your proposed adjustment(s), for example, references to tax laws, court decisions or Inland Revenue policy statements. When referring to a case as support for your proposed adjustment a summary of the applicable legal principle is required. Just referring to a case without the supporting principle could make your NOPA invalid. How the law applies to the facts You must relate the law and the legal principles in support of your proposed adjustments to your factual circumstances to ensure that the facts logically support the proposed adjustments. Documents supporting the adjustment Attach the documents you intend to rely on that are significantly relevant to the issues and that you’re aware of at the time you issue your NOPA. Where the evidence is oral it’s not necessary to give the name of the witnesses who may give evidence for you if the matter proceeds to court. Finalising and sending your NOPA Once you have completed and dated your NOPA, send or deliver it to us straightaway. If you have been in contact with an Inland Revenue staff member about the assessment or other issue you are disputing, address it to that person. Otherwise, send it to one of the postal addresses on page 7. Note You must send us your NOPA within four months of the date your assessment was issued or your self-assessed return was received by Inland Revenue. If you do not meet this deadline your NOPA can not be considered unless exceptional circumstances apply (page 11). If you have not furnished a return and the Commissioner makes a default assessment, you must furnish the outstanding return and send us a NOPA in respect of the default assessment otherwise you can not dispute the Commissioner’s default assessment. 16DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Note If your dispute relates solely to a research and development tax credit claim, different time limits apply. See the R&D tax credit information at ird.govt.nz/research-development Once Inland Revenue receives your NOPA As soon as we receive your NOPA and have confirmed that it’s valid we’ll acknowledge it by letter. If it’s not valid and the NOPA deadline has not passed, we’ll contact you with details of the action you must complete before the deadline expires, to make your NOPA valid. The staff member reviewing your NOPA will consider the points made to determine if the adjustment you have requested is allowed under the legislation. If they decide that your adjustment is allowed we’ll tell you your NOPA has been accepted, and make an amended assessment in due course. If they do not agree with your proposed adjustment we’ll issue a NOR rejecting your proposed adjustment. Inland Revenue’s NOR will outline why we consider that your proposed adjustment can not be accepted. To be valid, Inland Revenue’s NOR must be issued within two months of the date on your NOPA. For example, if your NOPA was sent 10 April 2019, the last date for issuing Inland Revenue’s NOR is 9 June 2019. You may contact us to provide further information in support of the NOPA, provided this is within the response period. If Inland Revenue rejects your NOPA If Inland Revenue rejects your NOPA and you disagree with our NOR, you must write to us rejecting it. You must do this within two months of the date we issue our NOR. The dispute will usually then proceed to the conference stage. 17 Part 4 – Preparing your statement of position Purpose of the statement of position If Inland Revenue issues you with a disclosure notice, you must issue a statement of position. The statement of position is your formal and final notification of what adjustments you consider should be made and why. It’s important because if the dispute can not be resolved and ultimately goes to court, only those issues and propositions of law raised in the statements of position can be raised in challenge. This is the exclusion rule mentioned on page 10. Format of the statement of position We strongly recommend you get professional advice before completing your statement of position. When you respond with your statement of position you must do so in the prescribed format. You can use either our Statement of position (SOP) - IR773 form or create your own statement of position. However, we recommend you at least follow the format of our form to make sure you meet all the requirements. The statement of position must contain the following details: • • the date of issue • • your name and IRD number • • your address and preferred contact details (phone, email, fax or post). The second part of the statement of position must contain the: • • outline of the facts relied on • • outline of the documentary evidence in support of the facts • • outline of the issues arising • • propositions of law relied on. Completing the statement of position Date of issue Show the date the statement of position is issued (sent) to Inland Revenue. IRD number of taxpayer Show your IRD number here. If the adjustment is for a company, partnership or other organisation, show the IRD number of the organisation. Full name of taxpayer Show your full name here. If the adjustment is for a company, partnership or other organisation, show the name of the organisation. 18DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Address and contact details Show your contact address, phone, email and fax numbers here. If the adjustment is for a company, partnership or other organisation, show their contact details. If you have an agent or would like to be contacted at a different address from your postal address, show how and where you would like to be contacted. Outline of the facts relied on Set out the facts on which you intend to rely. This should be similar to the information on your NOPA. Outline of the documentary evidence relied on Set out the documentary evidence that you would intend to rely on if the case were to proceed to court. State the type and date of the document (if known) and any other unique identifying factor. Where the evidence is oral, it’s not necessary to give the name of the witness who may give evidence for you if the matter proceeds to court, but you should still identify the evidence the witness may be giving.. Outline of the issues arising State the legal questions arising from the proposed adjustments (these are what the court is being asked to decide about), including the application of the laws the proposed adjustment is based on. State the relevant sections of the legislation if possible. You may raise several issues about one proposed adjustment. The propositions of law relied on List the propositions of law you consider support your proposed adjustment, along with any case authorities from which those propositions arise. A proposition of law is a statement about the application or interpretation of the law. It may be based on statutes or case law, or other opinion. Propositions of law may also include a statement on the application or interpretation of law that has not been considered by the courts before. Wherever possible, you should state the authority for the proposition of law relied on, for example, the particular case it is drawn from. 19 Finalising and sending your statement of position We strongly recommend you seek professional advice before finalising your statement of position. Once you have completed your statement of position, send or deliver it to the Inland Revenue staff member you’ve been dealing with. Send it to them as soon as you’ve completed it so they can consider it fully and send a reply back to you within the two-month response period. You can add information to your statement of position at any time if we agree. We’ll only approve this in limited circumstances, for example, the Commissioner will consider the materiality and relevance of the additional information in its capacity to resolve the dispute. Note You must issue your statement of position within two months of the date we issued the disclosure notice. If you do not meet this deadline your statement of position can not be accepted, unless exceptional circumstances apply (page 11). Once Inland Revenue receives your statement of position As soon as we receive your statement of position we’ll generally acknowledge it by letter. The staff member who sent you the disclosure notice will consider the points made in your statement of position and determine if the adjustment you have requested is allowed under the legislation. If they decide that your adjustment is allowed under the legislation we’ll tell you that your adjustment has been accepted, and make an amended assessment in due course. If they still do not agree with your proposed adjustment we’ll send you a statement of position. This will be issued within two months of the date of issue of your statement of position. If you disagree with the statement of position, the matter will be referred to an adjudicator. We may seek your agreement to add information to the statement of position at any time. An example of when we may ask to do this is if there has been an additional conference after the statements of position have been issued. Part 5 gives details of which court your dispute may go to if the adjudicator rejects your position. 20DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Part 5 – The courts Here we talk about the courts and tribunals which you may take your dispute to if you do not accept all or part of the adjudicator’s decision. We also explain your rights of appeal if you disagree with a decision of the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) or High Court. Exclusion rule applies – either party must apply under judicial discretion if they want to introduce material not disclosed in statements of position Customer files notice of claim in TRA End of process No Ye s Ye s Customer decides to challenge Assessment or decision issued No Customer files statement of claim in High Court Inland Revenue files notice of defence Inland Revenue files statement of defence Was a disclosure notice issued? Exclusion rule does not apply – argument in court limited to grounds of challenge Hearing Decision Assessment confirmed or amended From TRA jurisdiction or High Court, unsuccessful party may consider an appeal From TRA, end of process This chart shows an overview of court procedures. 21 The Taxation Review Authority (TRA) The TRA is totally independent of Inland Revenue and is based in Wellington, but it travels to other areas so that cases can be heard as close as possible to where you live. Most people have their challenge heard before the TRA for the following reasons. • • The TRA is less formal than the High Court. • • The cost is generally lower than for hearings in the High Court. • • The less formal nature of the TRA means you may more easily present your challenge yourself. • • Costs are not usually awarded, but in certain circumstances the TRA can award costs to the parties involved in the dispute. • • TRA hearings are not open to the public. • • The TRA judges are tax specialists. • • In certain circumstances the filing fee may be waived, remitted or refunded in full or in part, on application to the Registrar of the Authority. Challenging the adjudicator’s decision You may wish to challenge the adjudicator’s decision under the TRA’s jurisdiction. Features of the jurisdiction are: • • no limit on tax in dispute • • decisions are published without disclosing taxpayer details • • decisions may be appealed. There is a filing fee for lodging a notice of claim in the TRA jurisdiction. In certain circumstances this fee may be waived by the TRA. The High Court The High Court is more formal than the TRA. Hearings are open to the public and the Court may award costs. You may present your challenge to the High Court yourself, although we recommend you get professional legal assistance as a knowledge of court procedures is important. Companies, however must have a legal representative. Decisions the TRA or High Court can make After hearing your dispute, the TRA or High Court will make one of these decisions: • • allow your challenge in full • • allow it in part • • disallow it • • reduce the assessment. 22DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Your appeal rights if the decision goes against you If you disagree with a TRA or High Court decision, you may appeal against it to a higher authority if you have sufficient grounds. We have the same appeal rights. Appealing a decision TRA decisions You can appeal a decision of the TRA to the High Court, as long as it involves: • • a question of law, or • • a question of fact, if the amount of disputed tax, duty or tax credit is $2,000 or more, or if the amount of disputed loss is $4,000 or more. If you want to appeal a TRA decision to the High Court, you must lodge a notice of appeal in the High Court within 20 working days after the date of the decision. Copies must be served on the TRA and Inland Revenue (go to page 25 for contact details). If your case does not meet any of the conditions shown above, the TRA decision is final. High Court decisions You can appeal a High Court decision to the Court of Appeal. If you want to do this, you must lodge a notice of appeal in the Court of Appeal within 20 working days after the date of the decision. Copies must be served on the High Court and Inland Revenue (go to page 25 for contact details). Court of Appeal decisions An appeal to the Supreme Court is allowed only with the leave of the Supreme Court. There is no monetary limit, but leave will be granted only in matters of general public importance or if it’s of general commercial significance. The final decision The final decision will be: • • a court decision that can not be appealed, or • • a decision that neither you nor Inland Revenue decide to appeal within the required timeframes. The timetable on page 34 explains the sequence and timing for appealing court decisions. 23 Part 6 – Court proceedings Filing proceedings with the TRA If you wish to challenge an assessment or a disputable decision that is not an assessment under the TRA’s jurisdiction, you must prepare and file a notice of claim outlining your case. You must do this within two months of the issue date of: • • the adjudicator’s decision • • an assessment or amended assessment that is based on the adjudicator’s decision, whichever is appropriate in your circumstances. Your notice of claim must be prepared in the format set out in the Taxation Review Authority Regulations 1998. When you file the notice of claim under the TRA’s jurisdiction, you must also provide three copies and pay a filing fee to the TRA (go to page 25 for contact details for the TRA). In certain circumstances the TRA may waive the fee. Once you have filed your notice of claim with the TRA you must also personally serve a copy of the notice on Inland Revenue (refer to “Service of proceedings” on page 25). Directions conference and hearings in the TRA Following the filing of your notice of claim and our notice of defence and before a TRA judge hears your case, there must be a preliminary directions hearing at a place and time appointed by the TRA. At this hearing the TRA will want to know various details including how long Inland Revenue and you (or your agent) think the hearing will last. Both you (or your agent) and Inland Revenue must attend the directions hearing. If you do not attend, your challenge is deemed to be withdrawn unless you later get the leave of the TRA to proceed with the hearing. The TRA may permit you and/or Inland Revenue to attend by way of a telephone conference. As soon as possible after the directions hearing, the TRA will send to your “address for service” a notice recording its directions. If no date for your challenge has been set at that hearing, either you or Inland Revenue may then ask the TRA to set a date for your challenge to be heard. The TRA will then send you a notice that sets a time and date for the hearing. At the hearing, you may present your challenge personally or be represented by a solicitor, accountant, or other person of your choice. However, the TRA suggests it’s in your own interests to seek professional assistance to present your challenge, especially if questions of law are involved. TRA hearings are not open to the public, and in most cases costs are not awarded. The exception to this is if either party does not appear at the hearing, or abandons or settles the dispute without giving adequate notice. The TRA can also award costs if it dismisses a challenge as being frivolous, vexatious or for the purposes of delay. The TRA may also award costs for filing fees in certain circumstances. After a hearing the TRA will issue its written decision and send you a copy. 24DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Filing proceedings in the High Court High Court challenges must also be filed within two months of the issue date of: • • the adjudicator’s decision • • an assessment or amended assessment based on the adjudicator’s decision, whichever is appropriate in your circumstances. Your statement of claim must describe your course of action, in sufficient detail, to clearly inform the Court and Inland Revenue about the facts of your claim. It’s not essential, but we strongly recommend you get professional assistance. If we issued a disclosure notice as part of the disputes process, your statement of claim may not refer to any facts, propositions of law or issues not disclosed in the statements of position. File your statement of claim in the Registry of the High Court closest to where you live. A notice of proceeding, in the format prescribed by the High Court rules, must be filed along with every statement of claim. As set out in the High Court schedule of charges, there is also a filing fee payable. Once your statement of claim and notice of proceeding have been filed with the Court, you must personally serve a copy on the Legal Services of Inland Revenue (refer to “Service of proceedings” on page 25). We must file a statement of defence and serve it on you within 30 days of the date your statement of claim and notice of proceedings was served. The statement of defence either admits or denies the allegations of fact in the statement of claim. It also sets out any further facts we consider are relevant to the issues, and the issues that we require to be determined by the Court. We’re also limited to those issues and propositions of law disclosed in the statements of position under the disclosure notice procedure. Proving your position It’s up to you to prove your position. Whether you’ve taken your case to the TRA or the High Court, you must prove: • • the assessment or other disputable decision is wrong • • why the assessment or other disputable decision is wrong • • the amount by which the assessment or other disputable decision is wrong. This is called the “burden of proof ”. If we issued a disclosure notice as part of the disputes process you can refer only to those issues and propositions of law you disclosed in your statement of position. If your dispute is about shortfall penalties for evasion or a similar act we have charged, we have to prove the assessment is correct. In this situation our evidence is presented first at the hearing and it’s not your responsibility to prove our assessment is wrong. 25 Contact details for the Taxation Review Authority • • Postal Taxation Review Authority Tribunals Unit Ministry of Justice Private Bag 32001 Panama Street Wellington 6146 • • Delivery Taxation Review Authority Tribunals Unit Level One AMP Building 86 Customhouse Quay Wellington 6011 Service of proceedings All proceedings in the TRA and High Court must be served on Inland Revenue in one of the following ways: • • Postal Legal Services Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 • • Delivery Legal Services Inland Revenue Level 5 Asteron House 55 Featherston Street Wellington 6011 26DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Part 7 – Test cases Sometimes, when there are several court proceedings about the same issue, we’ll designate one of them as a test case to decide the issue for all of them. If there are several cases similar to yours, we may decide to designate your case as a test case to be heard in the High Court. If we decide to do this, we’ll notify you of this decision and request the case be transferred to the High Court if filed in the TRA. If you file proceedings for your case to be heard before the TRA or the High Court, we may tell you there is a test case already before the Courts and that we wish to “stay” (delay) your case until the test case is settled. This will only happen if we consider the test case is likely to determine all or most of the issues in your case. Your case can be stayed after you have filed your notice of claim or statement of claim with the TRA or the High Court, respectively. If you do not want your case delayed until the test case is decided, you can write to us saying you want your challenge to proceed. It will then carry on unless we get an order from the High Court. If we stay your case pending the outcome of a test case, we’ll tell you the outcome of that test case. You may accept that decision, or you may continue with your challenge. 27 Part 8 – Paying the tax in dispute When you have a dispute, the amount of your tax calculation will usually be different from the amount assessed. The difference between your calculation and the assessment is called the “tax in dispute”. If you start the disputes resolution process, initially you must still pay all your tax, including the tax in dispute, by the due date on the assessment. However, if we notify you that we disagree with your position before the due date, and you decide to take your case to court, you may defer payment of the tax in dispute (if any) while the dispute is being resolved. If you have already paid all the tax in dispute (either directly to Inland Revenue or through your PAYE deductions), you can ask us to refund it to you. Note If you defer payment of tax in dispute, use-of-money interest continues to be charged and is payable should part or all of the original assessment be confirmed. The tax in dispute you can defer paying until the TRA or the courts decide your challenge is called “deferrable tax”. When the adjudicator writes to tell you they disagree with your position, they will also tell you what the deferrable tax amount is. If we consider there is a risk you will not pay the tax in dispute if your challenge in the court is unsuccessful, you can be required to pay the tax in dispute. We will not refund any tax in dispute already paid. Note Provisional tax You may be calculating your provisional tax for the following year based on your residual income tax (RIT) for the year you are making the challenge for. In this situation, you can not reduce your provisional tax to take into account the tax in dispute – you must base it on the calculation of your RIT. Where Inland Revenue makes an assessment to increase a taxpayer’s RIT after the due date for payment, it will be treated as not having been increased for provisional tax purposes. Unsuccessful challenges When the deferrable tax is due If your challenge was unsuccessful you must pay the deferrable tax by the 30th day after what’s called “the day of determination of final liability”. This means the day the final result of your challenge is settled, and is the latest of: • • the day we receive written notice from you to advise that you are withdrawing your challenge • • the day the TRA, High Court, Court of Appeal or Supreme Court makes the final decision on the challenge • • the day you receive written notice from us to say we’re withdrawing our defence to your challenge. 28DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Interest payable If a challenge is unsuccessful, they’ll be interest due on any deferrable tax you have not paid. The amount of interest payable is calculated for each day in the interest period using this formula: T × R 365 Where: T is the unpaid tax which interest is payable on R is your paying rate applying on the day – check out our website for the current rate. Late payment penalties If you have not paid the deferrable tax plus the interest calculated under this formula 30 days after the day of determination of final liability, a further late payment penalty may be added to the outstanding amount as follows. We will charge you a late payment penalty if you miss a payment, but if you have a good payment history with us we may contact you before we do this. Otherwise, we’ll charge an initial 1% late payment penalty on the day after the due date. We’ll charge a further 4% penalty if there’s still an amount of unpaid tax (including penalties) seven days after the due date. Every month the amount owing remains unpaid after the due date a further 1% incremental penalty may be charged. Go to ird.govt.nz/penalties for more information. Non-payment of employer deductions If your deferrable tax is from Employment information which is subject to non-payment penalties, and is not paid by 30 days after the day of determination of final liability, we’ll send you a reminder letter. If the overdue amount is not paid or an instalment arrangement agreed to, we will charge you a 10% employer’s withholding payment penalty. Every month an amount remains outstanding a further 10% penalty will be charged. If, after we’ve imposed the penalty, you pay in full or enter into an instalment arrangement, the last penalty is reduced to 5%. 29 Successful challenges Interest payable by Inland Revenue If your challenge is successful, Inland Revenue refunds any tax in dispute you paid and also pays you interest on it. Interest is calculated for each day in the interest period using this formula: T × R 365 Where: T is the overpaid tax interest is payable on R Inland Revenue’s paying rate applying on the day – check out our website for the current rate. For all years, the interest period ends on the earlier of: • • the date the tax is refunded • • the date the tax is transferred to another account • • the date you can claim the refund. Note We will not pay or charge interest or penalties if the overpaid/underpaid amount is $100 or less. Any interest you receive is taxable income, so you must include it in your tax return the year you receive it. For more information on interest and penalties check our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. 30DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Part 9 – Other assessments and decisions you may dispute There are many types of decisions by Inland Revenue you can dispute – however, we will usually issue a NOPA before making either an amended assessment or a disputable decision you are likely to disagree with. If we do issue you with a NOPA you disagree with, the disputes process is slightly different to that described in this guide. For more information, see our guide Disputing a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) - IR777. The following pages cover some of the types of assessments or disputable decisions you may dispute. Income tax assessments Income tax assessments are the most common type Inland Revenue issues or acknowledges. They cover: • • income tax • • Working for Families Tax Credits • • fringe benefit tax. Note This is not a complete list of the types of assessment you may dispute. Income tax decisions There are a number of Inland Revenue decisions about income tax you can dispute. Examples include: • • whether a natural person is a New Zealand tax resident • • disputing an assessment on the grounds that a PAYE determination is incorrect in law or fact. International tax The procedures are the same as for disputing an income tax assessment. If you disagree with an assessment of income tax, including attributed controlled foreign company (CFC) or foreign investment fund (FIF) income, as part of your self-assessment, you should dispute the assessment. 31 Goods and services tax (GST) You may dispute GST assessments of tax payable or refunds, including your self-assessment, if we have not issued a NOPA for the assessment. You may also dispute certain decisions we make about GST and ask them to be reviewed. These include decisions about: • • a registered person’s request to change GST taxable periods • • details of a tax invoice • • whether a person must register for GST, or the cancellation of a GST registration • • group registrations • • a registered person’s accounting basis. There are some Inland Revenue decisions you may not dispute. These include decisions about: • • late payment penalties • • refunds, relief from GST, late filing penalties and recovery of GST • • the effective start date for certain categories of taxpayers • • varying the due date of returns • • record keeping. If you’re issuing a NOPA to your self-assessment you must do so within four months of the date your return is received by Inland Revenue – the self-assessment date. You’ll find this on the return acknowledgment form we sent you after processing your return. If you’re issuing a NOPA in response to an assessment made by Inland Revenue you must send it to us within four months of the date of issue of the notice of assessment. 32DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Student loans Studylink transactions If you disagree with any Studylink transactions, send a written objection explaining why you disagree, to: Student Loan Manager Studylink Centre Freepost 113907 Private Bag 11070 Palmerston North The loan manager must receive your objection within 31 days of the date you are notified. The loan manager will consider your objection and notify you whether or not it has been allowed. If you disagree with the loan manager’s decision, you can ask for your objection to be considered by the Chief Executive of the Ministry of Social Development. You must request this in writing within 21 days of the loan manager’s decision. Send your objection to: The Chief Executive Ministry of Social Development PO Box 1556 Wellington The Ministry of Social Development (MSD) will write to you with a decision. If you do not agree with that decision, you can apply to the Disputes Tribunal or District Court to have your objection decided. You must do this within 30 days of MSD’s decision. For more information on disputes, read the Review and Appeal process on the StudyLink website www.studylink.govt.nz Inland Revenue transactions Borrowers If you disagree with any Inland Revenue transactions, you may dispute any of the following: • • a repayment obligation (assessment) • • your student loan balance • • a disputable decision, eg, your New Zealand based or overseas based borrower status, outcome of an application for a student loan special deduction rate or student loan repayment deduction exemption, decision on a significant under- or over-deduction, and decision on relief • • interest charged • • penalties charged. The disputes procedures are the same as for income tax assessments for borrowers. 33 Employers If you disagree, you can dispute: • • your repayment deduction amount • • any penalties charged on your account • • any interest charged on your account. The disputes procedures for employers are the same as for PAYE. Note The interest on deferred tax in dispute (page 28) only applies to deferred amounts of repayment deductions, penalties, penal assessments and penal charges. Deferred amounts of student loan assessments will continue to attract the normal interest chargeable on any amount of loan balance not overdue. Child support Paying parents and custodians The process for objecting to child support assessments is different from the process described in this guide. If you wish to object to the amount of child support you have to pay you should first lodge a notice of objection with us. Our guideHelping you to understand child support - IR100 explains how to do this. If you still wish to challenge our decision, you will need to apply to the Family Court. Our guide Helping you to understand child support and the Family court - IR174 explains how to do this. Employers If you disagree, you can challenge your deduction determination. The disputes procedures are the same as for income tax assessments for paying parents and custodians, and as for PAYE determinations for employers. Note The interest on deferred tax in dispute only applies to deferred amounts of deductions and penalties. Shortfall penalties We may charge you shortfall penalties if you failed to meet your tax obligations. We usually issue a NOPA (notice of proposed adjustment) before assessing for shortfall penalties, but if we do not, you can dispute the assessment. Gift duty The gift duty disputes procedures are the same as those for income tax. 34DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT Part 10 – Time limits for disputing an assessment The following table summarises the time limits for each step you must take to go right through the disputes process. The earlier parts of this guide explain in detail what you must do and how much time you have for each step. Decision you wish to appeal Action Time limit you must meet Where to lodge your action Inland Revenue issues a notice of assessment or you want to make an adjustment to your self-assessment Furnish the return then issue a NOPA Four months from the relevant date on the notice Inland Revenue Inland Revenue issues a notice of response Reject the notice of response in writing Two months from the date on the notice of response Inland Revenue Inland Revenue issues a disclosure notice File your statement of position Two months from the date on the disclosure notice Inland Revenue Inland Revenue confirms the assessment You can file proceedings with the TRA or the High Court Two months from the date of rejection of your adjustment TRA or High Court, as appropriate Decision of TRAYou can appeal a TRA decision to the High Court 20 working days from when the TRA issues its written decision High Court High Court decisionYou can appeal the High Court decision to the Court of Appeal 20 working days from when the High Court delivers it written decision Court of Appeal Court of Appeal decision You may be able to appeal the Court of Appeal’s decision to the Supreme Court 20 working days from when the Court of Appeal delivers its written decision Supreme Court Note If your dispute relates solely to a research and development tax credit claim, different time limits apply. See the R&D tax credit information at ird.govt.nz/research-development 35 Before you begin Planning, preparation and presentation is very important. These points below will help you. Make yourself clear Prepare your notices in a way that is clear and easy to understand. Know your purpose The aim of your dispute should be to prove the assessment (or decision) is incorrect. You must know: • • details of the items you intend to adjust • • the facts and laws (including tax laws) that support the adjustment you’re proposing • • how the law applies to the facts • • the evidence you intend to rely on. Know your time limits There are timeframes throughout the disputes resolution process you must meet if your dispute is to succeed. Late actions will be accepted only in exceptional circumstances. Know when your payments are due Read Part 8 of this guide about paying the tax in dispute. Progression For each step you decide to take in the disputes resolution process, check you’ve made all the necessary preparations. Professional assistance We recommend you get independent advice from an accountant or other professional tax advisor if you wish to proceed with your dispute. This is especially important if complex issues are involved. Because of the nature of the disputes resolution process, Inland Revenue staff can not help you to prepare your NOPA, NOR, statement of position or any other documents for use in a dispute. 36DISPUTING AN ASSESSMENT For more help Need to speak with us?

You can also order copies by calling 0800 257 773. The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. 5 www.ird.govt.nz Questions Question 10 Schedular payments If the partnership or LTC has received schedular payments, we'll send you a Summary of earnings (SOE), detailing the payments received and the tax deducted. From your SOE, copy the total tax deducted into Box 10A and gross payments into Box 10B. The SOE may not contain all your earnings information. If any details are missing, please include them at Question 10. If the partnership or LTC is registered for GST, your gross schedular payments should not include any GST. If they do, show the gross payments at Question 10 and deduct the GST portion at Question 21. Question 11 New Zealand interest Include interest from all New Zealand sources at Question 11. The interest payer will usually send you an RWT withholding certificate (IR15), or similar statement, showing the gross interest paid and the amount of RWT deducted. Write the total of all RWT deducted in Box 11A. Add up all the gross interest amounts (before the deduction of any tax) and write the total in Box 11B. If expenses are deductible against the interest income (eg, commission), claim them at Question 21. Read the note about expenses on page 21. Note Don't send in any interest statements or IR15 certificates with your return, but keep them in case we ask for them later. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE6 Interest on broken term deposits If you've broken a term deposit during the year, you may have to account for "negative interest". This is interest repaid on a term deposit and may reduce the amount of interest to declare in your return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest shown on the IR15 or equivalent statement. Deduct the allowable negative interest component, using the worksheet below, before entering the gross amount at Question 11 of your return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a future income year when the term deposit matures. Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your RWT on interest form to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you've paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. 3 Copy this amount to Box 11B of your tax return. Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we paid you interest, include it in Box 11B for the income year the partnership or LTC received the interest. If the partnership or LTC paid us interest, include it as a deduction in Box 21 of the return for the income year the interest is paid. Read about expenses on page 21. Interest from overseas If the partnership or LTC received interest from overseas, convert your overseas interest and tax credits to New Zealand dollars and show the amounts at Question 16. Please read the notes about overseas income on pages 13 to 16. 7 www.ird.govt.nz Income from financial arrangements If the partnership or LTC was a party to a financial arrangement, such as government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts or deferred property settlements, you may have to calculate the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement using a spreading method, rather than on a cash basis. To work out if you must use a spreading method, please read "Financial arrangements" on pages 19 and 20. If the financial arrangement matures, is sold, remitted or transferred, you must do a "wash-up" calculation, known as a base price adjustment. Any RWT will be deducted on a cash basis. Show the RWT deducted and any income from the financial arrangement in Boxes 11A and 11B. Question 12 New Zealand dividends Dividends are the part of a company's profits that it passes on to its shareholders. Unit trusts are treated as companies for income tax purposes. Distributions from unit trusts will generally be taxable and are treated as dividends. Complete Question 12 if you received any New Zealand dividends, including dividends from your local electricity or gas supplier. Don't include a dividend that's a distribution of the trust's capital and is tax free. The company or unit trust that paid you the dividend will send you a dividend statement. Don't send in any dividend statements with your return, but keep them in case we ask for them later. If expenses are deductible against the dividend income (eg, commission), claim them at Question 21. Read the note about expenses on page 21. Note PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE8 Credits attached to dividends A New Zealand company or unit trust may attach several types of credits to dividends. "Imputation credits" are credits for part of the tax the company has already paid on its profits, which means the dividends aren't taxed twice. RWT is deducted from your dividend to bring the total credits withheld up to 33% of the gross dividend. What to show in your return Your dividend statements show the amount: • you received (net dividend) • of any imputation credits • of any RWT credits. Add all these amounts together to work out your total gross dividends and enter this in Box 12B. Add up all the imputation credits and print the total in Box 12. Add any dividend RWT credits and print the total in Box 12A. Shares instead of dividends If the partnership or LTC received shares instead of dividends, include them as income at Question 12. Write the amount as if you received dividends instead of shares. Dividends from overseas Please read about overseas income on pages 13 to 15 of this guide. Question 13 Māori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. Fill in Question 13 if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. 9 www.ird.govt.nz Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a "Māori authority credit". It is usually part of the tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits, which means the distributions aren't taxed twice. What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: • the distribution made to you, including what portion is taxable and what portion is non-taxable • Māori authority credit. Transfer these amounts, leaving out any non-taxable distributions, to the relevant boxes at Question 13. A Māori authority makes a pre-tax profit of $10,000. It pays tax on this profit of $1,750 (Māori authority tax rate of 17.5%) and distributes the entire profit to their 10 members. Each member will receive $825 as a cash distribution and $175 of Māori authority credits. Each member of the authority who has to file an IR7 return would show the following information at Question 13: Box 13A - $175 Box 13B - $1,000 (made up of $825 + $175) Example Non-taxable distribution You don't need to include in the IR7 return any other distributions received from a Māori authority that aren't taxable in the hands of a Māori authority member. These amounts are non-taxable distributions and can't have credits attached. For more information read our Māori authority guide (IR487). PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE10 Question 14 Income from another partnership If the partnership or LTC received any income or loss from another partnership, write the details at Question 14. Don't include any: • interest and RWT - show these at Question 11 • dividends, imputation credits, and dividend RWT - show these at Question 12 • Māori authority distributions and credits - show these at Question 13 • overseas income and any credits attached - show these at Question 16, see pages 13 to 15 • rental income - show this at Question 18, see page 17 • other income - show this at Question 19, see pages 17 to 20. Add up all the other income from partnerships and include the total in Box 14B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up any other tax credits and include the total in Box 14A. Question 15 Income from another LTC If the LTC received income from another LTC, write the details at Question 15. A partnership does not receive income or deductions from an LTC. If two or more people jointly receive income or deductions from an LTC, they should show these on their own returns, not the partnership's return. Note LTCs are transparent (looked through), meaning the owners are treated as having received the income and incurred the loss of the company. 11 www.ird.govt.nz The LTC will normally supply the information required to complete your return. Don't include any of the following types of income received from another LTC at Question 15: • interest and RWT - show these at Question 11 • dividends, imputation credits, and dividend RWT - show these at Question 12 • Māori authority distributions and credits - show these at Question 13 • overseas income and any credits attached - show these at Question 16, see pages 13 to 15 • rental income - show this at Question 18, see page 17 • other income - show this at Question 19, see pages 17 to 20. Change to the loss limitation rule Before the 2017-18 income year the amount of deductions an LTC owner (shareholder) could claim was subject to the loss limitation rule. This rule limits the amount of deductions an owner can claim to the amount of their “owner’s basis”, which represents their economic interest in the LTC. The loss limitation rule no longer applies to most LTC owners. It continues to apply for owners of LTCs that are in a partnership or joint venture that includes another LTC. If the loss limitation rule no longer applies, any deductions which have been carried forward will be claimable this year. The example on the following page explains how the tax return should be completed where this applies. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE12 An LTC (Company A) is an owner of another LTC (Company B) which is not in a partnership or joint venture that includes another LTC. For the 2017-18 income year Company A has a net loss of $10,000 from the LTC. Company A also has prior years’ non-allowable deductions brought forward of $15,000. Company A has no tax credits from the LTC for the year. Company A’s tax return should show these amounts in the following boxes: • 15A: $0 • 15B: $10,000- • 15C: $0 • 15D: $15,000 • 15E: $25,000- Example What to show on your return Add up all the other income from LTCs and include the total in Box 15B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up any other tax credits and include the total in Box 15A. Add up any non-allowable deductions this year from LTCs and include the total in Box 15C. There shouldn’t be non-allowable deductions this year unless the loss limitation rule still applies. Note If you had any non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year, you may be able to claim some, or all, of the brought forward amount this year. Print the amount claimable in Box 15D prior years' non-allowable deductions claimed this year. 13 www.ird.govt.nz You will be able to claim the full amount of non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year if the loss limitation rule no longer applies. Note If you have an amount in Box 15C, add this to Box 15B and put the total in Box 15E. If you have an amount in Box 15D, subtract this from Box 15B and put the total in Box 15E. If you don't have any amounts in Box 15C or Box 15D, copy the amount from Box 15B into Box 15E. Box 15E is your adjusted LTC income. Question 16 Overseas income If the partnership or LTC received overseas income, eg, from interest or financial arrangements, show this at Question 16. Convert all overseas income and qualifying overseas tax paid to New Zealand dollars. You can do this by: • using the rates available on www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: overseas currencies) • contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Tax paid overseas is distributed to the partners or owner(s) and the tax credit limit is calculated on the partner's or owner's income tax return. Keep evidence of overseas tax paid with your tax records for seven years. For more information about foreign tax credits read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate (IR461). If the income was received from a financial arrangement, please read our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 20, No 3 (April 2008). PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE14 Overseas dividends There are two situations covering the treatment of overseas dividends. Each owner or partner will need to determine which of the following applies to their share of foreign investments: • If the shares have FIF income or loss calculated, don't include any dividends paid from these shares on the IR7 return. Instead, show the calculated FIF income or loss at Box 16B. • If the shares are covered by one of the FIF exclusions (see pages 15 and 16), show the dividends at Box 16B. Each owner or partner will need to advise their individual amount of either the FIF income or loss (or their FIF calculation method) or the dividend, to be included on the IR7 return. Show each owner's or partner's individual amount, plus any other allocation of overseas income, at Box 16B on the IR7 return and at Box 24F on the IR7L or IR7P form - see page 25. This information is also used in determining the income amount at Box 4 on page 32 of this guide. In either situation, include any qualifying overseas tax credits attached to the dividends at Box 16A. Some Australian dividends can have New Zealand imputation credits attached. Include these at Box 12. Please note you can't claim Australian franking credits. If the partnership or LTC received dividends from an overseas company through an agent or trustee who deducted RWT in New Zealand or dividends treated as interest, show the New Zealand RWT deducted at Box 12A. If you've shown an imputation credit in Box 12 or an RWT credit in Box 12A and there is no income associated to these in Box 12B, you'll need to attach a note to the top of page 3 of your return with the details. Note 15 www.ird.govt.nz Foreign investment fund (FIF) income or loss If at any time during the 2018 income year the partnership or LTC held rights like shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, foreign unit trust, foreign superannuation scheme or foreign life insurance policy, the partners or owner(s) may be required to calculate FIF income or loss in their own income tax return(s). Generally, the partners or owner(s) will use the fair dividend rate to calculate FIF income. The partners or owner(s) may also need to file an additional FIF disclosure form. See Question 25 on page 48. The main exclusions from an interest in a FIF are: • investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts. Investments covered in the list are available in the Australian share exemption list (IR871) • interest in certain Australian unit trusts • limited exemptions for interest in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand) • a 10% or greater interest in a CFC • an individual or trustee of certain trusts, who is a partner or owner and holds, at all times in the income year, FIFs with a total cost of $50,000 or less. You can find more information on the exclusions and the FIF rules at www.ird.govt.nz/toii/fif and in our Ta x Information Bulletins (TIBs) - see the online index for relevant issues. Controlled foreign company (CFC) income or loss If at any time during the 2018 income year the partnership or LTC has attributed CFC income or loss, the partners or owner(s) may be required to calculate this in their own income tax return(s). PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE16 A loss from a CFC can't be used to offset domestic income or be included in domestic losses that are carried forward to the 2018 income year. Generally, these losses can only offset income or future income from CFCs that are resident in the same country as the CFC that incurred the loss. The partners or owner(s) may also need to file an additional CFC disclosure form. See Question 25 on page 48. Question 17 Business income Write the net profit or loss in Box 17B. This is the amount of income or loss after deducting all allowable business expenditure. If this is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Refer to our Smart business (IR320) guide for information on allowable business expenditure and record keeping. Attach one of these to the top of page 3 of your return: • a set of the partnership's or LTC's financial accounts • a completed Financial statements summary (IR10) form • a completed Farming income (IR3F) form or Schedule of business income (IR3B) form. If you complete an IR10, which speeds up the processing of the return, you don't need to send us your financial accounts as well, but keep them in case we ask for them later. Attribution rule Anyone who provides services and puts an intermediary between themselves and the recipient of the personal service has income earned allocated to them, not the intermediary. If this rule applies to persons associated to your partnership or LTC, it will affect the amount of taxable income in this return. When applying the attribution rule, LTCs are treated as associated entities and not as being transparent. To find out how to apply this rule, please read our Ta x Information Bulletins (TIBs), Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000), Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001), and Vol 21, No 8 Pt 2 (October/November 2009). If you need more information, please call us - see page 50. 17 www.ird.govt.nz Question 18 Rental income Write the net profit or loss (total rents minus expenses) in Box 18B. If this is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Refer to our Rental income (IR264) guide for information on allowable rental expenses and record keeping. Attach one of these to the top of page 3 of your return: • a set of the partnership's or LTC's financial accounts • a completed Financial statements summary (IR10) form • a completed Rental income (IR3R) form. Question 19 Other income If you invested capital in a partnership or LTC but didn't take an active part in the day-to-day operation or management of the business, any earnings would be considered passive income. Enter this amount at Question 19. Don't enter it here if you've already included it at another Question on your return. Also at Question 19 show any other income the partnership or LTC received, eg, sale of: • land and/or buildings • non-FIF shares or other property • securities. If the partnership or LTC received any of the income listed above, please read the following. Income from sale of land and/or buildings Profits from the sale of land and/or buildings are taxable if the partnership or LTC: • buys a property for the purpose or intention of resale • buys and sells land and/or buildings as a business • trades as a builder and improves a property before selling it • develops or subdivides land and sells sections • has a change of zoning on its property, and sells it within 10 years of buying it. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE18 • purchased a residential property on or after 1 October 2015 and sold/disposed of it within two years, whether the intention at the time of purchase was for resale or not. If the partnership or LTC is a New Zealand tax resident it will need to pay tax on its worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales worldwide whether caught under the bright-line test for residential property sales or the other property rules. Complete a Property sale information (IR833) form for each property sold/disposed of and include it with the return. The form explains how to calculate and correctly return the resulting profit or loss. The form can be downloaded from our website www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: IR833). Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary (IR10) or set of accounts. Include the taxable profits in Box 19B. Income from sale of non-FIF shares or other property Profits from the sale of shares and other property are taxable if the partnership or LTC buys: • and sells shares or other property as a business • shares or other property for resale • shares or property to make a profit. List the details of gross income and expenses from these sales on a separate sheet of paper and attach it to the top of page 3 of your IR7. Include the total profits in Box 19B. Selling or disposing of assets If the partnership or LTC sold or disposed of a depreciated asset for more than its adjusted tax value, you may need to account for depreciation recovered. You can use the depreciation calculator on our website www.ird.govt.nz to get a complete depreciation schedule for any asset. The schedule includes the amount to claim in the year of purchase and any adjustment in the year of sale. For further information please read Depreciation - a guide for businesses (IR260), and either Depreciation rates (IR265) or Historic depreciation rates (IR267). 19 www.ird.govt.nz Losses from sale of land, buildings, shares or other property If the partnership or LTC has made a loss and you can show that if the partnership or LTC had made a profit it would have been taxable, the partnership or LTC may be able to claim the loss as an expense. Include the total loss at Box 19B. Write the details of the loss on a separate sheet of paper and attach it to the top of page 3 of your IR7. Include details of other profits or losses made from similar sales, whether in this tax year or earlier. Financial arrangements A partner or owner must account for income from financial arrangements on an accrual basis. Financial arrangements include government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts and deferred property settlements. Changes to the rules for the treatment of financial arrangements have split the rules into two sets. Generally, the first set applies to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999 and the second applies to financial arrangements entered into, on or after that date. Both sets of rules require the income or expenditure to be spread over the term of the financial arrangement. Both sets of rules allow some exceptions from these spreading provisions if the partner or owner is a cash-basis holder (under the first set of rules), or a cash-basis person (under the second set of rules). The partner or owner is a cash-basis holder if, before 20 May 1999: • they held financial arrangements of $600,000 or less in value, or • the income derived from the financial arrangements was $70,000 or less, and • the difference between the person's gross income calculated under the cash basis and that calculated under the accrual method is no more than $20,000. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE20 The partner or owner is a cash-basis person if, from 20 May 1999: • the value of all financial arrangements added together is less than $1 million, or • the absolute value (the value no matter whether it's a positive or a negative figure) calculated under the accrual rules in the income year from the financial arrangement is less than $100,000, and • in comparing the gross income and expenditure using a spreading method under the accrual rules with the cash-basis income and expenditure, the result is less than $40,000. To determine whether the partner or owner is a cash-basis holder or cash-basis person, they must take into account their share of the financial arrangement, or their share in the gross income or expenditure under the financial arrangement the partnership or LTC is a party to. Sale or maturity of financial arrangements Whether or not the exemption from the spreading methods applies, when a financial arrangement matures, is sold, remitted or transferred, you must do a "wash-up" calculation, known as a base price adjustment. The calculation ensures the total gains or losses from the financial arrangement are accounted for. If you need any information about calculating a base price adjustment, please call us on 0800 443 773. Question 19C Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If a partner had RLWT deducted from the sale or transfer of a residential property located in New Zealand, they’ll need to show the full amount of the RLWT in their own individual income tax return. Don’t include it in the partnership tax credits. 21 www.ird.govt.nz If the LTC is an “offshore RLWT person” and has sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. The LTC should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. The LTC can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the LTC and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than one amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to the LTC and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Show the name of the LTC’s withholder(s) in the “Name of payer” box. Question 21 Expenses The partnership or LTC may have incurred expenses in generating its income, for example: • commission deducted from interest and dividends • expenses for return preparation • interest paid to Inland Revenue for late payment of tax in the income year it is paid. If the expenses have not already been claimed in the return, print the amount in Box 21. Question 23 Deduction for losses extinguished on transition from a QC or LAQC If the partnership or LTC had losses which were extinguished on transitioning from a QC or LAQC, each owner or partner is allowed a deduction for an amount equal to the amount given by the following formula: (Loss balance extinguished - prior years' deductions) x partnership share or owner's effective interest PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE22 Note: this is limited to the partner's or owner's share of net partnership or net LTC income for the year. Loss balance extinguished is the loss balance extinguished on transition from a QC or LAQC. If it includes foreign losses please call us on 0800 377 774 to make sure they are accounted for correctly. Prior years' deductions is the total amount of deductions for extinguished losses allowed in previous income years for all persons with a share in the partnership, or an effective look-through interest in the LTC. If this is the first year deductions have been claimed for extinguished losses, the amount will be zero. Work out the maximum allowable deduction for each owner or partner using the calculation table below and on page 23. Boxes 1 to 3 only need to be completed once. Use the resulting figures for all owners or partners. Boxes 4 to 9 must be completed for each owner or partner using their information from the IR7L or IR7P. Loss balance extinguished (copy this figure to Box 23 on the IR7) 1 Prior years' deductions (copy this figure to Box 23A on the IR7) 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. 3 If the answer in Box 3 is zero, no further deductions for extinguished losses can be claimed by the owners or partners. If it is greater than zero, continue below. Information on completing the IR7L is explained later in this guide. Attribution of income/loss is explained on pages 24 and 25, and how to complete Box 24O is explained on pages 26 to 33 of this guide. Note 23 www.ird.govt.nz Copy the total income figure from Box 24J on the IR7L or IR7P to Box 4 4 For LTC owners, copy any non-allowable deductions this year from Box 24O on the IR7L to Box 5 5 Add Boxes 4 and 5 and print the answer in Box 6. 6 If Box 6 is a loss, the owner or partner isn't entitled to a deduction this year. If it isn't a loss, continue below. Convert the owner's or partner's attribution of income/loss from Box 24B on the IR7L or IR7P to a decimal amount (eg, 40% = .40). Print the answer in Box 7. 7 Multiply Box 3 by Box 7 and print the answer in Box 8. 8 Print the amount from either Box 6 or Box 8, whichever is the lesser, in Box 9 below. This is the maximum deduction for the owner or partner. Maximum deduction 9 Copy the amount from Box 9 to Box 24K on the IR7L or IR7P form. Add up the maximum deductions for all owners or partners and print the answer in Box 23B of the IR7 return. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE24 Question 24 Attribution of income/loss All income, losses and tax credits must be attributed to the partners or owners in proportion to their share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC. At Question 24 tick which entity the income/loss details are attached for. • For partnerships, complete the IR7P to provide attribution details for all partners. • For LTCs, complete the IR7L to provide attribution details for all owners. Show the details for each partner or owner on the relevant form. If there are more than four partners or owners use additional IR7P or IR7L forms. You can print them from our website www.ird.govt.nz as you need them. Attach all IR7P or IR7L forms to the top of page 3 of your IR7 return.

Write percentages as four-digit numbers, eg show 15% as 15.00. For LTCs with only one one owner the percentage will be a five-digit number, eg show 100% as 100.00. Note For LTCs, effective look-through interest determines each owner's attribution of income or loss from the LTC. 25 www.ird.govt.nz Each owner's effective look-through interest is generally determined by the percentage of shares the owner has in t h e LTC . Please read our Look-through companies (IR879) guide if you need further information.

Note 5000 00 15000 00 10000 00 - - PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE32 Calculate the owner's basis here: Investments 1 Distributions 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 3 Income 4 Add Boxes 3 and 4 5 Deductions from previous tax years (but excluding any non-allowable deductions in those years) 6 Subtract Box 6 from Box 5 7 Disallowed amounts 8 Subtract Box 8 from Box 7\* 9 \* If Box 9 is a negative amount it means the owner has negative equity in the LTC and their owner's basis will be treated as nil. Print "0.00" in Box 9. Please note - deductions in Box 6 above also includes all the deductions claimed against gross income from the LTC from all sources in previous years in which the company was an LTC. For example, if the LTC has a rental property, all the deductions claimable against the rental income will be included in the total deductions figure, as well as expenses incurred in producing income from all other sources.

You can also order copies by calling 0800 257 773. The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. 5 www.ird.govt.nz Questions Question 10 Schedular payments If the partnership or LTC has received schedular payments, we'll send you a Summary of income (previously Summary of earnings), detailing the payments received and the tax deducted. From your Summary of income, copy the total tax deducted into Box 10A and gross payments into Box 10B. The Summary of income may not contain all your earnings information. If any details are missing, please include them at Question 10. If the partnership or LTC is registered for GST, your gross schedular payments should not include any GST. If they do, show the gross payments at Question 10 and deduct the GST portion at Question 21. Question 11 New Zealand interest Include interest from all New Zealand sources at Question 11. The interest payer will usually send you an RWT withholding certificate (IR15), or similar statement, showing the gross interest paid and the amount of RWT deducted. Write the total of all RWT deducted in Box 11A. Add up all the gross interest amounts (before the deduction of any tax) and write the total in Box 11B. If expenses are deductible against the interest income (eg, commission), claim them at Question 21. Read the note about expenses on page 21. Note Don't send in any interest statements or IR15 certificates with your return, but keep them in case we ask for them later. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE6 Interest on broken term deposits If you've broken a term deposit during the year, you may have to account for "negative interest". This is interest repaid on a term deposit and may reduce the amount of interest to declare in your return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest shown on the IR15 or equivalent statement. Deduct the allowable negative interest component, using the worksheet below, before entering the gross amount at Question 11 of your return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a future income year when the term deposit matures. Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your RWT on interest form to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you've paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. 3 Copy this amount to Box 11B of your tax return. Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we paid you interest, include it in Box 11B for the income year the partnership or LTC received the interest. If the partnership or LTC paid us interest, include it as a deduction in Box 21 of the return for the income year the interest is paid. Read about expenses on page 21. Interest from overseas If the partnership or LTC received interest from overseas, convert your overseas interest and tax credits to New Zealand dollars and show the amounts at Question 16. Please read the notes about overseas income on pages 13 to 16. 7 www.ird.govt.nz Income from financial arrangements If the partnership or LTC was a party to a financial arrangement, such as government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts or deferred property settlements, you may have to calculate the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement using a spreading method, rather than on a cash basis. To work out if you must use a spreading method, please read "Financial arrangements" on pages 19 and 20. If the financial arrangement matures, is sold, remitted or transferred, you must do a "wash-up" calculation, known as a base price adjustment. Any RWT will be deducted on a cash basis. Show the RWT deducted and any income from the financial arrangement in Boxes 11A and 11B. Question 12 New Zealand dividends Dividends are the part of a company's profits that it passes on to its shareholders. Unit trusts are treated as companies for income tax purposes. Distributions from unit trusts will generally be taxable and are treated as dividends. Complete Question 12 if you received any New Zealand dividends, including dividends from your local electricity or gas supplier. Don't include a dividend that's a distribution of the trust's capital and is tax free. The company or unit trust that paid you the dividend will send you a dividend statement. Don't send in any dividend statements with your return, but keep them in case we ask for them later. If expenses are deductible against the dividend income (eg, commission), claim them at Question 21. Read the note about expenses on page 21. Note PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE8 Credits attached to dividends A New Zealand company or unit trust may attach several types of credits to dividends. "Imputation credits" are credits for part of the tax the company has already paid on its profits, which means the dividends aren't taxed twice. RWT is deducted from your dividend to bring the total credits withheld up to 33% of the gross dividend. What to show in your return Your dividend statements show the amount: • you received (net dividend) • of any imputation credits • of any RWT credits. Add all these amounts together to work out your total gross dividends and enter this in Box 12B. Add up all the imputation credits and print the total in Box 12. Add any dividend RWT credits and print the total in Box 12A. Shares instead of dividends If the partnership or LTC received shares instead of dividends, include them as income at Question 12. Write the amount as if you received dividends instead of shares. Dividends from overseas Please read about overseas income on pages 13 to 15 of this guide. Question 13 Māori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. Fill in Question 13 if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. 9 www.ird.govt.nz Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a "Māori authority credit". It is usually part of the tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits, which means the distributions aren't taxed twice. What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: • the distribution made to you, including what portion is taxable and what portion is non-taxable • Māori authority credit. Transfer these amounts, leaving out any non-taxable distributions, to the relevant boxes at Question 13. A Māori authority makes a pre-tax profit of $10,000. It pays tax on this profit of $1,750 (Māori authority tax rate of 17.5%) and distributes the entire profit to their 10 members. Each member will receive $825 as a cash distribution and $175 of Māori authority credits. Each member of the authority who has to file an IR7 return would show the following information at Question 13: Box 13A - $175 Box 13B - $1,000 (made up of $825 + $175) Example Non-taxable distribution You don't need to include in the IR7 return any other distributions received from a Māori authority that aren't taxable in the hands of a Māori authority member. These amounts are non-taxable distributions and can't have credits attached. For more information read our Māori authority guide (IR487). PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE10 Question 14 Income from another partnership If the partnership or LTC received any income or loss from another partnership, write the details at Question 14. Don't include any: • interest and RWT - show these at Question 11 • dividends, imputation credits, and dividend RWT - show these at Question 12 • Māori authority distributions and credits - show these at Question 13 • overseas income and any credits attached - show these at Question 16, see pages 13 to 15 • rental income - show this at Question 18, see page 17 • other income - show this at Question 19, see pages 17 to 20. Add up all the other income from partnerships and include the total in Box 14B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up any other tax credits and include the total in Box 14A. Question 15 Income from another LTC If the LTC received income from another LTC, write the details at Question 15. A partnership does not receive income or deductions from an LTC. If two or more people jointly receive income or deductions from an LTC, they should show these on their own returns, not the partnership's return. Note LTCs are transparent (looked through), meaning the owners are treated as having received the income and incurred the loss of the company. 11 www.ird.govt.nz The LTC will normally supply the information required to complete your return. Don't include any of the following types of income received from another LTC at Question 15: • interest and RWT - show these at Question 11 • dividends, imputation credits, and dividend RWT - show these at Question 12 • Māori authority distributions and credits - show these at Question 13 • overseas income and any credits attached - show these at Question 16, see pages 13 to 15 • rental income - show this at Question 18, see page 17 • other income - show this at Question 19, see pages 17 to 20. Change to the loss limitation rule Before the 2017-18 income year the amount of deductions an LTC owner (shareholder) could claim was subject to the loss limitation rule. This rule limits the amount of deductions an owner can claim to the amount of their “owner’s basis”, which represents their economic interest in the LTC. The loss limitation rule no longer applies to most LTC owners. It continues to apply for owners of LTCs that are in a partnership or joint venture that includes another LTC. If the loss limitation rule no longer applies, any deductions which have been carried forward will be claimable this year. The example on the following page explains how the tax return should be completed where this applies. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE12 An LTC (Company A) is an owner of another LTC (Company B) which is not in a partnership or joint venture that includes another LTC. For the 2018-19 income year Company A has a net loss of $10,000 from the LTC. Company A also has prior years’ non-allowable deductions brought forward of $15,000. Company A has no tax credits from the LTC for the year. Company A’s tax return should show these amounts in the following boxes: • 15A: $0 • 15B: $10,000- • 15C: $0 • 15D: $15,000 • 15E: $25,000- Example What to show on your return Add up all the other income from LTCs and include the total in Box 15B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up any other tax credits and include the total in Box 15A. Add up any non-allowable deductions this year from LTCs and include the total in Box 15C. There shouldn’t be non-allowable deductions this year unless the loss limitation rule still applies. Note If you had any non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year, you may be able to claim some, or all, of the brought forward amount this year. Print the amount claimable in Box 15D prior years' non-allowable deductions claimed this year. 13 www.ird.govt.nz You will be able to claim the full amount of non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year if the loss limitation rule no longer applies. Note If you have an amount in Box 15C, add this to Box 15B and put the total in Box 15E. If you have an amount in Box 15D, subtract this from Box 15B and put the total in Box 15E. If you don't have any amounts in Box 15C or Box 15D, copy the amount from Box 15B into Box 15E. Box 15E is your adjusted LTC income. Question 16 Overseas income If the partnership or LTC received overseas income, eg, from interest or financial arrangements, show this at Question 16. Convert all overseas income and qualifying overseas tax paid to New Zealand dollars. You can do this by: • using the rates available on www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: overseas currencies) • contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Tax paid overseas is distributed to the partners or owner(s) and the tax credit limit is calculated on the partner's or owner's income tax return. Keep evidence of overseas tax paid with your tax records for seven years. For more information about foreign tax credits read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate (IR461). If the income was received from a financial arrangement, please read our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 20, No 3 (April 2008). PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE14 Overseas dividends There are two situations covering the treatment of overseas dividends. Each owner or partner will need to determine which of the following applies to their share of foreign investments: • If the shares have FIF income or loss calculated, don't include any dividends paid from these shares on the IR7 return. Instead, show the calculated FIF income or loss at Box 16B. • If the shares are covered by one of the FIF exclusions (see pages 15 and 16), show the dividends at Box 16B. Each owner or partner will need to advise their individual amount of either the FIF income or loss (or their FIF calculation method) or the dividend, to be included on the IR7 return. Show each owner's or partner's individual amount, plus any other allocation of overseas income, at Box 16B on the IR7 return and at Box 24F on the IR7L or IR7P form - see page 25. This information is also used in determining the income amount at Box 4 on page 32 of this guide. In either situation, include any qualifying overseas tax credits attached to the dividends at Box 16A. Some Australian dividends can have New Zealand imputation credits attached. Include these at Box 12. Please note you can't claim Australian franking credits. If the partnership or LTC received dividends from an overseas company through an agent or trustee who deducted RWT in New Zealand or dividends treated as interest, show the New Zealand RWT deducted at Box 12A. If you've shown an imputation credit in Box 12 or an RWT credit in Box 12A and there is no income associated to these in Box 12B, you'll need to attach a note to the top of page 3 of your return with the details. Note 15 www.ird.govt.nz Foreign investment fund (FIF) income or loss If at any time during the 2019 income year the partnership or LTC held rights like shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, foreign unit trust, foreign superannuation scheme or foreign life insurance policy, the partners or owner(s) may be required to calculate FIF income or loss in their own income tax return(s). Generally, the partners or owner(s) will use the fair dividend rate to calculate FIF income. The partners or owner(s) may also need to file an additional FIF disclosure form. See Question 25 on page 48. The main exclusions from an interest in a FIF are: • investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts. Investments covered in the list are available in the Australian share exemption list (IR871) • interest in certain Australian unit trusts • limited exemptions for interest in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand) • a 10% or greater interest in a CFC • an individual or trustee of certain trusts, who is a partner or owner and holds, at all times in the income year, FIFs with a total cost of $50,000 or less. You can find more information on the exclusions and the FIF rules at www.ird.govt.nz/toii/fif and in our Ta x Information Bulletins (TIBs) - see the online index for relevant issues. Controlled foreign company (CFC) income or loss If at any time during the 2019 income year the partnership or LTC has attributed CFC income or loss, the partners or owner(s) may be required to calculate this in their own income tax return(s). PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE16 A loss from a CFC can't be used to offset domestic income or be included in domestic losses that are carried forward to the 2019 income year. Generally, these losses can only offset income or future income from CFCs that are resident in the same country as the CFC that incurred the loss. The partners or owner(s) may also need to file an additional CFC disclosure form. See Question 25 on page 48. Question 17 Business income Write the net profit or loss in Box 17B. This is the amount of income or loss after deducting all allowable business expenditure. If this is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Refer to our Smart business (IR320) guide for information on allowable business expenditure and record keeping. Attach one of these to the top of page 3 of your return: • a set of the partnership's or LTC's financial accounts • a completed Financial statements summary (IR10) form • a completed Farming income (IR3F) form or Schedule of business income (IR3B) form. If you complete an IR10, which speeds up the processing of the return, you don't need to send us your financial accounts as well, but keep them in case we ask for them later. Attribution rule Anyone who provides services and puts an intermediary between themselves and the recipient of the personal service has income earned allocated to them, not the intermediary. If this rule applies to persons associated to your partnership or LTC, it will affect the amount of taxable income in this return. When applying the attribution rule, LTCs are treated as associated entities and not as being transparent. To find out how to apply this rule, please read our Ta x Information Bulletins (TIBs), Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000), Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001), and Vol 21, No 8 Pt 2 (October/November 2009). If you need more information, please call us - see page 50. 17 www.ird.govt.nz Question 18 Rental income Write the net profit or loss (total rents minus expenses) in Box 18B. If this is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Refer to our Rental income (IR264) guide for information on allowable rental expenses and record keeping. Attach one of these to the top of page 3 of your return: • a set of the partnership's or LTC's financial accounts • a completed Financial statements summary (IR10) form • a completed Rental income (IR3R) form. Question 19 Other income If you invested capital in a partnership or LTC but didn't take an active part in the day-to-day operation or management of the business, any earnings would be considered passive income. Enter this amount at Question 19. Don't enter it here if you've already included it at another Question on your return. Also at Question 19 show any other income the partnership or LTC received, eg, sale of: • land and/or buildings • non-FIF shares or other property • securities. If the partnership or LTC received any of the income listed above, please read the following. Income from sale of land and/or buildings Profits from the sale of land and/or buildings are taxable if the partnership or LTC: • buys a property for the purpose or intention of resale • buys and sells land and/or buildings as a business • trades as a builder and improves a property before selling it • develops or subdivides land and sells sections • has a change of zoning on its property, and sells it within 10 years of buying it • sold/disposed of residential property subject to the bright-line test. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE18 The bright-line test for residential property applies to: • properties purchased/acquired on or after 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive, and sold/ disposed of within two years, and • properties purchased /acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and sold within five years. If the partnership or LTC is a New Zealand tax resident it will need to pay tax on its worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales worldwide whether caught under the bright-line test for residential property sales or the other property rules. Complete a Property sale information (IR833) form for each property sold/disposed of and include it with the return. The form explains how to calculate and correctly return the resulting profit or loss. The form can be downloaded from our website www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: IR833). Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary (IR10) or set of accounts. Include the taxable profits in Box 19B. Income from sale of non-FIF shares or other property Profits from the sale of shares and other property are taxable if the partnership or LTC buys: • and sells shares or other property as a business • shares or other property for resale • shares or property to make a profit. List the details of gross income and expenses from these sales on a separate sheet of paper and attach it to the top of page 3 of your IR7. Include the total profits in Box 19B. Selling or disposing of assets If the partnership or LTC sold or disposed of a depreciated asset for more than its adjusted tax value, you may need to account for depreciation recovered. You can use the depreciation calculator on our website www.ird.govt.nz to get a complete depreciation schedule for any asset. The schedule includes the amount to claim in the year of purchase and any adjustment in the year 19 www.ird.govt.nz of sale. For further information please read Depreciation - a guide for businesses (IR260), and either Depreciation rates (IR265) or Historic depreciation rates (IR267). Losses from sale of land, buildings, shares or other property If the partnership or LTC has made a loss and you can show that if the partnership or LTC had made a profit it would have been taxable, the partnership or LTC may be able to claim the loss as an expense. Include the total loss at Box 19B. Write the details of the loss on a separate sheet of paper and attach it to the top of page 3 of your IR7. Include details of other profits or losses made from similar sales, whether in this tax year or earlier. Financial arrangements A partner or owner must account for income from financial arrangements on an accrual basis. Financial arrangements include government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts and deferred property settlements. Changes to the rules for the treatment of financial arrangements have split the rules into two sets. Generally, the first set applies to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999 and the second applies to financial arrangements entered into, on or after that date. Both sets of rules require the income or expenditure to be spread over the term of the financial arrangement. Both sets of rules allow some exceptions from these spreading provisions if the partner or owner is a cash-basis holder (under the first set of rules), or a cash-basis person (under the second set of rules). The partner or owner is a cash-basis holder if, before 20 May 1999: • they held financial arrangements of $600,000 or less in value, or • the income derived from the financial arrangements was $70,000 or less, and PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE20 • the difference between the person's gross income calculated under the cash basis and that calculated under the accrual method is no more than $20,000. The partner or owner is a cash-basis person if, from 20 May 1999: • the value of all financial arrangements added together is less than $1 million, or • the absolute value (the value no matter whether it's a positive or a negative figure) calculated under the accrual rules in the income year from the financial arrangement is less than $100,000, and • in comparing the gross income and expenditure using a spreading method under the accrual rules with the cash-basis income and expenditure, the result is less than $40,000. To determine whether the partner or owner is a cash-basis holder or cash-basis person, they must take into account their share of the financial arrangement, or their share in the gross income or expenditure under the financial arrangement the partnership or LTC is a party to. Sale or maturity of financial arrangements Whether or not the exemption from the spreading methods applies, when a financial arrangement matures, is sold, remitted or transferred, you must do a "wash-up" calculation, known as a base price adjustment. The calculation ensures the total gains or losses from the financial arrangement are accounted for. If you need any information about calculating a base price adjustment, please call us on 0800 443 773. Question 19C Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If a partner had RLWT deducted from the sale or transfer of a residential property located in New Zealand, they’ll need to show the full amount of the RLWT in their own individual income tax return. Don’t include it in the partnership tax credits. 21 www.ird.govt.nz If the LTC is an “offshore RLWT person” and has sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. The LTC should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. The LTC can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the LTC and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than one amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to the LTC and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Show the name of the LTC’s withholder(s) in the “Name of payer” box. Question 21 Expenses The partnership or LTC may have incurred expenses in generating its income, for example: • commission deducted from interest and dividends • expenses for return preparation • interest paid to Inland Revenue for late payment of tax in the income year it is paid. If the expenses have not already been claimed in the return, print the amount in Box 21. Question 23 Deduction for losses extinguished on transition from a QC or LAQC If the partnership or LTC had losses which were extinguished on transitioning from a QC or LAQC, each owner or partner is allowed a deduction for an amount equal to the amount given by the following formula: (Loss balance extinguished - prior years' deductions) x partnership share or owner's effective interest PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE22 Note: this is limited to the partner's or owner's share of net partnership or net LTC income for the year. Loss balance extinguished is the loss balance extinguished on transition from a QC or LAQC. If it includes foreign losses please call us on 0800 377 774 to make sure they are accounted for correctly. Prior years' deductions is the total amount of deductions for extinguished losses allowed in previous income years for all persons with a share in the partnership, or an effective look-through interest in the LTC. If this is the first year deductions have been claimed for extinguished losses, the amount will be zero. Work out the maximum allowable deduction for each owner or partner using the calculation table below and on page 23. Boxes 1 to 3 only need to be completed once. Use the resulting figures for all owners or partners. Boxes 4 to 9 must be completed for each owner or partner using their information from the IR7L or IR7P. Loss balance extinguished (copy this figure to Box 23 on the IR7) 1 Prior years' deductions (copy this figure to Box 23A on the IR7) 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. 3 If the answer in Box 3 is zero, no further deductions for extinguished losses can be claimed by the owners or partners. If it is greater than zero, continue below. Information on completing the IR7L is explained later in this guide. Attribution of income/loss is explained on pages 24 and 25, and how to complete Box 24O is explained on pages 26 to 33 of this guide. Note 23 www.ird.govt.nz Copy the total income figure from Box 24J on the IR7L or IR7P to Box 4 4 For LTC owners, copy any non-allowable deductions this year from Box 24O on the IR7L to Box 5 5 Add Boxes 4 and 5 and print the answer in Box 6. 6 If Box 6 is a loss, the owner or partner isn't entitled to a deduction this year. If it isn't a loss, continue below. Convert the owner's or partner's attribution of income/loss from Box 24B on the IR7L or IR7P to a decimal amount (eg, 40% = .40). Print the answer in Box 7. 7 Multiply Box 3 by Box 7 and print the answer in Box 8. 8 Print the amount from either Box 6 or Box 8, whichever is the lesser, in Box 9 below. This is the maximum deduction for the owner or partner. Maximum deduction 9 Copy the amount from Box 9 to Box 24K on the IR7L or IR7P form. Add up the maximum deductions for all owners or partners and print the answer in Box 23B of the IR7 return. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE24 Question 24 Attribution of income/loss All income, losses and tax credits must be attributed to the partners or owners in proportion to their share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC. At Question 24 tick which entity the income/loss details are attached for. • For partnerships, complete the IR7P to provide attribution details for all partners. • For LTCs, complete the IR7L to provide attribution details for all owners. Show the details for each partner or owner on the relevant form. If there are more than four partners or owners use additional IR7P or IR7L forms. You can print them from our website www.ird.govt.nz as you need them. Attach all IR7P or IR7L forms to the top of page 3 of your IR7 return.

Write percentages as four-digit numbers, eg show 15% as 15.00. For LTCs with only one one owner the percentage will be a five-digit number, eg show 100% as 100.00. Note For LTCs, effective look-through interest determines each owner's attribution of income or loss from the LTC. 25 www.ird.govt.nz Each owner's effective look-through interest is generally determined by the percentage of shares the owner has in t h e LTC . Please read our Look-through companies (IR879) guide if you need further information.

Please see Part 7 of our Look-through companies (IR879) guide before calculating the owner's basis. It explains the terms used in the following calculation. If there's more than one owner, complete the tables on pages 32 and 33 for each owner separately. Note 5000 00 15000 00 10000 00 - - PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE32 Calculate the owner's basis here: Investments 1 Distributions 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 3 Income 4 Add Boxes 3 and 4 5 Deductions from previous tax years (but excluding any non-allowable deductions in those years) 6 Subtract Box 6 from Box 5 7 Disallowed amounts 8 Subtract Box 8 from Box 7\* 9 \* If Box 9 is a negative amount it means the owner has negative equity in the LTC and their owner's basis will be treated as nil. Print "0.00" in Box 9. Please note - deductions in Box 6 above also includes all the deductions claimed against gross income from the LTC from all sources in previous years in which the company was an LTC. For example, if the LTC has a rental property, all the deductions claimable against the rental income will be included in the total deductions figure, as well as expenses incurred in producing income from all other sources. When each owner's basis (Box 9 on this page) has been calculated you can work out if there is any limitation on the deductions claimable for each owner. If the: • owner's basis (Box 9) is more than their attribution of the deductions (expenses), you won't need to complete Box 24O - go to Non-allowable deductions. • attribution of deductions (expenses) to the owners are more than their owner's basis you'll need to complete Boxes 1 to 3 below to calculate the amount to declare at Box 24O. 33 www.ird.govt.nz Attribution of this year's deductions (expenses) 1 Owner's basis (from Box 9 on page 32) 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 3 The result is non-allowable deductions this year.

Any deductions an owner can't claim because of the loss limitation rule are carried forward and may be claimed in future years, subject to the application of the loss limitation rule in those years. Owners may only use these deductions against income from the LTC. Non-allowable deductions Complete the calculation (Boxes 1 to 5) on this page if you have: • non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year (copy the amount from Box 24R Non-allowable deductions on your IR7L 2018 form into Box 24P on your IR7L 2019 form) and/or • non-allowable deductions this year (that means Box 24O has an amount in it). Non-allowable deductions brought forward (also show this amount in Box 24P). 1 Non-allowable deductions this year (Box 3 on page 33, put zero if you don't have non-allowable deductions) 2 Add Boxes 1 and 2. 3 If your Owner's basis (Box 9 on Page 32) was more than your attribution of this year's deductions (expenses), copy the difference to Box 4, otherwise print $0.00. 4 Subtract Box 4 from Box 3 (print $0.00 if this would equal a negative value). 5 PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE34 Prior years' non-allowable deductions claimable this year If there is a figure in Box 4, you will be able to claim prior years' non-allowable deductions.

The partnership or LTC is not assessed for tax, but each partner or owner is liable for tax on their share of income from the partnership or LTC. Each partner or owner must file an individual tax return showing all income, including their share from the partnership or LTC. Return due date If the partnership or LTC has a 31 March balance date, you have until 7 July 2020 to send in the return, unless you've been granted an extension of time. If you have an agent or a balance date other than 31 March this date may be different. Business industry classification (BIC) code We're lawfully required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. If your BIC code isn't preprinted on the return or is different from the preprinted one, please enter the correct code. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to businessdescription.co.nz It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. If you're unable to identify the correct code, call ACC on 0508 426 837. Please provide the code only. Don't provide a description. 5 ird.govt.nz Has the partnership or LTC ceased? If this is the final return, include a set of accounts (if required) up to the date the partnership or LTC ceased. Also include details of any distribution of assets and liabilities. If the partnership or LTC is registered for GST or as an employer, you will also need to complete a Business cessation - IR315 form to finalise your records. Depending on the partnership's or LTC's circumstances, other issues may also need to be finalised, eg, outstanding returns and/or arrears. Find out how to finalise the partnership's or LTC's tax accounts or deregister for GST at ird.govt.nz Note An LTC is still a legal entity until it's taken off the Companies Register. An LTC can stop trading but still have tax obligations, eg, filing returns. Nil returns Every partnership and LTC must file an income tax return, whether or not it has been active. If there is no gross income to declare, losses to claim, and no disclosures to make at Question 27 (read page 52) you can file a nil return. Complete the return up to Question 9 and sign the declaration at Question 28. For more information on look-through company (LTC) rules, read our Look-through companies - IR879 guide. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE6 Questions Question 10 Schedular payments If the partnership or LTC has received schedular payments, we'll send you a Summary of income, detailing the payments received and the tax deducted. From your Summary of income, copy the total tax deducted into Box 10A and gross payments into Box 10B. The Summary of income may not contain all your earnings information. If any details are missing, please include them at Question 10. If the partnership or LTC is registered for GST, your gross schedular payments should not include any GST. If they do, show the gross payments at Question 10 and deduct the GST portion at Question 23. Question 11 New Zealand interest Include interest from all New Zealand sources at Question 11. The interest payer will usually send you an RWT withholding certificate - IR15, or similar statement, showing the gross interest paid and the amount of RWT deducted. Write the total of all RWT deducted in Box 11A. Add up all the gross interest amounts (before the deduction of any tax) and write the total in Box 11B. Note If expenses are deductible against the interest income (eg, commission), claim them at Question 23. Read the note about expenses on page 26. Don't send in any interest statements or IR15 certificates with your return, but keep them in case we ask for them later. 7 ird.govt.nz Interest on broken term deposits If you've broken a term deposit during the year, you may have to account for "negative interest". This is interest repaid on a term deposit and may reduce the amount of interest to declare in your return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest shown on the IR15 or equivalent statement. Deduct the allowable negative interest component, using the worksheet below, before entering the gross amount at Question 11 of your return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a future income year when the term deposit matures. Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your RWT on interest form to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you've paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. 3 Copy this amount to Box 11B of your tax return. Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we paid you interest, include it in Box 11B for the income year the partnership or LTC received the interest. If the partnership or LTC paid us interest, include it as a deduction in Box 23 of the return for the income year the interest is paid. Read about expenses on page 26. Interest from overseas If the partnership or LTC received interest from overseas, convert your overseas interest and tax credits to New Zealand dollars and show the amounts at Question 16. Please read the notes about overseas income on pages 14 to 17. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE8 Income from financial arrangements If the partnership or LTC was a party to a financial arrangement, such as government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts or deferred property settlements, you may have to calculate the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement using a spreading method, rather than on a cash basis. To work out if you must use a spreading method, please read "Financial arrangements" on pages 25 and 26. If the financial arrangement matures, is sold, remitted or transferred, you must do a "wash-up" calculation, known as a base price adjustment. Any RWT will be deducted on a cash basis. Show the RWT deducted and any income from the financial arrangement in Boxes 11A and 11B. Question 12 New Zealand dividends Dividends are the part of a company's profits that it passes on to its shareholders. Unit trusts are treated as companies for income tax purposes. Distributions from unit trusts will generally be taxable and are treated as dividends. Complete Question 12 if you received any New Zealand dividends, including dividends from your local electricity or gas supplier. Don't include a dividend that's a distribution of the trust's capital and is tax free. The company or unit trust that paid you the dividend will send you a dividend statement. Don't send in any dividend statements with your return, but keep them in case we ask for them later. Note If expenses are deductible against the dividend income (eg, commission), claim them at Question 23. Read the note about expenses on page 26. 9 ird.govt.nz Credits attached to dividends A New Zealand company or unit trust may attach several types of credits to dividends. "Imputation credits" are credits for part of the tax the company has already paid on its profits, which means the dividends aren't taxed twice. RWT is deducted from your dividend to bring the total credits withheld up to 33% of the gross dividend. What to show in your return Your dividend statements show the amount: • • you received (net dividend) • • of any imputation credits • • of any RWT credits. Add all these amounts together to work out your total gross dividends and enter this in Box 12B. Add up all the imputation credits and print the total in Box 12. Add any dividend RWT credits and print the total in Box 12A. Shares instead of dividends If the partnership or LTC received shares instead of dividends, include them as income at Question 12. Write the amount as if you received dividends instead of shares. Dividends from overseas Please read about overseas income on pages 14 to 17 of this guide. Question 13 Māori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. Fill in Question 13 if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE10 Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a "Māori authority credit". It is usually part of the tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits, which means the distributions aren't taxed twice. What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: • • the distribution made to you, including what portion is taxable and what portion is non-taxable • • Māori authority credit. Transfer these amounts, leaving out any non-taxable distributions, to the relevant boxes at Question 13. Example A Māori authority makes a pre-tax profit of $10,000. It pays tax on this profit of $1,750 (Māori authority tax rate of 17.5%) and distributes the entire profit to their 10 members. Each member will receive $825 as a cash distribution and $175 of Māori authority credits. Each member of the authority who has to file an IR7 return would show the following information at Question 13: Box 13A - $175 Box 13B - $1,000 (made up of $825 + $175) Non-taxable distribution You don't need to include in the IR7 return any other distributions received from a Māori authority that aren't taxable in the hands of a Māori authority member. These amounts are non-taxable distributions and can't have credits attached. For more information read our Māori authority guide - IR487. 11 ird.govt.nz Question 14 Income from another partnership If the partnership or LTC received any income or loss from another partnership, write the details at Question 14. Don't include any: • • interest and RWT - show these at Question 11 • • dividends, imputation credits, and dividend RWT - show these at Question 12 • • Māori authority distributions and credits - show these at Question 13 • • overseas income and any credits attached - show these at Question 16, see pages 14 to 17 • • residential property income - show this at Question 18, see page 18 • • other rental income - show this at Question 19, see page 21 • • taxable property sales/disposals - show this at Question 20, see page 22 • • other income - show this at Question 21, see pages 24 to 26. Add up all the other income from partnerships and include the total in Box 14B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up any other tax credits and include the total in Box 14A. Question 15 Income from another LTC If the LTC received income from another LTC, write the details at Question 15. Note A partnership does not receive income or deductions from an LTC. If two or more people jointly receive income or deductions from an LTC, they should show these on their own returns, not the partnership's return. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE12 LTCs are transparent (looked through), meaning the owners are treated as having received the income and incurred the loss of the company. The LTC will normally supply the information required to complete your return. Don't include any of the following types of income received from another LTC at Question 15: • • interest and RWT - show these at Question 11 • • dividends, imputation credits, and dividend RWT - show these at Question 12 • • Māori authority distributions and credits - show these at Question 13 • • overseas income and any credits attached - show these at Question 16, see pages 14 to 17 • • residential property income - show this at Question 18, see page 18 • • other rental income - show this at Question 19, see page 21 • • taxable property sales/disposals - show this at Question 20, see page 22 • • other income - show this at Question 21, see pages 24 to 26. Change to the loss limitation rule This rule limits the amount of deductions an owner can claim to the amount of their "owner's basis", which represents their economic interest in the LTC. The loss limitation rule no longer applies to most LTC owners. It continues to apply for owners of LTCs that are in a partnership or joint venture that includes another LTC. What to show on your return Add up all the other income from LTCs and include the total in Box 15B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up any other tax credits and include the total in Box 15A. Add up any non-allowable deductions this year from LTCs and include the total in Box 15C. 13 ird.govt.nz Note There shouldn't be non-allowable deductions this year unless the loss limitation rule still applies. If you had any non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year, you may be able to claim some, or all, of the brought forward amount this year. Print the amount claimable in Box 15D prior years' non-allowable deductions claimed this year. If you have an amount in Box 15C, add this to Box 15B and put the total in Box 15E. If you have an amount in Box 15D, subtract this from Box 15B and put the total in Box 15E. If you don't have any amounts in Box 15C or Box 15D, copy the amount from Box 15B into Box 15E. Box 15E is your adjusted LTC income. Question 16 Overseas income If the partnership or LTC received overseas income, eg, from interest or financial arrangements, show this at Question 16. Convert all overseas income and qualifying overseas tax paid to New Zealand dollars. You can do this by: • • using the rates available on ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators • • contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Tax paid overseas is distributed to the partners or owner(s) and the tax credit limit is calculated on the partner's or owner's income tax return. Keep evidence of overseas tax paid with your tax records for seven years. For more information about foreign tax credits read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461. If the income was received from a financial arrangement, please read our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 20, No 3 (April 2008). PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE14 Overseas dividends There are two situations covering the treatment of overseas dividends. Each owner or partner will need to determine which of the following applies to their share of foreign investments: • • If the shares have FIF income or loss calculated, don't include any dividends paid from these shares on the IR7 return. Instead, show the calculated FIF income or loss at Box 16B. • • If the shares are covered by one of the FIF exclusions (see page 16), show the dividends at Box 16B. Each owner or partner will need to advise their individual amount of either the FIF income or loss (or their FIF calculation method) or the dividend, to be included on the IR7 return. Show each owner's or partner's individual amount, plus any other allocation of overseas income, at Box 16B on the IR7 return and at Box 26F on the IR7L or IR7P form - see page 30. This information is also used in determining the income amount at Box 4 on page 36 of this guide. In either situation, include any qualifying overseas tax credits attached to the dividends at Box 16A. Some Australian dividends can have New Zealand imputation credits attached. Include these at Box 12. Please note you can't claim Australian franking credits. If the partnership or LTC received dividends from an overseas company through an agent or trustee who deducted RWT in New Zealand or dividends treated as interest, show the New Zealand RWT deducted at Box 12A. Note If you've shown an imputation credit in Box 12 or an RWT credit in Box 12A and there is no income associated to these in Box 12B, you'll need to attach a note to the top of page 3 of your return with the details. 15 ird.govt.nz Foreign investment fund (FIF) income or loss If at any time during the 2020 income year the partnership or LTC held rights like shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, foreign unit trust, foreign superannuation scheme or foreign life insurance policy, the partners or owner(s) may be required to calculate FIF income or loss in their own income tax return(s). Generally, the partners or owner(s) will use the fair dividend rate to calculate FIF income. The partners or owner(s) may also need to file an additional FIF disclosure form. See Question 27 on page 52. The main exclusions from an interest in a FIF are: • • investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts. Investments covered in the list are available in the Australian share exemption list - IR871 • • interest in certain Australian unit trusts • • limited exemptions for interest in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand) • • a 10% or greater interest in a CFC • • an individual or trustee of certain trusts, who is a partner or owner and holds, at all times in the income year, FIFs with a total cost of $50,000 or less. You can find more information on the exclusions and the FIF rules at ird.govt.nz/foreign-investment-funds and in our Tax Information Bulletins (TIBs) - see the online index for relevant issues. Controlled foreign company (CFC) income or loss If at any time during the 2020 income year the partnership or LTC has attributed CFC income or loss, the partners or owner(s) may be required to calculate this in their own income tax return(s). A loss from a CFC can't be used to offset domestic income or be included in domestic losses that are carried forward to the 2020 income year. Generally, these losses can PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE16 only offset income or future income from CFCs that are resident in the same country as the CFC that incurred the loss. The partners or owner(s) may also need to file an additional CFC disclosure form. See Question 27 on page 52. Question 17 Business income Write the net profit or loss in Box 17B. This is the amount of income or loss after deducting all allowable business expenditure. If this is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Refer to our Smart business - IR320 guide for information on allowable business expenditure and record keeping. Attach one of these to the top of page 3 of your return: • • a set of the partnership's or LTC's financial accounts • • a completed Financial statements summary - IR10 form • • a completed Farming income - IR3F form or Schedule of business income - IR3B form. If you complete an IR10, which speeds up the processing of the return, you don't need to send us your financial accounts as well, but keep them in case we ask for them later. Attribution rule Anyone who provides services and puts an intermediary between themselves and the recipient of the personal service has income earned allocated to them, not the intermediary. If this rule applies to persons associated to your partnership or LTC, it will affect the amount of taxable income in this return. When applying the attribution rule, LTCs are treated as associated entities and not as being transparent. To find out how to apply this rule, please read our Ta x Information Bulletins (TIBs), Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000), Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001), and Vol 21, No 8 Pt 2 (October/November 2009). If you need more information, please call us - see page 54. 17 ird.govt.nz Question 18 Income and expenditure from residential property This question applies to owners of residential rental property, including overseas property subject to the residential rental property deduction rules in subpart EL of the Income Tax Act 2007. Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules). The rules generally limit the amount of residential deductions you can claim in the year to the total amount of residential income earned in that year. If the residential property makes a loss it must be carried forward to the next year in which residential income, including income from properties held on revenue account, is earned. The residential property calculations are made at the partner or owner level as they may have other residential income and deductions that need to be included. There are two levels of exclusions from the rules. Any rental income or loss and net income or loss from a taxable disposal is fully excluded from the rules if the property is: • • the main home; • • property subject to the mixed-use asset rules (holiday home rented out part-time); • • property owned by companies other than close companies; • • property owned by government enterprises; • • certain employee accommodation. For these types of property, the existing rules apply with the rental income or loss shown at Box 19B and net income or net loss from a taxable disposal shown in Box 20B. Any rental net loss and net loss from a taxable disposal is partially excluded from the new rules if it is for: • • property that will always be taxed on sale, being revenue account property of a person in the business of building, developing or dealing in land; • • other revenue account property the person has notified us they want the exclusion to apply to. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE18 For these types of property any rental net loss is shown at Box 19B and taxable disposal net loss is shown at Box 20B. Net rental income and net income from a taxable disposal plus any depreciation recovered is shown as residential income at Box 18B. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide for information on when the rules apply, how to calculate your income, the amount of deductions you can claim this year, and the amount of any excess deductions that must be carried forward. The residential property deduction rules also apply to a partnership or LTC that has borrowed money to acquire an interest in certain entities with significant rental property holdings - a residential land-rich entity - and has interest expenditure on the borrowed money. Residential land-rich entity - a close company, partnership or LTC that holds more than 50% of its assets by value in residential land directly or indirectly. They come under the interposed entities rules as part of the residential property deduction rules. For more information about the interposed entity rules, see page 60 of the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No.8 September 2019. Completing Question 18 your return Tick the method/s you have used to calculate your residential property income and deductions. You use one of the following: • • Portfolio basis - combine the income and deductions for all rental properties in the portfolio. • • Individual, property-by-property basis - income and deductions of individual property calculated separately to other property. You need to maintain separate records for each property to choose this option. The details for each property need to be provided to the partners or owners. • • Combination of the property-by-property basis and portfolio basis - choose to apply different methods to different property. Some properties are held in a portfolio and others are held on property-by-property basis. 19 ird.govt.nz For a partnership most of the calculations for excess rental deductions are made in the partners return. The partnership needs to provide sufficient information for the partners to complete their return correctly. If a partner wants to use the individual method the partnership needs to maintain separate records for each rental property and pass each property’s details to the partner. For an LTC, the owners need to complete their return using the same method chosen by the LTC for their share of the income and deductions. An owner can choose a different method for other rental properties they own. Example An LTC uses the portfolio method. The portfolio was loss-making overall, so any shareholder who directly holds other residential properties subject to the ring- fencing rules can include those other properties as part of the portfolio. They can then use their share of the deductions that flow through from the LTC against their total residential income. This includes their residential income from the LTC and any other residentia;l income they derive. Example An LTC uses the property-by-property basis. The shareholders must also use this method in their own returns. So, if residential deductions for the property exceed the residential income from the property, the shareholder can only use their share of the deductions up to their share of the income from the property. Their excess deductions cannot be used against residential income from a property they own directly. The Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 can be used to calculate the information required to be shown in your return. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE20 Write the total residential income in Box 18B. This is the total of the following amounts: (a) all residential rental income from a portfolio and/or individual property; (b) all depreciation recovery income for assets disposed of from a portfolio and/or individual property; (c) net income from the taxable sale/disposal of a property in a portfolio and/or individual property; and (d) all net residential rental income, depreciation recovery income and net income from the taxable disposal of property from residential property excluded because it is held on revenue account. Only include the net income from a disposal once. Write the total eligible deductions for residential rental properties in Box 18C. Include the amount of any interest paid on an investment in a residential land rich entity that relates to residential rental activity in Box 18B. Include the amount of other interest paid in Box 19B. The partners or owners share of these are shown in boxes 26G and 26M on the IR7P or IR7L. Note If you have taxable net income from other residential properties outside the rules, such as net rental income from a property held on revenue account or net income from a taxable disposal, you can allocate this income across any rental properties with excess deductions and include it in Box 18B Total residential income. Question 19 Other rental activities income Write the net profit or loss (total rents minus expenses) in Box 19B. If this is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Only include net residential rental income or losses not covered by the residential property deduction rules such as commercial rental income. Do not include any residential rental income already included at Question 18. 21 ird.govt.nz Attach one of these to the top of page 3 of your return: • • a set of the partnership's or LTC's financial accounts • • a completed Financial statements summary - IR10 form • • a completed Rental income - IR3R form. Question 20 Income from taxable property sales/disposals Include all income from land sales that are excluded from the residential property deduction rules. Tax losses from disposals of residential property are also included under this question. Net income from a bright-line sale is included under Residential income at Question 18, except the main home and holiday home taxed under the mixed- use asset rules. The profits are taxable if the partnership or LTC: • • buys a property for the purpose or intention of resale • • buys and sells land and/or buildings as a business The profits may be taxable if the partnership or LTC: • • trades as a builder and improves a property before selling it • • develops or subdivides land and sells sections • • has a change of zoning on its property, and sells it within 10 years of buying it. If the partnership or LTC is a New Zealand tax resident it will need to pay tax on its worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales worldwide whether caught under the bright-line test for residential property sales or the other property rules. If the partnership or LTC purchased a residential property on or after 1 October 2015 and sold/disposed of it within the bright-line period, any profit will be taxable, whether the intention at the time of purchase was for resale or not. This is called the bright-line test. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE22 The bright-line period for: • • properties purchased/acquired on or after 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive, is two years, • • properties purchased/acquired on or after 29 March 2018 is five years. Write the income or loss (other than a bright-line income or loss) at Box 20B. For more information on property sales see our guide Buying and selling residential property - IR313. Complete a Property sale information - IR833 form for each property sold/disposed of and include it with the return. The form explains how to calculate and correctly return the resulting profit or loss. The form can be downloaded from our website ird.govt.nz Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts. Question 20A Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If a partner had RLWT deducted from the sale or transfer of a residential property located in New Zealand, they’ll need to show the full amount of the RLWT in their own individual income tax return. Don’t include it in the partnership tax credits. If the LTC is an “offshore RLWT person” and has sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. The LTC should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. The LTC can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the LTC and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than one amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to the LTC and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. 23 ird.govt.nz Question 21 Other income If you invested capital in a partnership or LTC but didn't take an active part in the day-to-day operation or management of the business, any earnings would be considered passive income. Enter this amount at Question 21 unless you’ve already included it at another Question on your return. Also at Question 21 show any other income the partnership or LTC received, eg, sale of: • • non-FIF shares or other property • • securities. If the partnership or LTC received any of the income listed above, please read the following. Income from sale of non-FIF shares or other property Profits from the sale of shares and other property are taxable if the partnership or LTC buys: • • and sells shares or other property as a business • • shares or other property for resale • • shares or property to make a profit. List the details of gross income and expenses from these sales on a separate sheet of paper and attach it to the top of page 3 of your IR7. Include the total profits in Box 21B. Selling or disposing of assets If the partnership or LTC sold or disposed of a depreciated asset for more than its adjusted tax value, you may need to account for depreciation recovered. You can use the depreciation calculator on our website ird.govt.nz to get a complete depreciation schedule for any asset. The schedule includes the amount to claim in the year of purchase and any adjustment in the year of sale. For further information please read Depreciation - a guide for businesses - IR260, and either Depreciation rates - IR265 or Historic depreciation rates - IR267. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE24 Losses from shares or other property If the partnership or LTC has made a loss and you can show that if the partnership or LTC had made a profit it would have been taxable, the partnership or LTC may be able to claim the loss as an expense. Include the total loss at Box 21B. Write the details of the loss on a separate sheet of paper and attach it to the top of page 3 of your IR7. Include details of other profits or losses made from similar sales, whether in this tax year or earlier. Financial arrangements A partner or owner must account for income from financial arrangements on an accrual basis. Financial arrangements include government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts and deferred property settlements. Changes to the rules for the treatment of financial arrangements have split the rules into two sets. Generally, the first set applies to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999 and the second applies to financial arrangements entered into, on or after that date. Both sets of rules require the income or expenditure to be spread over the term of the financial arrangement. Both sets of rules allow some exceptions from these spreading provisions if the partner or owner is a cash-basis holder (under the first set of rules), or a cash-basis person (under the second set of rules). The partner or owner is a cash-basis holder if, before 20 May 1999: • • they held financial arrangements of $600,000 or less in value, or • • the income derived from the financial arrangements was $70,000 or less, and • • the difference between the person's gross income calculated under the cash basis and that calculated under the accrual method is no more than $20,000. 25 ird.govt.nz The partner or owner is a cash-basis person if, from 20 May 1999: • • the value of all financial arrangements added together is less than $1 million, or • • the absolute value (the value no matter whether it's a positive or a negative figure) calculated under the accrual rules in the income year from the financial arrangement is less than $100,000, and • • in comparing the gross income and expenditure using a spreading method under the accrual rules with the cash-basis income and expenditure, the result is less than $40,000. To determine whether the partner or owner is a cash-basis holder or cash-basis person, they must take into account their share of the financial arrangement, or their share in the gross income or expenditure under the financial arrangement the partnership or LTC is a party to. Sale or maturity of financial arrangements Whether or not the exemption from the spreading methods applies, when a financial arrangement matures, is sold, remitted or transferred, you must do a "wash-up" calculation, known as a base price adjustment. The calculation ensures the total gains or losses from the financial arrangement are accounted for. If you need any information about calculating a base price adjustment, please call us on 0800 443 773. Loss carry-back Where on your return to claim loss carry-back You must let us know if you are going use the loss carry- back scheme. If you are a partnership or look-through company, each partner or shareholder needs to elect into the loss carry-back scheme. They can do this in the ‘I want to’ section of your income tax account in myIR and selecting “Opt-in to carry-back loss”. The income attributed from the partnership or look- through company will be reduced by the amount of loss carried back. The partnership or look-through company does not need to elect into the loss carry-back scheme. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE26 However, they will need to show the loss carried back in the IR7 return. Claiming a loss carry-back in 2019 from 2020 If the partnership or look-through company has a 2020 loss you want to carry back to 2019, enter the loss amount in box 21B (Other income) in the 2020 income tax return. You will then need to amend the 2019 IR7 income tax return (if already filed) to include the loss. Each partner or shareholder will be required to amend their own 2019 IR3 return with the reduced income allocation to obtain a refund of tax paid. In myIR they choose amendment reason “loss carry-back”. Select income type “you are claiming net losses brought forward” and enter their allocation of the loss carried- back in box 28B (Amount of loss claimed this year). Claiming a loss carry-back in 2020 from 2021 If the partnership or look-through company is estimating a loss in 2021 which they want to carry back, enter the estimated loss in box 21B as a loss (Total other income- if a loss put a minus sign in the last box). Each partner or shareholder will need to elect into the loss carry-back scheme and file their 2020 IR3 returns with their allocation of the expected loss in box 30B (Amount claimed this year). Question 23 Expenses The partnership or LTC may have incurred expenses in generating its income, for example: • • commission deducted from interest and dividends • • expenses for return preparation • • interest paid to Inland Revenue for late payment of tax in the income year it is paid. If the expenses have not already been claimed in the return, print the amount in Box 23. 27 ird.govt.nz Question 25 Deduction for losses extinguished on transition from a QC or LAQC If the partnership or LTC had losses which were extinguished on transitioning from a QC or LAQC, each owner or partner is allowed a deduction for an amount equal to the amount given by the following formula: (Loss balance extinguished − prior years' deductions) × partnership share or owner's effective interest Note This is limited to the partner's or owner's share of net partnership or net LTC income for the year. Loss balance extinguished is the loss balance extinguished on transition from a QC or LAQC. If it includes foreign losses please call us on 0800 377 774 to make sure they are accounted for correctly. Prior years' deductions is the total amount of deductions for extinguished losses allowed in previous income years for all persons with a share in the partnership, or an effective look-through interest in the LTC. If this is the first year deductions have been claimed for extinguished losses, the amount will be zero. Work out the maximum allowable deduction for each owner or partner using the calculation table below and on page 28. Boxes 1 to 3 only need to be completed once. Use the resulting figures for all owners or partners. Boxes 4 to 9 must be completed for each owner or partner using their information from the IR7L or IR7P. Loss balance extinguished (copy this figure to Box 25 on the IR7) 1 Prior years' deductions (copy this figure to Box 25A on the IR7) 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. 3 PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE28 If the answer in Box 3 is zero, no further deductions for extinguished losses can be claimed by the owners or partners. If it is greater than zero, continue below. Note Information on completing the IR7L is explained later in this guide. Attribution of income/loss is explained on page 29, and how to complete Box 26Q is explained on pages 31 to 38 of this guide. Copy the total income figure from Box 26K on the IR7L or IR7P to Box 4 4 For LTC owners, copy any non-allowable deductions this year from Box 26Q on the IR7L to Box 5 5 Add Boxes 4 and 5 and print the answer in Box 6. 6 If Box 6 is a loss, the owner or partner isn't entitled to a deduction this year. If it isn't a loss, continue below. Convert the owner's or partner's attribution of income/loss from Box 26B on the IR7L or IR7P to a decimal amount (eg, 40% = .40). Print the answer in Box 7. 7 Multiply Box 3 by Box 7 and print the answer in Box 8. 8 Print the amount from either Box 6 or Box 8, whichever is the lesser, in Box 9 below. This is the maximum deduction for the owner or partner. Maximum deduction 9 Copy the amount from Box 9 to Box 26L on the IR7L or IR7P form. Add up the maximum deductions for all owners or partners and print the answer in Box 25B of the IR7 return. 29 ird.govt.nz Question 26 Attribution of income/loss All income, losses and tax credits must be attributed to the partners or owners in proportion to their share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC. At Question 26 tick which entity the income/loss details are attached for. • • For partnerships, complete the IR7P to provide attribution details for all partners. • • For LTCs, complete the IR7L to provide attribution details for all owners. Show the details for each partner or owner on the relevant form. If there are more than two partners or owners use additional IR7P or IR7L forms. You can print them from our website ird.govt.nz as you need them. Attach all IR7P or IR7L forms to the top of page 3 of your IR7 return. Completing your IR7L or IR7P Box 26A IRD number Print the partner's or owner's IRD number. If you don't know their IRD number you will need to contact them to request it. Box 26B Attribution of income/loss Show the attribution of income or loss the partner or owner is entitled to as a percentage of the total. Write percentages as four-digit numbers, eg show 15% as 15.00. Note For LTCs with only one one owner the percentage will be a five-digit number, eg show 100% as 100.00. For LTCs, effective look-through interest determines each owner's attribution of income or loss from the LTC. Each owner's effective look-through interest is generally determined by the percentage of shares the owner has in t h e LTC . Please read our Look-through companies - IR879 guide if you need further information.

See the note on page 12. Non-allowable deductions this year There won't be non-allowable deductions this year as the loss limitation rule no longer applies. Do not include an amount in Box 26Q. Non-allowable deductions brought forward Note The LTC should have records of the non-allowable deductions brought forward. Prior years' non-allowable deductions claimed this year This will be the same as the amount in Box 26R and is the amount claimable this year. Copy the amount in Box 26R to Box 26S. Non-allowable deductions carried forward There should be no non-allowable deductions to carry forward. Leave Box 26S blank. Example 1 Loss limitation rule no longer applies - owner with previously non-allowable deductions The following details are for Catherine who owns all of the shares in Company A, an LTC. IRD number 12-121-212 Total gross income $10,000 Expenses/deductions $15,000 Loss $5,000 Non-allowable deductions brought forward $10,000 PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE32 Boxes 26Q to 26T Non-allowable deductions (IR7L only) - where loss limitation rule still applies for the owners(s) Note This information only applies for an LTC that is in a partnership or joint venture with another LTC. The loss limitation rule ensures that the deductions claimed reflect the level of an owner's economic loss in the LTC. The "owner's basis" refers to the adjusted tax book value of an owner's investment in the LTC. The deductions an owner can claim are restricted if the overall deductions exceed the owner's basis in the LTC. See examples of the loss limitation rule on pages 38 to 53. Note For each owner calculate their owner's basis and any non-allowable deductions using the tables and information on pages 36 and 37. Please see Part 7 of our Look-through companies - IR879 guide before calculating the owner's basis. It explains the terms used in the following calculation. If there's more than one owner, complete the tables on pages 36 and 37 for each owner separately. 33 ird.govt.nz Calculate the owner's basis here: Investments 1 Distributions 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 3 Income 4 Add Boxes 3 and 4 5 Deductions from previous tax years (but excluding any non-allowable deductions in those years) 6 Subtract Box 6 from Box 5 7 Disallowed amounts 8 Subtract Box 8 from Box 7\* 9 \* If Box 9 is a negative amount it means the owner has negative equity in the LTC and their owner's basis will be treated as nil. Print "0.00" in Box 9. Please note - deductions in Box 6 above also includes all the deductions claimed against gross income from the LTC from all sources in previous years in which the company was an LTC. For example, if the LTC has a rental property, all the deductions claimable against the rental income will be included in the total deductions figure, as well as expenses incurred in producing income from all other sources. When each owner's basis (Box 9 on this page) has been calculated you can work out if there is any limitation on the deductions claimable for each owner. If the: • • owner's basis (Box 9) is more than their attribution of the deductions (expenses), you won't need to complete Box 26Q - go to Non-allowable deductions. • • attribution of deductions (expenses) to the owners are more than their owner's basis you'll need to complete Boxes 1 to 3 below to calculate the amount to declare at Box 26Q. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE34 Attribution of this year's deductions (expenses) 1 Owner's basis (from Box 9 on page 36) 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 3 The result is non-allowable deductions this year. Copy the amount from Box 3 into Box 26Q on your IR7L. Any deductions an owner can't claim because of the loss limitation rule are carried forward and may be claimed in future years, subject to the application of the loss limitation rule in those years. Owners may only use these deductions against income from the LTC. Non-allowable deductions Complete the calculation (Boxes 1 to 5) on this page if you have: • • non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year (copy the amount from Box 24R Non-allowable deductions on your IR7L 2019 form into Box 26R on your IR7L 2020 form) and/or • • non-allowable deductions this year (that means Box 26Q has an amount in it). Non-allowable deductions brought forward (also show this amount in Box 26R). 1 Non-allowable deductions this year (Box 3 on page 37, put zero if you don't have non-allowable deductions) 2 Add Boxes 1 and 2. 3 If your Owner's basis (Box 9 on page 36) was more than your attribution of this year's deductions (expenses), copy the difference to Box 4, otherwise print $0.00. 4 Subtract Box 4 from Box 3 (print $0.00 if this would equal a negative value). 5 35 ird.govt.nz Prior years' non-allowable deductions claimable this year If there is a figure in Box 4, you will be able to claim prior years' non-allowable deductions. Enter the smaller number of Box 3 and Box 4 as prior years' non-allowable deductions claimed this year in Box 26S on your IR7L. Non-allowable deductions carried forward The amount in Box 5 is the non-allowable deductions to carry forward. Copy this amount into Box 26T. Example 2 LTC loss limitation rule - current year non-allowable deductions only The following details are for Company A which is an LTC: IRD number 12-345-678 Total gross income $6,000 Expenses/deductions $10,000 Loss $4,000 One owner (shareholder): Sam (100%) IRD number 91-111-213 Sam's owner's basis $5,500.00 Note: Company A is in a partnership with another LTC.

The partnership or LTC is not assessed for tax, but each partner or owner is liable for tax on their share of income from the partnership or LTC. Each partner or owner must complete an individual tax return showing all income, including their share from the partnership or LTC. Return due date If the partnership or LTC has a 31 March balance date, you have until 7 July 2021 to send in the return, unless you've been granted an extension of time. If you have an agent or a balance date other than 31 March this date may be different. Business industry classification (BIC) code We're lawfully required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. If your BIC code is not preprinted on the return or is different from the preprinted one, please enter the correct code. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to businessdescription.co.nz or call ACC on 0508 426 837. It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. Please provide the code only. Do not provide a description. 5 ird.govt.nz Has the partnership or LTC ceased? If this is the final return, include a set of accounts (if required) up to the date the partnership or LTC ceased. Also include details of any distribution of assets and liabilities. If the partnership or LTC is registered for GST or as an employer, you will also need to complete a Business cessation - IR315 form to finalise your records. Depending on the partnership's or LTC's circumstances, other issues may also need to be finalised, for example outstanding returns and/or arrears. Find out how to finalise the partnership's or LTC's tax accounts or deregister for GST at ird.govt.nz Note An LTC is still a legal entity until it's taken off the Companies Register. An LTC can stop trading but still have tax obligations, for example completing returns. Nil returns Every partnership and LTC must complete an income tax return, whether or not it has been active. If there is no gross income to declare, losses to claim, and no disclosures to make at Question 27 (read page 50) you can complete a nil return. Complete the return up to Question 9 and sign the declaration at Question 28. For more information on look-through company rules, read our Look-through companies - IR879 guide. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE6 Questions Question 10 Schedular payments If the partnership or LTC has received schedular payments, we'll send you a Summary of income, detailing the payments received and the tax deducted. From your Summary of income, copy the total tax deducted into Box 10A and gross payments into Box 10B. The Summary of income may not contain all your earnings information. If any details are missing, please include them at Question 10. If the partnership or LTC is registered for GST, your gross schedular payments should not include any GST. If they do, show the gross payments at Question 10 and deduct the GST portion at Question 23. Question 11 New Zealand interest Include interest from all New Zealand sources at Question 11. The interest payer will usually send you an RWT withholding certificate - IR15, showing the gross interest paid and the amount of RWT deducted. Write the total of all RWT deducted in Box 11A. Add up all the gross interest amounts (before the deduction of any tax) and write the total in Box 11B. Note If expenses are deductible against the interest income (for example commission), claim them at Question 23. Read the note about expenses on page 26. Do not send us interest statements or IR15 certificates with the return. Keep these in case we ask for them later. 7 ird.govt.nz Interest on broken term deposits If you've broken a term deposit during the year, you may have to account for "negative interest". This is interest repaid on a term deposit and may reduce the amount of interest to declare in your return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest shown on the IR15 or equivalent statement. Deduct the allowable negative interest component, using the worksheet below, before entering the gross amount at Question 11 of your return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a later return when the term deposit matures. Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your RWT on interest form to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you've paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. 3 Copy this amount to Box 11B of your tax return. Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we paid you interest, include it in Box 11B for the income year the partnership or LTC received the interest. If the partnership or LTC paid us interest, include it as a deduction in Box 23 of the return for the income year the interest is paid. Read about expenses on page 26. Interest from overseas If the partnership or LTC received interest from overseas, convert your overseas interest and tax credits to New Zealand dollars and show the amounts at Question 16. Please read the notes about overseas income on pages 13 to 16. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE8 Income from financial arrangements If the partnership or LTC was a party to a financial arrangement, such as government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts or deferred property settlements, you may have to calculate the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement using a spreading method, rather than on a cash basis. To work out if you must use a spreading method, please read Financial arrangements on pages 24 to 25. If the financial arrangement matures, is sold, remitted or transferred, you must do a "wash-up" calculation known as a base price adjustment. Any RWT will be deducted on a cash basis. Show the RWT deducted and any income from the financial arrangement in Boxes 11A and 11B. Question 12 New Zealand dividends Dividends are the part of a company's profits that it passes on to its shareholders. Unit trusts are treated as companies for income tax purposes. Distributions from unit trusts will generally be taxable and are treated as dividends. Complete Question 12 if you received any New Zealand dividends, including dividends from your local electricity or gas supplier. Do not include a dividend that's a distribution of the trust's capital and is tax free. The company or unit trust that paid you the dividend will send you a dividend statement. Do not send us any dividend statements with the return. Keep these in case we ask for them later. Note If expenses are deductible against the dividend income (for example commission), claim them at Question 23. Read the note about expenses on page 26. 9 ird.govt.nz Credits attached to dividends A New Zealand company or unit trust may attach several types of credits to dividends. Imputation credits are credits for part of the tax the company has already paid on its profits, which means the dividends are not taxed twice. RWT is deducted from your dividend to bring the total credits withheld up to 33% of the gross dividend. What to show in your return Your dividend statements show the amount: • • you received (net dividend) • • of any imputation credits, and • • of any RWT credits. Add all these amounts together to work out your total gross dividends and enter this in Box 12B. Add up all the imputation credits and print the total in Box 12. Add any dividend RWT credits and print the total in Box 12A. Shares instead of dividends If the partnership or LTC received shares instead of dividends, include them as income at Question 12. Write the amount as if you received dividends instead of shares. Dividends from overseas Please read about overseas income on pages 14 to 16 of this guide. Question 13 Māori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. Fill in Question 13 if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE10 Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a Māori authority credit and is part of the tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits, so the distributions are not taxed twice. What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: • • the distribution made to you, including the taxable portion and the non-taxable portion, and • • Māori authority credit. Transfer these amounts, leaving out any non-taxable distributions, to the relevant boxes at Question 13. Example A Māori authority makes a pre-tax profit of $10,000. It pays tax on this profit of $1,750 (Māori authority tax rate of 17.5%) and distributes the entire profit to their 10 members. Each member will receive $825 as a cash distribution and $175 of Māori authority credits. Each member of the authority liable to complete an IR7 return would show the following information at Question 13: Box 13A - $175 Box 13B - $1,000 (made up of $825 + $175) Non-taxable distribution You do not need to include in the IR7 return any other distributions received from a Māori authority that are not taxable in the hands of a Māori authority member. These amounts are non-taxable distributions and cannot have credits attached. For more information read our Māori authority guide - IR487. 11 ird.govt.nz Question 14 Income from another partnership If the partnership or LTC received any income or loss from another partnership, write the details at Question 14. Do not include any: • • interest and RWT - show these at Question 11 • • dividends, imputation credits, and dividend RWT - show these at Question 12 • • Māori authority distributions and credits - show these at Question 13 • • overseas income and any credits attached - show these at Question 16, see pages 13 to 16 • • residential property income - show this at Question 18, see page 17 • • other rental income - show this at Question 19, see pages 20 to 21 • • taxable property sales/disposals - show this at Question 20, see page 21 • • other income - show this at Question 21, see pages 23 to 26. Add up all the other income from partnerships and include the total in Box 14B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up any other tax credits and include the total in Box 14A. Question 15 Income from another LTC If the LTC received income from another LTC, write the details at Question 15. Note A partnership does not receive income or deductions from an LTC. If 2 or more people jointly receive income or deductions from an LTC, they should show these on their own returns, not the partnership's return. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE12 LTCs are transparent (looked through), meaning the owners are treated as having received the income and incurred the loss of the company. The LTC will normally supply the information required to complete your return. Do not include any of the following types of income received from another LTC at Question 15: • • interest and RWT - show these at Question 11 • • dividends, imputation credits, and dividend RWT - show these at Question 12 • • Māori authority distributions and credits - show these at Question 13 • • overseas income and any credits attached - show these at Question 16, see pages 13 to 16 • • residential property income - show this at Question 18, see pages 17 to 18 • • other rental income - show this at Question 19, see pages 20 to 21 • • taxable property sales/disposals - show this at Question 20, see pages 21 to 22 • • other income - show this at Question 21, see pages 23 to 26. Change to the loss limitation rule This rule limits the amount of deductions an owner can claim to the amount of their owner's basis, which represents their economic interest in the LTC. The loss limitation rule no longer applies to most LTC owners. It continues to apply for owners of LTCs that are in a partnership or joint venture that includes another LTC. What to show on your return Add up all the other income from LTCs and include the total in Box 15B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up any other tax credits and include the total in Box 15A. Add up any non-allowable deductions this year from LTCs and include the total in Box 15C. 13 ird.govt.nz Note There should not be non-allowable deductions this year unless the loss limitation rule still applies. If you had any non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year, you may be able to claim some, or all, of the brought forward amount this year. Print the amount claimable in Box 15D prior years' non-allowable deductions claimed this year. If you have an amount in Box 15C, add this to Box 15B and put the total in Box 15E. If you have an amount in Box 15D, subtract this from Box 15B and put the total in Box 15E. If you do not have any amounts in Box 15C or Box 15D, copy the amount from Box 15B into Box 15E. Box 15E is your adjusted LTC income. Question 16 Overseas income If the partnership or LTC received overseas income, for example from interest or financial arrangements, show this at Question 16. Convert all overseas income and qualifying overseas tax paid to New Zealand dollars. You can do this by: • • using the rates available on ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators • • contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Tax paid overseas is distributed to the partners or owners and the tax credit limit is calculated on the partner's or owner's income tax return. Keep evidence of overseas tax paid with your tax records for 7 years. For more information about foreign tax credits read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461. If the income was received from a financial arrangement, please read our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 20, No 3 (April 2008). PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE14 Overseas dividends There are 2 situations covering the treatment of overseas dividends. Each owner or partner will need to determine which of the following applies to their share of foreign investments: • • If the shares have FIF income or loss calculated, do not include any dividends paid from these shares on the IR7 return. Instead, show the calculated FIF income or loss at Box 16B. • • If the shares are covered by 1 of the FIF exclusions (see page 15), show the dividends at Box 16B. Each owner or partner will need to advise their individual amount of either the FIF income or loss (or their FIF calculation method) or the dividend, to be included on the IR7 return. Show each owner's or partner's individual amount, plus any other allocation of overseas income, at Box 16B on the IR7 return and at Box 26F on the IR7L or IR7P form - see page 30. This information is also used in determining the income amount at Box 4 on page 33 of this guide. In either situation, include any qualifying overseas tax credits attached to the dividends at Box 16A. Some Australian dividends can have New Zealand imputation credits attached. Include these at Box 12. Note you cannot claim Australian franking credits. If the partnership or LTC received dividends from an overseas company through an agent or trustee who deducted RWT in New Zealand or dividends treated as interest, show the New Zealand RWT deducted at Box 12A. Note If you've shown an imputation credit in Box 12 or an RWT credit in Box 12A and there is no income associated to these in Box 12B, you'll need to attach a note to the top of page 3 of your return with the details. 15 ird.govt.nz Foreign investment fund (FIF) income or loss If at any time during the 2021 income year the partnership or LTC held rights like shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, foreign unit trust, foreign superannuation scheme or foreign life insurance policy, the partners or owners may be required to calculate FIF income or loss in their own income tax returns. Generally, the partners or owners will use the fair dividend rate to calculate FIF income. The partners or owners may also need to complete an additional FIF disclosure form. See Question 27 on page 50. The main exclusions from an interest in a FIF are: • • investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts. Investments covered in the list are available in the Australian share exemption list - IR871 • • interest in certain Australian unit trusts • • limited exemptions for interest in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand) • • a 10% or greater interest in a CFC • • an individual or trustee of certain trusts, who is a partner or owner and holds, at all times in the income year, FIFs with a total cost of $50,000 or less. You can find more information on the exclusions and the FIF rules at ird.govt.nz/foreign-investment-funds and in our Tax Information Bulletins (TIBs) - see the online index for relevant issues. Controlled foreign company (CFC) income or loss If at any time during the 2021 income year the partnership or LTC has attributed CFC income or loss, the partners or owners may be required to calculate this in their own income tax returns. A loss from a CFC cannot be used to offset domestic income or be included in domestic losses that are carried forward to the 2021 income year. Generally, these losses PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE16 can only offset income or future income from CFCs that are resident in the same country as the CFC that incurred the loss. The partners or owners may also need to complete an additional CFC disclosure form. See Question 27 on page 50. Question 17 Business income Write the net profit or loss in Box 17B. This is the amount of income or loss after deducting all allowable business expenditure. If this is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Refer to our Smart business - IR320 guide for information on allowable business expenditure and record keeping. Attach 1 of these to the top of page 3 of your return: • • a set of the partnership's or LTC's financial accounts • • a completed Financial statements summary - IR10 form • • a completed Farming income - IR3F form, or Schedule of business income - IR3B form. If you complete an IR10, which speeds up the processing of the return, you do not need to send us your financial accounts as well, but keep them in case we ask for them later. Attribution rule Anyone who provides services and puts an intermediary between themselves and the recipient of the personal service has income earned allocated to them, not the intermediary. If this rule applies to persons associated to your partnership or LTC, it will affect the amount of taxable income in this return. When applying the attribution rule, LTCs are treated as associated entities and not as being transparent. To find out how to apply this rule, please read our Ta x Information Bulletins (TIBs), Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000), Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001), and Vol 21, No 8 Pt 2 (October/November 2009). If you need more information, contact us - see page 52. 17 ird.govt.nz Question 18 Income and expenditure from residential property This question applies to owners of residential rental property, including overseas property subject to the residential rental property deduction rules in subpart EL of the Income Tax Act 2007. Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules). The rules generally limit the amount of residential deductions you can claim in the year to the total amount of residential income earned in that year. If the residential property makes a loss it must be carried forward to the next year in which residential income, including income from properties held on revenue account, is earned. The residential property calculations are made at the partner or owner level as they may have other residential income and deductions that need to be included. There are 2 levels of exclusions from the rules. Any rental income or loss and net income or loss from a taxable disposal is fully excluded from the rules if the property is: • • the main home • • property subject to the mixed-use asset rules (holiday home rented out part-time) • • property owned by companies other than close companies • • property owned by government enterprises • • certain employee accommodation. For these types of property, the existing rules apply with the rental income or loss shown at Box 19B and net income or net loss from a taxable disposal shown in Box 20B. Any rental net loss and net loss from a taxable disposal is partially excluded from the new rules if it is for: • • property that will always be taxed on sale, being revenue account property of a person in the business of building, developing or dealing in land • • other revenue account property the person has notified us they want the exclusion to apply to. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE18 For these types of property any rental net loss is shown at Box 19B and taxable disposal net loss is shown at Box 20B. Net rental income and net income from a taxable disposal plus any depreciation recovered is shown as residential income at Box 18B. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide for information on when the rules apply, how to calculate your income, the amount of deductions you can claim this year, and the amount of any excess deductions that must be carried forward. The residential property deduction rules also apply to a partnership or LTC that has borrowed money to acquire an interest in certain entities with significant rental property holdings - a residential land-rich entity - and has interest expenditure on the borrowed money. Residential land-rich entity - a close company, partnership or LTC that holds more than 50% of its assets by value in residential land directly or indirectly. They come under the interposed entities rules as part of the residential property deduction rules. For more information about the interposed entity rules, see page 60 of the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No.8 September 2019. Completing Question 18 your return Tick the method you used to calculate your residential property income and deductions. You use 1 of the following: • • Portfolio basis - combine the income and deductions for all rental properties in the portfolio. • • Individual, property-by-property basis - income and deductions of individual property calculated separately to other property. You need to maintain separate records for each property to choose this option. The details for each property need to be provided to the partners or owners. • • Combination of the property-by-property basis and portfolio basis - choose to apply different methods to different property. Some properties are held in a portfolio and others are held on property-by-property basis. 19 ird.govt.nz For a partnership most of the calculations for excess rental deductions are made in the partners return. The partnership needs to provide sufficient information for the partners to complete their return correctly. If a partner wants to use the individual method the partnership needs to maintain separate records for each rental property and pass each property’s details to the partner. For an LTC, the owners need to complete their return using the same method chosen by the LTC for their share of the income and deductions. An owner can choose a different method for other rental properties they own. Example An LTC uses the portfolio method. The portfolio was loss-making overall, so any shareholder who directly holds other residential properties subject to the ring- fencing rules can include those other properties as part of the portfolio. They can then use their share of the deductions that flow through from the LTC against their total residential income. This includes their residential income from the LTC and any other residential income they derive. Example An LTC uses the property-by-property basis. The shareholders must also use this method in their own returns. So, if residential deductions for the property exceed the residential income from the property, the shareholder can only use their share of the deductions up to their share of the income from the property. Their excess deductions cannot be used against residential income from a property they own directly. The Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 can be used to calculate the information required to be shown in your return. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE20 Write the total residential income in Box 18B. This is the total of the following amounts: (a) all residential rental income from a portfolio and/or individual property (b) all depreciation recovery income for assets disposed of from a portfolio and/or individual property (c) net income from the taxable sale/disposal of a property in a portfolio and/or individual property, and (d) all net residential rental income, depreciation recovery income and net income from the taxable disposal of property from residential property excluded because it is held on revenue account. Only include the net income from a disposal once. Write the total eligible deductions for residential rental properties in Box 18C. Include the amount of any interest paid on an investment in a residential land rich entity that relates to residential rental activity in Box 18B. Include the amount of other interest paid in Box 19B. The partners or owners share of these are shown in boxes 26G and 26M on the IR7P or IR7L. Note If you have taxable net income from other residential properties outside the rules, such as net rental income from a property held on revenue account or net income from a taxable disposal, you can allocate this income across any rental properties with excess deductions and include it in Box 18B Total residential income. Question 19 Other rental activities income Write the net profit or loss (total rents minus expenses) in Box 19B. If this is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Only include net residential rental income or losses not covered by the residential property deduction rules such as commercial rental income. Do not include any residential rental income already included at Question 18. 21 ird.govt.nz Attach 1 of these to the top of page 3 of your return: • • a set of the partnership's or LTC's financial accounts • • a completed Financial statements summary - IR10 form, or • • a completed Rental income - IR3R form. Question 20 Income from taxable property sales/disposals Include all income from land sales that are excluded from the residential property deduction rules. Tax losses from disposals of residential property are also included under this question. Net income from a bright-line sale is included under Residential income at Question 18, except the main home and holiday home taxed under the mixed- use asset rules. The profits are taxable if the partnership or LTC: • • buys a property for the purpose or intention of resale • • buys and sells land and/or buildings as a business. The profits may be taxable if the partnership or LTC: • • trades as a builder and improves a property before selling it • • develops or subdivides land and sells sections, or • • has a change of zoning on its property, and sells it within 10 years of buying it. If the partnership or LTC is a New Zealand tax resident it will need to pay tax on its worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales worldwide whether caught under the bright-line test for residential property sales or the other property rules. If the partnership or LTC purchased a residential property on or after 1 October 2015 and sold/disposed of it within the bright-line period, any profit will be taxable, whether the intention at the time of purchase was for resale or not. This is called the bright-line test. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE22 The bright-line period for: • • properties purchased/acquired on or after 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive, is 2 years • • properties purchased/acquired on or after 29 March 2018 is 5 years. Write the income or loss (other than a bright-line income or loss) at Box 20B. For more information on property sales see our guide Buying and selling residential property - IR313. Complete a Property sale information - IR833 form for each property sold/disposed of and include it with the return. The form explains how to calculate and correctly return the resulting profit or loss. The form can be downloaded from our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts. Question 20A Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If a partner had RLWT deducted from the sale or transfer of a residential property located in New Zealand, they’ll need to show the full amount of the RLWT in their own individual income tax return. Do not include it in the partnership tax credits. If the LTC is an “offshore RLWT person” and has sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. The LTC should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. The LTC can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the LTC and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than 1 amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to the LTC and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. 23 ird.govt.nz Question 21 Other income If you invested capital in a partnership or LTC but did not take an active part in the day-to-day operation or management of the business, any earnings would be considered passive income. Enter this amount at Question 21 unless you’ve already included it at another Question on your return. Also at Question 21 show any other income the partnership or LTC received, for example sale of: • • non-FIF shares or other property • • securities. If the partnership or LTC received any of the income listed above, please read the following. Income from sale of non-FIF shares or other property Profits from the sale of shares and other property are taxable if the partnership or LTC buys: • • and sells shares or other property as a business • • shares or other property for resale, or • • shares or property to make a profit. List the details of gross income and expenses from these sales on a separate sheet of paper and attach it to the top of page 3 of your IR7. Include the total profits in Box 21B. Selling or disposing of assets If the partnership or LTC sold or disposed of a depreciated asset for more than its adjusted tax value, you may need to account for depreciation recovered. You can use the depreciation calculator on our website ird.govt.nz to get a complete depreciation schedule for any asset. The schedule includes the amount to claim in the year of purchase and any adjustment in the year of sale. For more information read Depreciation - a guide for businesses - IR260, and either Depreciation rates - IR265 or Historic depreciation rates - IR267. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE24 Losses from shares or other property If the partnership or LTC has made a loss and you can show that if the partnership or LTC had made a profit it would have been taxable, the partnership or LTC may be able to claim the loss as an expense. Include the total loss at Box 21B. Write the details of the loss on a separate sheet of paper and attach it to the top of page 3 of your IR7. Include details of other profits or losses made from similar sales, whether in this tax year or earlier. Financial arrangements A partner or owner must account for income from financial arrangements on an accrual basis. Financial arrangements include government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts and deferred property settlements. Changes to the rules for the treatment of financial arrangements have split the rules into 2 sets. Generally, the first set applies to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999 and the second applies to financial arrangements entered into, on or after that date. Both sets of rules require the income or expenditure to be spread over the term of the financial arrangement. Both sets of rules allow some exceptions from these spreading provisions if the partner or owner is a cash-basis holder (under the first set of rules), or a cash-basis person (under the second set of rules). The partner or owner is a cash-basis holder if, before 20 May 1999: • • they held financial arrangements of $600,000 or less in value, or • • the income derived from the financial arrangements was $70,000 or less, and • • the difference between the person's gross income calculated under the cash basis and that calculated under the accrual method is no more than $20,000. 25 ird.govt.nz The partner or owner is a cash-basis person if, from 20 May 1999: • • the value of all financial arrangements added together is less than $1 million, or • • the absolute value (the value no matter whether it's a positive or a negative figure) calculated under the accrual rules in the income year from the financial arrangement is less than $100,000, and • • in comparing the gross income and expenditure using a spreading method under the accrual rules with the cash-basis income and expenditure, the result is less than $40,000. To determine whether the partner or owner is a cash-basis holder or cash-basis person, they must take into account their share of the financial arrangement, or their share in the gross income or expenditure under the financial arrangement the partnership or LTC is a party to. Sale or maturity of financial arrangements Whether or not the exemption from the spreading methods applies, when a financial arrangement matures, is sold, remitted or transferred, you must do a "wash-up" calculation, known as a base price adjustment. The calculation ensures the total gains or losses from the financial arrangement are accounted for. If you need any information about calculating a base price adjustment, call us on 0800 443 773. Loss carry-back Each partner or shareholder must decide if they will carry back their share of any loss and include it in their own income tax return. The partnership or look-through company does not need to elect into the loss carry-back scheme. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE26 Question 23 Expenses The partnership or LTC may have incurred expenses in generating its income, for example: • • commission deducted from interest and dividends • • expenses for return preparation, or • • interest paid to Inland Revenue for late payment of tax in the income year it is paid. If the expenses have not already been claimed in the return, print the amount in Box 23. 27 ird.govt.nz Question 25 Deduction for losses extinguished on transition from a QC or LAQC If the partnership or LTC had losses which were extinguished on transitioning from a QC or LAQC, each owner or partner is allowed a deduction for an amount equal to the amount given by the following formula: (Loss balance extinguished − prior years' deductions) × partnership share or owner's effective interest Note This is limited to the partner's or owner's share of net partnership or net LTC income for the year. Loss balance extinguished is the loss balance extinguished on transition from a QC or LAQC. If it includes foreign losses please contact us to make sure they are accounted for correctly. Prior years' deductions is the total amount of deductions for extinguished losses allowed in previous income years for all persons with a share in the partnership, or an effective look-through interest in the LTC. If this is the first year deductions have been claimed for extinguished losses, the amount will be zero. Work out the maximum allowable deduction for each owner or partner using the calculation table below and on page 28. Boxes 1 to 3 only need to be completed once. Use the resulting figures for all owners or partners. Boxes 4 to 9 must be completed for each owner or partner using their information from the IR7L or IR7P. Loss balance extinguished (copy this figure to Box 25 on the IR7) 1 Prior years' deductions (copy this figure to Box 25A on the IR7) 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. 3 PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE28 If the answer in Box 3 is zero, no further deductions for extinguished losses can be claimed by the owners or partners. If it is greater than zero, continue below. Note Information on completing the IR7L is explained later in this guide. Attribution of income/loss is explained on page 29, and how to complete Box 26Q is explained on pages 31 to 38 of this guide. Copy the total income figure from Box 26K on the IR7L or IR7P to Box 4 4 For LTC owners, copy any non-allowable deductions this year from Box 26Q on the IR7L to Box 5 5 Add Boxes 4 and 5 and print the answer in Box 6. 6 If Box 6 is a loss, the owner or partner is not entitled to a deduction this year. If it is not a loss, continue below. Convert the owner's or partner's attribution of income/loss from Box 26B on the IR7L or IR7P to a decimal amount (for example 40% = .40). Print the answer in Box 7. 7 Multiply Box 3 by Box 7 and print the answer in Box 8. 8 Print the amount from either Box 6 or Box 8, whichever is the lesser, in Box 9 below. This is the maximum deduction for the owner or partner. Maximum deduction 9 Copy the amount from Box 9 to Box 26L on the IR7L or IR7P form. Add up the maximum deductions for all owners or partners and print the answer in Box 25B of the IR7 return. 29 ird.govt.nz Question 26 Attribution of income/loss All income, losses and tax credits must be attributed to the partners or owners in proportion to their share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC. At Question 26 tick which entity the income/loss details are attached for. • • partnerships, complete the IR7P to provide attribution details for all partners, or • • LTCs, complete the IR7L to provide attribution details for all owners. Show the details for each partner or owner on the relevant form. If there are more than 2 partners or owners, use additional IR7P or IR7L forms. You can print them from our website ird.govt.nz Attach all IR7P or IR7L forms to the top of page 3 of your IR7 return. Completing your IR7L or IR7P Box 26A IRD number Print the partner's or owner's IRD number. If you do not know their IRD number you will need to contact them to request it. Box 26B Attribution of income/loss Show the attribution of income or loss the partner or owner is entitled to as a percentage of the total. Write percentages as four-digit numbers, for example show 15% as 15.00. Note For LTCs with only 1 owner the percentage will be a five-digit number, for example show 100% as 100.00. For LTCs, effective look-through interest determines each owner's attribution of income or loss from the LTC. Each owner's effective look-through interest is generally determined by the percentage of shares the owner has in t h e LTC . For more information read our Look-through companies - IR879 guide PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE30 Boxes 26C to 26J Attributed income/loss Print the partner's or owner's attribution of: • • interest (from Question 11) in Box 26C • • dividends (from Question 12) in Box 26D • • Māori authority distributions (from Question 13) in Box 26E • • overseas income (from Question 16) in Box 26F • • residential income (from Question 18) in Box 26G • • other rental income (from Question 19) in Box 26H • • other passive income (from Questions 20 and 21 minus any relevant expenses at Question 23, including income received by a non-active partner or owner in the business) in Box 26I • • all other income and expenses (not already included in Boxes 26C to 24I) in Box 26J. Box 26K Total income Print the total of all Boxes 26C, 26D, 26E, 26F, 26G, 26H, 26I and 26J in Box 26K. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Note The totals of all partners' or owners' Box 26Ks must add up to the IR7 income or loss shown in Box 24. If they do not, it will take us longer to process your return. Box 26L Deduction for extinguished losses See instructions on pages 27 to 28 of this guide. Box 26M Residential rental deductions Print the partner’s or owner’s attribution in Box 26M. Boxes 26N, 26O and 26P Attributed tax credits Print the partner's or owner's attribution of: overseas tax paid (from Question 16) in Box 26N • • imputation credits (from Question 12) in Box 26O • • other tax credits (from Questions 10 to 15, excluding any imputation credits) in Box 26P. 31 ird.govt.nz Boxes 26Q to 26T Non-allowable deductions (IR7L only) - where loss limitation rule does not apply for the owner(s) Note This information applies for an LTC who is not subject to the loss limitation rule. See the note on page 12. Non-allowable deductions this year There will not be non-allowable deductions this year as the loss limitation rule no longer applies. Do not include an amount in Box 26Q. Non-allowable deductions brought forward Note The LTC should have records of the non-allowable deductions brought forward. Prior years' non-allowable deductions claimed this year This will be the same as the amount in Box 26R and is the amount claimable this year. Copy the amount in Box 26R to Box 26S. Non-allowable deductions carried forward There should be no non-allowable deductions to carry forward. Leave Box 26S blank. Example 1 Loss limitation rule no longer applies - owner with previously non-allowable deductions The following details are for Catherine who owns all of the shares in Company A, an LTC. IRD number 12-121-212 Total gross income $10,000 Expenses/deductions $15,000 Loss $5,000 Non-allowable deductions brought forward $10,000 PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE32 Boxes 26Q to 26T Non-allowable deductions (IR7L only) - where loss limitation rule still applies for the owners Note This information only applies for an LTC that is in a partnership or joint venture with another LTC. The loss limitation rule ensures that the deductions claimed reflect the level of an owner's economic loss in the LTC. The "owner's basis" refers to the adjusted tax book value of an owner's investment in the LTC. The deductions an owner can claim are restricted if the overall deductions exceed the owner's basis in the LTC. See examples of the loss limitation rule on pages 38 to 53. Note For each owner calculate their owner's basis and any non-allowable deductions using the tables and information on pages 33 and 34. Please see Part 7 of our Look-through companies - IR879 guide before calculating the owner's basis. It explains the terms used in the following calculation. If there's more than 1 owner, complete the tables on pages 33 and 34 for each owner separately. 33 ird.govt.nz Calculate the owner's basis here: Investments 1 Distributions 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 3 Income 4 Add Boxes 3 and 4 5 Deductions from previous tax years (but excluding any non-allowable deductions in those years) 6 Subtract Box 6 from Box 5 7 Disallowed amounts 8 Subtract Box 8 from Box 7\* 9 \* If Box 9 is a negative amount it means the owner has negative equity in the LTC and their owner's basis will be treated as nil. Print "0.00" in Box 9. Note Deductions in Box 6 above also includes all the deductions claimed against gross income from the LTC from all sources in previous years in which the company was an LTC. For example, if the LTC has a rental property, all the deductions claimable against the rental income will be included in the total deductions figure, as well as expenses incurred in producing income from all other sources. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE34 When each owner's basis (Box 9 on the previous page) has been calculated you can work out if there is any limitation on the deductions claimable for each owner. If the: • • owner's basis (Box 9) is more than their attribution of the deductions (expenses), you will not need to complete Box 26Q - go to Non-allowable deductions • • attribution of deductions (expenses) to the owners are more than their owner's basis you'll need to complete Boxes 1 to 3 below to calculate the amount to declare at Box 26Q. Attribution of this year's deductions (expenses) 1 Owner's basis (from Box 9 on page 33) 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 3 The result is non-allowable deductions this year. Copy the amount from Box 3 into Box 26Q on your IR7L. Any deductions an owner cannot claim because of the loss limitation rule are carried forward and may be claimed in future years, subject to the application of the loss limitation rule in those years. Owners may only use these deductions against income from the LTC. Non-allowable deductions Complete the calculation (Boxes 1 to 5) on the following page if you have: • • non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year (copy the amount from Box 24R Non-allowable deductions on your IR7L 2020 form into Box 26R on your IR7L 2021 form), or • • non-allowable deductions this year (that means Box 26Q has an amount in it). 35 ird.govt.nz Non-allowable deductions brought forward (also show this amount in Box 26R). 1 Non-allowable deductions this year (Box 3 on page 34, put zero if you do not have non-allowable deductions). 2 Add Boxes 1 and 2. 3 If your Owner's basis (Box 9 on page 33) was more than your attribution of this year's deductions (expenses), copy the difference to Box 4, otherwise print $0.00. 4 Subtract Box 4 from Box 3 (print $0.00 if this would equal a negative value). 5 Prior years' non-allowable deductions claimable this year If there is a figure in Box 4, you will be able to claim prior years' non-allowable deductions. Enter the smaller number of Box 3 and Box 4 as prior years' non-allowable deductions claimed this year in Box 26S on your IR7L. Non-allowable deductions carried forward The amount in Box 5 is the non-allowable deductions to carry forward. Copy this amount into Box 26T.

The partnership or LTC is not assessed for tax, but each partner or owner is liable for tax on their share of income from the partnership or LTC. Each partner or owner must complete an individual tax return showing all income, including their share from the partnership or LTC. Return due date If the partnership or LTC has a 31 March balance date, you have until 7 July 2022 to send in the return, unless you've been granted an extension of time. If you have an agent or a balance date other than 31 March this date may be different. Business industry classification (BIC) code We're lawfully required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. If your BIC code is not preprinted on the return or is different from the preprinted one, please enter the correct code. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to businessdescription.co.nz or call ACC on 0508 426 837. It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. Please provide the code only. Do not provide a description. 5 ird.govt.nz Has the partnership or LTC ceased? If this is the final return, include a set of accounts (if required) up to the date the partnership or LTC ceased. Also include details of any distribution of assets and liabilities. If the partnership or LTC is registered for GST or as an employer, you will also need to complete a Business cessation - IR315 form to finalise your records. Depending on the partnership's or LTC's circumstances, other issues may also need to be finalised, for example outstanding returns and/or arrears. Find out how to finalise the partnership's or LTC's tax accounts or deregister for GST at ird.govt.nz Note An LTC is still a legal entity until it's taken off the Companies Register. An LTC can stop trading but still have tax obligations, for example completing returns. Nil returns Every partnership and LTC must complete an income tax return, whether or not it has been active. If there is no gross income to declare, losses to claim, and no disclosures to make at Question 28 (read page 56) you can complete a nil return. Complete the return up to Question 9 and sign the declaration at Question 29. For more information on look-through company rules, read our Look-through companies - IR879 guide. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE6 Questions Question 10 Schedular payments If the partnership or LTC has received schedular payments, we'll send you a Summary of income, detailing the payments received and the tax deducted. From your Summary of income, copy the total tax deducted into Box 10A and gross payments into Box 10B. The Summary of income may not contain all your earnings information. If any details are missing, please include them at Question 10. If the partnership or LTC is registered for GST, your gross schedular payments should not include any GST. If they do, show the gross payments at Question 10 and deduct the GST portion at Question 24. Question 11 New Zealand interest Include interest from all New Zealand sources at Question 11. The interest payer will usually send you an RWT withholding certificate - IR15, showing the gross interest paid and the amount of RWT deducted. Write the total of all RWT deducted in Box 11A. Add up all the gross interest amounts (before the deduction of any tax) and write the total in Box 11B. Note If expenses are deductible against the interest income (for example commission), claim them at Question 24. Read the note about expenses on page 31. Do not send us interest statements or IR15 certificates with the return. Keep these in case we ask for them later. 7 ird.govt.nz Interest on broken term deposits If you've broken a term deposit during the year, you may have to account for "negative interest". This is interest repaid on a term deposit and may reduce the amount of interest to declare in your return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest shown on the IR15 or equivalent statement. Deduct the allowable negative interest component, using the worksheet below, before entering the gross amount at Question 11 of your return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a later return when the term deposit matures. Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your RWT on interest form to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you've paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. 3 Copy this amount to Box 11B of your tax return. Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we paid you interest, include it in Box 11B for the income year the partnership or LTC received the interest. If the partnership or LTC paid us interest, include it as a deduction in Box 24 of the return for the income year the interest is paid. Read about expenses on page 31. Interest from overseas If the partnership or LTC received interest from overseas, convert your overseas interest and tax credits to New Zealand dollars and show the amounts at Question 16. Please read the notes about overseas income on pages 13 to 16. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE8 Income from financial arrangements If the partnership or LTC was a party to a financial arrangement, such as government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts or deferred property settlements, you may have to calculate the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement using a spreading method, rather than on a cash basis. To work out if you must use a spreading method, please read Financial arrangements on pages 30 to 31. If the financial arrangement matures, is sold, remitted or transferred, you must do a "wash-up" calculation known as a base price adjustment. Any RWT will be deducted on a cash basis. Show the RWT deducted and any income from the financial arrangement in Boxes 11A and 11B. Question 12 New Zealand dividends Dividends are the part of a company's profits that it passes on to its shareholders. Unit trusts are treated as companies for income tax purposes. Distributions from unit trusts will generally be taxable and are treated as dividends. Complete Question 12 if you received any New Zealand dividends, including dividends from your local electricity or gas supplier. Do not include a dividend that's a distribution of the trust's capital and is tax free. The company or unit trust that paid you the dividend will send you a dividend statement. Do not send us any dividend statements with the return. Keep these in case we ask for them later. Note If expenses are deductible against the dividend income (for example commission), claim them at Question 24. Read the note about expenses on page 31. 9 ird.govt.nz Credits attached to dividends A New Zealand company or unit trust may attach several types of credits to dividends. Imputation credits are credits for part of the tax the company has already paid on its profits, which means the dividends are not taxed twice. RWT is deducted from your dividend to bring the total credits withheld up to 33% of the gross dividend. What to show in your return Your dividend statements show the amount: • • you received (net dividend) • • of any imputation credits, and • • of any RWT credits. Add all these amounts together to work out your total gross dividends and enter this in Box 12B. Add up all the imputation credits and print the total in Box 12. Add any dividend RWT credits and print the total in Box 12A. Shares instead of dividends If the partnership or LTC received shares instead of dividends, include them as income at Question 12. Write the amount as if you received dividends instead of shares. Dividends from overseas Please read about overseas income on pages 13 to 16 of this guide. Question 13 Māori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. Fill in Question 13 if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE10 Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a Māori authority credit and is part of the tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits, so the distributions are not taxed twice. What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: • • the distribution made to you, including the taxable portion and the non-taxable portion, and • • Māori authority credit. Transfer these amounts, leaving out any non-taxable distributions, to the relevant boxes at Question 13. Example A Māori authority makes a pre-tax profit of $10,000. It pays tax on this profit of $1,750 (Māori authority tax rate of 17.5%) and distributes the entire profit to their 10 members. Each member will receive $825 as a cash distribution and $175 of Māori authority credits. Each member of the authority liable to complete an IR7 return would show the following information at Question 13: Box 13A - $175 Box 13B - $1,000 (made up of $825 + $175) Non-taxable distribution You do not need to include in the IR7 return any other distributions received from a Māori authority that are not taxable in the hands of a Māori authority member. These amounts are non-taxable distributions and cannot have credits attached. For more information read our Māori authority guide - IR487. 11 ird.govt.nz Question 14 Income from another partnership If the partnership or LTC received any income or loss from another partnership, write the details at Question 14. Do not include any: • • interest and RWT - show these at Question 11 • • dividends, imputation credits, and dividend RWT - show these at Question 12 • • Māori authority distributions and credits - show these at Question 13 • • overseas income and any credits attached - show these at Question 16, see pages 13 to 16 • • residential property income - show this at Question 18, see page 17 • • other rental income - show this at Question 20, see page 27 • • taxable property sales/disposals - show this at Question 21, see page 27 • • other income - show this at Question 22, see page 29. Add up all the other income from partnerships and include the total in Box 14B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up any other tax credits and include the total in Box 14A. Question 15 Income from another LTC If the LTC received income from another LTC, write the details at Question 15. Note A partnership does not receive income or deductions from an LTC. If 2 or more people jointly receive income or deductions from an LTC, they should show these on their own returns, not the partnership's return. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE12 LTCs are transparent (looked through), meaning the owners are treated as having received the income and incurred the loss of the company. The LTC will normally supply the information required to complete your return. Do not include any of the following types of income received from another LTC at Question 15: • • interest and RWT - show these at Question 11 • • dividends, imputation credits, and dividend RWT - show these at Question 12 • • Māori authority distributions and credits - show these at Question 13 • • overseas income and any credits attached - show these at Question 16, see pages 13 to 16 • • residential property income - show this at Question 18, see page 17 • • other rental income - show this at Question 20, see page 27 • • taxable property sales/disposals - show this at Question 21, see page 27 • • other income - show this at Question 22, see page 29. Change to the loss limitation rule This rule limits the amount of deductions an owner can claim to the amount of their owner's basis, which represents their economic interest in the LTC. The loss limitation rule no longer applies to most LTC owners. It continues to apply for owners of LTCs that are in a partnership or joint venture that includes another LTC. What to show on your return Add up all the other income from LTCs and include the total in Box 15B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up any other tax credits and include the total in Box 15A. Add up any non-allowable deductions this year from LTCs and include the total in Box 15C. 13 ird.govt.nz Note There should not be non-allowable deductions this year unless the loss limitation rule still applies. If you had any non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year, you may be able to claim some, or all, of the brought forward amount this year. Print the amount claimable in Box 15D prior years' non-allowable deductions claimed this year. If you have an amount in Box 15C, add this to Box 15B and put the total in Box 15E. If you have an amount in Box 15D, subtract this from Box 15B and put the total in Box 15E. If you do not have any amounts in Box 15C or Box 15D, copy the amount from Box 15B into Box 15E. Box 15E is your adjusted LTC income. Question 16 Overseas income If the partnership or LTC received overseas income, for example from interest or financial arrangements, show this at Question 16. Convert all overseas income and qualifying overseas tax paid to New Zealand dollars. You can do this by: • • using the rates available on ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators • • contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Tax paid overseas is distributed to the partners or owners and the tax credit limit is calculated on the partner's or owner's income tax return. Keep evidence of overseas tax paid with your tax records for 7 years. For more information about foreign tax credits read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461. If the income was received from a financial arrangement, please read our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 20, No 3 (April 2008). PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE14 Overseas dividends There are 2 situations covering the treatment of overseas dividends. Each owner or partner will need to determine which of the following applies to their share of foreign investments: • • If the shares have FIF income or loss calculated, do not include any dividends paid from these shares on the IR7 return. Instead, show the calculated FIF income or loss at Box 16B. • • If the shares are covered by 1 of the FIF exclusions (see page 15), show the dividends at Box 16B. Each owner or partner will need to advise their individual amount of either the FIF income or loss (or their FIF calculation method) or the dividend, to be included on the IR7 return. Show each owner's or partner's individual amount, plus any other allocation of overseas income, at Box 16B on the IR7 return and at Box 27F on the IR7L or IR7P form - see page 34. This information is also used in determining the income amount at Box 4 on page 38 of this guide. In either situation, include any qualifying overseas tax credits attached to the dividends at Box 16A. Some Australian dividends can have New Zealand imputation credits attached. Include these at Box 12. Note you cannot claim Australian franking credits. If the partnership or LTC received dividends from an overseas company through an agent or trustee who deducted RWT in New Zealand or dividends treated as interest, show the New Zealand RWT deducted at Box 12A. Note If you've shown an imputation credit in Box 12 or an RWT credit in Box 12A and there is no income associated to these in Box 12B, you'll need to attach a note to the top of page 3 of your return with the details. 15 ird.govt.nz Foreign investment fund (FIF) income or loss If at any time during the 2022 income year the partnership or LTC held rights like shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, foreign unit trust, foreign superannuation scheme or foreign life insurance policy, the partners or owners may be required to calculate FIF income or loss in their own income tax returns. Generally, the partners or owners will use the fair dividend rate to calculate FIF income. The partners or owners may also need to complete an additional FIF disclosure form. See Question 28 on page 56. The main exclusions from an interest in a FIF are: • • investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts. Investments covered in the list are available in the Australian share exemption list - IR871 • • interest in certain Australian unit trusts • • limited exemptions for interest in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand) • • a 10% or greater interest in a CFC • • an individual or trustee of certain trusts, who is a partner or owner and holds, at all times in the income year, FIFs with a total cost of $50,000 or less. You can find more information on the exclusions and the FIF rules at ird.govt.nz/foreign-investment-funds and in our Tax Information Bulletins (TIBs) - see the online index for relevant issues. Controlled foreign company (CFC) income or loss If at any time during the 2022 income year the partnership or LTC has attributed CFC income or loss, the partners or owners may be required to calculate this in their own income tax returns. A loss from a CFC cannot be used to offset domestic income or be included in domestic losses that are carried forward to the 2022 income year. Generally, these losses PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE16 can only offset income or future income from CFCs that are resident in the same country as the CFC that incurred the loss. The partners or owners may also need to complete an additional CFC disclosure form. See Question 28 on page 56. Question 17 Business income Write the net profit or loss in Box 17B. This is the amount of income or loss after deducting all allowable business expenditure. If this is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Refer to our Smart business - IR320 guide for information on allowable business expenditure and record keeping. Attach 1 of these to the top of page 3 of your return: • • a set of the partnership's or LTC's financial accounts • • a completed Financial statements summary - IR10 form • • a completed Farming income - IR3F form, or Schedule of business income - IR3B form. If you complete an IR10, which speeds up the processing of the return, you do not need to send us your financial accounts as well, but keep them in case we ask for them later. Attribution rule Anyone who provides services and puts an intermediary between themselves and the recipient of the personal service has income earned allocated to them, not the intermediary. If this rule applies to persons associated to your partnership or LTC, it will affect the amount of taxable income in this return. When applying the attribution rule, LTCs are treated as associated entities and not as being transparent. To find out how to apply this rule, please read our Ta x Information Bulletins (TIBs), Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000), Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001), and Vol 21, No 8 Pt 2 (October/November 2009). If you need more information, contact us - see page 58. 17 ird.govt.nz Question 18 Income and expenditure from residential property This question applies to owners of residential property, including overseas property, that gives rise to net income from a bright-line sale, and property subject to the residential property deduction rules. Bright-line property rule for residential property The bright-line property rule needs to be considered when none of the other land sale rules at Question 21 apply to the disposal of the property. This rule for residential property looks at the length of time a property is owned. If you sell or dispose of a residential property within a certain timeframe and no exclusion applies, then your profit on the sale will be taxable. This applies no matter what your reason was for buying the property or what kind of buyer you are. The bright-line property rule applies if you sell or dispose of a residential property you have owned for less than: • • 5 years for properties acquired between 29 March 2018 and 26 March 2021. • • 5 years for properties acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. • • 5 years for properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021 that qualify as a ‘new build’. • • 10 years for all other properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021. For tax purposes, a property is generally acquired on the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is entered into (even if some standard conditions like getting finance or a building report still need to be met). This date will determine which bright-line period (5 or 10 years) applies for your property. For more information on when a property is acquired, see our Question we’ve been asked (QB) 17/02: Date of acquisition of land, and start date for 2-year bright-line test at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE18 There are other dates that are relevant for figuring out whether your property sale is taxable under the bright- line property rule. Generally, your bright-line period starts when the legal title is transferred to you and ends when you enter into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell the property. There are some different rules if you purchase “off the plan” in a new development, for example. The bright-line property rule does not tax any profit made while the property was your main home. It also does not apply to a sale of inherited property, or if you’re the executor or administrator of a deceased estate, or if you transfer property to a partner or spouse under a relationship property agreement (however, for any subsequent sale the bright-line property rule will apply). You can use the property tax decision tool on our website to work out if you need to pay tax on the sale of your property. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/brightline Income and losses for property subject to the bright-line property rule are treated differently in the tax return. After a taxable bright-line sale: • • if you have net income from the sale of the property (a profit), the net income is included in Box 18B. Unless the property is part of a portfolio, expenses from other properties cannot be offset against the net income from the disposal. • • if you have made a net loss when the property is sold, the loss must be carried forward to a later income year when it can be used to offset net income from the land sale provisions, including from future disposals subject to the bright-line rule. A bright-line loss is not recorded in the tax return. Please keep your own record of any bright-line losses you have made. Complete a Bright-line residential property sale information - IR833 form for each bright-line property sold or disposed of and include it with your return. The form explains how to calculate the resulting profit or loss. Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts, unless the income will be included in your 19 ird.govt.nz return as part of your business income as a property speculator, property dealer, developer or builder. If you sell/dispose of a residential property and the sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule, the amount of the previously denied interest under the interest limitation rules is treated as if it were part of the cost of the property in the year of disposal. If this results in a net loss, the deduction for the net loss is limited under the current rule that applies to losses from the disposal of bright-line property. If the disposal is not taxable, the interest previously denied a deduction remains non- deductible. If you are a New Zealand tax resident you’ll need to pay tax on your worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales both in New Zealand and overseas subject to the bright-line property rule or the land sale rules. For more information on the land sale rules, go to ird.govt.nz/buying-selling or read our guide Bright-line property tax - IR1227. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Residential property deduction rule Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules). The rules generally limit the amount of residential deductions you can claim in the year to the total amount of residential income earned in that year. If the residential property makes a loss it must be carried forward to the next year in which residential income, including income from properties held on revenue account, is earned. The residential property calculations are made at the partner or owner level as they may have other residential income and deductions that need to be included. There are 2 levels of exclusions from the rules. Any rental income or loss and net income or loss from a taxable disposal is fully excluded from the rules if the property is: • • the main home • • property subject to the mixed-use asset rules (holiday home rented out part-time) PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE20 • • property owned by companies other than close companies • • property owned by government enterprises • • certain employee accommodation. For these types of property, the existing rules apply with the rental income or loss shown at Box 20B and net income or net loss from a taxable disposal shown in Box 21B. Any rental net loss and net loss from a taxable disposal is partially excluded from the new rules if it is for: • • property that will always be taxed on sale, being revenue account property of a person in the business of building, developing or dealing in land • • other revenue account property the person has notified us they want the exclusion to apply to. For these types of property any rental net loss is shown at Box 20B and taxable disposal net loss is shown at Box 21B. Net rental income and net income from a taxable disposal plus any depreciation recovered is shown as residential income at Box 18B. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide for information on when the rules apply, how to calculate your income, the amount of deductions you can claim this year, and the amount of any excess deductions that must be carried forward. The residential property deduction rules also apply to a partnership or LTC that has borrowed money to acquire an interest in certain entities with significant rental property holdings - a residential land-rich entity - and has interest expenditure on the borrowed money. Residential land-rich entity - a close company, partnership or LTC that holds more than 50% of its assets by value in residential land directly or indirectly. They come under the interposed entities rules as part of the residential property deduction rules. For more information about the interposed entity rules, see page 60 of the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No.8 September 2019. 21 ird.govt.nz Completing Question 18 in your return Tick the method you used to calculate your residential property income and deductions. You use 1 of the following: • • Portfolio basis - combine the income and deductions for all rental properties in the portfolio. • • Individual, property-by-property basis - income and deductions of individual property calculated separately to other property. You need to maintain separate records for each property to choose this option. The details for each property need to be provided to the partners or owners. • • Combination of the property-by-property basis and portfolio basis - choose to apply different methods to different property. Some properties are held in a portfolio and others are held on property-by-property basis. For a partnership most of the calculations for excess rental deductions are made in the partners return. The partnership needs to provide sufficient information for the partners to complete their return correctly. If a partner wants to use the individual method the partnership needs to maintain separate records for each rental property and pass each property’s details to the partner. For an LTC, the owners need to complete their return using the same method chosen by the LTC for their share of the income and deductions. An owner can choose a different method for other rental properties they own. Example An LTC uses the portfolio method. The portfolio was loss-making overall, so any shareholder who directly holds other residential properties subject to the ring- fencing rules can include those other properties as part of the portfolio. They can then use their share of the deductions that flow through from the LTC against their total residential income. This includes their residential income from the LTC and any other residential income they derive. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE22 Example An LTC uses the property-by-property basis. The shareholders must also use this method in their own returns. So, if residential deductions for the property exceed the residential income from the property, the shareholder can only use their share of the deductions up to their share of the income from the property. Their excess deductions cannot be used against residential income from a property they own directly. The Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 can be used to calculate the information required to be shown in your return. Write the total residential income in Box 18B. This is the total of the following amounts: (a) all residential rental income from a portfolio and/or individual property (b) all depreciation recovery income for assets disposed of from a portfolio and/or individual property (c) net income from the taxable sale/disposal of a property in a portfolio and/or individual property, and (d) all net residential rental income, depreciation recovery income and net income from the taxable disposal of property from residential property excluded because it is held on revenue account. Only include the net income from a disposal once. Write the total eligible deductions for residential rental properties in Box 18C. Include the amount of any interest paid on an investment in a residential land rich entity that relates to residential rental activity in Box 18B. Include the amount of other interest paid in Box 19B. The partners or owners share of these are shown in boxes 27G and 27M on the IR7P or IR7L. 23 ird.govt.nz Note If you have taxable net income from other residential properties outside the rules, such as net rental income from a property held on revenue account or net income from a taxable disposal, you can allocate this income across any rental properties with excess deductions and include it in Box 18B Total residential income. Question 19 Interest incurred from residential property This question applies to owners of residential property subject to the interest limitation rules. You do not need to complete this question for the following types of property: • • farmland • • hospitals, hospices, convalescent homes, nursing homes • • rest homes and retirement villages • • hotels, motels, inns, camping grounds, hostels. For interest to be deductible, the general deductibility rules must be met. The interest will also not be deductible to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. From 1 October 2021, interest is not deductible for residential property in New Zealand acquired on or after 27 March 2021, unless an exclusion or exemption applies (see below). For properties acquired before 27 March 2021, the ability to deduct interest on existing loans is being phased out between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025. For the 2022 tax year, you can claim: • • 100% of the interest incurred from 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021 • • 75% of the interest incurred from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE24 Interest on any new loans drawn down on or after 27 March 2021 is not deductible. Special rules also apply for refinanced loans and for interest on revolving credit and overdraft facilities. Any interest on borrowings above the closing balance on 26 March 2021 is not deductible. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz/property/renting-out-residential-property If you sell/dispose of a residential property and the sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule, the amount of the previously denied interest under the interest limitation rules is treated as if it were part of the cost of the property in the year of disposal. If this results in a net loss, the deduction for the net loss is limited under the current rule that applies to losses from the disposal of bright- line property. If the disposal is not taxable, the interest previously denied a deduction remains non-deductible. Completing Question 19 in your return Complete this question for any interest expense you are claiming in this income tax return at Boxes 18C and 20B in relation to a house, apartment, flat or other structure that could be used for residential accommodation, either short-term or long-term. This includes if you have an arrangement to build such a structure, and bare land that could be used to build such a structure under the relevant district plan. Write the total interest on residential property in Box 19A. This is the total interest incurred on your borrowings for all your residential properties for this year. If you are using an IR3R form to prepare a summary for each rental property, this is the total of all the 7A Boxes. Write the amount of interest expense claimed in Box 19B. If you are using an IR3R form to prepare a summary for each rental property, this is the total of all the 7B Boxes. Note The partners’ or owners’ share of Boxes 19A and 19B is included in their income tax returns in proportion to their share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC. 25 ird.govt.nz If you have claimed an interest expense in Box 19B, at Box 19C tick the reason(s) for the interest expense claimed: • • A Māori exempt company or not a residential land company – The interest limitation rules do not apply to non-close companies or groups if less than 50% of its total assets consist of residential property (excluding development property but including shares in other companies that exceed this 50% test) at all times during the income year. A close company that is a Māori authority, eligible to be a Māori authority, or wholly-owned by an entity that is a Māori authority or eligible to be one is an exempt Māori company if it passes this 50% test. • • Certain schedule 15 exclusions or property not in NZ - The interest limitation rules apply to land in New Zealand only. Schedule 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 also allows you to claim interest for the following: • • main home – if a portion is used to earn income such as a flatting situation • • business premises (for example, a villa now used as a dental clinic) except if the business premises is used for providing accommodation and it’s not a person’s main home • • certain Māori land, papakāinga and kaumātua housing, and land transferred as part of settlement under Te Tiriti o Waitangi/Treaty of Waitangi • • employee accommodation • • student accommodation. • • Loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 or interest incurred before 1 October 2021 – Interest incurred from 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021 is fully deductible. From 1 October 2021, the ability to claim interest is being phased out for the following situations: • • loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 • • property acquired before 27 March 2021 but the loan for the settlement of the property was not drawn down until on or after 27 March 2021 • • loans that relate to the purchase of a property acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE26 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. In other situations where the property is acquired on or after 27 March 2021, interest cannot be claimed from 1 October 2021 onwards. • • Emergency, transitional, social or council housing - You can claim interest for loans if your property is used for emergency, transitional or social housing when leased to the Crown (for example, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development or Kāinga Ora) or to a registered community housing provider. • • New build exemption - the exemption generally applies to new build residential properties for 20 years from the date a new build’s Code Compliance Certificate (CCC) is issued under the Building Act 2004. A ‘new build’ includes a self-contained dwelling: • • that received a CCC on or after 27 March 2020. The dwelling can be made from new or existing materials and can be constructed onsite or relocated onto the land • • acquired off the plans that received a CCC on or after 27 March 2020 • • created by converting an existing dwelling into 2 or more dwellings, that received a CCC on or after 27 March 2020 • • converted from commercial premises that received a CCC on or after 27 March 2020 • • converted from a hotel or motel and building consent authority records show that the conversion was completed on or after 27 March 2020 • • that has been removed from the earthquake prone buildings register on or after 27 March 2020, provided there is proof the remediation has been completed (either in the form of a CCC being issued, or local or building consent authority records showing the work has been completed and verified by a suitably qualified engineer) • • that was remediated because of weathertightness issues, provided more than 75% of the dwelling has been re-clad and a CCC was issued on or after 27 March 2020. 27 ird.govt.nz • • Development or land business exemption - The land business exemption applies to land held as part of a developing, subdividing, or land-dealing business, or a business of erecting buildings on land. The development exemption does not require you to have a ‘land business’ and applies to land that you develop, subdivide, or build on to create a new build. The development may be a one-off.

You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Question 20 Other rental activities income Write the net profit or loss (total rents minus expenses) in Box 20B. If this is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Only include net residential rental income or losses not covered by the residential property deduction rules such as commercial rental income. Do not include any residential rental income already included at Question 18. Attach 1 of these to the top of page 3 of your return: • • a set of the partnership's or LTC's financial accounts • • a completed Financial statements summary - IR10 form, or • • a completed Rental income - IR3R form. Question 21 Income from taxable property sales/disposals Include the total net income or loss from land. Do not include net income or loss from a bright-line sale at Box 21B. Bright-line sales are included under residential income at Question 18. Profits from land sales are taxable if you bought a property for the purpose of reselling it or are in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE28 The profits may also be taxable if you: • • are a builder and improved a property before selling it • • developed or subdivided land and sold sections, or • • had a change of zoning on your property and sold it within ten years of buying it. Show the total profit or loss from other property in Box 21B. If you are a New Zealand tax resident you’ll need to pay tax on your worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales worldwide subject to the bright-line property rule for residential land, or the other land sale rules. For more information on the land sale rules, go to ird.govt.nz/buying-selling or read our guide Tax and your property transactions - IR361. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Question 21A Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If a partner had RLWT deducted from the sale or transfer of a residential property located in New Zealand, they’ll need to show the full amount of the RLWT in their own individual income tax return. Do not include it in the partnership tax credits. If the LTC is an “offshore RLWT person” and has sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. The LTC should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. The LTC can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the LTC and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than 1 amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to the LTC and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. 29 ird.govt.nz Question 22 Other income If you invested capital in a partnership or LTC but did not take an active part in the day-to-day operation or management of the business, any earnings would be considered passive income. Enter this amount at Question 22 unless you’ve already included it at another Question on your return. Also at Question 22 show any other income the partnership or LTC received, for example sale of: • • non-FIF shares or other property • • securities. If the partnership or LTC received any of the income listed above, please read the following. Income from sale of non-FIF shares or other property Profits from the sale of shares and other property are taxable if the partnership or LTC buys: • • and sells shares or other property as a business • • shares or other property for resale, or • • shares or property to make a profit. List the details of gross income and expenses from these sales on a separate sheet of paper and attach it to the top of page 3 of your IR7. Include the total profits in Box 22B. Selling or disposing of assets If the partnership or LTC sold or disposed of a depreciated asset for more than its adjusted tax value, you may need to account for depreciation recovered. You can use the depreciation calculator on our website ird.govt.nz to get a complete depreciation schedule for any asset. The schedule includes the amount to claim in the year of purchase and any adjustment in the year of sale. For more information read Depreciation - a guide for businesses - IR260, and either Depreciation rates - IR265 or Historic depreciation rates - IR267. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE30 Losses from shares or other property If the partnership or LTC has made a loss and you can show that if the partnership or LTC had made a profit it would have been taxable, the partnership or LTC may be able to claim the loss as an expense. Include the total loss at Box 22B. Write the details of the loss on a separate sheet of paper and attach it to the top of page 3 of your IR7. Include details of other profits or losses made from similar sales, whether in this tax year or earlier. Financial arrangements A partner or owner must account for income from financial arrangements on an accrual basis. Financial arrangements include government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts and deferred property settlements. Changes to the rules for the treatment of financial arrangements have split the rules into 2 sets. Generally, the first set applies to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999 and the second applies to financial arrangements entered into, on or after that date. Both sets of rules require the income or expenditure to be spread over the term of the financial arrangement. Both sets of rules allow some exceptions from these spreading provisions if the partner or owner is a cash-basis holder (under the first set of rules), or a cash-basis person (under the second set of rules). The partner or owner is a cash-basis holder if, before 20 May 1999: • • they held financial arrangements of $600,000 or less in value, or • • the income derived from the financial arrangements was $70,000 or less, and • • the difference between the person's gross income calculated under the cash basis and that calculated under the accrual method is no more than $20,000. 31 ird.govt.nz The partner or owner is a cash-basis person if, from 20 May 1999: • • the value of all financial arrangements added together is less than $1 million, or • • the absolute value (the value no matter whether it's a positive or a negative figure) calculated under the accrual rules in the income year from the financial arrangement is less than $100,000, and • • in comparing the gross income and expenditure using a spreading method under the accrual rules with the cash-basis income and expenditure, the result is less than $40,000. To determine whether the partner or owner is a cash-basis holder or cash-basis person, they must take into account their share of the financial arrangement, or their share in the gross income or expenditure under the financial arrangement the partnership or LTC is a party to. Sale or maturity of financial arrangements Whether or not the exemption from the spreading methods applies, when a financial arrangement matures, is sold, remitted or transferred, you must do a "wash-up" calculation, known as a base price adjustment. The calculation ensures the total gains or losses from the financial arrangement are accounted for. If you need any information about calculating a base price adjustment, call us on 0800 443 773. Question 24 Expenses The partnership or LTC may have incurred expenses in generating its income, for example: • • commission deducted from interest and dividends • • expenses for return preparation, or • • interest paid to Inland Revenue for late payment of tax in the income year it is paid. If the expenses have not already been claimed in the return, print the amount in Box 24. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE32 Question 26 Deduction for losses extinguished on transition from a QC or LAQC If the partnership or LTC had losses which were extinguished on transitioning from a QC or LAQC, each owner or partner is allowed a deduction for an amount equal to the amount given by the following formula: (Loss balance extinguished − prior years' deductions) × partnership share or owner's effective interest Note This is limited to the partner's or owner's share of net partnership or net LTC income for the year. Loss balance extinguished is the loss balance extinguished on transition from a QC or LAQC. If it includes foreign losses please contact us to make sure they are accounted for correctly. Prior years' deductions is the total amount of deductions for extinguished losses allowed in previous income years for all persons with a share in the partnership, or an effective look-through interest in the LTC. If this is the first year deductions have been claimed for extinguished losses, the amount will be zero. Work out the maximum allowable deduction for each owner or partner using the calculation table below and on page 33. Boxes 1 to 3 only need to be completed once. Use the resulting figures for all owners or partners. Boxes 4 to 9 must be completed for each owner or partner using their information from the IR7L or IR7P. Loss balance extinguished (copy this figure to Box 26 on the IR7) 1 Prior years' deductions (copy this figure to Box 26A on the IR7) 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. 3 33 ird.govt.nz If the answer in Box 3 is zero, no further deductions for extinguished losses can be claimed by the owners or partners. If it is greater than zero, continue below. Note Information on completing the IR7L is explained later in this guide. Attribution of income/loss is explained on page 34, and how to complete Box 27Q is explained on page 36 of this guide. Copy the total income figure from Box 27K on the IR7L or IR7P to Box 4 4 For LTC owners, copy any non-allowable deductions this year from Box 27Q on the IR7L to Box 5 5 Add Boxes 4 and 5 and print the answer in Box 6. 6 If Box 6 is a loss, the owner or partner is not entitled to a deduction this year. If it is not a loss, continue below. Convert the owner's or partner's attribution of income/loss from Box 27B on the IR7L or IR7P to a decimal amount (for example 40% = .40). Print the answer in Box 7. 7 Multiply Box 3 by Box 7 and print the answer in Box 8. 8 Print the amount from either Box 6 or Box 8, whichever is the lesser, in Box 9 below. This is the maximum deduction for the owner or partner. Maximum deduction 9 Copy the amount from Box 9 to Box 27L on the IR7L or IR7P form. Add up the maximum deductions for all owners or partners and print the answer in Box 26B of the IR7 return. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE34 Question 27 Attribution of income/loss All income, losses and tax credits must be attributed to the partners or owners in proportion to their share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC. At Question 27 tick which entity the income/loss details are attached for. • • partnerships, complete the IR7P to provide attribution details for all partners, or • • LTCs, complete the IR7L to provide attribution details for all owners. Show the details for each partner or owner on the relevant form. If there are more than 2 partners or owners, use additional IR7P or IR7L forms. You can print them from our website ird.govt.nz Attach all IR7P or IR7L forms to the top of page 3 of your IR7 return. Completing your IR7L or IR7P Box 27A IRD number Print the partner's or owner's IRD number. If you do not know their IRD number you will need to contact them to request it. Box 27B Attribution of income/loss Show the attribution of income or loss the partner or owner is entitled to as a percentage of the total. Write percentages as four-digit numbers, for example show 15% as 15.00. Note For LTCs with only 1 owner the percentage will be a five-digit number, for example show 100% as 100.00. For LTCs, effective look-through interest determines each owner's attribution of income or loss from the LTC. Each owner's effective look-through interest is generally determined by the percentage of shares the owner has in t h e LTC . For more information read our Look-through companies - IR879 guide 35 ird.govt.nz Boxes 27C to 27J Attributed income/loss Print the partner's or owner's attribution of: • • interest (from Question 11) in Box 27C • • dividends (from Question 12) in Box 27D • • Māori authority distributions (from Question 13) in Box 27E • • overseas income (from Question 16) in Box 27F • • residential income (from Question 18) in Box 27G • • other rental income (from Question 20) in Box 27H • • other passive income (from Questions 21 and 22 minus any relevant expenses at Question 24, including income received by a non-active partner or owner in the business) in Box 27I • • all other income and expenses (not already included in Boxes 27C to 27I) in Box 27J.

Note The totals of all partners' or owners' Box 27Ks must add up to the IR7 income or loss shown in Box 25. If they do not, it will take us longer to process your return. Box 27L Deduction for extinguished losses See instructions on pages 32 to 33 of this guide. Box 27M Residential rental deductions Print the partner’s or owner’s attribution in Box 27M. Boxes 27N, 27O and 27P Attributed tax credits Print the partner's or owner's attribution of: overseas tax paid (from Question 16) in Box 27N • • imputation credits (from Question 12) in Box 27O • • other tax credits (from Questions 10 to 15, excluding any imputation credits) in Box 27P. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE36 Boxes 27Q to 27T Non-allowable deductions (IR7L only) - where loss limitation rule does not apply for the owner(s) Note This information applies for an LTC who is not subject to the loss limitation rule. See the note on page 12. Non-allowable deductions this year There will not be non-allowable deductions this year as the loss limitation rule no longer applies. Do not include an amount in Box 27Q. Non-allowable deductions brought forward Note The LTC should have records of the non-allowable deductions brought forward. Prior years' non-allowable deductions claimed this year This will be the same as the amount in Box 27R and is the amount claimable this year. Copy the amount in Box 27R to Box 27S. Non-allowable deductions carried forward There should be no non-allowable deductions to carry forward. Leave Box 27S blank. Example 1 Loss limitation rule no longer applies - owner with previously non-allowable deductions The following details are for Catherine who owns all of the shares in Company A, an LTC. IRD number 12-121-212 Total gross income $10,000 Expenses/deductions $15,000 Loss $5,000 Non-allowable deductions brought forward $10,000 37 ird.govt.nz Boxes 27Q to 27T Non-allowable deductions (IR7L only) - where loss limitation rule still applies for the owners Note This information only applies for an LTC that is in a partnership or joint venture with another LTC. The loss limitation rule ensures that the deductions claimed reflect the level of an owner's economic loss in the LTC. The "owner's basis" refers to the adjusted tax book value of an owner's investment in the LTC. The deductions an owner can claim are restricted if the overall deductions exceed the owner's basis in the LTC. See examples of the loss limitation rule on pages 41 to 56. Note For each owner calculate their owner's basis and any non-allowable deductions using the tables and information on pages 38 and 39. Please see Part 7 of our Look-through companies - IR879 guide before calculating the owner's basis. It explains the terms used in the following calculation. If there's more than 1 owner, complete the tables on pages 38 and 39 for each owner separately. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE38 Calculate the owner's basis here: Investments 1 Distributions 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 3 Income 4 Add Boxes 3 and 4 5 Deductions from previous tax years (but excluding any non-allowable deductions in those years) 6 Subtract Box 6 from Box 5 7 Disallowed amounts 8 Subtract Box 8 from Box 7\* 9 \* If Box 9 is a negative amount it means the owner has negative equity in the LTC and their owner's basis will be treated as nil. Print "0.00" in Box 9. Note Deductions in Box 6 above also includes all the deductions claimed against gross income from the LTC from all sources in previous years in which the company was an LTC. For example, if the LTC has a rental property, all the deductions claimable against the rental income will be included in the total deductions figure, as well as expenses incurred in producing income from all other sources. 39 ird.govt.nz When each owner's basis (Box 9 on the previous page) has been calculated you can work out if there is any limitation on the deductions claimable for each owner. If the: • • owner's basis (Box 9) is more than their attribution of the deductions (expenses), you will not need to complete Box 27Q - go to Non-allowable deductions • • attribution of deductions (expenses) to the owners are more than their owner's basis you'll need to complete Boxes 1 to 3 below to calculate the amount to declare at Box 27Q. Attribution of this year's deductions (expenses) 1 Owner's basis (from Box 9 on page 38) 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 3 The result is non-allowable deductions this year. Copy the amount from Box 3 into Box 27Q on your IR7L. Any deductions an owner cannot claim because of the loss limitation rule are carried forward and may be claimed in future years, subject to the application of the loss limitation rule in those years. Owners may only use these deductions against income from the LTC. Non-allowable deductions Complete the calculation (Boxes 1 to 5) on the following page if you have: • • non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year (copy the amount from Box 26R Non-allowable deductions on your IR7L 2021 form into Box 27R on your IR7L 2022 form), or • • non-allowable deductions this year (that means Box 27Q has an amount in it). PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE40 Non-allowable deductions brought forward (also show this amount in Box 27R). 1 Non-allowable deductions this year (Box 3 on page 38, put zero if you do not have non-allowable deductions). 2 Add Boxes 1 and 2. 3 If your Owner's basis (Box 9 on page 38) was more than your attribution of this year's deductions (expenses), copy the difference to Box 4, otherwise print $0.00. 4 Subtract Box 4 from Box 3 (print $0.00 if this would equal a negative value). 5 Prior years' non-allowable deductions claimable this year If there is a figure in Box 4, you will be able to claim prior years' non-allowable deductions. Enter the smaller number of Box 3 and Box 4 as prior years' non-allowable deductions claimed this year in Box 27S on your IR7L.

When this amount is allowed against his share of the gross income ($3,000) the result is $0.00, the amount of the adjusted LTC income.

The partnership or LTC is not assessed for tax, but each partner or owner is liable for tax on their share of income from the partnership or LTC. Each partner or owner must complete an income tax return showing all income, including their share from the partnership or LTC. Return due date If the partnership or LTC has a 31 March balance date, you have until 7 July 2023 to send in the return, unless you've been granted an extension of time. If you have an agent or a balance date other than 31 March this date may be different. Business industry classification (BIC) code We're lawfully required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. If your BIC code is not preprinted on the return or is different from the preprinted one, please enter the correct code. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to businessdescription.co.nz or call ACC on 0508 426 837. It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. Please provide the code only. Do not provide a description. 5 ird.govt.nz Has the partnership or LTC ceased? If this is the final return, include a set of accounts (if required) up to the date the partnership or LTC ceased. Also include details of any distribution of assets and liabilities. If the partnership or LTC is registered for GST or as an employer, you will also need to complete a Business cessation - IR315 form to finalise your records. Depending on the partnership's or LTC's circumstances, other issues may also need to be finalised, for example outstanding returns and/or arrears. Find out how to finalise the partnership's or LTC's tax accounts or deregister for GST at ird.govt.nz Note An LTC is still a legal entity until it's taken off the Companies Register. An LTC can stop trading but still have tax obligations, for example completing returns. Nil returns Every partnership and LTC must complete an income tax return, whether or not it has been active. If there is no gross income to declare, losses to claim, and no disclosures to make at Question 28 (read page 56) you can complete a nil return. Complete the return up to Question 9 and sign the declaration at Question 29. For more information on look-through company rules, read our Look-through companies - IR879 guide. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE6 Questions Question 10 Schedular payments If the partnership or LTC has received schedular payments, we'll send you a Summary of income, detailing the payments received and the tax deducted. From your Summary of income, copy the total tax deducted into Box 10A and gross payments into Box 10B. The Summary of income may not contain all your earnings information. If any details are missing, please include them at Question 10. If the partnership or LTC is registered for GST, your gross schedular payments should not include any GST. If they do, show the gross payments at Question 10 and deduct the GST portion at Question 24. Question 11 New Zealand interest Include interest from all New Zealand sources at Question 11. The interest payer will usually send you an RWT withholding certificate - IR15, showing the gross interest paid and the amount of RWT deducted. Write the total of all RWT deducted in Box 11A. Add up all the gross interest amounts (before the deduction of any tax) and write the total in Box 11B. Note If expenses are deductible against the interest income (for example commission), claim them at Question 24. Read the note about expenses on page 31. Do not send us interest statements or IR15 certificates with the return. Keep these in case we ask for them later. 7 ird.govt.nz Interest on broken term deposits If you've broken a term deposit during the year, you may have to account for "negative interest". This is interest repaid on a term deposit and may reduce the amount of interest to declare in your return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest shown on the IR15 or equivalent statement. Deduct the allowable negative interest component, using the worksheet below, before entering the gross amount at Question 11 of your return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a later return when the term deposit matures. Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your RWT on interest form to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you've paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. 3 Copy this amount to Box 11B of your tax return. Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we paid you interest, include it in Box 11B for the income year the partnership or LTC received the interest. If the partnership or LTC paid us interest, include it as a deduction in Box 24 of the return for the income year the interest is paid. Read about expenses on page 31. Interest from overseas If the partnership or LTC received interest from overseas, convert your overseas interest and tax credits to New Zealand dollars and show the amounts at Question 16. Please read the notes about overseas income on pages 13 to 16. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE8 Income from financial arrangements If the partnership or LTC was a party to a financial arrangement, such as government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts or deferred property settlements, you may have to calculate the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement using a spreading method, rather than on a cash basis. To work out if you must use a spreading method, please read Financial arrangements on pages 30 to 31. If the financial arrangement matures, is sold, remitted or transferred, you must do a "wash-up" calculation known as a base price adjustment. Any RWT will be deducted on a cash basis. Show the RWT deducted and any income from the financial arrangement in Boxes 11A and 11B. Question 12 New Zealand dividends Dividends are the part of a company's profits that it passes on to its shareholders. Unit trusts are treated as companies for income tax purposes. Distributions from unit trusts will generally be taxable and are treated as dividends. Complete Question 12 if you received any New Zealand dividends, including dividends from your local electricity or gas supplier. Do not include a dividend that's a distribution of the trust's capital and is tax free. The company or unit trust that paid you the dividend will send you a dividend statement. Do not send us any dividend statements with the return. Keep these in case we ask for them later. Note If expenses are deductible against the dividend income (for example commission), claim them at Question 24. Read the note about expenses on page 31. 9 ird.govt.nz Credits attached to dividends A New Zealand company or unit trust may attach several types of credits to dividends. Imputation credits are credits for part of the tax the company has already paid on its profits, which means the dividends are not taxed twice. RWT is deducted from your dividend to bring the total credits withheld up to 33% of the gross dividend. What to show in your return Your dividend statements show the amount: • • you received (net dividend) • • of any imputation credits, and • • of any RWT credits. Add all these amounts together to work out your total gross dividends and enter this in Box 12B. Add up all the imputation credits and print the total in Box 12. Add any dividend RWT credits and print the total in Box 12A. Shares instead of dividends If the partnership or LTC received shares instead of dividends, include them as income at Question 12. Write the amount as if you received dividends instead of shares. Dividends from overseas Please read about overseas income on pages 13 to 16 of this guide. Question 13 Māori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. Fill in Question 13 if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE10 Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a Māori authority credit and is part of the tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits, so the distributions are not taxed twice. What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: • • the distribution made to you, including the taxable portion and the non-taxable portion, and • • Māori authority credit. Transfer these amounts, leaving out any non-taxable distributions, to the relevant boxes at Question 13. Example A Māori authority makes a pre-tax profit of $10,000. It pays tax on this profit of $1,750 (Māori authority tax rate of 17.5%) and distributes the entire profit to their 10 members. Each member will receive $825 as a cash distribution and $175 of Māori authority credits. Each member of the authority liable to complete an IR7 return would show the following information at Question 13: Box 13A - $175 Box 13B - $1,000 (made up of $825 + $175) Non-taxable distribution You do not need to include in the IR7 return any other distributions received from a Māori authority that are not taxable in the hands of a Māori authority member. These amounts are non-taxable distributions and cannot have credits attached. For more information read our Māori authority guide - IR487. 11 ird.govt.nz Question 14 Income from another partnership If the partnership or LTC received any income or loss from another partnership, write the details at Question 14. Do not include any: • • interest and RWT - show these at Question 11 • • dividends, imputation credits, and dividend RWT - show these at Question 12 • • Māori authority distributions and credits - show these at Question 13 • • overseas income and any credits attached - show these at Question 16, see pages 13 to 16 • • income and expenses from residential property including rental income and net bright-line profit - show these at Question 18, see page 17 • • other rental income - show this at Question 20, see page 27 • • taxable property sales or disposals - show these at Question 21, see page 27 • • other income - show this at Question 22, see page 28. Add up all the other income from partnerships and include the total in Box 14B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up any other tax credits and include the total in Box 14A. Question 15 Income from another LTC If the LTC received income from another LTC, write the details at Question 15. Note A partnership does not receive income or deductions from an LTC. If 2 or more people jointly receive income or deductions from an LTC, they should show these on their own returns, not the partnership's return. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE12 LTCs are transparent (looked through), meaning the owners are treated as having received the income and incurred the loss of the company. The LTC will normally supply the information required to complete your return. Do not include any of the following types of income received from another LTC at Question 15: • • interest and RWT - show these at Question 11 • • dividends, imputation credits, and dividend RWT - show these at Question 12 • • Māori authority distributions and credits - show these at Question 13 • • overseas income and any credits attached - show these at Question 16, see pages 13 to 16 • • income and expenses from residential property including rental income and net bright-line profit - show these at Question 18, see page 17 • • other rental income - show this at Question 20, see page 27 • • taxable property sales or disposals - show these at Question 21, see page 27 • • other income - show this at Question 22, see page 29. Change to the loss limitation rule This rule limits the amount of deductions an owner can claim to the amount of their owner's basis, which represents their economic interest in the LTC. The loss limitation rule no longer applies to most LTC owners. It continues to apply for owners of LTCs that are in a partnership or joint venture that includes another LTC. What to show in your return Add up all the other income from LTCs and include the total in Box 15B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up any other tax credits and include the total in Box 15A. Add up any non-allowable deductions this year from LTCs and include the total in Box 15C. 13 ird.govt.nz Note There should not be non-allowable deductions this year unless the loss limitation rule still applies. If you had any non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year, you may be able to claim some, or all, of the brought forward amount this year. Print the amount claimable in Box 15D prior years' non-allowable deductions claimed this year. If you have an amount in Box 15C, add this to Box 15B and put the total in Box 15E. If you have an amount in Box 15D, subtract this from Box 15B and put the total in Box 15E. If you do not have any amounts in Box 15C or Box 15D, copy the amount from Box 15B into Box 15E. Box 15E is your adjusted LTC income. Question 16 Overseas income If the partnership or LTC received overseas income, for example from interest or financial arrangements, show this at Question 16. Convert all overseas income and qualifying overseas tax paid to New Zealand dollars. You can do this by: • • using the rates available on ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators • • contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Tax paid overseas is distributed to the partners or owners and the tax credit limit is calculated on the partner's or owner's income tax return. Keep evidence of overseas tax paid with your tax records for 7 years. For more information about foreign tax credits read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461. If the income was received from a financial arrangement, please read our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 20, No 3 (April 2008). PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE14 Overseas dividends There are 2 situations covering the treatment of overseas dividends. Each owner or partner will need to determine which of the following applies to their share of foreign investments: • • If the shares have FIF income or loss calculated, do not include any dividends paid from these shares on the IR7 return. Instead, show the calculated FIF income or loss at Box 16B. • • If the shares are covered by 1 of the FIF exclusions (see page 15), show the dividends at Box 16B. Each owner or partner will need to advise their individual amount of either the FIF income or loss (or their FIF calculation method) or the dividend, to be included on the IR7 return. Show each owner's or partner's individual amount, plus any other allocation of overseas income, at Box 16B on the IR7 return and at Box 27F on the IR7L or IR7P form - see page 34. This information is also used in determining the income amount at Box 4 on page 38 of this guide. In either situation, include any qualifying overseas tax credits attached to the dividends at Box 16A. Some Australian dividends can have New Zealand imputation credits attached. Include these at Box 12. Note you cannot claim Australian franking credits. If the partnership or LTC received dividends from an overseas company through an agent or trustee who deducted RWT in New Zealand or dividends treated as interest, show the New Zealand RWT deducted at Box 12A. Note If you've shown an imputation credit in Box 12 or an RWT credit in Box 12A and there is no income associated to these in Box 12B, you'll need to attach a note to the top of page 3 of your return with the details. 15 ird.govt.nz Foreign investment fund (FIF) income or loss If at any time during the 2023 income year the partnership or LTC held rights like shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, foreign unit trust, foreign superannuation scheme or foreign life insurance policy, the partners or owners may be required to calculate FIF income or loss in their own income tax returns. Generally, the partners or owners will use the fair dividend rate to calculate FIF income. The partners or owners may also need to complete an additional FIF disclosure form. See Question 28 on page 56. The main exclusions from an interest in a FIF are: • • investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts. Investments covered in the list are available in the Australian share exemption list - IR871 • • interest in certain Australian unit trusts • • limited exemptions for interest in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand) • • a 10% or greater interest in a CFC • • an individual or trustee of certain trusts, who is a partner or owner and holds, at all times in the income year, FIFs with a total cost of $50,000 or less. You can find more information on the exclusions and the FIF rules at ird.govt.nz/foreign-investment-funds and in our Tax Information Bulletins (TIBs) - see the online index for relevant issues. Controlled foreign company (CFC) income or loss If at any time during the 2023 income year the partnership or LTC has attributed CFC income or loss, the partners or owners may be required to calculate this in their own income tax returns. A loss from a CFC cannot be used to offset domestic income or be included in domestic losses that are carried forward to the 2023 income year. Generally, these losses PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE16 can only offset income or future income from CFCs that are resident in the same country as the CFC that incurred the loss. The partners or owners may also need to complete an additional CFC disclosure form. See Question 28 on page 56. Question 17 Business income Write the net profit or loss in Box 17B. This is the amount of income or loss after deducting all allowable business expenditure. If this is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Refer to our Smart business - IR320 guide for information on allowable business expenditure and record keeping. Attach 1 of these to the top of page 3 of your return: • • a set of the partnership's or LTC's financial accounts • • a completed Financial statements summary - IR10 form • • a completed Farming income - IR3F form, or Schedule of business income - IR3B form. If you complete an IR10, which speeds up the processing of the return, you do not need to send us your financial accounts as well, but keep them in case we ask for them later. Attribution rule Anyone who provides services and puts an intermediary between themselves and the recipient of the personal service has income earned allocated to them, not the intermediary. If this rule applies to persons associated to your partnership or LTC, it will affect the amount of taxable income in this return. When applying the attribution rule, LTCs are treated as associated entities and not as being transparent. To find out how to apply this rule, please read our Ta x Information Bulletins (TIBs), Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000), Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001), and Vol 21, No 8 Pt 2 (October/November 2009). If you need more information, contact us - see page 58. 17 ird.govt.nz Question 18 Income and expenses from residential property This question applies to owners of residential property, including overseas property, that have: • • income subject to the residential property deduction rules • • net income from a bright-line sale • • income in relation to a loan in a foreign currency • • depreciation recovery income from disposed assets • • net income from the taxable disposal of a residential property outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account. Residential property deduction rules Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules). The rules generally limit the amount of residential deductions you can claim in the year to the total amount of residential income earned in that year. If the deductions are more than your income, the difference must be carried forward to the next year you earn income from the residential property, including income from properties held on revenue account. The residential property calculations are made at the partner or owner level as they may have other residential income and deductions that need to be included. Any rental income or loss and net income or loss from a taxable disposal is fully excluded from the rules if the property is: • • the main home • • subject to the mixed-use asset rules (for example, a holiday home rented out part-time and not used for at least 62 days in the income year, or 62 working days in the income year if it’s usually only used on working days), or • • owned by companies other than close companies, or • • owned by government enterprises, or • • certain employee accommodation. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE18 For these types of property, any rental income or loss is shown at Box 20B and net income or net loss from a taxable disposal shown in Box 21B. Any rental net loss and net loss from a taxable disposal is partially excluded from the rules if it is for: • • property that will always be taxed on sale, being revenue account property of a person in the business of building, developing or dealing in land, or • • other revenue account property the person has notified us they want the exclusion to apply to. For these types of property any rental net loss is shown at Box 20B and taxable disposal net loss shown at Box 21B. The residential property deduction rules also apply to a partnership or LTC that has borrowed money to acquire an interest in certain entities that have significant rental property holdings - a residential land-rich entity - and has interest expenditure on the borrowed money. Residential land-rich entity - a close company, partnership or look-through company that holds more than 50% of its assets by value in residential land, directly or indirectly. These entities come under the interposed entities rules as part of the residential property deduction rules. For more information about the interposed entity rules, see page 60 of the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No.8 September 2019. Read our Rental income - IR264 guide for more information on: • • when the rules apply • • how to calculate your income • • the amount of deductions you can claim this year, and • • the amount of any excess deductions that must be carried forward. Completing your return Tick the method you have used to calculate your residential property income and deductions. 19 ird.govt.nz You can use 1 of the following methods: • • Portfolio basis - combine income and deductions for all rental properties in the portfolio. • • Individual, property-by-property basis - income and deductions of individual property calculated separately to other property. You need to maintain separate records for each property to choose this option. • • Combination of the individual basis and portfolio basis - choose to apply different methods to different property. Some properties are held in a portfolio and others are held on an individual basis. For a partnership most of the calculations for excess rental deductions are made in the partners’ return. The partnership needs to provide sufficient information for the partners to complete their return correctly. If a partner wants to use the individual method the partnership needs to maintain separate records for each rental property and pass each property’s details to the p ar tner. For an LTC, the owners need to complete their return using the same method chosen by the LTC for their share of the income and deductions. An owner can choose a different method for other rental properties they own. Example An LTC uses the portfolio method. The portfolio was loss-making overall, so any shareholder who directly holds other residential properties subject to the ring- fencing rules can include those other properties as part of the portfolio. They can then use their share of the deductions that flow through from the LTC against their total residential income. This includes their residential income from the LTC and any other residential income they derive. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE20 Example An LTC uses the individual property basis. The shareholders must also use this method in their own returns. So, if residential deductions for the property exceed the residential income from the property, the shareholder can only use their share of the deductions up to their share of the income from the property. Their excess deductions cannot be used against residential income from a property they own directly. The Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 can be used to help calculate the figures required to be entered in your return. You can print a copy off our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Write the total gross residential rental income from the portfolio and/or individual property in Box 18B. Box 18C Net bright-line profit The bright-line property rule needs to be considered when none of the other land sale rules at Question 21 apply to the disposal of the property. This rule for residential property looks at the length of time a property is owned. If you sell or dispose of a residential property (including overseas property) within a certain timeframe and no exclusion applies, then your profit on the sale will be taxable. This applies no matter what your reason was for buying or selling the property or what kind of buyer you are. The bright-line property rule applies if you sell or dispose of a residential property you have owned for less than: • • 5 years for properties acquired between 29 March 2018 and 26 March 2021. • • 5 years for properties acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. • • 5 years for properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021 that qualify as a ‘new build’. 21 ird.govt.nz • • 10 years for all other properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021. For tax purposes, a property is generally acquired on the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is entered into (even if some standard conditions like getting finance or a building report still need to be met). This date will determine which bright-line period (5 or 10 years) applies for your property. For more information on when a property is acquired, see our Question we’ve been asked (QB) 17/02: Date of acquisition of land, and start date for 2-year bright-line test at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz There are other dates that are relevant for figuring out whether your property sale is taxable under the bright- line property rule. Generally, your bright-line period starts when the legal title is transferred to you and ends when you enter into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell the property. Where land is acquired or disposed of in a way that does not follow the standard land sale process, for example if you purchase “off the plan”, there are some different rules that apply to the bright-line period start and end dates. The bright-line property rule does not tax any profit made in specific situations. Relief is also available for certain ownership transfers. For more information on exclusions to the bright-line property rule, ownership transfers and rollover relief go to ird.govt.nz/brightline or our guide Bright-line property tax - IR1227. You can also use the property tax decision tool on our website to work out if you need to pay tax on the sale of your property. Go to ird.govt.nz/brightline If you sell or dispose of a residential property and the sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule, the amount of the previously denied interest under the interest limitation rules is treated as if it were part of the cost of the property in the year of disposal. If this results in a net loss, the deduction for the net loss is limited under the current rule that applies to losses from the disposal of bright-line property. If the disposal is not taxable, the interest previously denied a deduction remains non- deductible. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE22 For more information about the bright-line property rule, go to ird.govt.nz/brightline or our guide Bright-line property tax - IR1227. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Completing your return Income and losses for property subject to the bright-line property rule are treated differently in the tax return. After a taxable bright-line sale: • • if you have net income from the sale of the property (a profit), the net income is included in Box 18C. Unless the property is part of a portfolio, expenses from other properties cannot be offset against the net income from the disposal. • • if you have made a net loss when the property is sold, the loss must be carried forward to a later income year when it can be used to offset net income from the land sale provisions, including from future disposals subject to the bright-line rule. A bright-line loss is not recorded in the tax return. Please keep your own record of any bright-line losses you have made. Complete a Bright-line residential property sale information - IR833 form for each bright-line property sold or disposed of and include it with your return. The form explains how to calculate the resulting profit or loss. Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts, unless the income will be included in your return as part of your business income as a property speculator, property dealer, developer or builder. Box 18D Other residential income Write the other residential income in Box 18D. This includes the total from the following amounts: • • income in relation to a loan denominated in a foreign currency from the portfolio and/or individual property • • all depreciation recovery income from assets disposed of from the portfolio and/or individual property 23 ird.govt.nz • • net income from the taxable disposal of a residential property outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account. Box 18E Total combined residential income The amount in Box 18E is the total amount of Box 18B, Box 18C and Box 18D. Box 18F Residential rental deductions Write the total eligible deductions for the year for all ring- fenced residential rental properties in Residential rental deductions Box 18F. Note Do not include the amount of interest expense denied under the interest limitation rules in Box 18F. If you have an investment in a land rich entity, include: • • interest relating to the residential rental activity that is deductible under the interest limitation rules in Box 18F • • the amount of interest paid that does not relate to the residential rental property in Box 20B. Note The partners or owners share of the Total combined residential income and Residential rental deductions are shown in Boxes 27G and 27M on the IR7P or IR7L. For more information read the Rental income - IR264 guide. Question 19 Interest incurred from residential property This question applies to owners of residential property subject to the interest limitation rules. You do not need to complete this question for the following types of property: • • farmland • • hospitals, hospices, convalescent homes, nursing homes PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE24 • • rest homes and retirement villages • • hotels, motels, inns, camping grounds, hostels. For interest to be deductible, the general deductibility rules must be met. The interest will also not be deductible to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. Since 1 October 2021, interest is not deductible for residential property in New Zealand acquired on or after 27 March 2021, unless an exclusion or exemption applies (see below). For properties acquired before 27 March 2021, the ability to deduct interest on existing loans is being phased out between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025. For the 2023 tax year, you can claim 75% of the interest incurred from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023. Interest on any new loans drawn down on or after 27 March 2021 is not deductible. Special rules also apply for refinanced loans and for interest on revolving credit and overdraft facilities. Any interest on borrowings above the closing balance on 26 March 2021 is not deductible. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz/property/renting-out-residential-property Completing your return Complete question 19 for any interest expense you are claiming in this income tax return at Boxes 18F and 20B in relation to a house, apartment, flat or other structure that could be used for residential accommodation, either short-term or long-term. This includes if you have an arrangement to build such a structure, and bare land that could be used to build such a structure under the relevant district plan. Write the total interest on residential property in Box 19A. This is the total interest incurred on your borrowings for all your residential properties for this year. If you are using an IR3R form to prepare a summary for each rental property, this is the total of all the 7A Boxes. Write the amount of interest expense claimed in Box 19B. If you are using an IR3R form to prepare a summary for each rental property, this is the total of all the 7B Boxes. 25 ird.govt.nz Note The partners’ or owners’ share of Boxes 19A and 19B is included in their income tax returns in proportion to their share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC. If you have claimed an interest expense in Box 19B, at Box 19C tick the reason(s) for the interest expense claimed: • • A Māori exempt company or not a residential land company - The interest limitation rules do not apply to non-close companies or groups if less than 50% of its total assets consist of residential property (excluding development property but including shares in other companies that exceed this 50% test) at all times during the income year. A close company that is a Māori authority, eligible to be a Māori authority, or wholly-owned by an entity that is a Māori authority or eligible to be one is an exempt Māori company if it passes this 50% test. • • Certain schedule 15 exclusions or property not in NZ - The interest limitation rules apply to land in New Zealand only. Schedule 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 also allows you to claim interest for the following: • • main home – if a portion is used to earn income such as a flatting situation • • business premises (for example, a villa now used as a dental clinic) except if the business premises is used for providing accommodation and it’s not a person’s main home • • certain Māori land, papakāinga and kaumātua housing, and land transferred as part of settlement under Te Tiriti o Waitangi/Treaty of Waitangi • • employee accommodation • • student accommodation. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE26 • • Loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 - From 1 October 2021, the ability to claim interest is being phased out for the following situations: • • loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 • • property acquired before 27 March 2021 but the loan for the settlement of the property was not drawn down until on or after 27 March 2021 • • loans that relate to the purchase of a property acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. In other situations where the property is acquired on or after 27 March 2021, interest cannot be claimed from 1 October 2021 onwards. • • Emergency, transitional, social or council housing - You can claim interest for loans if your property is used for emergency, transitional or social housing when leased to the Crown, for example to Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or Kāinga Ora, or to a registered community housing provider. • • New build exemption - A ‘new build’ is a self- contained residence that is issued a Code Compliance Certificate (CCC) under the Building Act 2004, confirming the residence was added to the land on or after 27 March 2020. The exemption generally applies for 20 years. For more information about what qualifies as a new build go to ird.govt.nz/property/ renting-out-residential-property or our guide Rental income - IR264. • • Development or land business exemption - The development exemption does not require you to have a ‘land business’ and applies to land that you develop, subdivide, or build on to create a new build. The development may be a one-off. The land business exemption applies to land held as part of a developing, subdividing, or land-dealing business, or a business of erecting buildings on land. • • Approved build-to-rent exclusion – This applies to land that meets the criteria of build-to-rent land and is approved by Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - Ministry of 27 ird.govt.nz Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

Do not include it in the partnership tax credits. If the LTC is an “offshore RLWT person” and has sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. The LTC should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. The LTC can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the LTC and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than 1 amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to the LTC and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Question 22 Other income If you invested capital in a partnership or LTC but did not take an active part in the day-to-day operation or management of the business, any earnings would be considered passive income.

Losses from shares or other property If the partnership or LTC has made a loss and you can show that if the partnership or LTC had made a profit it would have been taxable, the partnership or LTC may be able to claim the loss as an expense. Include the total loss at Box 22B. Write the details of the loss on a separate sheet of paper and attach it to the top of page 3 of your IR7. Include details of other profits or losses made from similar sales, whether in this tax year or earlier. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE30 Financial arrangements A partner or owner must account for income from financial arrangements on an accrual basis. Financial arrangements include government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts and deferred property settlements. Changes to the rules for the treatment of financial arrangements have split the rules into 2 sets. Generally, the first set applies to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999 and the second applies to financial arrangements entered into, on or after that date. Both sets of rules require the income or expenditure to be spread over the term of the financial arrangement. Both sets of rules allow some exceptions from these spreading provisions if the partner or owner is a cash-basis holder (under the first set of rules), or a cash-basis person (under the second set of rules). The partner or owner is a cash-basis holder if, before 20 May 1999: • • they held financial arrangements of $600,000 or less in value, or • • the income derived from the financial arrangements was $70,000 or less, and • • the difference between the person's gross income calculated under the cash basis and that calculated under the accrual method is no more than $20,000. The partner or owner is a cash-basis person if, from 20 May 1999: • • the value of all financial arrangements added together is less than $1 million, or • • the absolute value (the value no matter whether it's a positive or a negative figure) calculated under the accrual rules in the income year from the financial arrangement is less than $100,000, and • • in comparing the gross income and expenditure using a spreading method under the accrual rules with the cash-basis income and expenditure, the result is less than $40,000. 31 ird.govt.nz To determine whether the partner or owner is a cash-basis holder or cash-basis person, they must take into account their share of the financial arrangement, or their share in the gross income or expenditure under the financial arrangement the partnership or LTC is a party to. Sale or maturity of financial arrangements Whether or not the exemption from the spreading methods applies, when a financial arrangement matures, is sold, remitted or transferred, you must do a "wash-up" calculation, known as a base price adjustment. The calculation ensures the total gains or losses from the financial arrangement are accounted for. If you need any information about calculating a base price adjustment, call us on 0800 443 773. Question 24 Expenses The partnership or LTC may have incurred expenses in generating its income, for example: • • commission deducted from interest and dividends • • expenses for return preparation, or • • interest paid to Inland Revenue for late payment of tax in the income year it is paid. If the expenses have not already been claimed in the return, print the amount in Box 24. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE32 Question 26 Deduction for losses extinguished on transition from a QC or LAQC If the partnership or LTC had losses which were extinguished on transitioning from a QC or LAQC, each owner or partner is allowed a deduction for an amount equal to the amount given by the following formula: (Loss balance extinguished − prior years' deductions) × partnership share or owner's effective interest Note This is limited to the partner's or owner's share of net partnership or net LTC income for the year. Loss balance extinguished is the loss balance extinguished on transition from a QC or LAQC. If it includes foreign losses please contact us to make sure they are accounted for correctly. Prior years' deductions is the total amount of deductions for extinguished losses allowed in previous income years for all persons with a share in the partnership, or an effective look-through interest in the LTC. If this is the first year deductions have been claimed for extinguished losses, the amount will be zero. Work out the maximum allowable deduction for each owner or partner using the calculation table below and on page 33. Boxes 1 to 3 only need to be completed once. Use the resulting figures for all owners or partners. Boxes 4 to 9 must be completed for each owner or partner using their information from the IR7L or IR7P. Loss balance extinguished (copy this figure to Box 26 on the IR7) 1 Prior years' deductions (copy this figure to Box 26A on the IR7) 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. 3 33 ird.govt.nz If the answer in Box 3 is zero, no further deductions for extinguished losses can be claimed by the owners or partners. If it is greater than zero, continue below. Note Information on completing the IR7L is explained later in this guide. Attribution of income/loss is explained on page 34, and how to complete Box 27Q is explained on page 36 of this guide. Copy the total income figure from Box 27K on the IR7L or IR7P to Box 4 4 For LTC owners, copy any non-allowable deductions this year from Box 27Q on the IR7L to Box 5 5 Add Boxes 4 and 5 and print the answer in Box 6. 6 If Box 6 is a loss, the owner or partner is not entitled to a deduction this year. If it is not a loss, continue below. Convert the owner's or partner's attribution of income/loss from Box 27B on the IR7L or IR7P to a decimal amount (for example 40% = .40). Print the answer in Box 7. 7 Multiply Box 3 by Box 7 and print the answer in Box 8. 8 Print the amount from either Box 6 or Box 8, whichever is the lesser, in Box 9 below. This is the maximum deduction for the owner or partner. Maximum deduction 9 Copy the amount from Box 9 to Box 27L on the IR7L or IR7P form. Add up the maximum deductions for all owners or partners and print the answer in Box 26B of the IR7 return. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE34 Question 27 Attribution of income/loss All income, losses and tax credits must be attributed to the partners or owners in proportion to their share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC. At Question 27 tick which entity the income/loss details are attached for. • • partnerships, complete the IR7P to provide attribution details for all partners, or • • LTCs, complete the IR7L to provide attribution details for all owners. Show the details for each partner or owner on the relevant form. If there are more than 2 partners or owners, use additional IR7P or IR7L forms. You can print them from our website ird.govt.nz Attach all IR7P or IR7L forms to the top of page 3 of your IR7 return. Completing your IR7L or IR7P Box 27A IRD number Print the partner's or owner's IRD number. If you do not know their IRD number you will need to contact them to request it. Box 27B Attribution of income/loss Show the attribution of income or loss the partner or owner is entitled to as a percentage of the total. Write percentages as four-digit numbers, for example show 15% as 15.00. Note For LTCs with only 1 owner the percentage will be a five-digit number, for example show 100% as 100.00.

PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE36 Boxes 27Q to 27T Non-allowable deductions (IR7L only) - where loss limitation rule does not apply for the owner(s) Note This information applies for an LTC who is not subject to the loss limitation rule. See the note on page 12. Non-allowable deductions this year There will not be non-allowable deductions this year as the loss limitation rule no longer applies. Do not include an amount in Box 27Q. Non-allowable deductions brought forward Note The LTC should have records of the non-allowable deductions brought forward. Prior years' non-allowable deductions claimed this year This will be the same as the amount in Box 27R and is the amount claimable this year. Copy the amount in Box 27R to Box 27S. Non-allowable deductions carried forward There should be no non-allowable deductions to carry forward. Leave Box 27S blank. Example 1 Loss limitation rule no longer applies - owner with previously non-allowable deductions The following details are for Catherine who owns all of the shares in Company A, an LTC. IRD number 12-121-212 Total gross income $10,000 Expenses/deductions $15,000 Loss $5,000 Non-allowable deductions brought forward $10,000 37 ird.govt.nz Boxes 27Q to 27T Non-allowable deductions (IR7L only) - where loss limitation rule still applies for the owners Note This information only applies for an LTC that is in a partnership or joint venture with another LTC. The loss limitation rule ensures that the deductions claimed reflect the level of an owner's economic loss in the LTC. The "owner's basis" refers to the adjusted tax book value of an owner's investment in the LTC. The deductions an owner can claim are restricted if the overall deductions exceed the owner's basis in the LTC. See examples of the loss limitation rule on pages 41 to 56. Note For each owner calculate their owner's basis and any non-allowable deductions using the tables and information on pages 38 and 39. Please see Part 7 of our Look-through companies - IR879 guide before calculating the owner's basis. It explains the terms used in the following calculation. If there's more than 1 owner, complete the tables on pages 38 and 39 for each owner separately. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE38 Calculate the owner's basis here: Investments 1 Distributions 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 3 Income 4 Add Boxes 3 and 4 5 Deductions from previous tax years (but excluding any non-allowable deductions in those years) 6 Subtract Box 6 from Box 5 7 Disallowed amounts 8 Subtract Box 8 from Box 7\* 9 \* If Box 9 is a negative amount it means the owner has negative equity in the LTC and their owner's basis will be treated as nil. Print "0.00" in Box 9. Note Deductions in Box 6 above also includes all the deductions claimed against gross income from the LTC from all sources in previous years in which the company was an LTC. For example, if the LTC has a rental property, all the deductions claimable against the rental income will be included in the total deductions figure, as well as expenses incurred in producing income from all other sources. 39 ird.govt.nz When each owner's basis (Box 9 on the previous page) has been calculated you can work out if there is any limitation on the deductions claimable for each owner. If the: • • owner's basis (Box 9) is more than their attribution of the deductions (expenses), you will not need to complete Box 27Q - go to Non-allowable deductions • • attribution of deductions (expenses) to the owners are more than their owner's basis you'll need to complete Boxes 1 to 3 below to calculate the amount to declare at Box 27Q. Attribution of this year's deductions (expenses) 1 Owner's basis (from Box 9 on page 38) 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 3 The result is non-allowable deductions this year. Copy the amount from Box 3 into Box 27Q on your IR7L. Any deductions an owner cannot claim because of the loss limitation rule are carried forward and may be claimed in future years, subject to the application of the loss limitation rule in those years. Owners may only use these deductions against income from the LTC. Non-allowable deductions Complete the calculation (Boxes 1 to 5) on the following page if you have: • • non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year (copy the amount from Box 26R Non-allowable deductions on your IR7L 2022 form into Box 27R on your IR7L 2023 form), or • • non-allowable deductions this year (that means Box 27Q has an amount in it). PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE40 Non-allowable deductions brought forward (also show this amount in Box 27R). 1 Non-allowable deductions this year (Box 3 on page 38, put zero if you do not have non-allowable deductions). 2 Add Boxes 1 and 2. 3 If your Owner's basis (Box 9 on page 38) was more than your attribution of this year's deductions (expenses), copy the difference to Box 4, otherwise print $0.00. 4 Subtract Box 4 from Box 3 (print $0.00 if this would equal a negative value). 5 Prior years' non-allowable deductions claimable this year If there is a figure in Box 4, you will be able to claim prior years' non-allowable deductions. Enter the smaller number of Box 3 and Box 4 as prior years' non-allowable deductions claimed this year in Box 27S on your IR7L. Non-allowable deductions carried forward The amount in Box 5 is the non-allowable deductions to carry forward.

The partnership or LTC is not assessed for tax, but each partner or owner is liable for tax on their share of income from the partnership or LTC. Each partner or owner must complete an income tax return showing all income, including their share from the partnership or LTC. Return due date If the partnership or LTC has a 31 March balance date, you have until 7 July 2024 to send in the return, unless you've been granted an extension of time. If you have an agent or a balance date other than 31 March this date may be different. Business industry classification (BIC) code We're lawfully required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. If your BIC code is not preprinted on the return or is different from the preprinted one, please enter the correct code. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to businessdescription.co.nz or call ACC on 0508 426 837. It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. Please provide the code only. Do not provide a description. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE5 Has the partnership or LTC ceased? If this is the final return, include a set of accounts (if required) up to the date the partnership or LTC ceased. Also include details of any distribution of assets and liabilities. If the partnership or LTC is registered for GST or as an employer, you will also need to complete a Business cessation - IR315 form to finalise your records. Depending on the partnership's or LTC's circumstances, other issues may also need to be finalised, for example outstanding returns and/or arrears. Find out how to finalise the partnership's or LTC's tax accounts or deregister for GST at ird.govt.nz Note An LTC is still a legal entity until it's taken off the Companies Register. An LTC can stop trading but still have tax obligations, for example completing returns. Nil returns Every partnership and LTC must complete an income tax return, whether or not it has been active. If there is no gross income to declare, losses to claim, and no disclosures to make at Question 28 (read page 56) you can complete a nil return. Complete the return up to Question 9 and sign the declaration at Question 29. For more information on look-through company rules, read our Look-through companies - IR879 guide. 6 ird.govt.nz Questions Question 10 Schedular payments If the partnership or LTC has received schedular payments, we'll send you a Summary of income, detailing the payments received and the tax deducted. From your Summary of income, copy the total tax deducted into Box 10A and gross payments into Box 10B. The Summary of income may not contain all your earnings information. If any details are missing, please include them at Question 10. If the partnership or LTC is registered for GST, your gross schedular payments should not include any GST. If they do, show the gross payments at Question 10 and deduct the GST portion at Question 24. Question 11 New Zealand interest Include interest from all New Zealand sources at Question 11. The interest payer will usually send you an RWT withholding certificate - IR15, showing the gross interest paid and the amount of RWT deducted. Write the total of all RWT deducted in Box 11A. Add up all the gross interest amounts (before the deduction of any tax) and write the total in Box 11B. Note If expenses are deductible against the interest income (for example commission), claim them at Question 24. Read the note about expenses on page 31. Do not send us interest statements or IR15 certificates with the return. Keep these in case we ask for them later. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE7 Interest on broken term deposits If you've broken a term deposit during the year, you may have to account for "negative interest". This is interest repaid on a term deposit and may reduce the amount of interest to declare in your return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest shown on the IR15 or equivalent statement. Deduct the allowable negative interest component, using the worksheet below, before entering the gross amount at Question 11 of your return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a later return when the term deposit matures. Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your RWT on interest form to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you've paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. 3 Copy this amount to Box 11B of your tax return. Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we paid you interest, include it in Box 11B for the income year the partnership or LTC received the interest. If the partnership or LTC paid us interest, include it as a deduction in Box 24 of the return for the income year the interest is paid. Read about expenses on page 31. Interest from overseas If the partnership or LTC received interest from overseas, convert your overseas interest and tax credits to New Zealand dollars and show the amounts at Question 16. Please read the notes about overseas income on pages 13 to 16. 8 ird.govt.nz Income from financial arrangements If the partnership or LTC was a party to a financial arrangement, such as government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts or deferred property settlements, you may have to calculate the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement using a spreading method, rather than on a cash basis. To work out if you must use a spreading method, please read Financial arrangements on pages 30 to 31. If the financial arrangement matures, is sold, remitted or transferred, you must do a "wash-up" calculation known as a base price adjustment. Any RWT will be deducted on a cash basis. Show the RWT deducted and any income from the financial arrangement in Boxes 11A and 11B. Question 12 New Zealand dividends Dividends are the part of a company's profits that it passes on to its shareholders. Unit trusts are treated as companies for income tax purposes. Distributions from unit trusts will generally be taxable and are treated as dividends. Complete Question 12 if you received any New Zealand dividends, including dividends from your local electricity or gas supplier. Do not include a dividend that's a distribution of the trust's capital and is tax free. The company or unit trust that paid you the dividend will send you a dividend statement. Do not send us any dividend statements with the return. Keep these in case we ask for them later. Note If expenses are deductible against the dividend income (for example commission), claim them at Question 24. Read the note about expenses on page 31. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE9 Credits attached to dividends A New Zealand company or unit trust may attach several types of credits to dividends. Imputation credits are credits for part of the tax the company has already paid on its profits, which means the dividends are not taxed twice. RWT is deducted from your dividend to bring the total credits withheld up to 33% of the gross dividend. What to show in your return Your dividend statements show the amount: • • you received (net dividend) • • of any imputation credits, and • • of any RWT credits. Add all these amounts together to work out your total gross dividends and enter this in Box 12B. Add up all the imputation credits and print the total in Box 12. Add any dividend RWT credits and print the total in Box 12A. Shares instead of dividends If the partnership or LTC received shares instead of dividends, include them as income at Question 12. Write the amount as if you received dividends instead of shares. Dividends from overseas Please read about overseas income on pages 13 to 16 of this guide. Question 13 Māori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. Fill in Question 13 if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. 10 ird.govt.nz Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a Māori authority credit and is part of the tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits, so the distributions are not taxed twice. What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: • • the distribution made to you, including the taxable portion and the non-taxable portion, and • • Māori authority credit. Transfer these amounts, leaving out any non-taxable distributions, to the relevant boxes at Question 13. Example A Māori authority makes a pre-tax profit of $10,000. It pays tax on this profit of $1,750 (Māori authority tax rate of 17.5%) and distributes the entire profit to their 10 members. Each member will receive $825 as a cash distribution and $175 of Māori authority credits. Each member of the authority liable to complete an IR7 return would show the following information at Question 13: Box 13A - $175 Box 13B - $1,000 (made up of $825 + $175) Non-taxable distribution You do not need to include in the IR7 return any other distributions received from a Māori authority that are not taxable in the hands of a Māori authority member. These amounts are non-taxable distributions and cannot have credits attached. For more information read our Māori authority guide - IR487. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE11 Question 14 Income from another partnership If the partnership or LTC received any income or loss from another partnership, write the details at Question 14. Do not include any: • • interest and RWT - show these at Question 11 • • dividends, imputation credits, and dividend RWT - show these at Question 12 • • Māori authority distributions and credits - show these at Question 13 • • overseas income and any credits attached - show these at Question 16, see pages 13 to 16 • • income and expenses from residential property including rental income and net bright-line profit - show these at Question 18, see page 17 • • other rental income - show this at Question 20, see page 27 • • taxable property sales or disposals - show these at Question 21, see page 27 • • other income - show this at Question 22, see page 28. Add up all the other income from partnerships and include the total in Box 14B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up any other tax credits and include the total in Box 14A. Question 15 Income from another LTC If the LTC received income from another LTC, write the details at Question 15. Note A partnership does not receive income or deductions from an LTC. If 2 or more people jointly receive income or deductions from an LTC, they should show these on their own returns, not the partnership's return. 12 ird.govt.nz LTCs are transparent (looked through), meaning the owners are treated as having received the income and incurred the loss of the company. The LTC will normally supply the information required to complete your return. Do not include any of the following types of income received from another LTC at Question 15: • • interest and RWT - show these at Question 11 • • dividends, imputation credits, and dividend RWT - show these at Question 12 • • Māori authority distributions and credits - show these at Question 13 • • overseas income and any credits attached - show these at Question 16, see pages 13 to 16 • • income and expenses from residential property including rental income and net bright-line profit - show these at Question 18, see page 17 • • other rental income - show this at Question 20, see page 27 • • taxable property sales or disposals - show these at Question 21, see page 27 • • other income - show this at Question 22, see page 29. Change to the loss limitation rule This rule limits the amount of deductions an owner can claim to the amount of their owner's basis, which represents their economic interest in the LTC. The loss limitation rule no longer applies to most LTC owners. It continues to apply for owners of LTCs that are in a partnership or joint venture that includes another LTC. What to show in your return Add up all the other income from LTCs and include the total in Box 15B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up any other tax credits and include the total in Box 15A. Add up any non-allowable deductions this year from LTCs and include the total in Box 15C. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE13 Note There should not be non-allowable deductions this year unless the loss limitation rule still applies. If you had any non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year, you may be able to claim some, or all, of the brought forward amount this year. Print the amount claimable in Box 15D prior years' non-allowable deductions claimed this year. If you have an amount in Box 15C, add this to Box 15B and put the total in Box 15E. If you have an amount in Box 15D, subtract this from Box 15B and put the total in Box 15E. If you do not have any amounts in Box 15C or Box 15D, copy the amount from Box 15B into Box 15E. Box 15E is your adjusted LTC income. Question 16 Overseas income If the partnership or LTC received overseas income, for example from interest or financial arrangements, show this at Question 16. Convert all overseas income and qualifying overseas tax paid to New Zealand dollars. You can do this by: • • using the rates available on ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators • • contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Tax paid overseas is distributed to the partners or owners and the tax credit limit is calculated on the partner's or owner's income tax return. Keep evidence of overseas tax paid with your tax records for 7 years. For more information about foreign tax credits read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461. If the income was received from a financial arrangement, please read our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 20, No 3 (April 2008). 14 ird.govt.nz Overseas dividends There are 2 situations covering the treatment of overseas dividends. Each owner or partner will need to determine which of the following applies to their share of foreign investments: • • If the shares have FIF income or loss calculated, do not include any dividends paid from these shares on the IR7 return. Instead, show the calculated FIF income or loss at Box 16B. • • If the shares are covered by 1 of the FIF exclusions (see page 15), show the dividends at Box 16B. Each owner or partner will need to advise their individual amount of either the FIF income or loss (or their FIF calculation method) or the dividend, to be included on the IR7 return. Show each owner's or partner's individual amount, plus any other allocation of overseas income, at Box 16B on the IR7 return and at Box 27F on the IR7L or IR7P form - see page 34. This information is also used in determining the income amount at Box 4 on page 38 of this guide. In either situation, include any qualifying overseas tax credits attached to the dividends at Box 16A. Some Australian dividends can have New Zealand imputation credits attached. Include these at Box 12. Note you cannot claim Australian franking credits. If the partnership or LTC received dividends from an overseas company through an agent or trustee who deducted RWT in New Zealand or dividends treated as interest, show the New Zealand RWT deducted at Box 12A. Note If you've shown an imputation credit in Box 12 or an RWT credit in Box 12A and there is no income associated to these in Box 12B, you'll need to attach a note to the top of page 3 of your return with the details. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE15 Foreign investment fund (FIF) income or loss If at any time during the 2024 income year the partnership or LTC held rights like shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, foreign unit trust, foreign superannuation scheme or foreign life insurance policy, the partners or owners may be required to calculate FIF income or loss in their own income tax returns. Generally, the partners or owners will use the fair dividend rate to calculate FIF income. The partners or owners may also need to complete an additional FIF disclosure form. See Question 28 on page 56. The main exclusions from an interest in a FIF are: • • investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts. Investments covered in the list are available in the Australian share exemption list - IR871 • • interest in certain Australian unit trusts • • limited exemptions for interest in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand) • • a 10% or greater interest in a CFC • • an individual or trustee of certain trusts, who is a partner or owner and holds, at all times in the income year, FIFs with a total cost of $50,000 or less. You can find more information on the exclusions and the FIF rules at ird.govt.nz/foreign-investment-funds and in our Tax Information Bulletins (TIBs) - see the online index for relevant issues. Controlled foreign company (CFC) income or loss If at any time during the 2024 income year the partnership or LTC has attributed CFC income or loss, the partners or owners may be required to calculate this in their own income tax returns. A loss from a CFC cannot be used to offset domestic income or be included in domestic losses that are carried forward to the 2024 income year. Generally, these losses 16 ird.govt.nz can only offset income or future income from CFCs that are resident in the same country as the CFC that incurred the loss. The partners or owners may also need to complete an additional CFC disclosure form. See Question 28 on page 56. Question 17 Business income Write the net profit or loss in Box 17B. This is the amount of income or loss after deducting all allowable business expenditure. If this is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Refer to our Smart business - IR320 guide for information on allowable business expenditure and record keeping. Attach 1 of these to the top of page 3 of your return: • • a set of the partnership's or LTC's financial accounts • • a completed Financial statements summary - IR10 form • • a completed Farming income - IR3F form, or Schedule of business income - IR3B form. If you complete an IR10, which speeds up the processing of the return, you do not need to send us your financial accounts as well, but keep them in case we ask for them later. Attribution rule Anyone who provides services and puts an intermediary between themselves and the recipient of the personal service has income earned allocated to them, not the intermediary. If this rule applies to persons associated to your partnership or LTC, it will affect the amount of taxable income in this return. When applying the attribution rule, LTCs are treated as associated entities and not as being transparent. To find out how to apply this rule, please read our Ta x Information Bulletins (TIBs), Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000), Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001), and Vol 21, No 8 Pt 2 (October/November 2009). If you need more information, contact us - see page 58. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE17 Question 18 Income and expenses from residential property This question applies to owners of residential property, including overseas property, that have: • • income subject to the residential property deduction rules • • net income from a bright-line sale • • income in relation to a loan in a foreign currency • • depreciation recovery income from disposed assets • • net income from the taxable disposal of a residential property outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account. Residential property deduction rules Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules). The rules generally limit the amount of residential deductions you can claim in the year to the total amount of residential income earned in that year. If the deductions are more than your income, the difference must be carried forward to the next year you earn income from the residential property, including income from properties held on revenue account. The residential property calculations are made at the partner or owner level as they may have other residential income and deductions that need to be included. Any rental income or loss and net income or loss from a taxable disposal is fully excluded from the rules if the property is: • • the main home • • subject to the mixed-use asset rules (for example, a holiday home rented out part-time and not used for at least 62 days in the income year, or 62 working days in the income year if it’s usually only used on working days), or • • owned by companies other than close companies, or • • owned by government enterprises, or • • certain employee accommodation. 18 ird.govt.nz For these types of property, any rental income or loss is shown at Box 20B and net income or net loss from a taxable disposal shown in Box 21B. Any rental net loss and net loss from a taxable disposal is partially excluded from the rules if it is for: • • property that will always be taxed on sale, being revenue account property of a person in the business of building, developing or dealing in land, or • • other revenue account property the person has notified us they want the exclusion to apply to. For these types of property any rental net loss is shown at Box 20B and taxable disposal net loss shown at Box 21B. The residential property deduction rules also apply to a partnership or LTC that has borrowed money to acquire an interest in certain entities that have significant rental property holdings - a residential land-rich entity - and has interest expenditure on the borrowed money. Residential land-rich entity - a close company, partnership or look-through company that holds more than 50% of its assets by value in residential land, directly or indirectly. These entities come under the interposed entities rules as part of the residential property deduction rules. For more information about the interposed entity rules, see page 60 of the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No.8 September 2019. Read our Rental income - IR264 guide for more information on: • • when the rules apply • • how to calculate your income • • the amount of deductions you can claim this year, and • • the amount of any excess deductions that must be carried forward. Completing your return Tick the method you have used to calculate your residential property income and deductions. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE19 You can use 1 of the following methods: • • Portfolio basis - combine income and deductions for all rental properties in the portfolio. • • Individual, property-by-property basis - income and deductions of individual property calculated separately to other property. You need to maintain separate records for each property to choose this option. • • Combination of the individual basis and portfolio basis - choose to apply different methods to different property. Some properties are held in a portfolio and others are held on an individual basis. For a partnership most of the calculations for excess rental deductions are made in the partners’ return. The partnership needs to provide sufficient information for the partners to complete their return correctly. If a partner wants to use the individual method the partnership needs to maintain separate records for each rental property and pass each property’s details to the p ar tner. For an LTC, the owners need to complete their return using the same method chosen by the LTC for their share of the income and deductions. An owner can choose a different method for other rental properties they own. Example An LTC uses the portfolio method. The portfolio was loss-making overall, so any shareholder who directly holds other residential properties subject to the ring- fencing rules can include those other properties as part of the portfolio. They can then use their share of the deductions that flow through from the LTC against their total residential income. This includes their residential income from the LTC and any other residential income they derive. 20 ird.govt.nz Example An LTC uses the individual property basis. The shareholders must also use this method in their own returns. So, if residential deductions for the property exceed the residential income from the property, the shareholder can only use their share of the deductions up to their share of the income from the property. Their excess deductions cannot be used against residential income from a property they own directly. The Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 can be used to help calculate the figures required to be entered in your return. You can print a copy off our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Write the total gross residential rental income from the portfolio and/or individual property in Box 18B. Box 18C Net bright-line profit The bright-line property rule needs to be considered when none of the other land sale rules at Question 21 apply to the disposal of the property. This rule for residential property looks at the length of time a property is owned. If you sell or dispose of a residential property (including overseas property) within a certain timeframe and no exclusion applies, then your profit on the sale will be taxable. This applies no matter what your reason was for buying or selling the property or what kind of buyer you are. The bright-line property rule applies if you sell or dispose of a residential property you have owned for less than: • • 5 years for properties acquired between 29 March 2018 and 26 March 2021. • • 5 years for properties acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. • • 5 years for properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021 that qualify as a ‘new build’. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE21 • • 10 years for all other properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021. For tax purposes, a property is generally acquired on the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is entered into (even if some standard conditions like getting finance or a building report still need to be met). This date will determine which bright-line period (5 or 10 years) applies for your property. For more information on when a property is acquired, see our Question we’ve been asked (QB) 17/02: Date of acquisition of land, and start date for 2-year bright-line test at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz There are other dates that are relevant for figuring out whether your property sale is taxable under the bright- line property rule. Generally, your bright-line period starts when the legal title is transferred to you and ends when you enter into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell the property. Where land is acquired or disposed of in a way that does not follow the standard land sale process, for example if you purchase “off the plan”, there are some different rules that apply to the bright-line period start and end dates. The bright-line property rule does not tax any profit made in specific situations. Relief is also available for certain ownership transfers. For more information on exclusions to the bright-line property rule, ownership transfers and rollover relief go to ird.govt.nz/brightline or our guide Bright-line property tax - IR1227. You can also use the property tax decision tool on our website to work out if you need to pay tax on the sale of your property. Go to ird.govt.nz/brightline If you sell or dispose of a residential property and the sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule, the amount of the previously denied interest under the interest limitation rules is treated as if it were part of the cost of the property in the year of disposal. If this results in a net loss, the deduction for the net loss is limited under the current rule that applies to losses from the disposal of bright-line property. If the disposal is not taxable, the interest previously denied a deduction remains non- deductible. 22 ird.govt.nz For more information about the bright-line property rule, go to ird.govt.nz/brightline or our guide Bright-line property tax - IR1227. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Completing your return Income and losses for property subject to the bright-line property rule are treated differently in the tax return. After a taxable bright-line sale: • • if you have net income from the sale of the property (a profit), the net income is included in Box 18C. Unless the property is part of a portfolio, expenses from other properties cannot be offset against the net income from the disposal. • • if you have made a net loss when the property is sold, the loss must be carried forward to a later income year when it can be used to offset net income from the land sale provisions, including from future disposals subject to the bright-line rule. A bright-line loss is not recorded in the tax return. Please keep your own record of any bright-line losses you have made. Complete a Bright-line residential property sale information - IR833 form for each bright-line property sold or disposed of and include it with your return. The form explains how to calculate the resulting profit or loss. Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts, unless the income will be included in your return as part of your business income as a property speculator, property dealer, developer or builder. Box 18D Other residential income Write the other residential income in Box 18D. This includes the total from the following amounts: • • income in relation to a loan denominated in a foreign currency from the portfolio and/or individual property • • all depreciation recovery income from assets disposed of from the portfolio and/or individual property PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE23 • • net income from the taxable disposal of a residential property outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account. Box 18E Total combined residential income The amount in Box 18E is the total amount of Box 18B, Box 18C and Box 18D. Box 18F Residential rental deductions Write the total eligible deductions for the year for all ring- fenced residential rental properties in Residential rental deductions Box 18F. Note Do not include the amount of interest expense denied under the interest limitation rules in Box 18F. If you have an investment in a land rich entity, include: • • interest relating to the residential rental activity that is deductible under the interest limitation rules in Box 18F • • the amount of interest paid that does not relate to the residential rental property in Box 20B. Note The partners or owners share of the Total combined residential income and Residential rental deductions are shown in Boxes 27G and 27M on the IR7P or IR7L. For more information read the Rental income - IR264 guide. Question 19 Interest incurred from residential property This question applies to owners of residential property subject to the interest limitation rules. You do not need to complete this question for the following types of property: • • farmland • • hospitals, hospices, convalescent homes, nursing homes 24 ird.govt.nz • • rest homes and retirement villages • • hotels, motels, inns, camping grounds, hostels. For interest to be deductible, the general deductibility rules must be met. The interest will also not be deductible to the extent it is of a private or domestic nature. Since 1 October 2021, interest is not deductible for residential property in New Zealand acquired on or after 27 March 2021, unless an exclusion or exemption applies (see below). For property acquired before 27 March 2021, the ability to deduct interest on existing loans is limited to a percentage of the interest incurred. For the 2024 tax year, you can claim 50% of the interest incurred from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024. Interest on any new loans drawn down on or after 27 March 2021 is not deductible. Special rules also apply for refinanced loans and for interest on revolving credit and overdraft facilities. Any interest on borrowings above the closing balance on 26 March 2021 is not deductible. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz/property-interest-rules Completing your return Complete question 19 for any interest expense you are claiming in this income tax return at Boxes 18F and 20B in relation to a house, apartment, flat or other structure that could be used for residential accommodation, either short stays or long term. This includes if you have an arrangement to build such a structure, and bare land that could be used to build such a structure under the relevant district plan. Write the total interest on residential property in Box 19A. This is the total interest incurred on your borrowings for all your residential properties for this year. If you are using an IR3R form to prepare a summary for each rental property, this is the total of all the 7A Boxes. Write the amount of interest expense claimed in Box 19B. If you are using an IR3R form to prepare a summary for each rental property, this is the total of all the 7B Boxes. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE25 Note The partners’ or owners’ share of Boxes 19A and 19B is included in their income tax returns in proportion to their share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC. If you have claimed an interest expense in Box 19B, at Box 19C tick the reason(s) for the interest expense claimed: • • A Māori exempt company or not a residential land company - The interest limitation rules do not apply to non-close companies or groups if less than 50% of its total assets consist of residential property (excluding development property but including shares in other companies that exceed this 50% test) at all times during the income year. A close company that is a Māori authority, eligible to be a Māori authority, or wholly-owned by an entity that is a Māori authority or eligible to be one is an exempt Māori company if it passes this 50% test. • • Certain schedule 15 exclusions or property not in NZ - The interest limitation rules apply to land in New Zealand only. Schedule 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 also allows you to claim interest for the following: • • main home – if a portion is used to earn income such as a flatting situation • • business premises (for example, a villa now used as a dental clinic) except if the business premises is used for providing accommodation and it’s not a person’s main home • • certain Māori land, papakāinga and kaumātua housing, and land transferred as part of settlement under Te Tiriti o Waitangi/Treaty of Waitangi • • employee accommodation • • student accommodation. 26 ird.govt.nz • • Loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 - When an exclusion or exemption does not apply, you can claim 50% of the interest incurred for the following situations: • • loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 • • property acquired before 27 March 2021 but the loan for the settlement of the property was not drawn down until on or after 27 March 2021 • • loans that relate to the purchase of a property acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. In other situations where the property is acquired on or after 27 March 2021, interest cannot be claimed. • • Emergency, transitional, social or council housing - You can claim interest for loans if your property is used for emergency, transitional or social housing when leased or contracted (directly or indirectly) to the Crown, for example to Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or Kāinga Ora, or to a registered community housing provider. • • New build exemption - A ‘new build’ is a self- contained residence that is issued a Code Compliance Certificate (CCC) under the Building Act 2004, confirming the residence was added to the land on or after 27 March 2020. The exemption generally applies for 20 years. For more information about what qualifies as a new build go to ird.govt.nz/property/ renting-out-residential-property or our guide Rental income - IR264. • • Development or land business exemption - The development exemption does not require you to have a ‘land business’ and applies to land that you develop, subdivide, or build on to create a new build. The development may be a one-off. The land business exemption applies to land held as part of a developing, subdividing, or land-dealing business, or a business of erecting buildings on land. • • Approved build-to-rent exclusion – This applies to land that meets the criteria of build-to-rent land and PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE27 is approved by Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). You can claim interest for loans if your property is recorded on the build-to-rent asset register maintained by HUD.

Question 21 Income from taxable property sales or disposals Include all income and tax losses from land sales or disposals of other property not included at Question 18. Profits from land sales are taxable if you bought a property (including an overseas property) for the purpose of reselling it or are in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. The profits may also be taxable if the partnership or LTC: • • is a builder and improved a property before selling it • • developed or subdivided land and sold sections, or • • had a change of zoning on the property and sold it within ten years of buying it. 28 ird.govt.nz Write the total profit or loss from the sale or disposal of other property in Box 21B. Net profit from a bright-line sale is generally included in Box 18C. Only include in Box 21B the net profit from a bright-line sale excluded at Question 18, for example the bright-line sale of a mixed-use asset. Do not include any net loss from a bright-line sale. For more information on the land sale rules, go to ird.govt.nz/buying-selling or our guide Tax and your property transactions - IR361. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Box 21A Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If a partner had RLWT deducted from the sale or transfer of a residential property located in New Zealand, they’ll need to show the full amount of the RLWT in their own individual income tax return. Do not include it in the partnership tax credits. If the LTC is an “offshore RLWT person” and has sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. The LTC should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. The LTC can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the LTC and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than 1 amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to the LTC and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Question 22 Other income If you invested capital in a partnership or LTC but did not take an active part in the day-to-day operation or management of the business, any earnings would be considered passive income. Enter this amount at Question 22 unless you’ve already included it at another Question on your return. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE29 Also at Question 22 show any other income the partnership or LTC received, for example sale of: • • non-FIF shares or other property • • securities. If the partnership or LTC received any of the income listed above, please read the following. Income from sale of non-FIF shares or other property Profits from the sale of shares and other property are taxable if the partnership or LTC buys: • • and sells shares or other property as a business • • shares or other property for resale, or • • shares or property to make a profit. List the details of gross income and expenses from these sales on a separate sheet of paper and attach it to the top of page 3 of your IR7. Include the total profits in Box 22B. Selling or disposing of assets If the partnership or LTC sold or disposed of a depreciated asset for more than its adjusted tax value, you may need to account for depreciation recovered. You can use the depreciation calculator on our website ird.govt.nz to get a complete depreciation schedule for any asset. The schedule includes the amount to claim in the year of purchase and any adjustment in the year of sale. For more information read Depreciation - a guide for businesses - IR260, and either Depreciation rates - IR265 or Historic depreciation rates - IR267. Losses from shares or other property If the partnership or LTC has made a loss and you can show that if the partnership or LTC had made a profit it would have been taxable, the partnership or LTC may be able to claim the loss as an expense. Include the total loss at Box 22B. Write the details of the loss on a separate sheet of paper and attach it to the top of page 3 of your IR7. Include details of other profits or losses made from similar sales, whether in this tax year or earlier. 30 ird.govt.nz Financial arrangements A partner or owner must account for income from financial arrangements on an accrual basis. Financial arrangements include government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts and deferred property settlements. Changes to the rules for the treatment of financial arrangements have split the rules into 2 sets. Generally, the first set applies to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999 and the second applies to financial arrangements entered into, on or after that date. Both sets of rules require the income or expenditure to be spread over the term of the financial arrangement. Both sets of rules allow some exceptions from these spreading provisions if the partner or owner is a cash-basis holder (under the first set of rules), or a cash-basis person (under the second set of rules). The partner or owner is a cash-basis holder if, before 20 May 1999: • • they held financial arrangements of $600,000 or less in value, or • • the income derived from the financial arrangements was $70,000 or less, and • • the difference between the person's gross income calculated under the cash basis and that calculated under the accrual method is no more than $20,000. The partner or owner is a cash-basis person if, from 20 May 1999: • • the value of all financial arrangements added together is less than $1 million, or • • the absolute value (the value no matter whether it's a positive or a negative figure) calculated under the accrual rules in the income year from the financial arrangement is less than $100,000, and • • in comparing the gross income and expenditure using a spreading method under the accrual rules with the cash-basis income and expenditure, the result is less than $40,000. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE31 To determine whether the partner or owner is a cash-basis holder or cash-basis person, they must take into account their share of the financial arrangement, or their share in the gross income or expenditure under the financial arrangement the partnership or LTC is a party to. Sale or maturity of financial arrangements Whether or not the exemption from the spreading methods applies, when a financial arrangement matures, is sold, remitted or transferred, you must do a "wash-up" calculation, known as a base price adjustment. The calculation ensures the total gains or losses from the financial arrangement are accounted for. If you need any information about calculating a base price adjustment, call us on 0800 443 773. Question 24 Expenses The partnership or LTC may have incurred expenses in generating its income, for example: • • commission deducted from interest and dividends • • expenses for return preparation, or • • interest paid to Inland Revenue for late payment of tax in the income year it is paid. If the expenses have not already been claimed in the return, print the amount in Box 24. 32 ird.govt.nz Question 26 Deduction for losses extinguished on transition from a QC or LAQC If the partnership or LTC had losses which were extinguished on transitioning from a QC or LAQC, each owner or partner is allowed a deduction for an amount equal to the amount given by the following formula: (Loss balance extinguished − prior years' deductions) × partnership share or owner's effective interest Note This is limited to the partner's or owner's share of net partnership or net LTC income for the year. Loss balance extinguished is the loss balance extinguished on transition from a QC or LAQC. If it includes foreign losses please contact us to make sure they are accounted for correctly. Prior years' deductions is the total amount of deductions for extinguished losses allowed in previous income years for all persons with a share in the partnership, or an effective look-through interest in the LTC. If this is the first year deductions have been claimed for extinguished losses, the amount will be zero. Work out the maximum allowable deduction for each owner or partner using the calculation table below and on page 33. Boxes 1 to 3 only need to be completed once. Use the resulting figures for all owners or partners. Boxes 4 to 9 must be completed for each owner or partner using their information from the IR7L or IR7P.

Write percentages as four-digit numbers, for example show 15% as 15.00. Note For LTCs with only 1 owner the percentage will be a five-digit number, for example show 100% as 100.00. For LTCs, effective look-through interest determines each owner's attribution of income or loss from the LTC. Each owner's effective look-through interest is generally determined by the percentage of shares the owner has in t h e LTC .

Example 1 Loss limitation rule no longer applies - owner with previously non-allowable deductions The following details are for Catherine who owns all of the shares in Company A, an LTC. IRD number 12-121-212 Total gross income $10,000 Expenses/deductions $15,000 Loss $5,000 Non-allowable deductions brought forward $10,000 PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE37 Boxes 27Q to 27T Non-allowable deductions (IR7L only) - where loss limitation rule still applies for the owners Note This information only applies for an LTC that is in a partnership or joint venture with another LTC. The loss limitation rule ensures that the deductions claimed reflect the level of an owner's economic loss in the LTC. The "owner's basis" refers to the adjusted tax book value of an owner's investment in the LTC. The deductions an owner can claim are restricted if the overall deductions exceed the owner's basis in the LTC. See examples of the loss limitation rule on pages 41 to 56. Note For each owner calculate their owner's basis and any non-allowable deductions using the tables and information on pages 38 and 39. Please see Part 7 of our Look-through companies - IR879 guide before calculating the owner's basis. It explains the terms used in the following calculation. If there's more than 1 owner, complete the tables on pages 38 and 39 for each owner separately. 38 ird.govt.nz Calculate the owner's basis here: Investments 1 Distributions 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 3 Income 4 Add Boxes 3 and 4 5 Deductions from previous tax years (but excluding any non-allowable deductions in those years) 6 Subtract Box 6 from Box 5 7 Disallowed amounts 8 Subtract Box 8 from Box 7\* 9 \* If Box 9 is a negative amount it means the owner has negative equity in the LTC and their owner's basis will be treated as nil. Print "0.00" in Box 9. Note Deductions in Box 6 above also includes all the deductions claimed against gross income from the LTC from all sources in previous years in which the company was an LTC. For example, if the LTC has a rental property, all the deductions claimable against the rental income will be included in the total deductions figure, as well as expenses incurred in producing income from all other sources. PARTNERSHIP AND LTC RETURN GUIDE39 When each owner's basis (Box 9 on the previous page) has been calculated you can work out if there is any limitation on the deductions claimable for each owner. If the: • • owner's basis (Box 9) is more than their attribution of the deductions (expenses), you will not need to complete Box 27Q - go to Non-allowable deductions • • attribution of deductions (expenses) to the owners are more than their owner's basis you'll need to complete Boxes 1 to 3 below to calculate the amount to declare at Box 27Q. Attribution of this year's deductions (expenses) 1 Owner's basis (from Box 9 on page 38) 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 3 The result is non-allowable deductions this year. Copy the amount from Box 3 into Box 27Q on your IR7L. Any deductions an owner cannot claim because of the loss limitation rule are carried forward and may be claimed in future years, subject to the application of the loss limitation rule in those years. Owners may only use these deductions against income from the LTC. Non-allowable deductions Complete the calculation (Boxes 1 to 5) on the following page if you have: • • non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year (copy the amount from Box 26R Non-allowable deductions on your IR7L 2023 form into Box 27R on your IR7L 2024 form), or • • non-allowable deductions this year (that means Box 27Q has an amount in it). 40 ird.govt.nz Non-allowable deductions brought forward (also show this amount in Box 27R). 1 Non-allowable deductions this year (Box 3 on page 38, put zero if you do not have non-allowable deductions). 2 Add Boxes 1 and 2. 3 If your Owner's basis (Box 9 on page 38) was more than your attribution of this year's deductions (expenses), copy the difference to Box 4, otherwise print $0.00. 4 Subtract Box 4 from Box 3 (print $0.00 if this would equal a negative value). 5 Prior years' non-allowable deductions claimable this year If there is a figure in Box 4, you will be able to claim prior years' non-allowable deductions. Enter the smaller number of Box 3 and Box 4 as prior years' non-allowable deductions claimed this year in Box 27S on your IR7L. Non-allowable deductions carried forward The amount in Box 5 is the non-allowable deductions to carry forward. Copy this amount into Box 27T.

IR830 | February 2021 If you’re a self-employed real estate salesperson/agent it’s important to know what your tax responsibilities are. This factsheet provides an overview of your income tax and GST obligations. Working in the real estate industry Income tax You pay income tax on your net profit for the year, this is your gross income less any expenses or losses you have. Commissions paid to real estate salesperson/agents are schedular payments and are usually taxed at a flat rate of 20%. Tax is worked out on the GST exclusive amount. Tax on schedular payments is deducted by the person who pays you, unless you have a valid certificate of exemption. For more information go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: schedular payments). Expenses To claim a deduction for business expenses • You must have spent the money yourself and weren’t reimbursed. • It must be directly related to earning your business income. • You must have a record to prove it. Refer to IR830A. End of year tax return You will receive an automatic income tax assessment in myIR at the end of the tax year. You need to check the information, including any schedular income, is showing correctly and add in your expenses. GST GST is a tax added to the price of most goods and services by a GST-registered person. GST is charged at a rate of 15%. In most cases, the agency you work for will require you to be GST-registered (because they are GST-registered and charge their customers GST on commissions). If your agency doesn’t require you to be GST-registered, you must register if your commission sales (turnover) are: • Over $60,000 for the last 12 months, or • Expected to go over $60,000 for the next 12 months. Note: As a salesperson/agent selling on behalf of a GST- registered agency, your commission should include GST. But it doesn’t always, so it’s important you speak to your agency and/or tax agent first. For more information go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: GST). Tips for filing GST returns How often you file GST returns is called a filing frequency. The options are: • Monthly • Two-monthly • Six-monthly How you report your GST to us is called an accounting basis. The options are: • Payments • Invoice • Hybrid The default filing frequency is two-monthly and the default accounting basis is the invoice basis but you can choose a different one depending on your turnover. Your tax invoices will show your total commission, tax and GST. When completing your GST return, include your total commission based on your invoice. If you use the figure from your bank statement, you’ll be missing the tax and under-declaring your income.

Notes to complete the IR833 Bright-line test for residential property Residential property includes land: • with a house on it • the owner will build a house on at some stage, or • the owner may one day build a house on. Under the bright-line test a sale of residential property is taxable in certain circumstances, regardless of your intentions when you acquired it. This includes: • properties bought/acquired on or after 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive, which have subsequently been sold/ disposed of within two years, and • properties bought/acquired on or after 29 March 2018 which have subsequently been sold/disposed of within five years. If the bright-line test applies to your property transaction, and none of the exclusions apply, then you will have to pay tax on any profit you've made on the sale or disposal of the property. Exclusions For individuals and trusts (in limited circumstances), there are specific exclusions to the bright-line test. These are: Main home - If you are selling a property you need to decide if it's your main home. You can only have 1 main home. It is the property you have the greatest connection to. You can use the main home exclusion if the following 2 situations apply: • you have used a property as your main home for more than 50% of the time you’ve owned it, and • you have used more than 50% of the property's area (including your backyard, gardens and garage). Main home held in a trust - a sale/disposal by a trustee where the property was the main home of the principal settlor of the trust (or the principal settlor does not have a main home) and it was the main home of a beneficiary of the trust. Inherited property - a transfer of property to an executor or administrator, followed by the transfer to an individual beneficiary, and the sale of the property by the beneficiary. Note: The main home exclusion does not apply if it has been used two or more times in the previous two years. Relevant dates for property sales subject to the bright-line test (Boxes 4 and 5) If you have ticked that the sale or disposal of the property is taxable under the bright-line test, use the dates in the table below. Type of purchase/acquisitionDate to use Purchase of propertyRegistration date (date the property transfer was registered with Land Information New Zealand) Purchase of property where no registration occurs prior to the bright-line sale/disposal date Latest date that you acquired an interest in the property e.g. date of contract Sale “off the plan” where there is no title for the landDate of agreement for sale and purchase Acquiring property by way of subdivision of property where registration of the undivided property has occurred prior to the bright-line sale/disposal date The original date of registration for the undivided property Acquiring property by way of subdivision of property where no registration occurs prior to the bright-line sale/disposal date The latest date you acquired an interest in the undivided land e.g. date of contract Type of sale/disposalDate to use Sale, transfer or disposal of property under an agreementDate you entered into an agreement for sale, transfer or disposal Gifting of propertyDate the gift was made Compulsory acquisition of property by the Crown, a local authority or a public authority Date of compulsory acquisition Mortgagee saleDate the property is disposed of by or for the mortgagee as a result of the mortgagor's default Disposals not covered aboveDate you disposed of the property Deductible expenses (Box 8) Capital expenses incurred in acquiring the property and capital improvements will generally be deductible expenditure. You may not claim a deduction for private expenses relating to using the property as your residence. Holding costs are expenses such as interest, rates and insurance that are incurred as a result of owing land and are deductible to the extent that the land is used to earn taxable income. If you're not sure whether an expense is deductible, we recommend you seek advice from a tax agent. Bright-line loss If your total costs are more than the sale price of your property, you can only offset the loss against net income from another property sale. Any remaining loss can only be used in a future year when you have net income from another property sale. Provisional tax If your tax to pay on the taxable profit from your property sale is more than $5,000 tax at the end of the year from your last return ($2500 before 2020 return), you may be required to pay provisional tax in the following tax year. If you're not likely to have the same amount of tax to pay, you could consider estimating your provisional tax for the following year. Because there are penalties for under- paying provisional tax, we recommend you get professional advice about doing this. For more information read our Provisional tax - IR289 guide.

Notes to complete the IR833 Bright-line property rule for residential property Residential property includes land: • with a house on it • the owner will build a house on at some stage, or • the owner may one day build a house on. Under the bright-line property rule, regardless of your intentions when you acquired it, a sale of residential property may be taxable if you acquired it on or after: • 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive, and sold/disposed of it within 2 years • 29 March 2018 through to 26 March 2021 inclusive, and sold/disposed of it within 5 years. This includes property acquired as a result of an offer made to purchase property on or before 23 March 2021, and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021, or • 27 March 2021 and sold/disposed of it within 10 years. If one of these bright-line periods applies to your property transaction, and none of the exclusions apply, then you will have to pay tax on any profit you've made on the sale or disposal of the property. Exclusions For individuals and trusts (in limited circumstances), there are specific exclusions to the bright-line property rule. These are: Inherited property - a sale of a residential property that was transferred to an executor or administrator of a deceased estate or to an individual beneficiary. Relationship property settlements - property received as part of a relationship settlement agreement. Main home - If you are selling a property you need to decide if it's your main home. You can only have 1 main home. It is the property you have the greatest connection to. Main home held in a trust - a sale/disposal by a trustee where the property was the main home of the principal settlor of the trust (or the principal settlor does not have a main home) and it was the main home of a beneficiary of the trust. You can use the main home exclusion if the situations in the table below apply. Main home exclusionThe situations that must apply Properties acquired before 27 March 2021You have used: • a property as your main home for more than 50% of the time you’ve owned it, and • more than 50% of the property's area (including your backyard, gardens and garage) as your main home. Properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021You have used: • a property as your main home for 100% of the time you’ve owned it. This includes any continuous period of up to 12 months where it was not used as your main home, and • more than 50% of the property's area (including your backyard, gardens and garage) as your main home. Note: The main home exclusion does not apply if it has been used 2 or more times in the previous 2 years, or you or a group of persons have a regular pattern of buying and selling your main home. Relevant dates for property sales subject to the bright-line property rule (Boxes 4 and 5) If you have ticked that the sale or disposal of the property is taxable under the bright-line property rule, use the dates in the table below. Type of purchase/acquisitionDate to use Purchase/acquisition of propertyDate of registration with Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) Purchase/acquisition where no registration occurs prior to the sale/ disposal date The latest date you acquired an interest in the property, for example the date of contract.

If your property is subject to the 10 year bright-line period and it was not your main home for the entire time you owned it but you used it as your main home on some days during the bright-line period, your net profit (loss) is reduced for the main home days. You will pay tax under the bright-line property rule only on the proportion of any gain in value that relates to the days in the bright-line period that it was not used as your main home – see the following notes for boxes 6 to 8 to work out your reduced net profit (loss). Reduced sale price (Box 6) If the sale is taxable because you used your main home for other purposes for any continuous period of more than 12 months during the time you owned it (a change of use), your property sale income must be reduced for the days it was used as your main home. Divide the days it was used as your main home (including days in periods of up to 12 months it was not used as your main home before or after a period that it was used as your main home) by the total days in the bright-line period and multiply the result by the sale price. Deduct this amount from the sale price and show the result at box 6. Reduced purchase price (Box 7) If the sale price at box 6 is reduced for days it was used as your main home, the purchase price must also be reduced. Divide the days it was used as your main home (including days in periods of up to 12 months it was not used as your main home before or after a period that it was used as your main home) by the total days in the bright-line period and multiply the result by the purchase price. Deduct this amount from the purchase price and show the result at box 7. Reduced deductible expenses (Box 8) If the sale and purchase prices at boxes 6 and 7 are reduced for the days it was used as your main home, the deductible expenses must also be reduced. Divide the days it was used as your main home (including days in periods of up to 12 months it wasn’t used as your main home before or after a period that it was used as your main home) by the total days in the bright-line period and multiply the result by the total deductible expenses. Deduct this amount from the total deductible expenses and show the result at box 8. For information about what you can and cannot claim, see the following note on deductible expenses. Deductible expenses (Box 8) Capital expenses incurred in acquiring the property and capital improvements will generally be deductible. You may not claim a deduction for private expenses relating to using the property as your residence. Holding costs are expenses such as interest, rates and insurance that are incurred as a result of owning land and are deductible to the extent that the land is used to earn taxable income. If you're not sure whether an expense is deductible, we recommend you seek advice from a tax agent. Do not include any deductions for other expenses here, for example if you have other deductible expenses from renting the property out. Deductible expenses from renting the property are included separately in your tax return. Bright-line loss If your total costs are more than the sale price of your property, you can only offset the loss against net income from another property sale. Any remaining loss can only be used in a future year when you have net income from another property sale. Provisional tax If your tax to pay on the taxable profit from your property sale is more than $5,000 tax at the end of the year from your last return ($2,500 before 2020 return), you may be required to pay provisional tax in the following tax year. If you're not likely to have the same amount of tax to pay, you could consider estimating your provisional tax for the following year. Because there are penalties for under- paying provisional tax, we recommend you get professional advice about doing this. For more information read our Provisional tax - IR289 guide.

If your property is subject to either the 5 year bright-line period for new builds or the 10 year bright-line period, and it was not your main home for the entire time you owned it but you used it as your main home on some days during the bright-line period, your net profit (loss) is reduced for the main home days. You will pay tax under the bright-line property rule only on the proportion of any gain in value that relates to the days in the bright-line period that it was not used as your main home – see the following notes for Boxes 6 to 8 to work out your reduced net profit (loss). Reduced sale price (Box 6) If the sale is taxable because the property was your main home for some of the time you owned it but it was also used for other purposes for a continuous period of more than 12 months, your property sale income is reduced based on how long the property was your main home. Divide the number of main home days by the number of days in the bright-line period. Then multiply the result of that by the sale price. Show the result in Box 6. Main home days is the total number of days when more than 50% of the property's area (including your backyard, gardens and garage) was used as your main home. This includes days in a period of up to 12 months that it was not used as your main home, if the period was immediately before or after a period that the property was used as your main home. For days when 50% or less of the property's area (including your backyard, gardens and garage) was used as your main home, multiple the number of those days by the proportion of the property’s area that was your main home e.g. 250 days x 30% = 75 main home days.

Days in the bright-line period is the total number of days in the bright-line period. The start and end dates of the bright-line period are the dates you put in Boxes 4 and 5. Purchase price is the price you purchased the property for. Reduced deductible expenses (Box 8) If the sale and purchase prices at Boxes 6 and 7 are reduced for the days it was used as your main home, the deductible expenses must also be reduced. Divide the number of main home days by the number of days in the bright-line period. Then multiply the result of that by total deductible expenses. Deduct this amount from the total deductible expenses and show the result at Box 8. For information about what you can and cannot claim, see the following note on deductible expenses. Deductible expenses (Box 8) Expenses incurred in acquiring the property (other than the purchase price) and the cost of any capital improvements you made can be included as deductible expenses in Box 8. Capital improvements are things like adding on a new room – they do not include repairs and maintenance. Do not include any deductions for other expenses here, for example if you have other deductible expenses (such as interest, rates and insurance) from renting the property out. Deductible expenses from renting the property out are included separately in your tax return. You may not claim a deduction for these types of expenses if you did not use the property to earn income (eg, rent). If you're not sure whether an expense is deductible, we recommend you refer to part 5 of the Bright-line property tax guide – IR1227 or seek advice from a tax agent. Bright-line loss If your total costs are more than the sale price of your property, you can only offset the loss against net income from another property sale. Any remaining loss can only be used in a future year when you have net income from another property sale.

If your property is subject to either the 5 year bright-line period for new builds or the 10 year bright-line period, and it was not your main home for the entire time you owned it but you used it as your main home on some days during the bright-line period, your net profit (loss) is reduced for the main home days. You will pay tax under the bright-line property rule only on the proportion of any gain in value that relates to the days in the bright-line period that it was not used as your main home – see the following notes for Boxes 6 to 8 to work out your reduced net profit (loss). Reduced sale price (Box 6) If the property was your main home for some of the time you owned it but it was also used for other purposes for a continuous period of more than 12 months, your property sale income is reduced based on how long the property was your main home. Divide the number of main home days by the number of days in the bright-line period. Then multiply the result of that by the sale price. Show the result in Box 6. Main home days is the total number of days when more than 50% of the property's area (including your backyard, gardens and garage) was used as your main home.

For days when 50% or less of the property's area (including your backyard, gardens and garage) was used as your main home, multiple the number of those days by the proportion of the property’s area that was your main home for example 250 days x 30% = 75 main home days. Days in the bright-line period is the total number of days in the bright-line period. The start and end dates of the bright-line period are the dates you put in Boxes 4 and 5. Sale price is the total price you sold the property for before deducting any expenses. 5 Reduced purchase price (Box 7) If the sale price at Box 6 is reduced for days it was used as your main home, the purchase price must also be reduced. Divide the number of main home days by the number of days in the bright-line period. Then multiply the result of that by the purchase price. Show the result in Box 7. Main home days is the total number of days when more than 50% of the property's area (including your backyard, gardens and garage) was used as your main home. This includes days in a period of up to 12 months that it was not used as your main home, if the period was immediately before or after a period that the property was used as your main home. For days when 50% or less of the property's area (including your backyard, gardens and garage) was used as your main home, multiple the number of those days by the proportion of the property’s area that was your main home for example 250 days x 30% = 75 main home days. Days in the bright-line period is the total number of days in the bright-line period. The start and end dates of the bright-line period are the dates you put in Boxes 4 and 5. Purchase price is the price you purchased the property for. Reduced deductible expenses (Box 8) If the sale and purchase prices at Boxes 6 and 7 are reduced for the days it was used as your main home, the deductible expenses must also be reduced. Divide the number of main home days by the number of days in the bright-line period. Then multiply the result of that by total deductible expenses. Deduct this amount from the total deductible expenses and show the result at Box 8. For information about what you can and cannot claim, see the following note on deductible expenses. Deductible expenses (Box 8) Expenses incurred in acquiring the property (other than the purchase price) and the cost of any capital improvements you made can be included as deductible expenses in Box 8. Capital improvements are things like adding on a new room – they do not include repairs and maintenance. Do not include any deductions for other expenses here, for example if you have other deductible expenses (such as interest, rates and insurance) from renting the property out. Deductible expenses from renting the property out are included separately in your income tax return. You may not claim a deduction for these types of expenses if you did not use the property to earn income (eg, rent). If you're not sure whether an expense is deductible, we recommend you refer to part 5 of the Bright-line property tax guide – IR1227 or seek advice from a tax agent. Bright-line loss If your total costs are more than the sale price of your property, you can only offset the loss against net income from another property sale. Any remaining loss can only be used in a future year when you have net income from another property sale. Provisional tax If your tax to pay on the taxable profit from your property sale is more than $5,000 at the end of the year, you may be required to pay provisional tax in the following year. If you're not likely to have the same amount of tax to pay, you could consider estimating your provisional tax for the following year. Because there are penalties for under- paying provisional tax, we recommend you get professional advice about doing this. For more information read our Provisional tax - IR289 guide.

Sell means any form of disposal of the property including transfers or gifts. Residential property includes land: • with a house on it • the owner has an arrangement to build a house on, or • t he owner can build a house on under the district plan rules. Bright-line period begins with the bright-line start date and ends with the bright-line end date. Bright-line test A sale of residential property may be taxable if your bright-line end date is within 2 years of your bright-line start date. If this applies, and none of the exclusions or rollover relief applies, then you will have to pay tax on any profit on the sale of the property. Bright-line start date (Box 4) The table below shows various types of purchase or acquisition and the date to use. This is your bright-line start date. Type of purchase/acquisitionDate to use Standard purchase of a propertyDate the transfer of the property is registered to you with Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) (usually the settlement date) Subdivided land - property you have subdividedThe original date of registration for the undivided property Off the plans - property acquired relying on the completion of a land development or subdivision Date you entered into a sale and purchase agreement Change of trustee - land transferred from a trustee of a trust to another trustee of the trust Bright-line start date for the original trustee Joint tenancy converted to a tenancy in common or tenancy in common converted to a joint tenancy To the extent the person's share in the land is unchanged, the bright-line start date for the land before the tenancy was converted Purchase where no registration happens before the sale dateDate you acquired an interest in the property Freehold estate converted from a lease with a perpetual right of renewal Date you were first granted the leasehold estate Land outside New ZealandDate the transfer of the property is registered to you under foreign laws Bright-line end date (Box 5) The table below shows various types of sale or disposal and the date to use. This is your bright-line end date. Type of sale/disposalDate to use Standard sale of a propertyDate you entered into a sale and purchase agreement Gifting of propertyDate the gift was made Compulsory acquisition by the Crown, a local authority, or a public authority Date of compulsory acquisition Mortgagee saleDate the property is disposed of by or for the mortgagee because the mortgagor defaulted (usually the settlement date) Disposals not covered aboveDate you disposed of the property 4 Main home exclusion For individuals and trusts (in limited circumstances), there are exclusions from the bright-line test: • Main home - the sale of your main home. This is the property you have the greatest connection to. You can only have 1 main home. • Main home held in a trust - a sale by a trustee where the property was the main home of a principal settlor of the trust (or principal settlor does not have a main home) and it was the main home of a beneficiary of the trust. You can claim the main home exclusion if you have used: • more than 50% of the property’s area as your main home (including the yard, gardens, and garage) • t he property for more than 50% of the bright-line period as your main home. When you build a new home, you can ignore the construction period when determining if your usage of the property qualifies for the main home exclusion. You cannot claim the main home exclusion if you have used it twice in the previous 2 years, or you or a group of persons have a regular pattern of buying and selling your main home. Rollover relief Inherited property A sale of a residential property transferred to an executor or administrator of a deceased estate, or to an individual beneficiary, is not subject to tax under the bright-line test. Ownership transfers Rollover relief applies to property transferred under a relationship property agreement or between associated persons. When rollover relief applies: • t he person transferring land to a new owner will not be taxed at the time of the transfer; and • t he new owner is treated as having bought the property at the same time and for the same price as the person they received it from. For more information on rollover relief, read our Bright-line property tax - IR1229 guide. Deductible expenses (Box 8) Expenses incurred in buying the property (other than the purchase price) and the cost of any capital improvements you made can be included as deductible expenses in Box 8. Capital improvements are things like adding on a new room – they do not include repairs and maintenance. Do not include any deductions for other expenses here, for example if you have other deductible expenses (such as interest, rates and insurance) from renting the property out. Deductible expenses from renting the property out are included separately in your income tax return. You may not claim a deduction for these types of expenses if you did not use the property to earn income (eg, rent). You cannot claim private expenses relating to using the property as your residence. If you’re not sure whether an expense is deductible, we recommend you read our Bright-line property tax - IR1229 guide or seek advice from a tax agent. Bright-line loss If your total costs are more than the sale price of your property, you can only offset the loss against net income from another property sale. Any remaining loss can only be used in a future year when you have net income from another property sale. Provisional tax If your tax to pay on the taxable profit from your property sale is more than $5,000 at the end of the year, you may be required to pay provisional tax in the following year. If you're not likely to have the same amount of tax to pay, you could consider estimating your provisional tax for the following year.

Sell means any form of disposal of the property including transfers or gifts. Residential property includes land: • with a house on it • the owner has an arrangement to build a house on, or • t he owner can build a house on under the district plan rules. Bright-line period begins with the bright-line start date and ends with the bright-line end date. Bright-line test A sale of residential property may be taxable if you acquired it: • on or after 27 March 2021 and sold it before 1 July 2024, or • between 29 March 2018 and 26 March 2021 and sold it within 5 years or before 1 July 2024 (whichever is earliest). If 1 of these applies and none of the exclusions or rollover relief applies, then you will have to pay tax on any profit on the sale of the property. When a property is acquired For tax purposes, a property is generally acquired on the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is entered into (even if some standard conditions like getting finance or a building report still need to be met). Full information on when a property is acquired is found in QB 17/02 on taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz Property acquired on or after 27 March 2021 is treated as having been acquired before 27 March 2021, if the purchase was the result of an offer the purchaser made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer could not be withdrawn before 27 March 2021. Bright-line start date (Box 4) The table below shows various types of purchase or acquisition and the date to use. This is your bright-line start date.

This is the property you have the greatest connection to. You can only have 1 main home. • Main home held in a trust - a sale by a trustee where the property was the main home of a principal settlor of the trust (or principal settlor does not have a main home) and it was the main home of a beneficiary of the trust. You can use the main home exclusion if the situations in the table below apply unless you have used it twice in the previous 2 years, or you or a group of persons have a regular pattern of buying and selling your main home. The date you acquired the property determines which main home exclusion criteria to apply. Main home exclusionThe situations that must apply Property acquired on or after 27 March 2021You have used: • m ore than 50% of the property's area as your main home (including the yard, gardens and garage), and • t he property for 100% of the bright-line period as your main home. This may include any continuous period of up to 12 months where the property was not used as your main home (for example, a period between moving out and when the property is finally sold). Note: When you build a new home, you may qualify for the main home exclusion even if the construction takes longer than 12 months as long as the period of time is reasonable. Property acquired before 27 March 2021You have used: • more than 50% of the property's area as your main home (including the yard, gardens and garage), and • the property for more than 50% of the bright-line period as your main home. Note: When you build a new home, you can ignore the construction period when determining if your usage of the property qualifies for the main home exclusion. Rollover relief Inherited property A sale of a residential property transferred to an executor or administrator of a deceased estate, or to an individual beneficiary, is not subject to tax under the bright-line test. Ownership transfers and rollover relief Rollover relief applies to property transferred under a relationship property agreement. When rollover relief applies: • t he person transferring land to a new owner will not be taxed at the time of the transfer; and • t he new owner is treated as having bought the property at the same time and for the same price as the person they received it from.

If you acquired the property on or after 27 March 2021 and it was not your main home for the entire bright-line period but you used it as your main home on some days during the bright-line period, your net profit (loss) is reduced by the main home days. You will pay tax under the bright-line test only on the proportion of any gain in value that relates to the days in the bright-line period that it was not used as your main home – see the following notes for Boxes 6 to 8 to work out your reduced net profit (loss). Reduced sale price (Box 6) If the property was your main home for some of the time you owned it but it was also used for other purposes for a continuous period of more than 12 months, your property sale income is reduced based on how long the property was your main home. Divide the number of main home days by the number of days in the bright-line period. Then multiply the result of that by the sale price. Show the result in Box 6. Main home days is the total number of days when more than 50% of the property's area (including your backyard, gardens and garage) was used as your main home. This includes days in a period of up to 12 months that it was not used as your main home, if the period was immediately before or after a period that the property was used as your main home. For days when 50% or less of the property's area (including your backyard, gardens and garage) was used as your main home, multiple the number of those days by the proportion of the property’s area that was your main home for example 250 days x 30% = 75 main home days. Days in the bright-line period is the total number of days in the bright-line period. The start and end dates of the bright-line period are the dates you put in Boxes 4 and 5. Sale price is the total price you sold the property for before deducting any expenses. Reduced purchase price (Box 7) If the sale price at Box 6 is reduced for days it was used as your main home, the purchase price must also be reduced. Divide the number of main home days by the number of days in the bright-line period. Then multiply the result of that by the purchase price. Show the result in Box 7. Main home days is the total number of days when more than 50% of the property's area (including your backyard, gardens and garage) was used as your main home. This includes days in a period of up to 12 months that it was not used as your main home, if the period was immediately before or after a period that the property was used as your main home. For days when 50% or less of the property's area (including your backyard, gardens and garage) was used as your main home, multiple the number of those days by the proportion of the property’s area that was your main home for example 250 days x 30% = 75 main home days. Days in the bright-line period is the total number of days in the bright-line period. The start and end dates of the bright-line period are the dates you put in Boxes 4 and 5. Purchase price is the price you bought the property for. Deductible expenses (Box 8) Expenses incurred in buying the property (other than the purchase price) and the cost of any capital improvements you made can be included as deductible expenses in Box 8. Capital improvements are things like adding on a new room – they do not include repairs and maintenance. Do not include any deductions for other expenses here, for example if you have other deductible expenses (such as interest, rates and insurance) from renting the property out. Deductible expenses from renting the property out are included separately in your income tax return. You may not claim a deduction for these types of expenses if you did not use the property to earn income (eg, rent). You cannot claim private expenses relating to using the property as your residence. If you’re not sure whether an expense is deductible, we recommend you read our Bright-line property tax - IR1227 guide or seek advice from a tax agent. Reduced deductible expenses (Box 8) If the sale and purchase prices at Boxes 6 and 7 are reduced for the days it was used as your main home, the deductible expenses must also be reduced. Divide the number of main home days by the number of days in the bright-line period. Then multiply the result of that by total deductible expenses. Deduct this amount from the total deductible expenses and show the result at Box 8. For information about what you can and cannot claim, see the previous note on deductible expenses. Bright-line loss If your total costs are more than the sale price of your property, you can only offset the loss against net income from another property sale. Any remaining loss can only be used in a future year when you have net income from another property sale. 8 Provisional tax If your tax to pay on the taxable profit from your property sale is more than $5,000 at the end of the year, you may be required to pay provisional tax in the following year.

Business Ngā Ūmanga ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. A portfolio investment entity (PIE) - such as a managed fund - invests the contributions from investors in different types of investments. Entities that meet the eligibility requirements can elect to become a PIE if they are a: • managed fund, such as a unit trust, or superannuation fund • company • benefit fund • life fund • group investment fund. How PIEs calculate tax Most PIEs will calculate their tax based on the prescribed investor rate (PIR) provided by their investors rather than at the entity’s tax rate. This type of PIE is called a multi- rate PIE (MRP). There are also 2 types of MRP for non-resident investors: • a foreign investment zero-rate PIE (zero-rate PIE) • a foreign investment variable-rate PIE (variable-rate PIE) These MRPs allow qualifying non-resident investors (notified foreign investors) to have tax rates applied to their attributed PIE income similar to the tax rates that would apply if they invested directly in the assets of the PIE. For details of who is a notified foreign investor refer to our factsheet Information for non-residents who invest in PIEs - IR858. PIEs that are not MRPs include: • listed PIEs • benefit fund PIEs • certain life fund PIEs. These PIEs do not calculate their tax using their investors’ PIR. Instead, their tax is calculated using the entity’s basic tax rate. What is a prescribed investor rate (PIR)? A PIR is the tax rate that applies to attributed PIE income of the investor in a MRP. The PIR for resident individuals is based on 2 tests relating to your income in the last 2 income years. • First is your taxable income such as income from salary, wages and any additional sources of income you would include in your income tax return. (Taxable income cannot be a negative amount). • Second is your taxable income plus your attributed PIE income after subtracting any attributable PIE loss. (Net PIE losses do not reduce taxable income). The prescribed investor rates for NZ tax resident individuals are 10.5%, 17.5% and 28%. How to find the PIR that applies to me? Your PIR is determined based on the lower rate from either of the last 2 years’ income. For example, to determine your PIR income for the 2024 income year you use the income details for 2022 and 2023. Note: Most individuals have a 31 March income year. If your income year ends later than March, the income you consider may be for the 2 years before the preceding year. If in either of the previous 2 income years: your taxable income was ... and your taxable income plus your PIE income was ... before the relevant tax year for ... then your PIR is ... $0 – $14,000 $0 – $48,000Either year 10.5% $48,001 – $70,000Either year17.5% $14,001 – $48,000 $0 – $70,000Either year17.5% $48,001 or more Any amountEach year28% Any amount$70,001 or moreEach year28% You must notify your PIE your IRD number and the PIR that applies to you. Information for resident individuals who invest in PIEs IR855 | September 2024 This factsheet helps you understand your tax obligations as a resident individual when investing in a portfolio investment entity (PIE) 2 ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. What happens if you do not provide the MRP with your PIR? If you do not provide the MRP with your PIR, the MRP will deduct PIE tax at the rate of 28% which may be higher than your actual PIR. You must also provide your IRD number. Updating your PIR You can notify the MRP your correct PIR at any time during the year. The MRP may be able to back-date the change. When we identify you are on the wrong rate, we may advise the MRP of the rate that is appropriate for you. Where you have not notified the correct PIR that applies to your income attributed by the MRP, or that rate is not applied to all your PIE income for the full tax year, further tax to pay or a refund may arise in the PIE calculation as part of your annual income tax assessment. What happens if you do not provide the MRP with your IRD number? You have 6 weeks from becoming an investor in a MRP to provide your IRD number. If you do not provide it the MRP must close your investment account and treat you as having exited on the last day of the 6-week period. Arriving or leaving New Zealand and your PIR If you’re a New Zealand tax resident individual who has invested in a MRP and you then cease to be a resident and you are not a notified foreign investor, you should have a PIR of 28% from the date you leave New Zealand. You should tell the MRP of the change as soon as possible. Refer to our factsheet Information for non-residents who invest in PIEs - IR858. Transitional residents (essentially new residents in New Zealand) have a 4-year tax exemption on their foreign- sourced investment income. However, you must include your worldwide income when determining your PIR in the first 2 years you’re a New Zealand tax resident. However, transitional residents may choose not to include their foreign-sourced income when working out their PIR for either or both of the first 2 income years as a resident; but only if they reasonably expect their taxable income in that period will be significantly lower than their total income from all sources for the income year before the first resident year. If you’re a transitional resident who invests in a zero- rate PIE you can notify the 0% PIR for each year you’re a transitional resident. Transitional residents should send us a message in myIR or a letter attached to their income tax returns filed during the transitional period confirming how their PIR has been calculated. Becoming and ceasing to be a notified foreign investor For resident investors who become non-resident and notify the foreign investment PIE that they are notified foreign investors, the PIE should treat the investor as a notified foreign investor from the day it’s notified of the change of status if possible, but no later than the start of the next tax year. For a notified foreign investor who becomes a New Zealand tax resident investor, the foreign investment PIE has the choice of changing the investor’s status immediately or waiting until the beginning of the next tax year to do so. If the PIE waits, the investor can continue to be treated as a notified foreign investor for the tax year and any income attributed to the investor during this transitional period will not be subject to further tax at the investor level. Among other things, this is to handle situations when residency applies retrospectively, due to the application of the 183- day residency rule. The foreign investment PIE can rely on the notification from the investor of their entitlement to access a particular PIR(s). The PIE can continue to treat the investor’s status as unchanged up to the end of the tax year even though the investor’s residency status may have changed part-way through the tax year. When a zero-rate may be applied for an individual You may be taxed at a zero-rate by a MRP that files returns using the quarterly option, if you exit the MRP during a quarter. A transitional resident who invests in a zero-rate PIE can have a 0% PIR for the period of transitional residence. There are no other situations where you may have a zero- rate applied. Ceasing to be represented by a proxy If you’re represented by a proxy for PIE investors (custodian) and then you cease to be represented by that proxy, its obligations will pass directly to the MRP that holds your investment. You should notify the MRP of your correct PIR and IRD number. Record-keeping requirements If your only New Zealand-sourced income, including your attributed PIE income, is taxed at source and you have provided your IRD number to all payers there are no record keeping requirements. If you’re also required to provide details of your attributed PIE income for the purpose of a New Zealand student loan repayment obligation, then you must keep your records relating to that income for 12 months after the end of the income year in which the income was derived. If you carry on a business or other activity with intention of earning income, records need to be kept for 7 years after the income year they relate to. 3 ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. Income attributed by the MRP PIE income or loss attributed by a MRP to resident individuals is included in the end-of-year PIE calculation in the income tax assessment to check that the PIR notified is correct for the year. If your correct PIR has not been applied to all your PIE income for the full year the under or overpayment is then included in your income tax assessment adjusting your tax liability or refund. It could also affect your liability to provisional tax. Working for Families and student loans PIE income from a retirement savings scheme or superannuation fund where the funds are locked in, such as a KiwiSaver scheme, will not affect Working for Families and student loans. All other MRP income needs to be included as family scheme income or adjusted net income. You can complete the ‘Adjust your income’ service in myIR or the Adjust your income - IR215 form. If you receive a distribution or dividend from a listed PIE that does not use your PIR, the dividend must be included in family scheme income and your adjusted net income. If you have not included the dividend in your income tax return, you’ll need to show it using the ‘Adjust your income’ service in myIR or the IR215 form. These dividends are not liable for resident withholding tax (RWT). Income tested benefits or main benefit All investments are cash assets for benefit purposes. Any income received from an investment is treated as income for benefit purposes. Capital gains from managed funds are not income. Income earned through a PIE, may affect entitlements to Working for Families and assistance provided by Work and Income such as an Accommodation Supplement and Childcare Assistance. Attributed PIE income from locked-in funds such as KiwiSaver and other superannuation schemes are not treated as chargeable income or cash assets for benefit purposes. Distributions from listed PIEs are treated as income for benefit purposes. If you have any questions about the impact of investments on your benefit, please call Work and Income general enquiries on 0800 559 009. When is your MRP income received? You’ll need to know in which income year your attributed MRP income is received so you can determine: • your correct PIR • the income tax return in which any income attributed by the MRP should be included. PIE income is treated as being received in your income year that includes the end of the MRPs income year. If you and the MRP have standard 31 March balance dates, the year in which the MRP attributes the income and you receive it will be the same. If you have a balance date other than 31 March, the year the income is received may be different from the year in which the MRP attributes the income. If you have a ...and ...then ... 30 June 2024 balance date (your 2024 income year) the MRP has a 31 March 2024 balance date because the end of the MRP’s 2024 income year falls within your 2024 income year, the income is also your 2024 attributed income. 31 December 2023 balance date (your 2024 income year) the MRP has a 31 March 2024 balance date because the end of the MRP’s 2024 income year falls after the end of your 2024 income year, the income falls into your 2025 income year. Dividends or distributions You do not need to include dividends or distributions from a MRP in your income tax return as they are excluded income. Dividends or distributions received from a listed PIE that does not use your PIR will not need to be included in your income tax return, unless you choose to include the dividend to claim imputation credits. If you choose to include the dividend in your tax return it is included in the dividend question and not the PIE calculation. These dividends are not liable for RWT. Investor statements MRPs are required to issue investor statements providing investors with information about: • their interest in the MRP • the income received from their investment in the income year • the tax calculated by the MRP on their investment. Most MRPs need to provide you with information regarding your investment by 31 May following the end of the tax year. A few types of MRP may send that information to you by or after 30 June. If you withdraw your investment from a MRP that files returns using the quarterly option and zero-rates exiting investors, the MRP has to provide the information within 1 month of the end of the quarter in which you exited. If you do not receive any details from your MRP or you think the investor statement is wrong, you need to contact the MRP. Listed PIEs may send a dividend statement to their investors. Where there is a rate change during a year you may receive more than 1 investor statement; 1 for each rate applied during the year. Residual interests Any residual investor interest at the end of the quarter in which an investor exits a MRP that files PIE returns using the quarterly option will be paid to Inland Revenue by the MRP within 1 month of the end of the quarter in which the exit occurs. This will be included as a credit in the PIE calculation in your income tax assessment. 4 ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication.

Attributed PIE income or loss from a MRP is not included in your taxable income in your tax return. There is a separate end-of-year PIE calculation for resident individuals. myIR has a PIE income section we will pre-populate with the details provided to us by the MRP. We will automatically include PIE income or loss in the PIE calculation as part of processing your income tax return. The paper Individual tax return - IR3 includes a PIE calculation with 3 boxes in the return and a worksheet in the guide to help complete them. We will automatically include the PIE calculation as part of processing your income tax return. If the PIE calculation results in a debit this will be added to the tax on taxable income. This ensures any foreign tax credits or imputation credits you may have can be used to cover this tax liability. If the PIE calculation outcome is a credit it is added to a refund due or subtracted from tax to pay. If you choose to include a distribution from a listed PIE in your tax return, add the dividend and imputation credits into the dividend and ICA credit fields in the IR3. Excess New Zealand tax credits and losses Most MRPs that have excess New Zealand tax credits or losses in a tax calculation period receive a tax credit calculated at the individual investor’s PIR. The MRP then credits the investor by adjusting their interest in the MRP, or making a distribution. If the notified PIR is too high or low you may have further tax to pay or a credit amount in your PIE calculation in your income tax assessment. Losses attributed to New Zealand tax resident individual investors in a MRP cannot be claimed as a deduction in their income tax return. The loss is included in the PIE calculation included in the income tax assessment. The following table shows the result for an individual who notifies a PIR that is too high or too low and is attributed a loss: The loss attributed by the MRP is: And you notified a PIR of: And your correct PIR is: Then your PIE calculation will result in.... ($1,000)28%17.5% a $105 PIE debit added to your tax on taxable income. This is because you received more credit for the loss from the MRP than you were entitled to receive. ($1,000)10.5%17.5% a $70 PIE credit added to your residual income tax. This is because you received less credit for the loss from the MRP than you were entitled to receive. Withdrawing your investment If you withdraw your investment from a MRP that files PIE returns using the quarterly option part-way through a quarter, the MRP may calculate tax at the zero-rate on your share of the attributed income. In all other cases the MRP will calculate tax on exit at your notified PIR. Your actual PIR will be applied to the PIE income when we process your income tax assessment. A partial withdrawal may not be significant enough to be treated as an exit, or switching from 1 investor class to another within the same entity may not reduce your interest in the MRP. In these situations, the MRP may make voluntary payments of tax. If the tax calculation has been made at your correct PIR and is sufficient to meet the tax liability, there should not be a PIE tax outcome for underpaid PIE tax in your tax return. PIE investments in overseas markets If the PIE invests in overseas markets, you do not have to complete disclosures or make calculations for the purposes of the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules. Any calculations under the FIF rules will be made by the PIE. Investor expenses Generally, investor expenses charged by the MRP in relation to your interest will be taken into account when the MRP calculates the income to attribute to you. You will not be able to claim the expenses in your tax return. Investments at the time of death Investments held at the time of death will pass to the Estate. The transfer to the Estate is considered to be an exit and the MRP may zero-rate the income in the period to the date of death. In this case the MRP income will have to be included in the PIE calculation in the individual’s tax return to the date of death. If the investments are not distributed to the beneficiaries but continue to be held in the Estate, the resident executor should advise the MRP of the PIR chosen by a New Zealand resident trustee (either 0%, 10.5%, 17.5% or 28%). For more information on options for trustees refer to our factsheet: Information for trustees who invest in PIEs - IR856. PIE income received as a beneficiary of a trust Attributed PIE income treated as a New Zealand tax resident individual’s beneficiary income of a trust that is not a PIE is treated as trust income. It is excluded from the beneficiary’s PIE calculation as part of their income tax assessment. 5 ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication.

Joint investments and partnerships Where an investment is held by a partnership or is in joint names, each partner/holder of the investment has tax obligations in relation to their share of the income. The separate individuals should advise the MRP of their IRD number and PIR that applies. If the partners do not provide their PIR and/or IRD number, the MRP will deduct PIE tax at the default rate of 28% which may be higher than the actual rate. If the PIE holds the joint holder’s details including their IRD number and reports the details to us, we will split the investment income and tax details equally according to the number of joint holders. If the share is not equal, you will need to manually change it in myIR or contact us to correct this. Note: The MRP will apply the highest notified rate to the investment. Where joint investors have notified a rate that is lower than the rate applied by the PIE there may be a refund of PIE tax in the end of year PIE calculation. Each New Zealand tax resident holder of a joint investment in a listed PIE can choose to declare their share of the dividend in their tax return. Transferring your investments Income from investments held in your name cannot be transferred to another person, for example, a spouse on a lower income. However, investments can be sold. There are rules about valuation of property sold to associated persons. Please refer to Tax and your property transactions - IR361 booklet available on our website.
