Retirement scheme contribution tax
==================================

2007 legislative amendment enacts a new tax structure for taxing certain contributions to a retirement savings scheme.

**_Sections BE 1, CX 42B, KD 1(1), LB 3, LD 4, LD 12, NEB 1 to 7, NF 1(2), NG 16B and OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004; sections BE 1(5B), CX 50B, LB 6, LE 7B, LO 2B, MB 1(5B), MB 6, RA 1, RA 6B, RA 10, RA 15, RA 24, RD 1, RE 2, RF 16, RH 1 to 6, YA 1, and Schedule 1, Part D, clause 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007, and sections 28C, 29 (1), 31(1), 47B and 48B of the Tax Administration Act 1994_**

The Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007 amends the Income Tax Act 2004, the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 to enact a new tax structure for taxing certain contributions to a retirement savings scheme. The new rules allow retirement scheme contributions that would be taxable in the hands of the person who benefits from the contribution to be subject to a final withholding tax instead. The effect of these rules is that this income is treated as excluded income and therefore not taken into account for student loan, child support and Working for Families tax credit purposes. The withholding tax imposed on the contribution is based, generally, on the contributor's tax rate in either of two previous income years before the contribution is made.

#### Background

Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu (TRoNT) asked the government to consider new rules for taxing contributions to a retirement saving scheme. TRoNT was setting up a retirement savings scheme for its members, and was planning to make contributions to the scheme on behalf of its members. Members' funds, including contributions made by TRoNT, would be locked-in until retirement. However, early withdrawals would be permitted in certain circumstances, such as to assist with the purchase of a first home.

Under current law, any contribution that TRoNT made to the scheme on behalf of members would be taxable in the hands of the member and subject to income tax, with that income being taken into account for social assistance purposes. TRoNT proposed that these contributions should be subject to a final withholding tax rather than income tax so members would not have to include this income in their tax returns, given this income was locked into a retirement saving scheme. TRoNT also proposed that the contributions should not be taken into account for social assistance purposes, because contributions would be locked in and unavailable for day-to-day living expenses. This treatment is consistent with the treatment of employer superannuation contributions, fringe benefits and portfolio investment entity (PIE) income.

Although the impetus for developing these rules came from TRoNT, the rules apply to companies (but not close companies), widely held unit trusts and Maori authorities.

#### Key features

**Income tax amendments**

New subpart RH of the 2007 Act and subpart NEB of the 2004 Act enact the Retirement Scheme Contribution Tax rules (RSCT rules). The RSCT rules are an elective regime that allows a retirement scheme contribution such as a taxable Maori authority distribution or a dividend made by a retirement scheme contributor to a retirement savings scheme to be subject to retirement scheme contribution tax. Section BE 1 of both Acts has been amended to treat RSCT as a withholding liability. If the retirement scheme contributor does not apply the RSCT rules, the contribution will be subject to existing tax rules and taxable in the hands of the member or shareholder of the retirement scheme contributor.

A retirement scheme contribution is defined in section RH 2 of the 2007 Act (section OB 1 of the 2004 Act) as a contribution in money made by a retirement scheme contributor to a retirement savings scheme for the benefit of a person who is a member of, or has an ownership interest in, the contributor. For example, a taxable Maori authority distribution made by a Maori authority to a retirement savings scheme on behalf of its members would be subject to the RSCT rules if the contributor applied the RSCT rules. The amount of the contribution includes any imputation credit or Maori authority credit attached to the distribution.

For an entity to be a retirement scheme contributor for a person in an income year, section RH 4 of the 2007 Act (section NEB 6 of the 2004 Act) provides that the entity must be:

*   a widely held unit trust;
*   a company other than a close company; or
*   a Maori authority.

The person must be a unit holder, shareholder or member of the entity during or before the year that the entity makes a retirement scheme contribution. (For the purposes of this _TIB_ item, the term "member" is used when referring to this person.) This is the person who benefits from the contribution.

New section RH 3 of the 2007 Act (section NEB 5 of the 2004 Act) specifies that for an entity to be a retirement savings scheme for the purposes of the RSCT rules, the entity must be:

*   a portfolio investment entity;
*   hold the funds from a retirement scheme contribution for the member; and
*   the distribution rules governing the distributions of funds by the scheme are approved by the Commissioner as fair and reasonable and meet the rules relating to distributions which are set out in section RH 3 of the 2007 Act (section NEB 5 of the 2004 Act). In general, the funds cannot be distributed before the person reaches the age of retirement as set out in the rules. However, early withdrawals are permitted in certain circumstances, such as to assist with the purchase of the first home, assist with tertiary study or repay a student loan, and withdrawals allowed for by the KiwiSaver rules (for example, significant financial hardship).

The retirement scheme contributor is required to withhold the tax from the contribution at the time the payment is made at the RSCT rate for the member (the retirement scheme prescribed rate). RSCT is payable by the 20th of the month following the month in which the contribution was made and deducted. The retirement savings scheme, if appointed by the retirement scheme contributor, can act as the contributor's agent in relation to the calculation and payment of the tax.

The RSCT rate is set out in Schedule 1, Part D, clause 7 of the 2007 Tax Act and in the definition of "retirement scheme prescribed rate" in the 2007 and 2004 Acts. Table1 sets out the amount of tax payable.

**Table 1**

| _**Criteria for determining rate**_ | _**Retirement scheme prescribed rate**_ |
| --- | --- |
| If none of the following situations apply. | 39% |
| If none of the following situations apply and the member has, in either of the two income years preceding the year in which the contribution is made, taxable income of $60,000 or less and has provided his or her tax file number. | 33% |
| If the situation below does not apply, and<br><br>1.  the member has, in either of the two income years preceding the year in which the contribution is made, taxable \\income of $38,000 or less and provided his or her tax file number;<br>2.  the member is a non-resident and the retirement scheme contributor is a Maori authority and the amount of the distribution is $200 or less;<br>3.  the member is a non-resident and the retirement scheme contributor is a Maori authority and has provided a tax file number. | 19.5% |
| If the member is a non-resident at the time of the contribution and the contribution is a non-resident's withholding income. | 0% (in this case the contribution is subject to non-resident withholding tax) |

Sections LE 7B and LO 2B of the 2007 Act (sections LB 3 and LD 4 of the 2004 Act) allow imputation credits and Maori authority credits to be used to meet the RSCT liability of the retirement scheme contributor. If the amount of the credit exceeds the RSCT liability, the amount of that excess credit can be claimed by the member as if it were a credit attached to a distribution made to the member. The retirement scheme contributor must give notice, within 30 days of the contribution, of the amount of the excess.

Section CX 42B of the 2004 Act and section CX 50 of the 2007 Act treats retirement scheme contributions that are subject to the RSCT rules as excluded income. This provision applies to the member (that is the person for whose benefit the contribution is made) and the retirement savings scheme. However, a retirement scheme contribution is not treated as excluded income in the following situations:

*   if the member provides the retirement scheme contributor or the retirement savings scheme with a tax rate that is less than the member's rate;
*   the member includes the retirement scheme contribution in a return of income for the year in which the contribution is made; or
*   the member is a non-resident and the contribution is non-resident passive income (non-resident withholding income).

If the retirement scheme contribution is not treated as excluded income, section LB 6 of the 2007 Act (section LD 12 of the 2004 Act) allows a credit for the amount of the RSCT withheld. In the case of the non-resident, the amount of the credit is the excess amount of the RSCT withheld over the non-resident withholding tax paid in relation to the contribution.

Section RE 2 of the 2007 Act (section NF 1 of the 2004 Act) which deals with resident passive income (resident withholding income) has been amended to provide that:

*   a taxable Maori authority distribution that is subject to the RSCT is not treated as resident passive income; and
*   a dividend that is treated as excluded income by virtue of being subject to RSCT is not resident passive income.

New section RF 16 of the 2007 Act (section NG 16B of the 2004 Act) provides that when RSCT is paid in respect of a member who is non-resident and the contribution is subject to the non-resident withholding tax rules, the contributor is treated as having withheld an amount of non-resident withholding tax equal to the lesser of the amount of the RSCT paid or the non-resident withholding tax payable. If excess RSCT is paid, section LB 6 of the 2007 Act (section LD 12 of the 2004 Act) allows a credit for the excess.

Consequential amendments have been made to subpart RA of the 2007 Act to incorporate the RSCT rules into the general withholding and payment obligations.

The Working for Families tax credits rules in section MB 1 of the 2007 Act (section KD 1 of the 2004 Act) have been amended to ensure that retirement scheme contributions that are not treated as excluded income are not included in the assessable income for the purposes of the tax credit rules. In addition, a new section MB 6 of the 2007 Act (section KD 1(1)(hh) of the 2004 Act) allows, in limited circumstances, a distribution of a retirement scheme contribution from a retirement savings scheme to be included in a person's assessable income for calculating the person's entitlement to these tax credits.

Sections RA 2 and RA 24 of the 2007 Act (section NEB7 of the 2004 Act) and the definition of the RSCT rules provide that:

*   the provisions of the 2007 Act, 2004 Act and the Tax Administration Act 1994 apply to a person who is liable for RSCT as if RSCT were income tax imposed under section BB 1;
*   sections 170(2), 171 and 172 of the Tax Administration Act (recovery of unpaid resident withholding tax) apply; and
*   Part 9 of the Tax Administration Act (penalties) applies.

**Tax administration amendments**

The RSCT rules have amended a number of provisions in the Tax Administration 1994. In particular:

*   section 22 (keeping of records) has been amended to require a retirement scheme contributor to keep records of every contribution and the value of those contributions, including the details of the recipient of the contribution;
*   section 29 (shareholder dividend statement to be provided by company) has been amended to require RSCT information to be shown on the dividend statement as appropriate; and
*   section 33 (Maori authority to give notice of amounts distributed) has been amended to require RSCT information to be shown on notices as appropriate.

New section 28C requires that a person who gives notice that their tax rate is less than 39% for the purposes of calculating the RSCT on contributions, must provide their tax file number in the notice.

New section 47B requires a retirement scheme contributor or a retirement savings scheme to provide a statement to the Commissioner showing the amount of the RSCT and any other information required. The statement must be provided no later than the 20th of the month after the month in which the RSCT was withheld. A statement is only required if the RSCT to be withheld is not satisfied by imputation credits or Maori authority credits attached to the retirement scheme contribution.

Section 48B requires a reconciliation statement to be filed each year if a retirement scheme contributor makes a contribution. The reconciliation statement must be received by Inland Revenue by the end of the second month after the end of the income year.

#### Application date

The amendments to give effect to the RSCT rules in the 2004 Act and the Tax Administration Act 1994 come into force on 1 April 2007. The amendments in the 2007 Act come into force on 1 April 2008, except for section 554(3) (which inserts the basic rates of RSCT into Schedule 1, Part D), which comes into force on 1 July 2008. The delay in this section coming into force is a drafting error as it was never intended this provision be delayed. Inland Revenue considers that section ZA 3(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies to allow the provisions in the 2007 Act to be interpreted as a reference to the Income Tax Act 2004 to the extent necessary to reflect sensibly the intent of the legislation. It is not the intent of the legislation that no withholding rates apply during the period 1 April 2008 to 30 June 2008. This is on the basis that the references in sections RH 5 and RH 6 to Schedule 1, Part D, clause 7 of the 2007 Act are references to the corresponding provision in the 2004 Act, which is the definition of "retirement scheme withholding rate". This ensures that the withholding rates apply to any contributions made during the period 1 April 2008 to 30 June 2008.

Return of money paid
====================

30 August 2019

A few tax intermediaries have been surprised to see money in client’s accounts returned unexpectedly.

This is part of our plan to simplify the tax system for all customers. If we cannot see any debt in an account, or do not know which tax account the balance should be going to, we will return the overpayment in near real-time.

It’s their money after all - we don’t want to hold onto it if we haven’t been told what to do with it.

We’re aware this is a change that some customers and intermediaries will need to adjust to. Here are a few ways you can make this new process work for you.

Making a payment
----------------

When making a payment - including by direct credit or internet banking - make sure you and your clients include the correct details. These details include the IRD number for the customer, as well as the payee code.

The payee code is the account that you’re paying (for example, INC) followed by the period (DDMMYYYY). If you’re paying for more than one account or more than one period, you need to include this in the details.

We do see some customers submit incorrect details with their payment - for example, they might include INC instead of FAM. This will direct the payment to the wrong account, so we will return it to the nominated bank account within 24 hours. To prevent complications, we recommend double-checking the details of a payment before you make it.

If you make a payment in advance of filing a return in a period, that credit will be held until the return is processed. For example, if you’re making voluntary payments for a period where you have not yet filed a return, we will hold the credit in that account. The credit will be returned once the period has been assessed and there is no debt to offset.

Filing a return
---------------

When filing a return - either in myIR or through software - there will always be an option to request a transfer of any credit.

As with making a payment, all you need to do is tell us where you want the credit to go, and we will transfer it. If you don’t, we’ll return the credit to the bank account we have on file.

Existing credits
----------------

If you or your clients have old credits in your accounts, we'll start refunding them.

We'll start returning credits from 2016 and earlier from August 2019. If you or your clients would rather keep these credits in our system, you can move them to an unassessed period or transfer them to another account.

The majority of credits dated back to 2017 have already been processed for the 2018-2019 tax year for the tax account they were held under. If there was credit remaining after the tax account was processed - and it was not assigned to another tax account - this credit would be returned to the nominated bank account.

How we return money
-------------------

Amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (section 184A TAA 1994), that came into effect from 1 April 2019, state 'a refund of tax paid in excess must be made by direct credit to a bank account nominated by the taxpayer entitled to the refund'.

For the next release, we’re looking into new payment direction options to prevent payments made to Inland Revenue not getting to the right place.

[Go to Section 184A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 on the New Zealand Legislation website](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1994/0166/356.0/DLM358789.html)

Our changes
-----------

We’re looking into some options to help simplify the process of making payments, such as asking banks to reorder the display options in their pay tax drop-down menus to list INC before GAP.

We’ve also made some changes for provisional tax, which will assist with payments for 7 May 2020. The 2021 financial year will now be open from 1 April 2020, to prevent payments being automatically returned if you select the 2021 financial year rather than 2020.

If you make a payment for the 2019 financial year on or after the due date, we will transfer available credits to the provisional tax liability going forward. If you have overdue amounts in other accounts, these credits will be transferred to those liabilities first.

Revaluing former grey list shares that were inherited at a nil cost
===================================================================

2012 act re-values some foreign shares that were inherited at a nil cost before 1 Apr 2007 and explains the tax consequences resulting from the revaluation.

_Section EX 67B_

The Act re-values some foreign shares that were inherited at a nil cost before 1 April 2007. This revaluation can have two tax consequences. First, the shares could enter into the FIF attribution rules. Secondly, in cases when the shares are held on revenue account and the shares have a market value that is higher than the market value on the date of inheritance, the holder will be taxed on the difference between these two values.

In cases when the shares are held on revenue account and the shares have a market value that is higher than the market value on the date of inheritance, they will be taxed on the difference between these two values.

#### Application date

The revaluation of these shares occurred on 7 May 2012.

#### Key features

New section EX 67B applies to shares in FIFs that were inherited at zero cost. It applies only if the FIF was a grey list company at the time the shares were inherited and if the shares were inherited before 1 April 2007 (when the grey list exemption was abolished for portfolio shares). These shares are subject to a deemed sale and reacquisition at market value on the 7 May 2012.

The deemed sale and reacquisition can have two tax consequences. First, the shares could enter into the FIF attribution rules. The FIF rules will not apply if the total cost of the person's FIF interests (including the newly determined market value of the re-valued shares) is less than $50,000, unless the person elects to apply the FIF rules (see subsections CQ 5(1)(d) and (e)). They will also not apply if some other exemption (for example, sections EX 31 to 39) applies to the shares.

**Example**

Sandy inherited some foreign shares at zero cost. The inherited shares have a market value of $20,000 on 7 May 2012 which is the date that section EX 67B re-values them. Sandy has some other foreign shares that are worth $40,000, although $5,000 of these shares are in ASX-listed companies that qualify for the section EX 31 exemption.

Excluding the ASX-listed shares, the value of Sandy's foreign shares is $55,000. This is more than $50,000, so Sandy must apply the FIF rules to the foreign shares (other than the ASX-listed foreign shares), beginning from the income year that includes 7 May 2012.

Secondly, in cases when the shares are held on revenue account, there may be a taxable gain, depending on whether the shares have become more valuable since they were inherited. If the market value of the person's shares at the time of the disposal in section EX 67B(2) is more than the market value at the time of the inheritance, any revenue account gain on the affected shares is limited to an amount equal to the difference between the market value at the time of the disposal and the market value on the date the shares were inherited. If the market value of the person's shares at the time of the disposal in section EX 67B(2) is less than the market value at the time of the inheritance, the person is treated as having no revenue account gain or loss on the shares.

If there is a revenue account gain on the shares, the resulting tax liabilities are able to be spread over three consecutive years, with at least one-third paid in the first year after the year the disposal takes effect, one-half of the remaining tax paid in the second year, and the rest in the third year.

A taxpayer can only spread revenue account income. They cannot spread FIF income that arises after the deemed reacquisition.

**Example 1**

John inherited shares at a zero cost on 5 January 2001. The shares had a market value of $20,000 on 5 January 2001. The shares are worth $30,000 on 7 May 2012. Because the shares are held on revenue account, John is taxed on the $10,000 difference between these two market values. The $3,300 tax liability can be spread over three years, in which case John would pay $1,100 in each of the next three years.

**Example 2**

Sam inherited shares at a zero cost on 6 November 2006. The shares had a market value of $200,000 on 6 November 2006. The shares are worth $100,000 on 7 May 2012. Sam would not have a tax liability under section EX 67B(2B) and this section does not create a revenue account loss.
IN CONFIDENCE Revenue Alert RA 18/01 Dividend stripping – some share sales where proceeds are at a high risk of being treated as a dividend for income tax purposes An alert should not be interpreted as being Inland Re Many people sell shares in companies each year and pay no tax on the proceeds, either because they do not exceed their cost, or because any gain is on capital account. However, increasingly Inland Revenue is seeing sales of shares to related entities in situations where Inland Revenue considers the sale proceeds are a dividend under the general tax avoidance rule in section BG 1 and also sometimes the dividend stripping rule in section GB 1. In essence, a dividend is a transfer of value by a company to a shareholder or related person and the transfer is caused by that shareholding. Dividend stripping refers to the sale of shares where some or all of the amount received is in substitution for a dividend likely to have been derived by the seller but for the sale of the shares. The related party scenarios described in this Alert are a subset of arrangements of various kinds known generically as “dividend stripping”, but Inland Revenue wants shareholders to be more aware of these situations, and of the department’s concerns. Background When a person sells shares in a company (the target) to an unrelated purchaser, it is generally appropriate for the transaction to be taxed as a sale of the shares rather than a dividend (though this is not always the case, for example if the target company is cashed up, and the sale is for the purpose of avoiding tax on a liquidating distribution). The sale may be on revenue or capital account. However, if the sale is to a related entity, such as a company in which the seller or sellers have a significant shareholding, the economic effect of the transaction may be that the seller indirectly continues to substantially own the target company. The greater the similarity between the seller’s pre and post-sale A Revenue Alert is issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, and provides information about a significant and/or emerging tax planning issue that is of concern to Inland Revenue. At the time an alert is issued risk assessments will already be underway to determine the level of risk and to consider appropriate responses. A Revenue Alert will identify: • the issue (which may be a scheme, arrangement, or particular transaction) which the Commissioner believes may be contrary to the law or is inconsistent with policy; • the common features of the issue; • our current view; and • our current approach. An alert should not be interpreted as being Inland Revenue’s final position. Rather, an alert outlines the Commissioner’s current view on how the law should be applied. For any alert we issue it is likely that some investigatory work has already been carried out. If people have entered into an arrangement similar to the one described or are thinking about it, they should talk to their tax advisor and/or to Inland Revenue for advice about tax implications. 2 IN CONFIDENCE ownership of the target company, the greater the risk that the transaction should be treated as a tax avoidance transaction. This risk exists regardless of whether or not the target company has liquid assets or retained earnings at the time of sale. For example, the target company may have appreciated assets, or goodwill that has emerged over time. A recent example of this kind of dividend stripping transaction is Beacham v CIR (2014) 26 NZTC 21-111. In Beacham, the shareholders in Beacham Holdings Ltd were a husband and wife (the Beachams). They had borrowed approximately $1.1M from the company over a period of years. The borrowing was problematic in that if interest was not charged on it, it would give rise to a taxable dividend to the shareholders. Beacham Holdings had retained earnings of approximately $1.8M. The shareholders sold Beacham Holdings to Beacham Group Ltd, which they also wholly owned, in exchange for a debt obligation of $1.84M. The debt obligation was partly satisfied by various journal entries that operated to set off the shareholders’ obligations to repay the amounts borrowed from Beacham Holdings against the obligations owed to them by Beacham Group for the purchase of the Beacham Holdings shares. The remainder of the purchase price was left as a debt outstanding to the Beachams. The shareholders treated the transaction for tax purposes as a sale of the shares in Beacham Holdings to Beacham Group. However, the court held that it was a dividend stripping transaction, and the shareholders were taxable on the sale proceeds as if they were a dividend. The court did not distinguish between the amounts used to pay the shareholders’ overdrawn current account and the amounts left owing to the shareholders. Inland Revenue has been considering some practices and in some cases investigating sales of shares to related companies. It has come to the view that sometimes the transactions are likely subject to the anti-avoidance rules. This requires consideration of the objective purposes of the arrangements and the test of parliamentary contemplation, as set out in the leading court case in this area. Current view on dividend stripping in restructuring transactions The Commissioner’s view is that where a person or persons sell shares in a company (the target) to another company (the acquirer) in which the person or persons also has (or have) a significant ownership interest, section BG 1 or section GB 1 can apply in a wider range of circumstances than those in the Beacham case. For example, a sale can be subject to section BG 1 where the target has no retained earnings at the time of sale, and where the purchase price is simply left owing to the vendors. A tax avoidance arrangement may also arise where a holding company structure is used to facilitate the exit of a shareholder, or the merger of two companies. The Commissioner would also have tax avoidance concerns where an arrangement inappropriately creates available subscribed capital (ASC) for a company in situations where a shareholder in reality has not provided anything for the issue of shares by the company. Examples The following examples highlight the Commissioner’s concerns. They are not intended to be a comprehensive guide to when sales of shares, either to related or unrelated parties, give rise to a dividend stripping concern. 3 IN CONFIDENCE Example 1: sale of company with no retained earnings, no real ownership change Target Ltd was 100% owned by a discretionary family trust. It owned and operated a successful medium sized business. Most of the directors were also beneficiaries of the family trust. Target distributed most of its retained earnings as fully imputed dividends each year. Over a four year period, these dividends averaged $500,000 per annum. Although fully imputed, some of these dividends were subject to additional tax, as the income of the trustee, top marginal rate beneficiaries, or minor beneficiaries subject to the minor beneficiary rule. Others gave rise to tax refunds or reductions, as they were beneficiary income of lower marginal rate beneficiaries. The family trust sold Target to HoldCo Ltd, for $3.5M, which was $3M above the net equity. The price was supported by a valuation from a registered valuer. The family trust lent HoldCo $3.5M in exchange for a debt obligation. Before the sale, HoldCo was a shell company owned 100% by the family trust. The gain arose from the fact that Target’s business was well established, and was generating significant annual profits. There was also a small element of asset appreciation. After the sale, Target’s business continued as before. However, rather than distributing its earnings as dividends over the next three years, it loaned an equivalent amount to HoldCo. HoldCo used the money to repay the debt owed to the family trust. The loan repayments were either retained by the trust or used to make distributions to beneficiaries. They were not returned as taxable income. The Commissioner asked the trustees of the family trust and their advisors why the shares in Target had been sold. They responded that, consideration was being given to the possibility of going into a new line of business, and that for this purpose it was desirable to have a holding company structure. The new business was going to be operated by a new company, which would be owned by the holding company. No new business had in fact eventuated. Commissioner’s view on Example 1 Looked at objectively, the transaction resulted in no material change in the family trust’s commercial position. The family trust continued to own the same business as before, albeit now indirectly through its ownership of HoldCo. The sale proceeds (the $3.5m debt owed to the family trust) are a transfer of value to the family trust for which the trust has not really given up anything from the restructure and the sale of its shares in Target. The loan also means that future loan repayments are not dividends. It seems unlikely to the Commissioner that Parliament would have contemplated that outcome within the rules in the legislation and therefore the transaction is probably a tax avoidance arrangement. It may also likely be subject to section GB 1 so that the proceeds received by the family trust (the $3.5M debt it is owed) from the sale are treated as being a dividend. This is despite the fact that Target had no retained earnings at the time of the sale, and that there is no immediate transfer of cash to Target at the time of the sale to HoldCo. The Commissioner’s view would be the same if HoldCo were an established company with its own business. 4 IN CONFIDENCE Example 2: sale to holding company: target company assets used to fund shareholder exit OpCo Ltd was a successful trading company owned 50:50 by two discretionary family trusts, Trust A and Trust B. OpCo had two executive directors, Mr A and Mr B, both of whom worked in and were the founders of the company, and each of whom was the settlor of one of the trusts. OpCo had grown significantly, funded mostly by fully taxed retained earnings, totalling $8M at the time of the transaction. OpCo had very little available ASC, having been funded mostly by shareholder loans which had been repaid. OpCo had only occasionally paid dividends. Mr B wished to exit the business, and Mr A was keen for his trust (Trust A) to acquire Trust B’s shares. The parties agreed on a valuation of $10m for the business. The sale was structured as follows. All transactions occurred on the same day.  Trust A set up a new holding company (HoldCo Ltd), with nominal share capital;  HoldCo acquired all of Trust B’s OpCo shares for $5M, issuing an IOU in exchange;  HoldCo acquired all of Trust A’s OpCo shares on the same basis;  HoldCo borrowed $5M from OpCo’s existing bank, secured over OpCo’s assets. The provision of security by OpCo was properly dealt with in terms of Companies Act 1993 compliance.  HoldCo paid the $5M to Trust B in satisfaction of the IOU. The result of the transaction was that:  Trust B received $5M cash and gave up its OpCo shares;  The OpCo /HoldCo group (which was economically identical to OpCo, since HoldCo’s only asset was its shares in OpCo) had provided that $5M cash, by HoldCo borrowing from the bank and then providing it to Trust B as the purchase price for Trust B’s shares in OpCo.  Trust A had 100% of a group worth 50% of what it was previously worth, and was owed $5M by the group. Commissioner’s view on Example 2 The Commissioner considers it probable that the transaction is a tax avoidance arrangement. The results seem again to be beyond what Parliament would have contemplated arising. Firstly, as a result of the transaction, Trust A is owed $5M and now holds its original OpCo shares indirectly, while the OpCo/HoldCo group is able to make payments to Trust A of up to $5M free of tax (by way of debt repayment). It is also relevant that Trust A has acquired economic ownership of $5m worth of OpCo shares from Trust B, without suffering any economic consequences as it effectively used OpCo’s assets. The payment of the purchase price to Trust B has been funded by way of a borrowing by the OpCo/HoldCo group, for which that group is liable, rather than by a borrowing by Trust A, yet the transaction has not been taxed as a distribution; The tax advantage of the transaction can be counteracted by treating Trust A as receiving a dividend at the time of the transaction. 5 IN CONFIDENCE Example 3: merger using a holding company A Ltd and B Ltd were medium size trading companies. A Ltd was owned 100% by Mr A, and B Ltd was owned 25% by Mr A and 75% by Mr B. Both companies had very little ASC, having been funded mostly by previous shareholder loans (now repaid). Mr A and Mr B were relatives, and on good personal and business terms. They decided it would be a good idea to merge their companies, which were each valued at $5M, though their tangible assets were valued at only $2M each. The merger was achieved by forming a new HoldCo owned 62.5% by Mr A and 37.5% by Mr B. Mr A and Mr B provided only nominal amounts for the HoldCo shares and so HoldCo had very little ASC. HoldCo acquired the shares in A Ltd and B Ltd, with $10M of finance provided by the vendors. Before the merger, Mr A and Mr B would have been taxable on any amounts distributed to them by their companies, subject to the possibility of returning the relatively small amount of ASC by way of a share repurchase. Leaving aside sections BG 1 and GB 1, immediately after the merger, they would have been able to be paid $10M by HoldCo as a repayment of the purchase price debt. Within a few months of the sale:  $5M of the loans were converted into fully paid shares in HoldCo;  HoldCo, A Ltd and B Ltd were amalgamated in a short form amalgamation, with HoldCo as the continuing company. These steps were already contemplated at the time that the sale of the shares to HoldCo took place. Accordingly, the ASC of the HoldCo shares issued on conversion of the debt was not the $5M debt discharged by issue of those shares. It was limited by section CD 43(9) and section CD 43(10) to half the ASC of the A Ltd and B Ltd shares on issue before the sale of the A Ltd and B Ltd to HoldCo. Section CD 43(9) and section CD 43(10) limit the ASC of shares issued by a company (in this case HoldCo) where the company receives consideration for those shares, directly or indirectly, in the form of shares in another company (in this case A Ltd and B Ltd), and immediately after the issue, there are 1 or more persons (in this case Mr A and Mr B) whose common voting interests in the company and the other company total 10% or greater. Commissioner’s view on Example 3 Again applying the Parliamentary contemplation test, the Commissioner’s view is that these transactions are likely to be a tax avoidance arrangement. Although there is a commercial purpose (the merger of the two businesses), given the facts and circumstances, that purpose has been achieved in a way that means the transaction has a more than merely incidental purpose of tax avoidance. Relevant facts and circumstances include in particular the fact that the ownership of HoldCo reflects the ownership of the two existing companies. The transaction is likely to be a tax avoidance arrangement subject to section BG 1. The transactions give rise to a dividend of $5M. The Commissioner considers that sections CD 43(9) and CD 43(10) limit the ASC so that the $5M of loan converted to shares does not give rise to any ASC. Even if these sections don’t apply to limit the ASC, section BG 1 if applied would affect the ASC created from the arrangement. This is because the effect of the arrangement is that the shareholders have not contributed anything in commercial reality in exchange for the shares issued to them upon conversion. 6 IN CONFIDENCE Current status Inland Revenue has been considering arrangements of the type outlined above and has commenced investigations into a number of taxpayers who have entered into restructuring arrangements like those described. Where Inland Revenue considers that sale proceeds, debt repayments or other value transferred are in substance a dividend, the Commissioner will assess the shareholder on the amount of the dividend. The Commissioner may also assess the company for resident or non-resident withholding tax, except where the dividend arises as a result of a reconstruction under section GB 1(3) (see sections RE 2(5)(j) and RF 3(2)). Late payment penalties and use of money interest may be applied to taxpayers entering into the types of arrangement described in this Revenue Alert. Shortfall penalties may also apply, although these may be reduced where a voluntary disclosure is made. If you consider that our concerns may apply to your situation, we recommend you discuss the matter with your tax advisor or with us, and consider making a voluntary disclosure. Guidelines for making a voluntary disclosure are contained in our booklet Putting your tax returns right (IR280) and Standard Practice Statement 09/02 Voluntary disclosures (May 2009).

Revenue Alert on diverting personal income released
===================================================

**21 June 2010**

Inland Revenue today released a Revenue Alert on diverting personal services income to further refine its position on income allocation and diversion arrangements in the wake of a Court of Appeal decision.

Revenue Alerts are issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to provide information about significant or emerging tax planning issues.

The Alert updates a 2008 Revenue Alert. It sets out New Zealand's taxation rules and the circumstances when Inland Revenue will consider income diversion arrangements to be tax avoidance in this context.

Group Tax Counsel, Assurance, Graham Tubb says the decision in the Penny and Hooper case is a welcome affirmation of Inland Revenue's long-held views in this area of tax planning, and lines up well with recent cases dealing with forestry structures, intellectual property rights, and structured finance arrangements.

Mr Tubb said the decision does not mean that every small business which has been incorporated, or is run through a trust is now a tax avoidance arrangement.

"To be considered avoidance, the tax effect would need to be substantial and unusual. It is a question of degree, but as is suggested by the Court, Inland Revenue should not interfere in 'marginal circumstances'. The Penny and Hooper decision confirms important criteria which, in combination, are likely to be indicative of tax avoidance and we reflect these in our updated Revenue Alert."

"These cases are not about any concept of 'market salary' (a concept which has been allowed to overtake the real debate) or telling people what they should be paid. In fact there are often legitimate reasons to retain income in the entity, for business purposes. However, where tax avoidance is found, Inland Revenue will consider if the distribution of profits is sufficient," he said.

Mr Tubb said the decision continues a long line of successful cases dating back to the 1980s and others concerning the sheltering of personal income.

Inland Revenue will continue to investigate aggressive tax planning cases similar to these as it identifies them. The Revenue Alert can be found at [http://www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/revenue-alerts/revenue-alert-ra1001.html](technical-tax/revenue-alerts/revenue-alert-ra1001.html)

The tax system is a major piece of national infrastructure, and the Revenue portfolio is both busy and interesting. The strategic value of the tax system has increased in importance with the COVID-19 crisis and response. Decisions taken in the next few years will affect the ability of the tax system to continue to raise sufficient revenue to finance government expenditure. In your manifesto there are a number of issues that we have identified that will require Cabinet decisions, and in some cases legislation, if you wish to progress them before the end of the year. Officials will report to you immediately on the process for progressing these items. These matters include: •A new 39% top personal income tax rate •Extension of the Small Business (Cashflow) Loan Scheme •Changes to the minimum family tax credit (report in conjunction with MSD and Treasury) We look forward to working with you over this parliamentary term. Briefing to the incoming Minister of Revenue 5 Introduction to the Revenue portfolio Introduction to the Revenue portfolio As Minister of Revenue, you are accountable for the overall working of New Zealand’s tax system and for protecting its integrity. You are also the responsible Minister for Vote Revenue, its appropriations, and policy priorities and direction within this Vote. A s the principal steward of New Zealand’s revenue system, Inland Revenue must maintain the integrity of the tax system and the confidentiality of people's tax affairs. Inland Revenue collects over 80% of the Crown’s revenue . T he New Zealand Customs Service collects the majority of the remaining 20%. C onstitutionally, tax can only be levied according to laws enacted by Parliament. Decisions on tax policies delivered by Inland Revenue are made jointly by you and the Minister of Finance. T he administration of social policies makes up a significant portion of Inland Revenue’s core business. Alongside collecting tax, Inland Revenue is an administrator of five social policies (Working for Families, Child Support, Student Loans, KiwiSaver and Paid Parental Leave). Inland Revenue has responsibility for distributing and/or collecting these social support payments and has shared policy responsibilities for these regimes with other departments. These roles are also administered under Vote Revenue. In addition to tax, you will take s ocial policy decisions jointly with other appropriate Ministers. More information about the social policy products Inland Revenue administers, and the Ministerial responsibilities relating to them, is covered in the table beginning on page 8. T he Commissioner of Inland Revenue has statutory independence from Ministers, to ensure Inland Revenue can levy tax and carry out its duties independently. The Commissioner carries prime responsibility for Inland Revenue’s performance and must exercise statutory judgement to determine where resources should be focused. This is a somewhat different arrangement from other government departments, where Ministers have more ability to influence how a department should act. I ntroduction to Inland Revenue The needs and wellbeing of New Zealanders are at the heart of what Inland Revenue does. As mentioned above, in addition to being New Zealand’s principal revenue agency, we also have an important role in administering social policy and other programmes, often in conjunction with other government agencies. I nland Revenue contributes to the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealand by collecting and distributing money. Its success is reflected in three outcomes: •Revenue is available to fund Government programmes through people meeting payment obligations of their own accord; Briefing to the incoming Minister of Revenue 6 •P eople receive the payments they are entitled to, enabling them to participate in society; and •New Zealanders benefit economically and socially through Inland Revenue working collaboratively across its external environment. I nland Revenue is transforming to become a more customer-centric, intelligence-led and agile organisation. This transformation is making it simpler and more certain for people to pay their taxes and receive their entitlements. Inland Revenue is involved in partnerships across government and the private sector to improve outcomes for New Zealanders. I nland Revenue takes a ‘right from the start’ approach, which means we support customers before issues arise. A range of activities make it easy for customers to get things right, and hard for them to get it wrong. Inland Revenue: •acts early; •makes it easy to meet obligations and difficult not to; •makes processes easy for customers; and •actively involves and engages customers and other stakeholders. C ompliance is about making sure everyone pays the right amounts, accurately files the right information, and that customers receive the right amounts or entitlements. It covers everything Inland Revenue does, from helping customers get things right from the start, through to enforcement where necessary. Inland Revenue also has new analytical tools and capabilities, which allow us to approach compliance more strategically. We can now better understand our customers and their reasons for not getting it right, develop more tailored and efficient interventions, and respond faster when we see deliberate non-compliance. Firm action is taken to address deliberate non-compliance through a range of enforcement activities including audit, litigation and prosecution. A s at 30 June 2020, Inland Revenue had approximately 4,700 people on permanent or fixed-term agreements. This reduction is a result of the cessation of time-limited funding, and continuing to realise the savings Inland Revenue committed to in return for the Government’s investment in Business Transformation. This is covered in more detail in the Inland Revenue – People section on page 24. s9(2)(g)(i) Briefing to the incoming Minister of Revenue 7 Introduction to the tax and transfer system Inland Revenue’s role in the tax and transfer system New Zealand's tax system is robust and provides reliable sources of revenue to fund Government programmes. As well as having coherent tax policy, the tax administration must also function well; this is critical because both policy and administration must be working well for the tax system to be effective. T he New Zealand tax system operates through customers meeting their tax obligations voluntarily. There are three fundamental beliefs that underpin voluntary compliance and are vital to upholding the integrity of the tax system. It is important that New Zealanders believe that: •when I pay my tax, I’m doing a good thing (and that’s what people like me do); •when I’m trying to do the right things, Inland Revenue will help me; and •when someone else is trying to do the wrong thing, Inland Revenue will find them. Inland Revenue plays a vital role in maintaining and enhancing the integrity of the tax system by making sure it is clear, consistent and simple. A longside the Treasury, Inland Revenue provides advice to the Government on tax policy and the social policies we administer. Inland Revenue also provides advice to the Government on international tax issues and is involved in the development and implementation of New Zealand’s international tax legislation. C ompared to most other countries, New Zealand’s tax base is very broad and neutral. In New Zealand there are three major tax bases: personal income tax, company income tax and Goods and Services Tax (GST). Over 95% of the tax revenue Inland Revenue collects is from these three main taxes and those that support them (for example resident withholding tax – the tax on interest and dividend income). T he following chart shows the source of New Zealand’s tax revenue for the financial year ended 30 June 2019, as reported in Inland Revenue’s Annual Report 2019 1 . 1 Please note the revenue figures for the year ended 30 June 2020 have yet to be approved by Audit NZ. Briefing to the incoming Minister of Revenue 8 Size and scope of I nland Revenue’s activities Inland Revenue provides services to a wide range of customers. These include employees, employers, the self-employed, companies, not-for -profit organisations, trusts, Māori authorities, tax agents, parents, students, savers and investors, and people who live overseas but have tax affairs or social policy obligations in New Zealand. Alongside the tax products mentioned in the previous section, Inland Revenue also administers a number of other products (particularly relating to social policy) in collaboration with other government departments. The table below shows a list of these products, the departments we collaborate with, and the current distribution of Ministerial responsibility for these policy areas. Product Activity Joint Minister / Portfolio Working for Families tax credits Inland Revenue, with the Ministry of Social Development, distributed $3.19 billion in entitlements for Working for Families tax credits during the 2019-20 year. Policy responsibility: shared with the Ministers of/for Finance and Social Development. Administrative responsibility: shared with Minister for Social Development. Child support Inland Revenue collected $449 million from more than 161,000 parents who pay child support and distributed $297 million to carers during the 2019-20 year. The difference is retained by the Government to help offset the cost of the sole parent and unsupported child benefits paid to receiving carers. Policy responsibility: As Minister of Revenue, you have sole responsibility. Administrative responsibility: As Minister of Revenue, you have sole responsibility. Note: consultations may be required with other Ministers – typically the Ministers of/for Finance, Social Development, and Children. KiwiSaver Inland Revenue administers the KiwiSaver scheme by collecting contributions and transferring them to scheme providers for investment. Inland Revenue transferred $8 billion to scheme providers during the 2019-20 year. As at 30 June 2020 there were 3.1 million people enrolled in KiwiSaver. Policy responsibilities: Minister of Finance - policy decisions likely to have major fiscal or economic impacts. Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs - withdrawal rules and scheme provider administration. As Minister of Revenue, you have responsibility for membership rules and contributions. Briefing to the incoming Minister of Revenue 9 Student loans Inland Revenue jointly administers the Student Loan Scheme with the Ministries of Education and Social Development (StudyLink). Inland Revenue has more than 692,000 student loan customers and collected $1.4 billion in repayments during the 2019-20 year. Policy responsibilities: Minister of Education – Student Loan Scheme as a whole. Minister of Social Development – administration of lending. As Minister of Revenue you have responsibility for the collection of repayments. R&D Tax Incentive Inland Revenue is the lead administrator of this scheme, working in conjunction with Callaghan Innovation. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment has policy responsibility for all R&D initiatives. Firms can claim a tax credit for eligible expenditure incurred from the start of the 2019-20 income year. Policy responsibilities: The Minister of Research, Science and Innovation is responsible for an appropriation in Vote Revenue for the 2020/21 financial year for the Research and Development Tax Incentive and makes the overall policy decisions. As Minister of Revenue you have responsibility for technical decisions. Administrative responsibility: Inland Revenue. Best Start As at August 2020, since the inception of Best Start in mid-2018 over $181.5 million has been paid to 79,500 New Zealand families, supporting over 92,900 children. Policy responsibility: Shared with Ministers of/for Finance and Social Development. Administrative responsibility: shared with Minister for Social Development. Paid Parental Leave Inland Revenue has delegated authority from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment to process Paid Parental Leave applications and to make payments. Inland Revenue made $420 million in payments to 47,810 carers during the 2019-20 year. Policy responsibility: Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety Administrative responsibility: Inland Revenue Te Tiriti o Waitangi, the Treaty of Waitangi Inland Revenue understands the importance of meeting its Tiriti o Waitangi obligations as a government agency. Inland Revenue’s Māhutonga programme seeks to integrate te Briefing to the incoming Minister of Revenue 10 Tiriti o Waitangi and Māori principles, concepts and practices into the way it works. Māhutonga sets out the direction we want to take with our organisational culture and our Māori customers. The current landscape Inland Revenue has had a significant focus on the response to the global COVID-19 pandemic. We have shared our analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on the economy and society, along with our approach to services and operations with public sector agencies to support New Zealand’s collective response to COVID-19. Inland Revenue has taken a highly supportive and empathetic approach to help customers through this period, assisting them to find the best way to manage their obligations and receive the right entitlements. Our new analytical capabilities are shaping how we support customers to pay and receive the right amounts across a range of areas. These capabilities have significantly improved our ability to identify and address new risks and compliance opportunities, to better understand our customers, and how we can help them get it right and shift their behaviour. We are rethinking the balance of interventions and skills required to achieve this, complemented with greater automation, more sophisticated risk analysis and better targeting. Our improved analytical capability presents significant opportunity, which we can discuss with you further at the appropriate time. Inland Revenue’s performance has been, and will continue to be, affected by prioritisation decisions made to support the Government’s response to COVID-19. Inland Revenue’s performance against the targets set for the 2020/21 financial year will reflect the impacts of responding to COVID-19. More information about Inland Revenue’s performance will be provided in a separate briefing. Briefing to the incoming Minister of Revenue 11 Tax policy Introduction to tax policy The primary purpose of the tax system is to raise revenue to fund government expenditure. This should be done in a way that is efficient, fair, simple, coherent and collects the tax that is due, on time and in full. The decisions you take with the Minister of Finance on tax policy shape the tax system. Th e tax system is a major piece of national infrastructure. Its strategic value has increased in importance with the COVID-19 crisis and response. The ability of the tax system to raise funds to be used in response to the crisis, and (when and if appropriate) contribute to eventual fiscal consolidation, is a role that no other national infrastructure can play. As such, decisions in the next few years that affect the ability of the tax system to continue to raise substantial amounts of revenue are even more important than usual. In the past, some Ministers of Finance and Revenue have established a memorandum of understanding setting out how they want to work together on the tax portfolio and outlining the division of responsibility. If this is of interest, we can discuss this with you further. Re flecting the joint responsibilities between you and the Minister of Finance, you will receive joint tax policy advice from Inland Revenue and the Treasury. As mentioned in the Introduction to the Tax and Transfer System section, Inland Revenue is also an administrator of Working for Families, Child Support, Student Loan, KiwiSaver and Paid Parental Leave social policies, and has shared policy responsibilities for these regimes with other departments. We can discuss with you the possibility of setting up regular engagement with Ministerial colleagues who share responsibility for these social policy regimes. New Zealand’s tax and transfer system New Zealand’s current tax system has evolved through decisions made over many years. Past decisions have been guided by the following principles: •Neutrality with respect to economic activity, so that particular sectors are neither favoured nor penalised by the tax rules. •Minimising the economic burden, relative to the revenue being raised, to lessen any distortions to economic activity that taxes might cause. •Fairness, so that different taxpayers with similar amounts of income pay similar amounts of tax. •Progressivity, so those who are better off pay a greater proportion of their income in tax. •Considering the tax and transfer system as a whole, by thinking about how different policies interact, rather than looking at policies in isolation. Briefing to the incoming Minister of Revenue 12 There are two important consequences of following this approach. The New Zealand tax system raises the bulk of its revenue from three tax bases: personal income, company income and GST, and New Zealand does not have some of the more distortionary taxes, such as stamp duties, that are found in other countries. New Zealand’s tax system is underpinned by a “broad-based, low-rate” (BBLR) framework. In a BBLR tax system tax bases are kept broad and tax rates are kept as low as possible while remaining consistent with the Government’s distributional objectives.  A BBLR helps ensure the revenue base is stable and works well because taxes are applied fairly and with few exemptions. For instance, compared with other OECD countries, New Zealand raises a high amount of consumption tax revenue from its GST (as a proportion of GDP) despite the GST rate being in the middle of the range. The broad approach to what is being taxed makes Parliament’s intention clear and helps courts decide what is, and what is not, tax avoidance. Th e interaction between the way individuals and entities, such as companies, are taxed is also very important to ensure that the tax system achieves its efficiency and fairness objectives. Changing income tax rates requires considering implications for the coherence of the system as a whole, and the incentives for individuals to work and save. Ho w attractive New Zealand is as a destination for international investment is affected by the corporate tax rate. Coordinating the interaction between the individual and entity tax rates is an important aspect of the design of the tax system, which helps address the tension between the alignment of rates and international competitiveness. T ax policy settings need to be supported by good tax administration. As mentioned, the New Zealand tax system is underpinned by the concept of voluntary compliance. This means ensuring taxpayers can readily comply with their obligations, that they are able to seek support when they need help in meeting such obligations, and that Inland Revenue takes appropriate enforcement action where there is non-compliance. Together, good tax policy settings and good tax administration make a great tax system. Developing the Tax Policy Work Programme One of the first steps for the new Government is to develop a revenue strategy that is effectively linked with its economic strategy. The revenue strategy sets out the Government’s objectives for the tax system and tax policy, in the context of its economic and fiscal strategies. The next stage is developing a tax policy work programme that gives effect to the revenue strategy. Th e Tax Policy Work Programme (TPWP) sets out what Inland Revenue’s policy focus will be over the next 18 months. Its development involves consultation with a wide range of stakeholders. It is approved by you and the Minister of Finance, and reflects your priorities. An updated version of the TPWP was released in August 2019 – we will provide you with a copy of this work programme. Briefing to the incoming Minister of Revenue 13 The TPWP is generally made public, attracting strong interest from the tax and business communities, to whom it provides greater certainty and an understanding of the Government’s direction in tax policy. We will report to you and the Minister of Finance on possible measures for inclusion in the TPWP. Influences on the Tax Policy Work Programme During 2020, a significant amount of policy resource was diverted to the COVID-19 response, which required a number of tax and social policy measures to be delivered in a short period of time (policy measures that Inland Revenue has implemented as part of the COVID-19 response to date are set out on page 20 ). The focus has mainly been on the initial phase of responding to COVID-19, which relates to short-term measures aimed at supporting households and firms, and alleviating hardship. Over the next 18 months, tax policy measures associated with COVID-19 will continue to be a high priority. This would involve longer-term measures helping to rebuild the economy. This could involve consideration of whether current tax settings are making the right trade-offs between supporting economic efficiency, productivity and growth on the one hand, and Government fairness and distributional goals on the other. In practice, tax policy work aimed at rebuilding the economy is not necessarily separate from the majority of the TPWP, which is aimed at ensuring that tax is raised fairly and efficiently, and that tax policy responds quickly and appropriately to new developments. Keeping tax policy up to date and relevant, often through a number of smaller initiatives, is critical in ensuring that New Zealand has, and continues to have, a good tax system. Potential issues requiring decisions and or discussion with you before the end of t he year In your manifesto there are several issues that we have identified that will require Cabinet decisions, and in some cases legislation, before the end of the year. Officials will report to you immediately on the process for progressing these items. These matters include: •A new 39% top personal income tax rate •Extension of the Small Business (Cashflow) Loan Scheme •Changes to the minimum family tax credit (report in conjunction with MSD and Treasury) B efore the end of the year we will also discuss and seek direction from you on: •Your availability to attend and open the CAANZ annual tax conference in Auckland on 19 November 2020 •Legislative Bill bids for 2021 •Budget 2021 work •Next steps following the reinstatement of two tax bills - both will need to be passe d p rior to 31 March 2021 s9(2)(f)(iv) Briefing to the incoming Minister of Revenue 14 Key issues for the TPWP over the next 18 months Alongside the issues identified above, the key issues for the TPWP over the next 18 months are outlined below. •R ebuilding the economy - whether current tax settings are making the right trade- offs, considering the advantages and disadvantages of possible reform. •Issues related to the misalignment of the top personal tax rate and the company rate. •The role of environmental taxes and what an environmental tax framework should look like. •Improving data analytics – to further enhance insights from data and informatio n to provide better informed policy interventions. •International tax settings – includes work being progressed by the OECD on taxin g th e digital economy (referred to by the OECD as Pillar One and Pillar Tw o proposals). Ensuring the tax system does not act as an undue impediment to inbound capital investment and imported skills, while not creating integrity or equity risks. •Improving tax administration. •Potential changes to Working for Families and broader welfare overhaul. •Allocating sufficient resource to business as usual issues to ensure a robust tax system, maintaining its integrity. •Testing policies in the tax system (and applicable parts of the welfare system) are working as Parliament intended, and helping to ensure regulatory systems are fi t f or purpose. Generic tax policy process The process of developing tax policy is also important. Tax changes are developed in accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). This is a defined process that emphasises consultation throughout the policy development process. The GTPP contributes significantly to tax policy changes being well thought through and workable in practice. There are two particular benefits from the GTPP. Tax is complex and nobody has a monopoly of wisdom on tax matters. External parties help us identify potential problems and improve the workability of policy. T he GTPP also fosters a trusted relationship between officials and stakeholders. It means New Zealand has a private sector that is well informed about tax policy and can provide advice based on what is best for the tax system rather than what is solely in their interest. International commentators comment favourably on the constructive and inclusive way tax policy is developed in New Zealand compared with other countries. I nland Revenue and the Treasury publicly released the Tax and social policy engagement framework in August 2019. This sought to formalise enhancements to consultation processes and reflect how the GTPP has evolved over time. Key enhancements outlined in the framework are placing a greater emphasis on outcome focused policy development Briefing to the incoming Minister of Revenue 15 through earlier and more frequent engagement, engagement with a wider range of stakeholders, and engagement with Māori. New ways of working put in place in response to COVID-19 reflected the move towards earlier and more frequent engagement. In particular, the hosting of regular focus groups with stakeholders to discuss issues relating to specific tax areas. These processes received positive feedback from stakeholders and will inform how the GTPP operates moving forward. Engagement with stakeholders Due to the GTPP’s emphasis on consultation and engagement throughout the policy development process, Inland Revenue has well established relationships with the tax community. Inland Revenue engages regularly with stakeholders such as tax agents, professional bodies such as Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ) and Accountants and Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand (ATAINZ), and industry groups such as the Corporate Taxpayers Group. These groups may seek to regularly engage with you over significant issues within your portfolio. Traditionally the Minister of Revenue opens the conferences of CA ANZ and the International Fiscal Association (IFA). This year the CA ANZ conference is scheduled for 19 November, and the IFA conference is on 25 February 2021. Officials will support you with briefings for these events. Bills in progress In addition to the items on the work programme, there are also a number of taxation bills before Parliament at any given time. Currently, two Bills have been introduced and should be progressed. These Bills are the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill and the Child Support Amendment Bill. In order to be progressed, these Bills will need to be re-instated by the new Parliament. We are happy to discuss the content of these Bills with you in more detail. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill received its first reading on 24 June 2020 and was referred to the Finance and Expenditure Committee. The main items within the Bill include the annual rates of income tax for the 2020-21 tax year, deductibility of feasibility expenditure, purchase price allocation, and amendments to the land sale rules. The feasibility expenditure and purchase price allocation amendments have attracted a large amount of interest from the private sector, with this high level of interest expected to continue as the Bill progresses. The Bill also includes amendments relating to the application of GST on outbound mobile roaming services, the transfer of unclaimed Australian superannuation money to KiwiSaver accounts, and Mycoplasma bovis tax issues. A Supplementary Order Paper to Briefing to the incoming Minister of Revenue 16 the Bill includes amendments simplifying the administration of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 and adjustments to the threshold for an automatic write-off of tax owing for individuals. As this Bill contains annual rates for the 2020-21 tax year, and it is a statutory requirement for the rates to be set befor e each tax year, it will need to be enacted before the end of March 2021. Child Support Amendment Bill The Child Support Amendment Bill received its first reading on 6 May 2020 and was referred to the Social Services and Community Committee. The proposals in the Bill are aimed at supporting Stage 4 of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme and include amendments that would introduce the payment of financial support by compulsory deduction, limit retrospective reassessments by introducing a four year time bar, and amending the definition of income. A Supplementary Order Paper to the Bill would remove child support incremental penalties and simplify the penalty write-off provisions. Briefing to incoming Minister of Revenue 17 Current significant policy issues As noted above, the TPWP will need to be updated to reflect your priorities. Summarised below are significant projects which we recommend be carried forward. We look forward to discussing these further with you. Issue Summary Next steps Loss continuity It has been publicly announced that changes to relax the loss continuity rules (applying when there is a change in a company’s ownership) would apply from the 2020-21 income year. Policy decisions on the detailed design of these changes still need to be made and legislative amendments must be passed before these changes can come into effect. Permanent loss carry-back A temporary loss carry-back measure applying to losses incurred in the 2019-20 or 2020-21 income years has already been implemented as part of the COVID- 19 response. It has been publicly announced that there is an intention to develop a permanent loss carry back mechanism to replace the temporary measure. Policy decisions on the design of the measure still need to be made, in addition to decisions on how the measure should be funded. Legislative amendments must also be passed before these changes can come into effect. Taxing the digital economy A major international tax focus is addressing concern about the low levels of income tax paid by large multinational companies. Work is being undertaken at the OECD on a multilateral solution to this issue, with the OECD releasing a report in October 2020 and work expected to be on-going in 2021. New Zealand officials are contributing to the OECD process. Another option is for New Zealand to implement a unilateral digital services tax (DST). Exposure draft legislation for a DST has been prepared but has not been released publicly. Ministers will need to make a decision about the suitability of any OECD multilateral solution for New Zealand and whether to progress a unilateral DST in the meantime. Briefing to incoming Minister of Revenue 18 Issue Summary Next steps Self-employed compliance initiatives This project aims to address the issue of self-employed taxpayers having lower levels of compliance than employees by adding new industries to the schedular/withholding payments regime. We are planning to report to you with a draft officials’ issues paper on new industries to add to the regime in the first quarter of next year. Land review A review of the tax rules applying to land is underway, to ensure that the current tax settings are fair, balanced and support productive investment while discouraging speculation. As noted above, certain amendments to the land sale rules have already been included in a taxation omnibus bill, further work is now underway on a general review of the tax rules applying to land. We are planning to report to you on the land review in the new year. Environmental taxes A major focus is working towards producing a framework on when to apply environmental taxes. We are working initially with other government agencies on an across-agency framework. An update report to Ministers is planned for late 2020, with a consultation document in 2021. Welfare Overhaul and review of the tax credit system The cross-agency work programme for overhauling the welfare system has re- started. Officials are considering how the work programme could shift to focus more on the challenges arising from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges include addressing changes in income support following increased levels of unemployment, desire for longer term structural changes to the tax and transfer system, and a potentially smaller fiscal envelope in the next forecast period. We are working with government agencies on reviewing the fundamental frameworks with a plan to report to Ministers in late 2020 - including a scoping note on a review of Working for Families and related tax credits. Briefing to incoming Minister of Revenue 19 Issue Summary Next steps Charities and not-for-profits Charities and not-for-profits receive a range of tax concessions. These tax concessions are being reviewed to ensure they operate coherently and fairly, and to ensure the integrity of the tax system is protected. We are planning to report to you in the new year outlining options for potential public consultation. s9(2)(f)(iv) Briefing to incoming Minister of Revenue 20 COVID-19 response measures Outlined below are tax policy measures that have been implemented as part of the COVID-19 response to date. As a number of the measures are temporary, it is important to consider what will happen when these measures expire. In addition, as the permanent measures were implemented rapidly, it may be necessary for them to be reviewed. Measure Summary Application period Temporary measures Temporary loss carry-back Allows businesses to estimate losses for the 2019-20 or 2020-21 income year and offset these losses against profits made in the prior year. Effective for 2019-20 and 2020-21 income years.

Tax Counsel Office maintains confidence in the tax administration by providing guidance on the correct interpretation of the Inland Revenue Acts and other relevant laws, and by considering case law. The Tax Counsel Office is led by Martin Smith, Chief Tax Counsel. I nland Revenue’s funding For the 2020/21 financial year, the department’s funding is provided through four appropriations: •a multi-year appropriation of just under $1,024 million for the implementation of Business Transformation from 2017/18 to 2021/22 •just over $626 million for services for customers, including services to inform the public about entitlements and meeting obligations, services to process obligations and entitlements, management of debt and unfiled returns, and investigations, and •just over $10 million for policy advice and $5m for services to other agencies. Tw o factors have impacted Inland Revenue’s funding over recent years: our commitment to self-fund and realise savings as part of Business Transformation benefit commitments, and time-limited funding for specific initiatives coming to an end. A further briefing on the department’s financial position, resourcing and capacity will be provided to you shortly. s9(2)(g)(i) Briefing to incoming Minister of Revenue 24 Inland Revenue – People As part of Inland Revenue’s transformation, we are creating an organisation which better serves the people of New Zealand. Maximising the capability of our people is essential to the success of transforming Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue has invested significantly in building the foundations for a transformed and future-fit workforce. Inland Revenue is progressively working towards being an organisation with a smaller, more knowledge-based workforce to ensure it operates sustainably and efficiently. A significant programme of organisation design is underway to ensure the organisation is the right size and shape to perform effectively, efficiently and sustainably. This programme will continue into 2021. T here are two main drivers of this reduction. Business Transformation has changed the nature of our work – for example, automation has removed much of the work that previously required manual effort. In return for the Government’s investment in Business Transformation, Inland Revenue committed to realise savings of $495 million by 2023/24, estimating that the organisation would be approximately 25-30% smaller. During Business Transformation we have appointed many staff on fixed term agreements in anticipation of down-sizing once transformation changes are embedded. Th e second driver is the cessation of time-limited funding. Previous governments provided time-limited funding, enabling Inland Revenue to dedicate resources to increase the focus on areas of specific compliance risk, such as the hidden economy. The majority of this funding ceased as at 30 June 2020, with some small amounts remaining in 2020/21 and 2021/22. In addition, some specific funding has been provided to Inland Revenue to retain staff to September 2021, to support customers in light of the impact of COVID-19. Engagement with unions Inland Revenue’s three unions—the Public Service Association (PSA), Taxpro and the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE) — play an important role representing their members’ voices, and Inland Revenue is committed to working with them. E ngagement with unions extends across business groups, the transformation programme and a range of organisational initiatives. Unions are involved at local, national and programme levels, and Inland Revenue regularly shares information with them. I nland Revenue negotiated collective agreements with each of the three unions in the 2019/20 financial year, with all agreements covering three years. I nland Revenue has relationship agreements with each of the unions, which establish the s9(2)(g)(i) s9(2)(g)(i) Briefing to incoming Minister of Revenue 25 a greed relationship principles and provide practical guidelines on how we will work together to provide a positive workplace for Inland Revenue’s people. Briefing to incoming Minister of Revenue 26 Business Transformation Where we are now Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation is a multi-year programme of modernising New Zealand’s revenue system to ensure it will serve the needs of all New Zealanders. The Business Transformation programme is a combination of changes to policy, process, technology and the capability of our people. It is far more than an upgrade of technology and is changing every aspect of the way Inland Revenue operates. Transformation aims to: •increase voluntary compliance, by making it easier for people to get things right and difficult to get wrong; •ensure continued collection of tax revenue; •contribute to a growing, healthy economy; •improve the Government’s ability to make policy changes more quickly and cost- effectively; and •create an information asset to deliver improved outcomes. I mplementation is now well advanced, with one final stage to go, referred to as Stage 4. The majority of tax and social policy products are now administered on new systems and with new processes, and customers are now able to do a lot for themselves online. The modern, digital revenue system envisaged by transformation is now largely in place. D ecision-makers have significantly more agility to make changes to policy and legislative settings than they previously had. The flexible and iterative nature of START (Inland Revenue’s new core platform) means that new products or services that adopt out-of- the-box processes and use established patterns can be implemented much more quickly. I nland Revenue has implemented new intelligence and knowledge management tools, a new enterprise support services platform, and organisation design. Together, these changes are helping Inland Revenue to work more efficiently and effectively. T he investment made in transformation has created the systems and processes required to enable Inland Revenue to operate in the digital age. Inland Revenue’s ability to keep providing services to customers remotely during COVID-19 and to respond quickly to Government priorities would not have been possible without the investment made in transformation and the flexibility and adaptability of its people. Wh ile the programme is now close to completion, Business Transformation is inherently high-risk and will remain so until its completion. Inland Revenue remains committed to completing transformation as quickly as possible to reduce risk. Changes will be implemented progressively during 2021, to ensure Inland Revenue has capacity to respond to Government priorities. The programme will close by 30 June 2022. Briefing to incoming Minister of Revenue 27 What remains to be completed Stage 4 contains several workstreams. •Completing the core. Move the final tax and social policy products to new systems and processes – these are Child Support, Paid Parental Leave and a number of smaller products (duties, foreign trusts and unclaimed monies). These products (with the exception of child support) will move to new systems and processes on 1 March 2021. Deployment and cut over activity will be planned and executed on a remote-working basis, which will mitigate possible COVID-19 impacts. Child Support will move later in the year, likely in October 2021. •Optimising our technology landscape. Ensure underlying technology infrastructure is up-to-date and sustainable, and decommission heritage systems and processes. •C ompleting the intelligence-led programme of work. Handover of new analytical and knowledge management capabilities to business-as -usual teams. •C ompleting the implementation of Ātea (our enterprise support services). The end date for the replacement of our internal systems and processes is dependent on the all-of-government payroll solution. •E nsuring a smooth transition to the post-transformation operating model. Transition the services, processes, frameworks and methods that will endure after transformation has been completed and ensure the business is ready to accept them. I mproved agility Amongst the benefits to stakeholders from the investment in transformation, the Government now has greater policy agility. Previously our heritage systems were a major constraint on our ability to implement policy change quickly and cost-effectively. I nland Revenue’s improved agility has been demonstrated through, for example, the implementation of the Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme. This was designed and implemented in a matter of weeks without additional investment in systems and processes. The extent to which this was possible, however, was heavily dependent on simple requirements, no/few exceptions, using information already held, and designing within the “out of the box” processes of our technology platform. S imilarly, Inland Revenue has an improved ability to share information securely with other government agencies. For example, to ascertain employers’ eligibility for the wage subsidy, Ministry of Social Development staff are now able to access the required information from our systems via a portal, enabling a swifter response for customers and a more efficient use of departmental resources. This is a good demonstration of digital technologies helping agencies to use data in new and innovative ways to improve the lives of New Zealanders. Briefing to incoming Minister of Revenue 28 H ow quickly Inland Revenue can implement new products or services will always be determined by: •the nature of the change and its requirements; •whether the information/data required is already held; •the capacity to educate and support customers and/or intermediaries i n und erstanding what any change means for them, and what they need to do; and •the lead times required by intermediaries, such as software developers, to prepare for any change. Leveraging this investment As Inland Revenue embeds these new capabilities, there are opportunities to consider leveraging the investment in new systems across the public sector, as well as to make further improvements to the administration of the tax system. This includes working closely with other departments, including the Department of Internal Affairs, Statistics NZ and the New Zealand Customs Service, to take advantage of the investment in enterprise support services (Ātea). Enterprise support services are the internal systems and processes that support the day-to-day running of Inland Revenue. In February 2020, the Digital Government Leadership Group (DGLG) agreed a work programme to enable the process model developed by Inland Revenue for human resources, finance, asset management and procurement functions to be adopted as a common process model for all-of-g overnment. COVID-19 has resulted in delays in getting the work programme fully up and running. In addition, as part of the agreed arrangements for the implementation of Ātea, any material or information developed for Inland Revenue is able to be reused across government. This will enable other agencies using the same technology platform as Inland Revenue (Oracle) to accelerate delivery as they will not have to start from scratch. This approach will help to ensure that the public service leverages the best possible value from its digital technology and data investments. In relation to START, there is a continuum of options for further leveraging this investment. For example, Inland Revenue could potentially act as a service provider to other parts of government for activities that are complementary to the end-to-end tax model. There are also opportunities for the data and information held by Inland Revenue, and the analytics platform and capabilities developed, to be shared with others to enable them to deliver services to their customers. These are areas of opportunity that we would like to discuss further with you at the appropriate time. Timeframes It is important that the focus remains on completing Business Transformation and successfully transitioning to Inland Revenue’s new capabilities. The optimal timeframe for further leveraging these assets will be from early-mid 2022, once the programme has Briefing to incoming Minister of Revenue 29 completed key deliverables. We will be keen to explore the potential for leverage with you during 2021, as this may also shape policy work around the administration of the tax and social policy system. Reporting progress Business Transformation is required to report to Cabinet on progress by July and December each year. I n addition, monthly status updates are provided to you and the Minister of Finance. Given the high-risk nature of the programme, independent quality assurance reviews are conducted regularly. You and the Minister of Finance are provided with the opportunity to talk directly with the review teams and receive copies of the reports once they have been finalised. Transparency about the programme and its progress has been a key principle since the programme began. Inland Revenue regularly publishes the progress updates mentioned above on its external website (www.ird.govt.nz) as well as summaries of the independent quality assurance reviews. The next independent assurance review scheduled is a Gateway 0 review (a strategic assessment) planned for late November 2020.

Reverse takeovers and continuity rules
======================================

2006 amendment to the concessionary continuity rules which apply to carrying forward losses and imputation credits following a change in a company's shareholding.

### Sections OB 1 and OD 5AA, 1994 and 2004 Income Tax Acts

The concessionary continuity rules, which apply to carrying forward losses and imputation credits when there is a change in a company's shareholding, have been extended to recognise that continuity can be maintained through reverse takeovers or mergers. The new rules apply when both companies involved in the takeover or merger are widely held or listed companies.

### Background

Normally a company must have a continuity of shareholding of 49% to enable it to carry forward its tax losses for New Zealand income tax purposes. In relation to imputation credits, the required continuity percentage is 66%. These continuity rules are premised on tracing shareholding through groups of companies back to noncorporate shareholders. Concessionary rules allow for the fact that this is not practical in a number of circumstances.

Under the previous concessionary continuity rules, there was no provision to carry forward tax losses when a smaller, widely held listed company took over or merged with a larger one. However, conceptually, the takeover or merger itself should not have caused a breach of the continuity rules resulting in the forfeiture of tax losses or imputation credits when the continuity of shareholding thresholds of at least 49% or 66% was satisfied.

### Key features

A new section OD 5AA has been inserted into the 1994 and 2004 Income Tax Acts to provide a new ownership tracing rule for reverse takeovers. The new rule will apply to a "changeover" in a limited attribution company (the initial parent) which is treated as holding ownership interests in another company (the subsidiary). A "changeover" can be a change in ownership, or a situation where the initial parent ceases to exist because of an amalgamation.

Continuity will not be lost if:

*   immediately before the changeover the initial parent is treated as holding all the ownership interests in the subsidiary; and
*   immediately after the changeover another limited attribution company (the new parent) is treated as holding all the ownership interests in the subsidiary; and
*   before and after the changeover, each shareholder in the initial parent owns shares in the new parent in the same proportion to other shareholders in the initial parent (ignoring other interests in the new parent the shareholder might have); and
*   there is commonality (49% of the carry forward of losses, or 66% for the carry forward of imputation and dividend withholding payment credits) in:
    *   the ownership interests in the initial company that are treated as being held by the initial shareholders immediately before the changeover; and
    *   the ownership interests in the new parent that are treated as being held by the initial shareholders immediately after the changeover.

"Limited attribution company" is defined in section OB 1 and is a:

1.  building society
2.  cooperative company
3.  listed company
4.  widely held company
5.  foreign company that is not a closely held company.

### Application date

The new rule applies for changes in ownership occurring in the 1998-99 or a subsequent income year, if the company files a tax return on the basis that the requirements of a continuity provision are satisfied in relation to the change of ownership. More generally it applies from 3 April 2006, the date of assent of the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006.

Reverse takeovers
=================

2006 amendment to the concessionary continuity rules relating to reverse takeovers or mergers.

##### Section OD 5AA of the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 2004

Concessionary continuity rules, which apply to carrying forward losses and imputation credits when there is a change in a company's shareholding, were extended to recognise that continuity can be maintained through reverse takeovers or mergers by the introduction of section OD 5AA by the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. That section has been amended because it did not produce the correct result where:

*   treasury stock or cross-shareholdings are cancelled without consideration upon the takeover; or
*   the subsidiary of the initial parent is also a limited attribution company.

Paragraphs (e) and (f) of section OD 5AA(2) have been amended to correct the position, effective from the original application date of the 1998-99 income year.

Background In the course of its work, Inland Revenue is required to contact customers for a variety of reasons which supports the integrity of the tax system. Under the Tax Administration Act the Commissioner is charged with the care and management of the tax system and in particular, the Commissioner is required to have regard to the importance of promoting compliance including voluntary compliance. To support this, Inland Revenue undertakes a wide range of marketing activities helping customers know about available support, new products or when they may have a return or debt due. This helps to ensure as many taxpayers as possible can meet their obligations or claim their entitlements. Inland Revenue uses a variety of channels for marketing including billboards, digital advertising, videos, radio and social media. In an increasingly digital world, social media has grown in relevance as a major advertising channel. Inland Revenue has been actively using social media channels for targeted and non-targeted advertising, including custom audience lists, for over ten years. It has been an effective way to help customers meet their obligations and access their entitlements. Advertising campaigns on social media are mostly carried out through Meta (specifically Facebook), Google (including YouTube) and LinkedIn (Inland Revenue has two LinkedIn accounts – one for Tax Professionals, the other general Inland Revenue followers). Campaigns can also be managed by an external advertising agency. Inland Revenue opened its first social media account in 2013, and first trialled targeted social media advertising using custom audience lists in 2014. These are lists of specific customers for who the information Inland Revenue wants to share is relevant, for example they may have entitlements they can access or debt they need to pay. Custom audience lists include a range of data that will help identify those relevant people that may have an account with the social media platform – for example first name, last name, date of birth and email. However, the specific information on each list will depend on the platform and how best to target advertisements to individuals using the platform. No financial or tax specific information is used. The typical process for sharing custom audience lists with platforms is for the list to be securely uploaded and stored by the platform after a procedure called hashing takes place, which deidentifies customer information. This means an individual is not able to be identified by the platform from the hashed data. The platform then carries out matching against its own data which is also in hashed form. This is carried out in an automated process within the platform. The matched data becomes the audience lists which the advertising will reach. Context for the review On Monday 9 September 2024, RNZ published an article about Inland Revenue’s use of taxpayer information for targeted advertising on social media platforms. This generated public concern and media attention about the privacy practices Inland Revenue uses to generate custom audience lists and share them for targeted social media advertising. Coverage was specifically on the use of deidentification tools (called hashing) and the implications of this for protecting customers’ personal information. Page 5 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Concerns fell into three main categories: 1. Taxpayers are required to provide personal data for tax and social administration purposes and were concerned that they had no control over how their information might be used. 2. Taxpayers being unable to opt out of having their details provided to social media companies. 3. The security controls used (hashing) do not sufficiently de-identify people. This concern was highlighted by reference to a press release from the United States Federal Commission and European Regulators, sharing this concern. Review topic and scope In response to public concerns, Inland Revenue paused all social media advertising use of custom audience lists and undertook an internal review to consider whether any of the concerns were valid and to ensure that practices used are compliant with the Privacy Act. The review set out to understand: • whether Inland Revenue’s use of custom audience lists for targeted advertising complies with the Privacy Act 2020. • the process for providing custom audience lists to social media platforms. • data security and retention in the platforms. • whether social media platforms used data from custom audience lists to enhance their own user profiles. Key findings The key findings of the review are as follows: Use of custom audience lists and privacy The Privacy Act describes personal information as information about an identifiable individual. When hashed data is uploaded to the platforms it is not considered personal information. This is because it is in hashed form and does not identify anyone. In addition, the hashing of the data is one layer of security, and the data is uploaded into a secure platform where it is matched with the platform's hashed data in an automated, machine-to-machine process. The data is deleted after the matching process is completed and not used in any other way by the platforms. Inland Revenue’s Privacy Policy notifies people that we will use email addresses and mobile phone numbers to send customers reminders about their tax affairs, and we send hashed information to third parties. The custom audience list information provided is deleted by the platform after a period of time (which varies depending on the platform). In 2016 Inland Revenue completed a privacy impact assessment regarding the use of custom audience lists on Facebook. The privacy impact for the project was assessed as Medium; several privacy risks were identified but could be adequately mitigated. This assessment was updated in 2024 and the privacy impact of using custom audience lists remains the same. Page 6 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Providing custom audience lists to social media platforms The information provided to the platforms is securely uploaded through an Inland Revenue browser. Where data is hashed, this is automatically performed using an algorithm within the browser of the Inland Revenue device uploading the custom audience list. Both the hashing algorithm and transmission are compliant with NZISM specifications. All data is securely stored on the platform. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner is assessing whether or not Inland Revenue had the appropriate safeguards in place to minimise the privacy risk of the use of the hashing technology as an information sharing tool. Data security and retention Inland Revenue requested security assurance reports from the social media platforms used for targeted advertising with custom audience lists. It is satisfied that the information received shows appropriate standards e.g. international standards and the New Zealand Information Security Manual (NZISM), for managing information security were met. Social media platforms using data from custom audience lists for their own purposes The social media platforms indicated that custom audience list information is not used to enhance or build profiles of their users. This means that any data that has not been provided to the platforms directly from individuals is not retained or used by the platforms in the future. Outcome Having undertaken the review, we believe that the process taken in using custom audience lists in targeted social media marketing is recognised as legitimate both in New Zealand and internationally. There continues to be ongoing public concerns about the practice of using custom audience lists for social media advertising. We recognise the importance of building and maintaining public trust as a cornerstone of an effective tax and social policy system. For these reasons, Inland Revenue will be ceasing the use of custom audience lists for the foreseeable future. The review has highlighted issues can arise when sharing information with a third party. It is essential that information sharing with any external party, when there is a need for troubleshooting, must be performed securely. Any attachments or other forms of data upload must be encrypted prior to leaving Inland Revenue’s network. Once the troubleshooting process is completed, it should be ensured the suppliers remove or delete the information. This should be documented as part of the standard operation procedures. Recommendations It is recommended to set review dates for Privacy Impact Assessment’s (PIA) to see if anything has changed over time. This includes whether Inland Revenue still has the same view of the activity being undertaken and if the privacy impact rating is still the same. It is recommended that Inland Revenue undertake a full review of the use of social media for marketing and advertising purposes including the use of specific capabilities and products as well as the information sharing required to enable them. Page 7 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] It is recommended that, in the event Inland Revenue determines that social media marketing or advertising capabilities which target individuals is required, the appropriateness of the implementation of an opt in/opt out process within the core tax system is considered. Unintended Disclosures During the course of review two unintended disclosures were identified. Unintended disclosure - LinkedIn The review identified that there was an exception with some data provided to LinkedIn, where not all uploaded data was hashed. In addition to hashed email address, first name, last name and country was uploaded to the LinkedIn secure platform without being hashed. Company information was also provided. This was uploaded within the secure LinkedIn platform to be matched in an automated process. While this data was uploaded to be matched in a machine-to-machine environment and there was no human interaction, disclosing a person’s name (regardless of how it is processed) to LinkedIn does not comply with the Privacy Act. This is not a notifiable privacy breach as the information disclosed was minor (name and country), not sensitive and not likely to be misused and is not likely to cause serious harm to affected individuals. It does not need to be reported to the Privacy Commissioner or affected individuals. However, Inland Revenue notified the Privacy Commissioner of this disclosure when it was discovered during the review. Unintended disclosure – Meta It was identified that there was one instance of an unhashed custom audience list being shared with Meta support. This took place in early 2024 when Meta experienced problems with matching an uploaded hashed custom audience list, containing the data of 268,000 customers. A Meta support person requested a raw (unhashed) file to try and solve the issue. They were provided with this file to try and solve the issues relating to matching the data. Meta confirmed that the file would have been deleted once the issue was resolved. The file was viewed by Meta support for the purposes of trouble shooting, however sharing this file via email was not part of the approved approach for custom audience lists. This is considered a non-notifiable privacy breach due to no serious harm has or is likely to occur as a result of the list being shared with a Meta support person. Although the breach is not notifiable, when this activity was discovered, Inland Revenue contacted the Office of the Privacy Commissioner to let them know that this unapproved sharing of personal information had occurred. Inland Revenue has chosen to contact everyone who was included in the custom audience list for transparency and to rebuild trust. Recommendations The review recommends an internal assurance process be undertaken by Inland Revenue to understand how these breaches happened. Page 8 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Event Timeline Page 9 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 1.0 Overview This section outlines the public concerns that prompted an internal review and the scope of the review. What Happened? On Monday 9 September 2024, RNZ published an article about Inland Revenue’s use of taxpayer information for targeted advertising on social media platforms. This generated public concern and media attention about the privacy practices Inland Revenue uses to generate custom audience lists and share them for targeted social media advertising. Coverage was specifically on the use of deidentification tools (called hashing) and the implications of this for protecting customers’ personal information. Concerns fell into three main categories: 1. Taxpayers are required to provide personal data for tax and social administration purposes and were concerned that they had no control over how their information might be used. 2. Taxpayers being unable to opt out of having their details provided to social media companies. 3. The security controls used (hashing) do not sufficiently de-identify people. This concern was supported by reference to a press release from the United States Federal Commission and European Regulators, sharing this concern. Since the article was released there has been ongoing media interest, as well as public interest. Inland Revenue has received more than 8,000 Privacy Act requests from individuals seeking to understand if they have been included within the data shared to social media platforms. In addition, 23 OIA requests for information about custom audience lists have been received. In response to public concerns, Inland Revenue paused all social media advertising using custom audience lists and undertook a review. 1.1 Scope of the review This review sets out to understand: • whether Inland Revenue’s use of custom audience lists for targeted advertising complies with the Privacy Act 2020. • how Inland Revenue provides custom audience lists to social media platforms. • data security and retention in the platforms. • whether social media platforms are using data from custom audience lists for their own purposes. In order to address these areas, it is important to understand why custom audience lists are used and how the data is shared from Inland Revenue to social media platforms and in what form. Page 10 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 2.0 Understanding the use of custom audiences lists for social media advertising This section outlines why custom audience lists have been used at Inland Revenue for targeted advertising on social media platforms and the role of hashing in uploading these lists. 2.1 Overview In the course of its work, Inland Revenue is required to contact customers for a variety of reasons which supports the integrity of the tax system. Under the Tax Administration Act the Commissioner is charged with the care and management of the tax system and in particular, the Commissioner is required to have regard to the importance of promoting compliance including voluntary compliance. To support this, Inland Revenue undertakes a wide range of marketing activities helping customers know about available support, new products or when they may have a return or debt due. This helps to ensure as many taxpayers as possible can meet their obligations or claim their entitlements. Inland Revenue uses a variety of channels for marketing including billboards, digital advertising, videos, radio and social media. In an increasingly digital world, social media has grown in relevance as a major advertising channel. Inland Revenue has been actively using social media channels for targeted and non-targeted advertising, including custom audience lists, for over ten years. It has been an effective way to help customers meet their obligations and access their entitlements. Inland Revenue opened its first social media account in 2013, and first trialled targeted social media advertising using custom audience lists in 2014. This was performed with the support of a New Zealand based marketing agency. Advertising campaigns using custom audience lists are carried out by the marketing team directly through the following platforms: • Meta (specifically Facebook), • Google (including YouTube), • and LinkedIn (Inland Revenue has two LinkedIn accounts, one for Tax Professionals, the other for general Inland Revenue followers). The adverts are relevant to the target audience in terms of the subject matter (e.g. student loans, tax refunds) and are general reminders about things like payments. They do not, for example, specify that someone has a student loan. Inland Revenue also runs campaigns through external advertising agencies. The external agencies are not involved in all campaigns. Their role includes for example, setting up the advertising campaign, designing posts and linking these to matched audience lists (not the unhashed custom audience list information) that Inland Revenue has set up. This approach is typically used for larger campaigns that use a range of channels to reach customers. The process of how this information is shared with them can be seen in Section 6.0 Information Security Review, Sharing with Inland Revenue Advertiser. 2.2 What are custom audience lists? Custom audience lists are used in targeted advertising to improve accuracy of reaching the appropriate audiences with the relevant advertisements. Custom audience lists include a range of data that will help identify those relevant people – for example first name, last name, email and date of birth (however these values depend on the platform and how Page 11 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Inland Revenue use it). No financial or tax information about these individuals is used in creating custom audience lists. These lists are uploaded to the platform after a procedure called hashing, which means that an individual is not able to be identified from it. This data is then matched with data the platform holds. Further details about how the matching process is performed, the data included, and data security applied is outlined below in the report. There are two scenarios where custom audience lists are created for advertising campaigns at Inland Revenue: 1. Monthly advertising for reoccurring activity (e.g. Student Loan campaigns, GST customers, Working for Families): • The Centre of Enterprise Data and Analytics (CEDA) team provide the file outlining the target audience monthly. There are a range of user segments covered to target the different campaign audiences. • These occur monthly as the audience experiences lots of change (e.g. have overdue debt, moving overseas, self-employed). 2. Direct advertising campaign: • These are for advertising which are one off, or non-consistent campaigns (e.g. Brightline property tax rule). • The Compliance Strategy and Innovation (CSI) and CEDA teams are involved in extracting the custom audience lists that will be used to establish target audiences. The methodology for these targeted advertising campaigns differs depending on the platform being used, and whether the content is targeting individuals or businesses. 2.3 Uploading data - what does ‘hashed data/hashing’ mean? When information is uploaded to social media platforms it goes through a process called hashing, which de-identifies the data. It is important to understand the hashing process to assess whether sharing information in this way for advertising purposes breaches privacy. The process and requirements are set up by the platform and anyone using this form of targeted advertising agrees to the process. It is up to each organisation to assess the suitability of the process. 2.4 How hashing is used in custom audience lists A targeted advertising campaign is a marketing strategy to display adverts to a specific group of people. A set of information is required before any agency can pinpoint this specific group e.g. demographic, geographic, and interests. Inland Revenue may provide information such as first name, surname, date of birth, email address, phone number, city, postal code and country to our advertising platforms. This information is hashed locally within an Inland Revenue managed internet browser, before being sent to the platforms through a secured channel. Respective platforms will then match it with their internal database, to create a custom audience list. The uploaded hashed data from Inland Revenue gets deleted once this process is complete. Any unmatched data is also deleted. Page 12 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 2.5 Conclusions Inland Revenue has been actively using social media channels for targeted and non- targeted advertising for over ten years. Targeted advertising on social media platforms is carried out by using custom audience lists to improve accuracy of reaching the appropriate audiences with the relevant advertisements. These lists include a range of data that will help identify those relevant people – for example first name, last name, email and date of birth. This information is hashed locally within an Inland Revenue managed internet browser, before being sent to the platforms through a secured channel. The Privacy Act describes personal information as information about an identifiable individual. When hashed data is uploaded to the platforms it is not considered personal information. 3.0 Hashing This section outlines in detail the process of hashing to de-identify personal information and known risks and controversies. 3.1 Overview Hashing is a process of scrambling raw data into a fixed-size string of seemingly random characters – called a hash. Key characteristics of hashing include: • Consistent – Hashing the same data with the same hashing algorithm will produce the same output, regardless of who performed the hashing. • Fixed output length – Regardless of input size, the output is always the same fixed length to enable effective storage. • Fast – Hash function is quick. • Collision resistance – The more advanced the algorithm, the less likely to find two inputs that produce the same hash output. • Basically irreversible – Modern hashing algorithms (SHA-256) are essentially irreversible with existing technology. This may change in the future with the emergence of quantum computing. 3.2 Common Use Cases Hashing is used for a range of use cases and key examples include: • Password storage: Passwords are commonly stored as hashed. During authentication, the user input password is hashed and matched against the stored hash. Usually incorporated with salt technique (explained below) to mitigate a rainbow attack, making it more secured. • Data integrity: Hashes can be used to validate the file integrity; a user can compare a downloaded file’s hash with the original source hash. • Digital signatures: digital signatures leverage hashing to verify data integrity during transit. Messages are encrypted, then hashed, and both the encrypted message and the hash are sent to the destination. The encrypted message is then rehashed and then compared to the original hash to validate the integrity of the message. Page 13 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3.3 Hashing Algorithms Commonly used hash algorithms (set of rules) include but are not limited to – MD5, SHA1, SHA2 (SHA-256,384,512), and SHA-3. Each of the algorithms carries different levels of complexity and security level. In the context of social media usage, the platforms used by Inland Revenue implement the SHA-256 hashing algorithm for custom audience list hashing. SHA-256 is an approved cryptographic algorithm (as defined in the NZ Information Security Manual (NZISM) v3.8) for hashing purposes on information classified In Confidence and below. The NZISM is the New Zealand Government's manual on information assurance and systems security. It is designed to meet the needs of agency information security executives as well as vendors, contractors and consultants who provide services to agencies. Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) sets the standards and guidance that agencies are then required to consider as part of their risk management processes. Government agencies are to assess the security risks and implement the security controls relevant to their environment. With the current technology and computation process capability, to reverse the hash, it would take multiple lifetimes of a person to try all the possible combinations for SHA256 (2 256 ). This may change with the emerging quantum computers as they may have the potential to break many of the current cryptographic systems. As of now, SHA-256 remains secure against quantum attacks. 3.4 Illustration of Hashing 3.5 Encoding and Hashing The fact the same input always generates the same hash output is true only when the same character encoding is used. Character encoding is like assigning a letter or symbol a special number, so a computer can interpret and remember it. For example, a computer may see the character “A” as number 65, “B” as 66. The numbers assigned can be different depending on the encoding used. Commonly used encodings are ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16, and ISO-8859. Different encodings are used to address different requirements e.g. ASCII were designed to be compact hence used in the early computers with limited memory. Input (Plaintext) John Doe SHA256 hash function Output (Hash) 6CEA57C2FB6CBC2A40411135005760F241FFFC3E 5E67AB99882726431037F908 Page 14 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The differences of how encoding affects the output is shown below: This shows that using different encodings creates different results and combinations, which makes it more challenging for a rainbow attack to be successful (see below for explanation on rainbow attacks). 3.6 Known Risks and Controversies Hashing does not anonymise data It is possible to reverse-engineer or brute-force hashes under certain conditions, especially if the input (names, email addresses) is short or from a limited set. Hashing is not immune to a rainbow table attack. In a rainbow table attack, the attacker uses a pre- computed table of hashes to look up the plaintext version of a hashed info. This means that if there is a match spotted between the pre-prepared table of hashes and something in the hashed data, then it would be possible to recognise the plain text version of the hashed data. See below for a simplified rainbow attack illustration: A malicious actor identifies Aaron is in the compromised list by finding a match between the pre-prepared table and the hashed list. Compromised Data First name (hashed) 39fdbdb8ddf75a006ffec2a3ba95c3a04ce5517c608a786ef9a042af9843bd8c 300648cea31d54fdec1ce29f8771bcae5107e97e6a9d3b98567a28cf85306b64 7e8c729e4e4ecc320cb411c4d1419bf5fbad733212d4e9491b7630aaef0b8b1c 458556af7d03d652f06f2fc28727390e6860989a70246cbb93699995f1766798 Rainbow Table (common First Name) First name Hash Aaron 39fdbdb8ddf75a006ffec2a3ba95c3a04ce5517c608a786ef9a042af9843bd8c Adam f7f376a1fcd0d0e11a10ed1b6577c99784d3a6bbe669b1d13fae43eb64634f6e Alex 4135aa9dc1b842a653dea846903ddb95bfb8c5a10c504a7fa16e10bc31d1fdf0 Ben 6900dfb584a9e7b72109b1b72518ff62af7a81b7b5a74066a56e5edba6dcf973 Input (UTF8) John Doe SHA256 hash function Output (Hash) 6cea57c2fb6cbc2a40411135005760f241fffc3e5e6 7ab99882726431037f908 Input (UTF16) John Doe SHA256 hash function Output (Hash) b3dc648ab2c85949b6cf55de19ff79ee8d85b0315 c4350f28c1ea6a0eb6fb28a Page 15 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Re-identification risk A malicious actor with access to a large dataset or matching inputs (like names and email addresses) could match the hashed values to real-world identities. For instance, if the same hash appears in different datasets, they can cross-reference and de-anonymise individuals by correlating the data. The rainbow table illustration above is applicable here as well. Lack of salting Salting is a technique used to further anonymise data during the hashing process. Random data is added to the information to be hashed. This provides increased protection against rainbow table lookups. SHA256 itself does not include any mechanism for salting. Without this technique, identical inputs will always produce identical hashes, making the system vulnerable to attacks like rainbow tables or hash collisions across systems. Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) A MITM attack allows a malicious actor to intercept communication between a client and server (in this context: Inland Revenue and advertising platform). There are a few methods a malicious actor could use to execute this attack: 1. Intercept – Reads all data being transmitted e.g. Attacker sits on the same Wi-Fi network and captures the data using tools like Wireshark (packet sniffing tool). 2. DNS spoofing – Attacker can spoof DNS responses and redirect a user to malicious websites, in this context they pretend to be a social media platform and receive the customer lists. 3. Man-in-the-the-browser attack – variant for MITM, attacks and modifies a website and injects a malicious script, then harvests the uploaded data. 3.7 Reducing risks associated with hashing For any form of hashing attack, the data itself must first be accessed. Accessing hashed data is challenging given the layers of security that are part of uploading and storing hashed data within the platforms that use it. The risks are reduced significantly by transmitting the data through an encrypted channel like Transport Layer Security (TLS). This can be observed by the HTTPS URL prefix at the internet browser address bar. By encrypting the data, even if an attacker intercepts the data, they cannot read it without the keys used for encryption – these keys are exchanged securely during a secure handshake process. This process ensures both parties use the same method of communication e.g. algorithms and ways to authenticate each other. If the handshake fails, the connection is terminated preventing any insecure communication. 3.8 Published information about hashing usage and risks In the media articles, two sources were referenced which discussed the risks of using hashing to anonymise personal information. These are considered below: Page 16 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Article 1: Introduction to the Hash Function as a Personal Data Pseudonymisation Technique (EDPS) Context This is a paper written by the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) in 2019 - highlighting hash re-identification. This provided a view of key concerns around using hashing for data anonymisation, and techniques to protect against re-identification risks. Risk 1, Speed to de-anonymise hashed data The paper visualised this risk through a scenario on linking a seemingly anonymised hash value back to a potential 20 million phone numbers within 20 seconds (1 million hashes generated per second). To replay this scenario in New Zealand, there is approximately 5.8 million mobile phone connections and it would only take ~6 seconds to turn those phone numbers into hashes. The more attributes (names, email, phone numbers) a malicious actor has access to, the easier it is to relink the hash back to a person. Relevance to Inland Revenue Multiple attributes are used for the custom audience list; the process to match the hash back to a person takes extra effort, but not impossible. The re-identification risk remains. Risk 2, Strength of algorithm used From the same paper, it mentioned the older MD5 and SHA-1 algorithm should not be used as they have known vulnerabilities like collisions attack. Instead, cryptographically resistant hash functions should be used, including SHA-2 and SHA-3. Relevance to Inland Revenue Inland Revenue uses SHA-2 (SHA-256) for this custom audience list function SHA-256 is an approved cryptographic algorithm (as defined in the NZ Information Security Manual (NZISM) v3.8) for hashing purposes on information classified In Confidence and below. Techniques to protect against reidentification Several techniques were mentioned in the paper to hinder or reduce the re-identification risks, including encrypt before hash, various salt models (increases randomisation of the hash), and differential models. Relevance to Inland Revenue In this context for Inland Revenue, none of the techniques can be used as the social media platforms only accept hashes without the above additional security techniques. Article 2: No, hashing still doesn't make your data anonymous (FTC) Context This blog from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) highlights hashing does not anonymise data. While it transforms data into a seemingly anonymous string, hashes can still be reverse engineered (this is demonstrated through the rainbow table attack shown above). Hashes alone do not offer true privacy protection as attackers can exploit predictable data like email addresses. Page 17 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The FTC concludes that to truly protect privacy, additional measures such as salting and other security techniques should complement hashing. Simply hashing sensitive data is insufficient to prevent re-identification, particularly when the inputs are known or guessable. Relevance to Inland Revenue This blog highlights while hashing can de-identify data, hashes can be re-identified without additional security techniques. In Inland Revenue’s case we are limited by the processes around hashing provided by the social media platforms, which do not provide salting capabilities (for example). However, there are additional security controls around the use of custom audience lists including uploading data through encrypted channels which significantly reduces the likelihood of data being accessed, even if it were to be intercepted. 3.9 Conclusions Hashing is a commonly used way of sharing de-identified data. In the context of social media usage, the platforms used by Inland Revenue implement the SHA-256 hashing algorithm for custom audience list hashing. This meets the standards and guidance set by Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB). As of now, SHA-256 remains secure against quantum attacks. While it is possible to apply a rainbow attack to hashed data under certain limited conditions, the hashed data must first be accessed. The additional layers of security provided, in addition to hashing, by transmitting data through encrypted channels, means the data is safe and not at risk from such attacks. Inland Revenue uploads hashed data with additional transport layer security using recognised encryption channels and there is no evidence that this process has ever been compromised. Additionally, the data is uploaded in a process that connects machine to machine with no human intervention. 4.0 Process Flow – How targeted social media advertising happens This section shows process flows to show how targeted social media advertising is performed at Inland Revenue for each social media platform used, where the data goes and what form it is in during different stages. 4.1 Process flows The following processes are built and maintained by the respective social media platform. In this situation, Inland Revenue is a user and not able to define any specific requirements. Hashing and these data related controls are system security controls – which means these are automated processes where human intervention is not required and information is not disclosed or viewed by a human. Page 18 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4.2 Meta 4.3 LinkedIn Page 19 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4.4 Google 5.0 Additional Security Controls This section outlines the security controls that apply to data when it is uploaded to social media platforms. 5.1 Overview Hashing is primarily used for de-identification and should be used in conjunction with wider controls available to ensure data security. Hashing and these data related controls are system security controls – which means these are automated processes where human intervention is not required and information is not disclosed nor viewed by a human. When determining the security/safety of this data when uploaded to the social media platform we have looked at: • Is the data stored safely (i.e. is the platform secure?)? o This information is provided through security assurance reports provided by the platforms (seen in Section 7.0. Assurance from Supplier Platforms) • Is the data secure in transit (when moving from an Inland Revenue machine to the platform?)? o Data transmission between Inland Revenue devices (client) and social media platforms (server) happens through a secured channel with Transport Layer Security (TLS). It encrypts data that is transmitted across the web. This means that anyone who tries to intercept this data will only see a garbled mix of characters that cannot be read without the keys used for encryption • Is the data retention appropriate? o Data retention for the custom audience list (CSV) that is uploaded depends per platform: Page 20 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] ▪ Meta: “promptly delete customer list after the match process is completed” ▪ Google: Will not retain custom list for any longer than necessary once the matching processes are completed. ▪ LinkedIn: The customer audience list will be automatically deleted after 28 days of upload. This information is included within Section 6.0. Information Security Review, Data Retention. • Is the data used only for its intended purpose, and not used to build/enhance user profiles? o All platforms have attested to not using the data provided to build new profiles, or append existing profiles. This information is included within Section 6.0. Information Security Review, User Profile Enhancing. 5.2 Conclusions The additional security controls outlined, together with the processes being automated where human intervention is not required and information is not disclosed nor viewed by a human, gives Inland Revenue confidence that adequate security controls are in place. 6.0 Information Security Review The table below outlines the data provided, login process, data security, retention, sharing with Inland Revenue Advertiser, User Profile Enhancing and Second Order Information Assumptions for each platform.

Page 21 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Meta (Facebook) Google LinkedIn Individual Individual Individual Company ▪ Mobile Advertiser ID (Madid) (hashing not required) ▪ Facebook App User ID (UID) (hashing not required) ▪ Facebook Page User ID (PageUID) (hashing not required) ▪ State/Province ▪ Gender ▪ Value ▪ Job Title ▪ Employee Company ▪ Googleaid ▪ Googleuid ▪ Appleidfa All these fields are in plaintext ▪ Company Website ▪ LinkedIn Company Page URL ▪ Stock Symbol ▪ Industry ▪ State ▪ Company Code All these fields are in plaintext Data Security The customer list (provided as CSV) is hashed using SHA-256 within the internet browser automatically (on the Inland Revenue device), then this hashed information is uploaded and stored within the platform. This information is hashed individually (e.g. each piece of data provided about an entity is hashed, instead of all data per entity being hashed at once). Inland Revenue staff cannot access the plaintext or hashes within the platform. The customer list (provided as CSV) is hashed using SHA-256 within the internet browser automatically (on the Inland Revenue device). Hashing is performed on both individual attributes (name, email, phone number) and combined attributes (e.g. mailing address which is a combination or countries and zip codes, and names). This hashed information is uploaded and stored within the platform. Inland Revenue staff cannot access the plaintext or hashes within the platform. Emails within the customer list (provided as CSV) are hashed within the internet browser automatically (on the Inland Revenue device) using SHA- 256. The other values provided (first name, last name and country) are not hashed. The CSV is then uploaded and stored within the LinkedIn data centre. Inland Revenue staff cannot access the plaintext or hashes within the platform. The customer list (provided as CSV) is uploaded into the Inland Revenue internet browser and NOT hashed. This information is stored within the LinkedIn data centre. This information remains visible to Inland Revenue staff with access to the Inland Revenue LinkedIn tenant. This data will stop being visible within the solution after 90 days of inactivity with the company list. Data in transit security: The transmission of the hashed CSV file from Inland Revenue device to the respective social media platforms (server) happens through a secured channel with Transport Layer Security (TLS). It encrypts data that is transmitted across the web. This means that anyone who tries to intercept this data will only see a garbled mix of characters that is nearly impossible to decrypt. This internet browser also authenticates the identity of the websites through SSL certificate and prompts the user if it is a fraudulent website. Page 22 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Meta (Facebook) Google LinkedIn Individual Individual Individual Company Data Retention Meta says they “promptly delete customer list after the match process is completed” – this is regardless of if the hashed customer information is matched or not. Google says they will not retain customer list for any longer than necessary once the matching processes are completed, Google promptly delete the data files IR uploaded via the internet browser. The matched lists are removed following a campaign’s completion. LinkedIn says that the customer list will automatically be stored for 28 days and deleted. The matched list created based on the custom list will be stored for 90 days and deleted, if it is not edited or being used in any active campaign. The customer list is stored for 28 days and deleted. The company list is the only thing that remains, which is deleted after 2 years. However, this cannot be used for targeting after deletion. Company list data is no longer visible after 90 days of inactivity Log on Process Inland Revenue staff log on to Meta through their personal user accounts (which are expected to have MFA enabled). From here they can access the Inland Revenue Meta Business Suite and perform updates. The Inland Revenue marketing team to log on to our advertising agencies Inland Revenue specific workspace. Password is shared in plaintext, MFA is enabled - registered MFA device is held by Inland Revenue staff. Inland Revenue staff log on to LinkedIn through their personal user accounts (which are expected to have MFA enabled). From here they can access the Inland Revenue LinkedIn and perform updates. Sharing with IR Advertiser When in the Inland Revenue portal, once de-identified matched lists are uploaded these can be shared with IR’s advertising companies as required. The list within the portal is shared through the portal to the advertising agency. The advertising agency will have their own portal. As Google does not support matched list sharing, a shared account is used between the advertising agencies and Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue staff upload the custom lists into the shared tenant and do not share the plaintext CSV with third party advertising partners. When in the Inland Revenue portal, once matched lists are uploaded these can be shared with IR’s advertising companies as required. The list is shared through the portal to the advertising agency. The advertising agency will have their own portal. Note: Inland Revenue has no recorded examples of where company lists have been shared with an advertising agency. If this was shared with an advertising agency, they would be able to see the plaintext information for company lists. User Profile Enhancing Meta will not use the data to build or append interest-based profile Google will not use the data files to build or enhance customer profiles. LinkedIn will not modify, reverse engineer, decompile, create other works from, or disassemble any Confidential information. LinkedIn does not profile non-members, and we also do not create or enhance behavioural profiles of members with off-LinkedIn data. Page 23 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Meta (Facebook) Google LinkedIn Individual Individual Individual Company Second Order Information Assumptions Interaction between a user and a targeted advertisement generates statistics to measure how effective a campaign is, this includes: impressions, reach, frequency, link clicks, click through rate, cost per click, reactions, shares. These are accessible by Inland Revenue. Aside from marketing related stats, each social media platform may be able to record all user’s activities/behaviour whenever they interact with the platform (regardless of whether a customer list campaign is used), including but not limited to Likes and Shares, mouse hover tracking, page/ad view duration, user device information (operating system, location, language, browser version), interests based on a user’s search query. Inland Revenue digital advertising includes a ‘call to action’ e.g. please visit this Inland Revenue webpage for more information on student loan repayment process. By interacting with the advertisement, it is possible for a social media platform to infer that a user may be interested in certain topics like student loan (this is different from User Profile Enhancing). However, simply clicking or viewing the ads will not give a social media platform conclusive data but rather increases the likelihood of a user being interested in a certain topic. 7.0 Assurance from Social Media Platforms Inland Revenue requested security assurance reports from the Social Media platforms used for targeted advertising with custom audience lists. 7.1 Assurance Information The assurance information provided, is detailed in the table below. Description of the different types of assurance requested are outlined below. Platform ISO27001 SOC2 Report Security Attestation Google Y Meta Y\* Y LinkedIn Y Y \*Meta policy assures relevant audit report such as SOC 2 Type II report is available upon request. Inland Revenue has made the request and is awaiting receipt of the report. ISO27001 Is an internationally recognised standard for managing information security. The standard outlines requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS) – the aim of which is to help organisations make the information assets they hold more secure. To receive the certification, an accredited certification body performs an audit against the ISO27001 areas for the relevant party. Once obtained, the certification is valid for 3 years with an annual surveillance audit process to maintain compliance. Page 24 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] System and Organisation Controls (SOC) Report Is produced through an independent audit of a company's information security systems. This includes the controls the organisation has in place to safeguard those systems, and the information stored, processed, and/or transmitted by them. It comprises five Trust Services Criteria: Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality and Privacy. There are two SOC reports an organisation can seek: • SOC 1 Reports – assurance on financial reporting and accuracy. • SOC 2 Reports – cloud and data centre security controls, this focuses on: Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality and Privacy. For both SOC reports, there are two types of reports: • Type I Report – performs point in time assessment of controls. • Type II Report – performs assessment of controls over a period of time. This includes testing of operational effectiveness over time. Only a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) or an organisation accredited by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) can conduct a SOC audit. These are generally performed on an annual basis, however they can be conducted more frequently. Security Attestation Inland Revenue received a copy of an assertion report prepared by PWC in 2013 for Facebook which assessed Facebook’s Custom Audiences security controls. The conclusion and the opinion over Facebook’s management assertion is fairly stated as below: • Information provided to Facebook is not shared with other advertisers and third parties. • Facebook implemented safeguards and controls against accidental or unauthorised access, use, alteration or disclosure of data. • Information provided by advertisers for Custom Audience list generation is only retained for as long as needed for matching process. Facebook disposes of the data once it’s no longer required. 8.0 Key findings The following section outlines the key findings from the review, in relation to what the review set out to understand: • whether Inland Revenue’s use of custom audience lists for targeted advertising complies with the Privacy Act 2020. • how Inland Revenue provides custom audience lists to social media platforms. • data security and retention in the platforms. • whether social media platforms used data from custom audience lists to enhance their own user profiles. Page 25 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 8.1 Use of custom audience lists and privacy In 2016 as part of usual due diligence when using customer information, Inland Revenue completed a privacy impact assessment regarding the use of custom audience lists on Facebook. A privacy assessment helps identify potential effects that a proposal may have on people and their information. The assessment considered how custom audiences worked, what personal information would be used, security and retention of that information. The privacy impact for the project was assessed as Medium; several privacy risks were identified but could be adequately mitigated. Privacy assessments were not done for Google or LinkedIn as the information, processes and terms and conditions were the same or similar to what was already assessed. Inland Revenue updated the privacy assessment into the use of custom audience lists, considering all platforms used, in 2024 following media commentary. The privacy impact remains rated at Medium. The Privacy Act describes personal information as information about an identifiable individual. When hashed data is uploaded to the platforms it is not considered personal information. This is because it is in hashed form and does not identify anyone. In addition, the hashing of the data is one layer of security and the data is uploaded into a secure platform where it is matched with the platform’s hashed data in an automated, machine-to-machine process. The data is deleted after the matching process is completed and not used in any other way by the platforms. Inland Revenue’s Privacy Policy notifies people how we use their information and that we send hashed information to third parties. To comply with other Privacy Act obligations, Inland Revenue informs customers how it uses information via its website. Inland Revenue’s Privacy Policy states that if a customer gives Inland Revenue their email address or mobile phone number, we may use these to send them reminders about their tax affairs or information about our products and services. Along with other information, the email address, and sometimes phone number, is used in compiling the custom audience list. The Policy also informs the public that Inland Revenue uses information to target advertising to them indirectly via a third party: Why you might see a certain advertisement on social media We may also use or disclose your information to third parties to assist us to communicate or market our services to you. To reach groups of people with information that is relevant to them while protecting their privacy, we sometimes provide hashed and fully anonymised information to social media channels when placing advertisements. In this process, your personal information is treated with the utmost integrity by us. The social media channel is not given any identifiable information. We fully comply with our obligations under the Tax Administration Act and the Privacy Act to protect your personal information. This statement, should it remain in the Privacy Policy, will be amended as hashed information is not anonymised but de-identified (pseudo-anonymised). The Privacy Act does not require an individual to consent to the use of their information. The Act is purpose-focused rather than consent-focused and allows personal information Page 26 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] collected for one purpose to be used for related purposes. Informing people of their tax obligations or entitlements is directly related to why Inland Revenue holds customer information. The source information used to collate a custom audience list is personal information for the purposes of the Privacy Act. ‘Personal information’ is defined as information about an identifiable individual. The source information is also sensitive revenue information (SRI) under the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). SRI is revenue information that identifies, or is reasonably capable of being used to identify, a person or entity, whether directly or indirectly. SRI is to be kept confidential under the TAA and not to be disclosed unless the disclosure is specifically permitted under the TAA. Inland Revenue takes its TAA obligations in relation to taxpayer confidentiality seriously and has internal processes for signing off the disclosure of information. Written approval has been located for each of the three platforms used but, given organisational and personnel changes over the last 10 years, there are gaps in timing for that documentation. However, we have been able to identify that certain campaigns in those time gaps involved someone with the delegated authority for disclosing the information and who was very familiar with IR’s confidentiality obligations 8.1.2 Historic use of custom audience lists on additional platforms In the course of the review, it was found that there had been historic use of custom audience lists for targeted adverts on TradeMe in 2017 as part of the Business Transformation Programme. There is no evidence that this platform has been used for targeted advertising with custom audience lists since this instance. 8.2 Providing custom audience lists to social media platforms In order to advertise with social media platforms, Inland Revenue is required to upload information in the way each platform requires. The information provided to the platforms is securely uploaded through an Inland Revenue browser. Where data is hashed, this is automatically performed using a standard algorithm within the browser of the Inland Revenue device uploading the custom audience list. Both the hashing algorithm and transmission are compliant with NZISM specifications. All data is securely stored on the platform. 8.3 Data security and retention Inland Revenue requested security assurance reports from the social media platforms used for targeted advertising with custom audience lists. After assessing these, Inland Revenue is satisfied that the information provided shows appropriate standards for managing information security, as there are no exceptions noted for the in-scope security controls. Page 27 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 8.4 Using data from custom audience lists to enhance their own user profiles The social media platforms indicated that custom audience list information is not used to enhance or build profiles of their own users. 8.5 Conclusions Having undertaken the review, we believe that the process taken in using custom audience lists in targeted social media marketing is recognised as legitimate both in New Zealand and internationally. However, there continues to be ongoing public concerns about the practice of using custom audience lists for social media advertising. Inland Revenue recognises the importance of building and maintaining public trust as a cornerstone of an effective tax and social policy system. The review has highlighted issues can arise when sharing information with a third party. It is essential that information sharing with any external party when there is a need for troubleshooting, must be performed securely. Attachment or data upload must be encrypted prior to leaving Inland Revenue’s network. Once the troubleshooting process is completed, ensure the suppliers remove or delete the information. This should be documented as part of the standard operation procedures. 8.6 Recommendations It is recommended in response to customer concerns that Inland Revenue cease the use of custom audience lists for the foreseeable future. It is recommended to set review dates for Privacy Impact Assessment’s (PIA) where relevant in the PIA register to see if anything has changed and if Inland Revenue still has the same view of the activity being undertaken and if the impact rating is still the same. It is recommended that Inland Revenue undertake a full review of the use of social media for marketing and advertising purposes including the use of specific capabilities and the information sharing required to enable them. It is recommended that, in the event Inland Revenue determines that social media marketing or advertising capabilities which target individuals is required, it considers the appropriateness of the implementation of a Opt in/Opt Out process within the core tax system. 9.0 Unintended disclosures During the course of review two unintended disclosures were identified. 9.1 LinkedIn During the review, it was identified that not all data being provided to LinkedIn through custom audience lists was hashed. Page 28 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] What happened? Inland Revenue has been using custom audience lists with email, first name, last name and country for LinkedIn targeted advertising since 2020. Before this, only emails were provided. Approval was sought to expand the custom audience lists to include first name, last name and country. Approval was given on the assumption that all data provided was hashed and no individual was identified. During this review it was identified that only emails within custom audience lists uploaded to LinkedIn are hashed. A timeline is shown below. Why is this a problem? The unhashed information provided to LinkedIn is both Personally Identifiable information and SRI. Providing this information unhashed does not align with the marketing guidelines or the approvals obtained. While this data was uploaded to be matched in a machine-to-machine environment, which does not enable LinkedIn to identify these customers, disclosing a person’s name does not comply with the Privacy Act, is not strictly necessary, and is considered a non-notifiable breach. A non-notifiable breach is a breach where no serious harm has or is likely to occur and does not need to be reported to the Privacy Commissioner or affected individuals. Page 29 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 9.2 Meta What happened? In the course of the review, it was identified that there was one instance of an unhashed custom audience list being shared with Meta support. In early 2024, Inland Revenue had an issue with the matching of a custom audience list in Meta. This issue saw a file with over 200,000 entries having an unexpectedly low match rate of under 1,000. Based on this, Inland Revenue started to perform troubleshooting internally and reached out to Meta for support. This activity can be found in the timeline below. Key information from this incident is: • Inland Revenue provided a cleartext CSV to Meta Support for troubleshooting purposes (following Meta’s request). This had 268,068 entries. Each entry included: phone number(s), first name, last name, city, country, zip code, date of birth, email(s), age, year of birth. • Sharing this file via email was not part of the approved approach for custom audience lists. • Inland Revenue performed its own troubleshooting and identified that the phone number field in this list was causing the issue. The phone number data was removed from the custom audience lists which resolved the issue. • Meta stated that data provided would be “automatically deleted after a period of time”. • When the CSV was provided to Meta support, they were told to dispose of the file once completing the investigation and inform Inland Revenue. Meta assured information used for the troubleshooting is kept confidential and secure and they do not retain any records of personal information. Page 30 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Timeline – Meta troubleshooting incident Page 31 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Why is this a problem? Sharing this file via email was not part of the approved approach for custom audience lists. This is not a notifiable privacy breach as it’s reasonable to believe sharing the list with a Meta support person has not caused, and is unlikely to cause, serious harm to affected individuals. Although the breach is not notifiable, when this activity was discovered, Inland Revenue contacted the Office of the Privacy Commissioner to let them know that this unapproved sharing of personal information had occurred. Inland Revenue has chosen to contact everyone who was included in the custom audience list for transparency and to rebuild trust. 9.3 Recommendation It is recommended an internal assurance process be undertaken by Inland Revenue to understand how this breach happened.

E.g. “John Doe” is an example of plaintext. Hashing Hashing is a process of scrambling raw data into a fixed-size string of seemingly random characters – called a hash. Rainbow table A rainbow table is a precomputed table for caching the outputs of a cryptographic hash function. SRI Sensitive Revenue Information Salting Salting is a technique used to further anonymise data during the hashing process. Random data is added to the information to be hashed. This provides increased protection against rainbow table lookups. Transport Layer Security (TLS) Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a secure lock that protects your data online. IT encrypts the info, ensure the user is interacting with the right website (authentication, and makes sure nothing gets changed (integrity).

According to a research report from Deloitte, there is a strong shift towards people-centric marketing and communication strategies. Public sector entities adopted commercial strategies such as integrating data and behavioral insights into their digital campaigns. Governments aim to influence behaviour, build trust, and support crucial initiatives like public health and economic recovery. UK government has increasingly turned to data-driven advertising, utilising social media and targeted adverts to engage specific demographic groups with tailored content. Targeted advertising campaigns have also been used to address various social and public health issues, uses a combination of PR, community engagement, and targeted multilingual digital ads to deter illegal migration and educate migrants about legal routes and the dangers of illegal crossing. Canada has a similar practice on using digital advertising to reach various demographic groups – Government of Canada Advertising for 2022-2023 shows 71% of their advertising budget is focused on digital media, including programmatic ads, social media, and search engine marketing. Adverts are aimed at informing citizens about government programmes, public health initiatives, and social services.

The new document is called “D4205 Data Retention Standard”. Key findings from this revision include: •The papers’ key goal is ensuring that IR is meeting the requirements for destruction and retention of data in t he “Inland Revenue Retention and Disposal Schedule”. •Having an automated method of processing data to apply retention and destruction rules. •Archiving system back-u ps enable recovery of lost data but aren’t the official archive. •Heritage application archive data to be moved to the ideal transition repository. Option list provided. •New systems and Heritage systems, that will endure after the BT Programme, need to provide a method to c omply with retention and disposal requirements; this is identified as a key risk. •Ensuring the future-s tate application meets the archive requirements. Conclusions for the Decom processes and its alignment with the strategy: •IR has been following the archiving strategies and progress is currently on track, working through the de commissioning and archiving of the 400-plus Heritage applications. •So far 90 applications have already been decommissioned. Of the 244 apps in scope up to Release 4, 187 are c ompleted. The Decom processes have been enhanced to check viability of what gets archived. •The BT Release 5-tim ed applications are starting their initial analysis. This will be dependant on the Enduring Application managing the disposal requirements. Recommendations: •Note the future apps not meeting the disposal risk identified from the revised Archive Strategy paper D4205. •Note the key IR future-s tate application owners are being followed up to define their archive capabilities as part of the D4205 Archive Strategy review. •Note the new D&A archive assessment governance processes to support the existing Design governance processes. •Note the 2019D 4205 Data Retention Standard is still to be formalised through the TDA governance prior to this document’s TDA discussions. 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] D4197 Review & Update Approach for Decom, Migrate & Archive Pathways Key D4205 Archive Strategy updates The key 2017 Archiving Strategy paper D2132 has been replaced by the 2019 “D4205 Data Retention Standard” paper. This was updated by the BT Release 4 Environments team. The key changesto the 2017 strategy include: •IR needs a data management approach that meets the following key objectives: •Reducing long term cost of storage infrastructure •Ensure that data growth is controlled so that databases remain manageable •Lowering the administrative burden of data management with automation •Meeting requirements for destruction and retention of data in the “Inland Revenue Retention a nd Disposal Schedule”. •Having an automated method of processing data to apply retention and destruction rules. •New systems and Heritage systems that will endure after the BT Programme should provide a me thod to comply with retention and disposal requirements in the primary online data set. •IR to consider if backups should be retained and excluded from retention rules as they are a point in tim e snapshot of the entire data set and will protect against unintentional data loss. •Older systems such as Heritage applications that are being replaced/retired by BT can be dealt with in several ways and will need to be evaluated individually for the most appropriate method based on each system. Refer to Appendix 1 for the approaches and the technology options and Appendix 2 for the example scenarios. •Further follow-up with the key future-state application (START, STAX, DIP and SharePoint) to clarify if they have the required archive rules and process embedded. 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] D4197 Review & Update Approach for Decom, Migrate & Archive Pathways Linking D4205 Archive Framework to the Decom & TDA design processes • Identify data functions (Dat a us e , Search access) • Identify interdependencies • Identify s takeholde rs (user access, frequency) • Identify data structures (Able to view as images, Need for code to interpret data for view) Identify • • • • Dat a C at eg or y • Data Class • Data Sub Class • Retention Period • Retention Approval • Disposal Approval Classify • • • • Disposal Schedule Gove rnance (PRA Executive Sponsor) • Decommissioning Asse ssment TLO Governance • TDA archive design governance Verify Archive P at tern an alys is (Database Archive, Application Image Archive, Data Extract & In Application Archiving) Application Affinity analysis Select target environment Confirm source and des tination sy stems Identify transfer pattern Determine extract and load rules Archive Pattern High Performance Storage (N SP/ Cloud) Low Performance Storage (N SP/ Cloud) Offline Storage Storage Pattern • • • • Request access to archive • Maintain Archive Accessibility & Readability Data Access • • • • Target system data life cycle management functionality setup • Deletion process & approvals embedded • Disposal process set-up. • Ensure archived data is read only and identifiable as archive data.

Revised IR10 financial statements summary
=========================================

Article on the revised IR10 financial statements summary which comes into effect from the 2012-13 income year.

The IR10 _Accounts information_ form has been through some significant changes. It’s now known as the IR10 _Financial statements summary_ and comes into effect from the 2012-13 income year.

### Background

The IR10 _Accounts information_ form was designed as a short form of financial statement so taxpayers would not have to file a full set of financial accounts with Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue uses information from the IR10 for analytical purposes (such as tax compliance risk, policy and strategic research).

It also has an ancillary purpose of capturing useful business information, which is used by Statistics New Zealand for the Annual Enterprise Survey. This data set helps support whole-of-Government decision-making (for example, the Budget and interest rates-setting) and provides crucial economic indicators for use by wider Government and other researchers (such as the Treasury and the Reserve Bank). If IR10 information were not available, Statistics New Zealand would have to survey an additional 30,000 businesses to gather this information.

The form was developed in the early 1990s and has not been updated since. It is primarily completed as an attachment to a number of mandatory tax returns (which have business income), but the IR10 form itself is not mandatory, and taxpayers can chose to send in financial statements instead. It is Inland Revenue's preference that an IR10 is filed rather than sending in financial statements. It is widely accepted throughout the tax community (including Inland Revenue) that there have been numerous problems with the old IR10 forms. It was out-dated, sometimes unclear and ill-suited for analytical purposes, both for Inland Revenue and external stakeholders. The changes being introduced seek to address these problems for taxpayers, their agents and Inland Revenue.

### Key features

The major changes in the IR10 form include:

*   aligning the form with the taxpayer’s financial statements so there is greater consistency between the two. This will make it easier for taxpayers, tax agents and accountants to translate their own or their clients’ financial statements into an IR10 form
*   discarding boxes that are not fit-for-purpose, and replacing them with boxes that contain more useful variables (from a statistical and risk analytics sense) that are not currently captured in the IR10 form
*   re-labelling some boxes so the scope of the information requested provides more useful information. For example, the previous balance sheet item "Land and buildings" has been split under the new IR10 into separate items "Land" and "Buildings".

The new IR10 form also includes boxes that allow a more accurate disclosure of income not previously accommodated in the old IR10 form, for example, Box 26: Exceptional items and Box 53: Untaxed realised gains/ receipts.

#### A revised and improved IR10 guide

The IR10 guide has also been updated to underscore the importance of the information being gathered, the purpose of the IR10 form, and to ensure that it is clear what information is required of taxpayers and their agents. The following tables summarise the changes.

| Relabelled boxes |     |

Rewrite Advisory Panel remedial items
=====================================

2014 Rewrite Advisory Panel remedial items covering various topics relating to the Income Tax Act 2007.

Notice to leave a consolidated imputation group
-----------------------------------------------

#### _Sections FM 40(5) and FN 12(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007_

The Panel considered, and agreed with, a submission that the Income Tax Act 2007 contains an unintended change to the effective date that a company leaves a consolidated group of companies, if its notice to leave the consolidated group of companies is invalid.

### Key features

Under the provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007, a company must provide a notice to the Commissioner that it has left a consolidated group if it is no longer entitled to continue as a member of that consolidated group of companies. Sections FN 12(5) and FM 40(5) apply to invalidate this notice as an anti-avoidance rule.

The amendments to sections FM 40(5) and FN 12(5) ensure that if the notice is invalidated, the company is treated as leaving the group from the start of the tax year in which the company is no longer entitled to be within the consolidated group.

### Application date

The amendment applies from the beginning of the 2008-09 income year.

Withholding of tax from schedular payments
------------------------------------------

#### _Section RD 10(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007_

The Panel considered, and agreed with, a submission that the effect of section RD 10(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 differs from the outcome given by that section's corresponding provision in the Income Tax Act 2004.

### Key features

The amendment corrects the unintended change and ensures that the payer of a schedular payment to a GST-registered person must withhold tax under the PAYE rules based on the GST-exclusive amount. This is because GST charged by and paid to a registered person is not treated as income.

### Application date

The amendment applies from the beginning of the 2008-09 income year.

Relief from obligation to withhold resident withholding tax
-----------------------------------------------------------

#### _Section RE 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

The Panel considered, and agreed with, a submission that the outcome given by section RE 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 differs from the outcome given by that section's corresponding provision in the Income Tax Act 2004 on the requirement to withhold resident withholding tax from payments of dividends. This issue mainly relates to financial institutions operating through a branch in New Zealand that pay dividends to the branch's New Zealand shareholders in relation to shares issued by the foreign company.

### Key features

Section RE 4 requires a person to withhold resident withholding tax from payments of dividends and interest, unless an exception applies.

The amendment correctly provides an exception from the obligation to withhold resident withholding tax. This ensures that a non-resident company carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand through a branch is relieved from the obligation to withhold resident withholding tax from dividends paid to its New Zealand shareholders if the company is not required by generally accepted accounting practice, to express its financial statements in New Zealand dollars.

### Application date

The amendment applies from the beginning of the 2008-09 income year. However, a "savings" provision applies to:

*   validate the tax position of a company that has withheld resident withholding tax from dividends paid to its New Zealand shareholders (based on the previous section RE 4 in the 2007 Act); and
*   ensure that self-assessments of shareholders that take into account the dividend paid from the company and the associated tax credit are not disturbed.

Refund limits for ICA companies
-------------------------------

#### _Section RM 13(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007_

The Panel agreed with a submission that, for a company that has an extension of time to file its annual imputation credit account (ICA) return, the provisions of section RM 13(3) in the Income Tax Act 2007 do not correctly reflect the outcome given by the section's corresponding provision in the Income Tax Act 2004 (section MD 2(1A)).

### Key features

The amendment corrects the unintended change and ensures that the amount of the refund or transfer must not exceed the balance of the company's imputation credit account on the last day of the tax year to which that imputation credit account return relates.

### Application date

The amendment applies from the beginning of the 2008-09 income year.

Rewrite Amendments
==================

Remedial changes have been made to the Income Tax Act 2004 on the recommendation of the Rewrite Advisory Panel.

_**Sections DZ 13, EH 37, EH 81, LE 3(3),**_ _**OB 1 and Schedule 22A**_

Remedial changes have been made to the Income Tax Act 2004 on the recommendation of the Rewrite Advisory Panel.  The amendments ensure that provisions in the 2004 Act:

*   have the same legal outcome as would be obtained under their corresponding provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994; or
*   appropriately identify the provision as an intended change in Schedule 22A.

### Background

At the time of enactment of the Income Tax Act 2004, the Finance and Expenditure Committee expressed concern that the new legislation could contain unintended policy changes.  To alleviate that concern, the committee recommended that a panel of tax specialists be appointed to review any submission that the 2004 Act contained an unintended policy change.  An unintended policy change is one that gives rise to a different outcome from the corresponding provision in the Income Tax Act 1994.  The Rewrite Advisory Panel accepted this review role.

These remedial amendments arise from this review and were added to the bill at the select committee stage of the legislative process.

### Key features

The provisions affected are section DZ 13 (unamortised balances of expenditures in farming and agricultural sector), sections EH 37 and EH 81 (income equalisation schemes), section LE 3(3) (section LE 3 holding companies), the definition of "beneficiary income" in section OB 1, and Schedule 22A.

### Application dates

The amendments are retrospective and apply from the beginning of the income year corresponding to the 2005-06 tax year.

### Detailed analysis

##### _Section DZ 13 and Schedule 22A_

Section DZ 13 has been amended to more clearly reflect an intended policy change. 

Following the repeal of the 1994 Act, section DZ 13 of the 2004 Act was introduced to ensure that a person can continue to be allowed a deduction for the unamortised balance of certain types of expenditure to which section DO 4 of the 1994 Act applied.

Section DO 4 of the 1994 Act allowed a deduction for certain types of farming and agricultural expenditure but required that deduction to be spread over a number of years.  It contained the current spreading rules and two different set of amortisation rules for qualifying expenditure incurred in the 1995 and prior tax years. 

Most of these expenditures from the 1995 and earlier tax years were expected to be fully amortised by the end of the 2005 tax year.  However, because the amortisation of the expenditure could occur only if the expenditure was "of benefit to the business" in a tax year, there was a possibility that a person may have an unexpired balance of these qualifying expenditures at the end of the 2005 tax year.  As the 2004 Act repealed section DO 4 of the 1994 Act, a new rule was required in the 2004 Act to ensure that a person could amortise any remaining balance of these earlier expenditures.

Therefore section DZ 13 was enacted to ensure that unamortised farming and agricultural expenditures incurred in the 1995 and earlier tax years can be allocated to a tax year occurring after commencement of the 2004 Act.  As these expenditures are very long-dated, it was also considered appropriate for section DZ 13 to provide a way to terminate those earlier amortisation rules.

The policy intention for section DZ 13 was to provide for a person's unamortised balance of these qualifying expenditures at the end of the 2005 tax year to be allocated to the first tax year after commencement of the 2004 Act in which the "benefit to the business" test was satisfied.  However, the provision as originally enacted was unclear and did not achieve this purpose, with the result that the unamortised balances could not be allocated to any tax year.

The amendment to section DZ 13 ensures that a person is allowed a deduction for the amount of the unamortised balance of these qualifying expenditures at the end of the person's 2004-05 tax year.  This deduction is then allocated to the first income year after commencement of the 2004 Act in which the unamortised expenditure satisfies the criteria of "being of benefit to the business".

In addition, section DZ 13 was inadvertently omitted from Schedule 22A of the 2004 Act (the Schedule that contains a list of the intended changes made in the 2004 Act).  The amendment also corrects that omission.

##### _Sections EH 37 and EH 81_

The definition in section OB 1 of "specified period" as it relates to the income equalisation scheme has been amended to correct an inadvertent change in wording.

The definition of "specified period" in the 2004 Act contained an unintended change in that it changed the timing of the "specified period" to 30 September each year, being six months after 31 March each year.  Under the 1994 Act the "specified period" ended six months after the person's balance date for income tax purposes. 

The correct policy is that deposits to the income equalisation scheme should be made within six months of the end of a person's balance date for income tax purposes.  The amendment ensures that the 2004 Act continues that intended policy outcome.

##### _Section LE 3 holding companies_

Section LE 3(3)(e) has been amended to ensure that the tax outcome under the 2004 Act is the same as the 1994 Act.

Section LE 3 is part of the foreign investor tax credit rules and is intended to ensure that dividends paid by a New Zealand-resident company to its non-resident shareholders have an effective New Zealand tax rate of no greater than 33%.  This is achieved by providing the resident company paying the dividend with a foreign investor tax credit, which is then subtracted from the company's income tax liability for that tax year.

When the investment into New Zealand is through a New Zealand-resident holding company, however, that company may have insufficient taxable income to utilise the foreign-investor tax credit.  This will occur, for example, when all dividends the holding company receives from the New Zealand group of companies are either fully imputed dividends or exempt dividends.

This problem was addressed by section LE 3 of the 1994 Act.  Under section LE 3, and only for the purpose of the foreign investor tax credit rules, the New Zealand-resident holding company is treated in a similar way to a non-resident in relation to dividends it derives from its New Zealand group of companies.

This section LE 3 concession is limited to a holding company that derives dividends that are of the types listed in section CB 10 of the 1994 Act.  Section LE 3(3)(e) in the 2004 Act, as originally enacted, inadvertently changed the effect of the law by treating the section LE 3 holding company status as revoked if it derives dividends of any type referred to in sections CW 9 to CW 11 of the 2004 Act (the corresponding provisions to section CB 10 of the 1994 Act).

Section LE 3(3)(e) has been amended to restore the outcome that was achieved under the 1994 Act.

### Beneficiary income

In section OB 1, the definition of "beneficiary income", in paragraph (b)(ii), has been amended to cross-refer to section CC 3(2).

The cross-reference to section CC 3, as originally enacted in the 2004 Act, was too broad and potentially led to the result that no accrual income could be included in beneficiary income.  The correct policy is that for taxation purposes, beneficiary income does not include income derived by a trustee from the forgiveness of a debt owed by the trustee, but otherwise may include accrual income.

The amendment corrects this position by ensuring the cross-reference is to section CC 3(2), which relates only to certain types of debt forgiveness.

Rewrite items
=============

2012 remedial changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Income Tax Act 2004 covering livestock valuations rules, trustee income and minor drafting matters.

Remedial changes have been made to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Income Tax Act 2004 on the recommendation of the Rewrite Advisory Panel. A number of minor drafting matters have also been corrected, including cross-references, punctuation and terminology, in the interests of consistency.

### Livestock Valuation Rules

_Section EC 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and Income Tax Act 2007 (sections 30 and 245 of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Act 2012)_

These sections restore the business nexus requirement to the livestock valuation rules set out in subpart EC for both the 2004 and 2007 Acts. The business nexus requirement was inadvertently omitted in rewriting the livestock valuation rules in subpart EE of the Income Tax Act 1994.

#### Background

As part of the rewrite of the trading stock rules in subpart EE of the Income Tax Act 1994 into the Income Tax Act 2004, the livestock valuation rules were separated from the general trading stock rules (subpart EB). The livestock valuation rules were placed in a separate subpart (subpart EC). Subpart EC was re-enacted in the Income Tax Act 2007.

However, under section EE 1 of the 1994 Act, the trading stock valuation rules in subpart EE of the Income Tax Act 1994 applied to a person carrying on a business. Therefore in the 1994 Act, the livestock valuation rules applied only to a person carrying on a business and to their livestock held as part of the normal incident of carrying on that business. The Rewrite Advisory Panel agreed with a submission that the business nexus requirement was inadvertently omitted in rewriting the livestock valuation rules now set out in subpart EC of the Income Tax Act 2007.

#### Detailed analysis

This amendment restores the business nexus to subpart EC in both the 2004 and 2007 Acts. However, livestock held in a dealing business is valued under the general trading stock valuation rules in subpart EB (section EB 2(3)(f)). This distinction is also made explicit in this amendment by providing that the livestock valuation rules do not apply to a livestock dealing business.

The business nexus will normally be satisfied for livestock held over several years, such as dairy cattle, sheep, goats and the like, which are held for their fleece or their progeny (or both). The business nexus would normally be satisfied for this type of livestock because the disposal of these animals beyond their useful life is a normal event in a farming business.

#### Application date(s)

The amendment is retrospective to the commencement of the 2005-06 income year. However, a savings provision applies in the event a taxpayer has taken a tax position on or before 31 May 2011, relying on the provisions of subpart EC prior to this amendment.

### Trustee income

_Section HC 25(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (section 84 of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Act 2012)_

The amendment resolves an ambiguity by clarifying that section HC 25(1) applies to a foreign-sourced amount derived by a trustee in an income year that is trustee income. The clarification ensures that section HC 25 does apply to a foreign-sourced amount that is distributed as beneficiary income.

### Background

The Rewrite Advisory Panel noted that section HC 25(1) contains an ambiguity and could be read as applying to income derived from a source outside Zealand by a non-resident trustee of a trust having a resident settlor even if that income is distributed as beneficiary income.

However, the Panel also identified that the Interpretation Act 1999 provided for headings to sections to be relevant indicators for statutory interpretation, and so the ambiguity can be resolved by normal interpretive approach. However, the provision is amended to ensure consistency with the rewrite objectives of clear, accessible legislation.

### Detailed analysis

This amendment clarifies that section HC 25 applies to income derived by a trustee in an income year that is not also beneficiary income.

If income derived by a trustee for an income year is not distributed as beneficiary income, that income is included in the trustee's taxable income as trustee income. In most circumstances, trustees are taxed on income derived if it is either sourced from New Zealand or derived by a trust having a resident settlor.

Section HC 25 is essential to the settlor basis for taxing trusts as it ensures that a non-resident trustee of a trust having a resident settlor (and certain other types of trusts) is taxable on income derived from a source outside New Zealand.

### Application date

The amendment applies from the 2008-09 income year.

### Minor maintenance items

A number of minor maintenance items arising from the rewrite of income tax legislation have been referred to the Rewrite Advisory Panel. These may include:

*   ambiguities;

\[UNCLASSIFIED\] Regulatory Impact Assessments Amendment Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023–24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill 14 March 2024 Included in this pack are the following Regulatory Impact Statements: 1.Reducing the bright-line period for taxing residential property 2.Reintroducing interest deductibility on residential investment property 3.Removing building depreciation 4.Disposals of trading stock at below market value 5.Online Casino Taxes Item 01 Regulatory Impact Statement | 2 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Inland Revenue’s recommended option is Option 2. The main reason is that a lengthy bright-line test such as 10 years is likely to be an inefficient way of collecting tax revenue. Taxes that generate a lot of behavioural changes while raising relatively small amounts of revenue tend to be very inefficient. If the bright-line test causes taxpayers to hold onto their properties for more than 10 years, the government will obtain no tax revenue from these people. In these cases, the tax is causing people to act in ways that can be undesirable (by holding onto a property longer than would be desirable in the absence of tax) while raising no revenue. Option 2 will also assist with the Government’s objective of putting downward pressure on rents because a smaller likelihood of gains being taxed is likely to incentivise landlords to invest in rental housing, which will, to some extent, encourage the building of dwellings and provision of rental housing. A potential disadvantage of Option 2 is that it will mean a narrower capital income tax base because fewer gains will be taxed. However, we consider that a 10-year bright-line is unlikely to be an efficient way of taxing this capital income. If the government wanted to tax the income, it would be preferable to have a tax on these gains irrespective of when the assets were sold. Views of stakeholders The Treasury The Treasury agrees that the current 10-year bright-line test likely has significant efficiency costs relative to the revenue raised, and that the arbitrary time boundary raises issues of fairness. However, the Treasury does not have a firm view on whether a 2-year bright-line test is preferable to the current 10-year test. The Treasury recommends a 20-year bright-line test or longer. This would capture more capital gains, thereby improving the fairness of the tax system and supporting more sustainable house prices. Treasury considers it unlikely that landlords will pass on the tax change through lower rents in the short run. Research by the Housing Technical Working Group, a cross-agency group of housing experts, found that the main drivers of rents over the past twenty years have been household income growth and the physical supply of rental housing relative to demand. The Treasury therefore expects that reducing the bright-line period would not significantly impact rents in the short run, as the stock of housing supply is fixed. In the longer term, the change could result in some increase to rental housing supply, thereby putting downward pressure on rents. This will depend on the degree of flexibility in urban land supply and/or opportunities to intensify existing land. As a result, the impact of reducing the bright-line period in the long term will depend on future policy. Supporting the flexibility of urban land supply will make it more likely that reducing the bright-line period increases the supply of housing in the long run rather than primarily raising house prices. Ministry of Housing and Urban Development - Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga HUD agrees with Inland Revenue’s assessment of the impact on supply, house prices, and rents. Based on research by the Housing Technical Working Group, a cross-agency group of housing experts, showing rents are primarily driven by household incomes and the relative supply and demand for housing, HUD believes the impact on rent prices in the short term will be negligible. In the long term, reinstatement should make rents under Option 2 less than under Option 1, with the magnitude of that contingent on any improvements to overall efficiency of urban land supply response.

As such, the options under consideration were limited to the status quo and introducing a 2-year bright-line test.

The rental market 1.Upward pressure on rents can be driven by many factors that influence the supply of rental properties. These factors may be related or unrelated to tax settings. 2.However, moving back to a 2-year bright-line test can reduce pressure on rents by encouraging the construction of dwellings and thus putting downward pressure on rents. 3.Rental affordability is a significant issue in New Zealand. Based on Household Economic Survey data for the year ended June 2022, a quarter of renting households were spending over 40% of their disposable income on housing costs, and rents have risen faster than mortgage payments. Renters also have higher rates of reporting housing issues like dampness, mould, and lack of heating. 1 4.While rental affordability (measured by the ratio of changes in rent prices to changes in incomes) has been mostly constant over the past decade, 2 New Zealand has not fared favourably in international comparisons. The proportion of low-income households (the lowest income quintile) in New Zealand spending over 40% of their income on rent was the highest in the OECD in 2018 data at 61%. 3 The same analysis for households of all incomes finds New Zealand is also near the top of OECD countries for the proportion of renters spending over 40% of their income on housing costs (24%), 4 and for median spend on housing costs by renting households (28% of household income). 5 The latter measure of median spend increases to 41% for low-income households. 6 The bright-line test 5.The bright-line test was originally introduced in 2015 to improve compliance with the land sale rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 by supplementing the intention test. 7 Under the intention test, gains from the sale of land purchased with a purpose or intention of disposal are taxable. However, this test can be difficult to enforce because there can be difficulties determining a taxpayer’s purpose or intention in relation to land. The difficulties meant that some land speculators were not paying tax on gains from property sales in instances where they should have been paying tax. 1 https://www.stats.govt.nz/news/housing-affordability-more-challenging-for-renters-than-homeowners/ 2 https://www.hud.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Documents/Methods-Nov-2022.pdf 3 International comparisons of housing affordability for renters and owners, p. 18. 4 International comparisons of housing affordability for renters and owners, p. 20 5 International comparisons of housing affordability for renters and owners, p. 22. 6 International comparisons of housing affordability for renters and owners, p. 23 7 The regulatory impact statements published for the introduction of these rules, as well as the subsequent extensions of these rules, are available here (2015), here (2017), and here (2021). Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 6.The bright-line test originally applied to residential property that was acquired and disposed of within 2 years. The test was extended to acquisitions and disposals within 5 years in 2018, with the objective of ensuring that tax is paid on the gains from property speculation and to improve housing affordability for owner-occupiers by reducing demand from speculators. 7.The test was extended again in 2021 to apply to acquisitions and disposals within 10 years (or 5 years for new builds). This extension was intended to reduce investor demand for property. This would reduce the amounts investors were prepared to pay for houses and the number of houses they would buy, thereby supporting first-home buyers and helping lift New Zealand’s home ownership rates. 8.The Government is concerned that the current 10-year bright-line test treats a very wide group of investment property owners as property speculators. In addition, the Government is concerned that the current bright-line tests place upward pressure on rents. This can happen in the longer run, by reducing the supply of dwellings. 9.The Income Tax Act 2007 contains other provisions that impose income tax on property transactions. However, it continues to be the case the that the key provision taxing gains from speculation (the intention test) is difficult to enforce. As a result, if there is no bright-line test, it is likely many people who have gains from the sale of land that should be subject to tax under the intention test will fail to comply. W h a t i s t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m o r o p p o r t u n i t y? 10.While the gains on any residential investment property purchased with the intention to sell are taxable, the subjective nature of determining investors’ intention makes this difficult to enforce. Therefore, there are good policy reasons to continue to have a bright-line test to provide more clarity to the taxation of gains from residential property sales. 11.However, the longer 10-year bright-line period gives rise to a large “lock-in” effect, where investors are incentivised to hold onto property until the bright-line period has expired to avoid tax liability. This can be an inefficient way of raising revenue. In addition, this can reduce the stock of dwellings over time (relative to what the stock would have been without this lengthy bright-line test). This can put upward pressure on rents. W h a t o b j e c t i v e s a r e s o u g h t i n r e l a t i o n t o t he p o l i c y p r o b l e m ? 12.The Government’s objective in repealing the current bright-line tests and replacing them with a new 2-year bright-line test is to reduce upward pressure on rents. Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section 2: Deciding upon an option to addres s the policy proble m W h a t c r i t e r i a w i l l b e u s e d to c o m p a r e o p t i o n s to t h e s t a t u s q u o ? 13.The likely impact of the options will be assessed against the status quo under the Government’s objective of reducing upward pressure on rents and improving housing affordability in the rental market. The impact on housing affordability and home ownership is also considered, given those outcomes were a motivation for the status quo bright-line test. 14.The options will also be evaluated against the traditional tax policy criteria of efficiency, equity, integrity, fiscal impact, compliance and administration costs, and coherence. These are described below. a.Efficiency: Taxes should be, to the extent possible, efficient and minimise (as much as possible) impediments to economic growth. That is, the tax system should avoid unnecessarily distorting the use of resources (e.g., causing biases toward one form of investment versus another) and imposing heavy costs on individuals and firms. b.Equity: The tax system should promote fairness. The burden of taxes differs across individuals and businesses depending on which bases and rates are adopted. Assessment of both vertical equity (the appropriate treatment of those on different income levels or in different circumstances) and horizontal equity (the consistent treatment of those at similar income levels, or similar circumstances) is important. c.Revenue integrity: The tax system should be sustainable over time and minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and arbitrage. d.Fiscal impact: Tax reforms need to be affordable given fiscal constraints, and the system must raise sufficient revenue to support the Government’s fiscal strategy. e.Compliance and administration costs: The tax system should be as simple and low cost as possible for taxpayers to comply with and for Inland Revenue to administer. f.Coherence: Individual reform options should make sense in the context of the entire tax system. While a particular measure may seem sensible when viewed in isolation, implementing the proposal may not be desirable given the tax system as a whole. W h a t s c o p e w i l l o p t i o n s b e c o n s i d e r e d w i t h i n ? 15.The Government has already announced its intention to repeal the current bright-line tests and replace them with a new 2-year bright-line test. 16.Ministers have directed officials to provide advice on this policy within the timeframes required for decisions in December 2023. Therefore, the scope of feasible options is Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] limited. Officials are progressing this advice on the basis of the commitment made in National’s Back Pocket Boost, as the coalition agreements are silent on changes to the bright-line test. This is for the bright-line proposal to take effect from July 2024 so that properties acquired before July 2022 will not be subject to taxation under the bright-line test. Limitations on consultation 17.Formal stakeholder engagement following the Generic Tax Policy Process has not been possible in the time allowed for preparation of this advice. The risks of a lack of formal consultation include the potential for unintended consequences arising from the policy change. Consultation also enables a more rigorous understanding of trade-offs when making policy changes. This is pertinent for a proposal like reducing the bright- line test, which could have impacts on the rental property market and the housing system more generally with respect to prices, rents, and the supply of housing. Because the bright-line test has been subject to several changes since introduction, its impacts on the housing system, as well as the mechanics of the changes and how the proposal will work, have been discussed and submitted on previously. 18.The absence of consultation for the current proposal means that officials have not been able to establish whether issues raised in previous submissions are just as relevant to the current proposal. For example, no formal consultation has occurred to determine whether stakeholders consider moderating growth in house prices is as much of a priority for the current proposal compared to when previous bright-line changes were being considered. This is an important point when considering that the current proposal has a different motivation to that of the status quo. This is reflective of trade-offs, for which consultation would ideally occur to help improve understanding of the relevant issues. 19.One issue in particular that may be affected by a lack of consultation is the 1 July 2024 implementation date. This is out of sync with the tax year and has implications for property owners in trying to understand how the rules apply to them part-way through the year. This will be mitigated through taxpayer guidance and website updates to ensure the timing of the change is well signalled. W h a t o p t i o n s a r e b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d? Option 1: Retain the status quo 20.Option 1 is to retain the status quo. Under current law, a 5-year bright-line test applies for properties acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and before 27 March 2021. A 10- year bright-line test applies for properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021, except for new-build land, for which a 5-year bright-line test applies. 21.Option 1 addresses concerns around property speculation by dampening demand. In addition, it ensures that speculators are taxed on gains from the sale of residential investment land. Due to the length of the 10-year period, it is likely to result in significant lock-in effects and may, in the longer run, place upward pressure on rents. Option 2 – Introduce a new 2-year bright-line test Regulatory Impact Statement | 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 22.Option 2 is to repeal the current bright-line tests and introduce a new 2-year bright-line test. This test would tax properties sold after the application date, provided they were acquired within 2 years of the date of sale. 23.Option 2 will address the Government’s concerns that a very wide group of investment property owners are being treated as property speculators. 24.Option 2 will also continue to address concerns around property speculation by providing a clear rule under which gains from property speculation will be taxed. At the same time, it will support two of the other objectives of the original 2-year test. These were to minimise the number of sales made taxable that were acquired without an intention of resale, and to minimise costs to taxpayers in complying with the bright-line test. Options analysis 25.Option 2 is assessed relative to Option 1 (the status quo) against the Government’s objective of reducing upward pressure on rents as well as the criteria listed above. 26.Reducing upward pressure on rents and impact on home ownership: Option 2 will mean that beyond a 2-year period, residential investment property owners will not be subject to the bright-line test. This will reduce the total taxes they pay if they end up needing to sell a property within the 2–10 year period. This can incentivise new construction, which would put downward pressure on rents in the longer run. This would help renters. 27.A shorter bright-line period decreases the tax cost of investing in residential property. An increase in demand for purchasing such property could then put upward pressure on property prices compared to the status quo. This would be detrimental to first-home buyers. The impact on home ownership rates cannot be quantified. 28.Efficiency: The change is likely to have limited effects on economic growth but a significant effect on other aspects of economic efficiency. 29.The key potential efficiency advantage of taxing gains generated by investors in residential property is that the gain is a form of economic income. Not taxing these gains when other forms of income are taxed can reduce the efficiency of the tax system. This is a possible reason for preferring Option 1 relative to Option 2. 30.However, we consider that this is a very weak argument for preferring Option 1. It is a reason for taxing gains irrespective of how long an investment property is held. It is not a good argument for taxing gains only if a property is sold within 10 years of acquisition. 31.The original 2-year bright-line test had a clear rationale. This was to tax gains when it was very likely that the gains should have been taxed under the intention test. The 2- year bright-line test did this without the difficulties and economic costs of applying the intention test while at the same time minimising the number of sales that were taxed without an intention of resale. This rationale cannot be reasonably said to apply for a 10-year bright-line test. Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 32.Taxing gains only if investment property is sold within 10 years can be a very inefficient way of taxing gains on investment property. This is because if a property appreciates significantly in the first few years it is owned, there can be a large incentive for the owner to hold the property for at least 10 years so that gains are not taxed. 33.These "lock-in” effects constitute deadweight costs that decrease economic efficiency, as residential property owners may hold rentals for longer than they otherwise would if not for the bright-line test. Option 2 decreases some of the inefficiencies associated with lock-in. 34.The compounding effect of capital gains for a property owner who is “locked” into holding the property for 10 years creates a proportionately large distortion compared to a property owner who is locked in for 2 years where capital gains have less time to accrue. 35.In many cases, it will also be likely that the gains accrued during a 2-year lock-in period would have been taxable under the intention test anyway, which decreases the economic distortions the bright-line test creates when considered in conjunction with existing taxing provisions. Conversely, the gains accrued during a 10-year lock-in period are less likely to have been taxable under the intention test, leading to larger inefficiencies. 36.Taxes that are easy to step around are inefficient. They can produce behavioural changes while generating very little revenue. It is inefficient to provide an incentive for a taxpayer who wishes to sell a property after 5 years to hold onto the property for an additional 5 years. This has a large efficiency cost per dollar of revenue raised when many properties are held for more than 10 years and no revenue is gained on these properties. 37.Overall, there are significant efficiency gains achieved by reducing the bright-line period, and this is a strong reason to prefer Option 2. 38.Equity: One possible fairness disadvantage of Option 2 relative to Option 1 is that it taxes less capital income. People are normally taxed on their income and exempting capital gains can be criticised as horizontally inequitable. It favours those who earn income as capital gains over those who are earning most other forms of income. If those who earn this sort of income tend to be better off, this can also be criticised on vertical equity grounds if this undermines a government’s tax progressivity goals. 39.However, once again this provides very weak fairness grounds for taxing gains on residential investment properties if these properties are sold within 10 years of acquisition but not if they are held for a longer period. It also provides weak fairness grounds for taxing gains on residential investment property when other gains are not being taxed. 40.By contrast, there is a good fairness ground for the original 2-year bright-line test. This is that most sales within this short period will have been in cases where the intention test should have applied and the income should have been taxed under general income tax principles. 41.Revenue integrity: Revenue integrity may decline under Option 2 as it is possible that properties held for more than 2 years that should have been caught by the intention Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] test may no longer have tax paid on sale. At the same time, it minimises the number of cases where the tax will apply even though the gains should not have been caught by the intention test. 42.Fiscal impact: The expected fiscal cost of Option 2 over the forecast period (to 2027/28) is estimated to be approximately $202 million. 43.Compliance and administration costs: A reduced bright-line test will capture fewer property transactions and affect fewer people, which reduces compliance costs. The complexity that exists in the current bright-line settings could also be reduced to further lessen compliance costs. Changing the bright-line test will create some initial administrative work such as providing guidance and education campaigns. 44.Coherence: There appears to be little policy rationale for taxing gains on investment properties only if the properties are sold within 10 years. By contrast there is a policy rationale for a 2-year bright-line test, being that it ensures gains are taxed when they should have been taxable under the intention test. Thus, Option 2 appears superior to Option 1 on grounds of coherence. Treasury assessment of the options 45.The Treasury agrees that the current 10-year bright-line test likely has significant efficiency costs relative to the revenue raised, and that the arbitrary time boundary raises issues of fairness. However, the Treasury does not have a firm view on whether a 2-year bright-line test is preferable to the current 10-year test. 46.The Treasury recommends a 20-year bright-line test or longer. This would capture more capital gains, thereby improving the fairness of the tax system and supporting more sustainable house prices. 47.In the short and medium term, the bulk of the impact from reducing the bright-line test to 2 years is likely to be reflected in house prices, with minimal impacts on rents. House price impacts are highly uncertain and will depend on the timing of reducing the bright- line period. The Treasury will analyse these potential impacts further and may adjust our house price forecasts to reflect them as part of the Budget Economic and Fiscal Update. 48.In the long run, tax changes could also impact the supply of housing by incentivising new construction, and could therefore have more significant impacts on rents. The long-run incidence on house prices and rents will depend on the flexibility of urban land supply and the availability of opportunities to intensify existing urban land: a.low flexibility of urban land supply and limited opportunities to intensify mean the policy will primarily raise house prices in the long run. b.high flexibility of urban land supply and significant opportunities to intensify mean the policy will primarily reduce rents in the long run. 49.Research by the Housing Technical Working Group, a cross-agency group of housing experts, suggests that rents are primarily driven by household incomes and the relative supply and demand for rental housing. The Treasury therefore expects that reducing the bright-line test to 2 years would not significantly impact rents in the short run, as the stock of housing supply is fixed. Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 50. The Treasury’s assessment of the evidence is that urban land supply has been highly restrictive over the last two decades, as demonstrated by the gradual fall in interest rates pushing up house prices rather than pushing down rents. 51. Recent policy changes (such as the Auckland Unitary Plan) appear to have improved the responsiveness of supply for higher-density housing. However, without further changes, housing supply may continue to be unresponsive to demand in the long term. 52. As a result, the impact of reducing the bright-line period in the long term will depend on future policy. Supporting the flexibility of urban land supply will make it more likely that reducing the bright-line period increases the supply of housing in the long run rather than primarily raising house prices. Ministry of Housing and Urban Development – Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga assessment of the options 53. HUD agrees with Inland Revenue’s assessment of the impact on supply, house prices, and rents. Based on research by the Housing Technical Working Group, a cross- agency group of housing experts, showing rents are primarily driven by household incomes and the relative supply and demand for housing, HUD believes the impact on rent prices in the short term will be negligible. In the long term, reinstatement should make rents under Option 2 less than under Option 1, with the magnitude of that contingent on any improvements to overall efficiency of urban land supply response. Regulatory Impact Statement | 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section 3: Delivering a n option H o w w i l l t h e n e w a r r a n g e m e n t s b e i m p l e m e n t e d? 56.This change will give rise to minimal system changes, and tax return processes will remain the same. Changes required will include updating all taxpayer guidance, websites, and calculators. 57.It is currently proposed that the changes will apply to disposals of residential land after 1 July 2024. There is a potential for confusion resulting in errors by taxpayers and significant software challenges for accounting software suppliers, arising from an application date that does not align with the ordinary tax year (1 April to 31 March). This could be mitigated by applying the proposals from 1 April 2024, which would be Inland Revenue’s preference. H o w w i l l t h e n e w a r r a n g e m e n t s b e mo n i t o red, ev a l u a ted, a n d re v i e wed? 58.Inland Revenue currently has processes in place to monitor all New Zealand property transactions and to identify possible bright-line transactions and notify taxpayers. Inland Revenue may request transactors in property to update transaction details accordingly in myIR. None of these processes are expected to change as a result of the proposal. 59.Where non-compliance is identified, there are process for reminders, compliance visits and audits (where necessary). These processes will continue for any amended bright- line test. Item 02 Regulatory Impact Statement | 2 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] For an income tax to be based on ability to pay, there needs to be a deduction for the costs of producing the income 1 . Compared to the status quo, Option 2 will support income being used as a measure of a taxpayer’s ability to pay tax. Inland Revenue’s recommended option is Option 2. Option 2 means that income will be a better measure of ability to pay than would have been true under Option 1. It also means that tax will be less of a barrier to people making efficient commercial decisions. Finally, Inland Revenue is concerned that the denial of interest deductions is likely to make investment in rental housing an unattractive proposition for many investors. Over time, this is likely to reduce the supply of housing and rental housing (relative to what would be the case if interest expense was deductible). This would place upward pressure on rents, which would increase housing costs for tenants and decrease the equity with the tax treatment of other investments that are taxed on a net basis. Views of stakeholders The Treasury Treasury agrees that allowing deductions for costs incurred in deriving income ensures that income tax reflects ability to pay and that restoring interest deductions will make the income tax system more consistent and coherent. Treasury considers it unlikely that landlords will pass on the tax change through lower rents in the short run. Research by the Housing Technical Working Group, a cross-agency group of housing experts, found that the main drivers of rents over the past twenty years have been household income growth and the physical supply of rental housing relative to demand. The Treasury therefore expects that restoring interest deductibility would not significantly impact rents in the short run, as the stock of housing supply is fixed. In the longer term, the change could result in some increase to rental housing supply, thereby putting downward pressure on rents. This will depend on the degree of flexibility in urban land supply and/or opportunities to intensify existing land. As a result, the impact of interest deductibility in the long term will depend on future policy. Supporting the flexibility of urban land supply will make it more likely that restoring interest deductibility increases the supply of housing in the long run rather than primarily raising house prices. Ministry of Housing and Urban Development – Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga (HUD) HUD agrees with Inland Revenue’s assessment of the impact on supply, house prices, and rents. Based on research by the Housing Technical Working Group, a cross-agency group of housing experts, showing rents are primarily driven by household incomes and the relative supply and demand for housing, HUD believes the impact on rent prices in the short term will be negligible. In the long term, reinstatement should make rents under Option 2 less than under Option 1, with the magnitude of that contingent on any improvements to overall efficiency of urban land supply response. General public There was a wide range of views expressed when the current interest limitation rules were introduced, and there is likely to be that same wide range of views expressed as those 1 It has been common for people to argue that tax should be levied on the basis of ability to pay, i.e. that those with greater ability to pay should pay more tax. If income is used to measure ability to pay, this means that those with greater incomes should pay more tax. In this context income is a net concept, after accounting for expenses incurred in earning that income, like interest. Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] consideration were limited to the status quo and reintroduction of interest deductibility. Time constraints also applied to the policy development of the proposal and has not permitted consultation on the various options, or refinement of the preferred option.

The rental market 1.Upward pressure on rents can be driven by many factors that influence the supply of rental properties. These factors may be related or unrelated to tax settings. 2.However, restoring interest deductibility could have a long-term effect on reducing the cost of housing for tenants by incentivising new construction with this putting downward pressure on rents. This is even true under the status quo with a new build exemption from the rules that deny interest deductions if it creates incentives for an important group of investors to pull back from investing in the housing market. 3.Rental affordability is a significant issue in New Zealand. Based on Household Economic Survey data for the year ended June 2022, a quarter of renting households were spending over 40% of their disposable income on housing costs, and rents have risen faster than mortgage payments. Renters also have higher rates of reporting housing issues like dampness, mould, and heating. 2 4.While rental affordability (measured by the ratio of changes in rent prices to changes in incomes) has been mostly constant over the past decade, 3 New Zealand has not fared favourably in international comparisons. The proportion of low-income households (the lowest income quintile) in New Zealand spending over 40% of their income on rent was the highest in the OECD in 2018 data at 61%. 4 The same analysis for households of all incomes finds New Zealand is also near the top of OECD countries for the proportion of renters spending over 40% of their income on housing costs (24%), 5 and for median spend on housing costs by renting households (28% of household income). 6 The latter measure of median spend increases to 41% for low-income households. 7 Interest limitation rules 5.The interest limitation rules for residential investment property were originally introduced to address housing affordability. 8 The aim of the rules was to reduce demand for residential property by preventing investors from deducting interest expenditure for tax purposes. 6.The interest limitation rules were introduced in 2021 and deny a deduction for interest incurred for residential investment property. For property acquired on or after 27 March 2 https://www.stats.govt.nz/news/housing-affordability-more-challenging-for-renters-than-homeowners/ 3 https://www.hud.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Documents/Methods-Nov-2022.pdf 4 International comparisons of housing affordability for renters and owners, p. 18. 5 International comparisons of housing affordability for renters and owners , p. 20 6 International comparisons of housing affordability for renters and owners, p. 22. 7 International comparisons of housing affordability for renters and owners, p. 23 8 The regulatory impact statement published for the introduction of these rules is available here. Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] taxable income. Deductions are generally allowed whether or not assets generate non- taxable gains as well as taxable income. Impact of deductibility settings on rents 12.In addition, denial of interest deductions may be reducing new construction and the supply of dwellings below the level that would have arisen if interest continued to be deductible. Over time, this could put upward pressure on rents and gradually make rental properties less affordable for tenants. A healthy housing market requires a good supply of housing for both tenants and owner-occupiers. 13.The reintroduction of the ability to claim interest deductions for residential investment properties would reduce pressure on landlords which, in the longer run, should have a flow-on effect in reducing rents for tenants. W h a t o b j e c t i v e s a r e s o u g h t i n r e l a t i o n t o t he p o l i c y p r o b l e m ? 14.The Government’s objective in reintroducing interest deductibility for residential investment land is to reduce upward pressure on rents. 15.In addition, restoring interest deductions is an important step to make the income tax system more consistent and coherent by ensuring tax is based on ability to pay. Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section 2: Deciding upon an option to addres s the policy proble m W h a t c r i t e r i a w i l l b e u s e d to c o m p a r e o p t i o n s to t h e s t a t u s q u o ? 16.The likely impact of the options will be assessed against the status quo under the Government’s objective of reducing upward pressure on rents and improving housing affordability in the rental market. 17.The options will also be evaluated against the traditional tax policy criteria of efficiency, equity, integrity, fiscal impact, compliance and administration costs, and coherence. These are described below: a.Efficiency: Taxes should be, to the extent possible, efficient and minimise (as much as possible) impediments to economic growth. That is, the tax system should avoid unnecessarily distorting the use of resources (e.g., causing biases toward one form of investment versus another) and imposing heavy costs on individuals and firms. b.Equity: The tax system should promote fairness. The burden of taxes differs across individuals and businesses depending on which bases and rates are adopted. Assessment of both vertical equity (the appropriate treatment of those on different income levels or in different circumstances) and horizontal equity (the consistent treatment of those at similar income levels, or similar circumstances) is important. c.Revenue integrity: The tax system should be sustainable over time and minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and arbitrage. d.Fiscal impact: Tax reforms need to be affordable given fiscal constraints, and the system must raise sufficient revenue to support the Government’s fiscal strategy. e.Compliance and administration costs: The tax system should be as simple and low cost as possible for taxpayers to comply with and for Inland Revenue to administer. f.Coherence: Individual reform options should make sense in the context of the entire tax system. While a particular measure may seem sensible when viewed in isolation, implementing the proposal may not be desirable given the tax system as a whole. W h a t s c o p e w i l l o p t i o n s b e c o n s i d e r e d w i t h i n ? Government commitments 18.The Government has already announced its intention to phase the ability to claim interest deductions for residential investment properties back in with the phasing and timing specified described in Option 2 below. 19.Ministers have directed officials to provide advice on this policy within the timeframes required for decisions in December 2023. Therefore, the scope of feasible options is limited. Regulatory Impact Statement | 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Limitations on consultation 20. Formal stakeholder engagement following the Generic Tax Policy Process has not been possible in the time allowed for preparation of this advice. The risks of a lack of formal consultation include the potential for unintended consequences arising from the policy change. Consultation also enables a more rigorous understanding of trade-offs when making policy changes. This is pertinent for a proposal like reintroducing interest deductions, which could have impacts on the rental property market and the housing system more generally with respect to prices, rents, and the supply of housing. 21. The intention to change the interest limitation rules was signalled in the pre-election manifestos of the parties that have formed the Government. W h a t o p t i o n s a r e b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d? Option 1: Retain the status quo 22. Option 1 is to retain the status quo. Under the status quo, the ability to claim interest deductions for residential investment properties will continue to be denied entirely for properties purchased on or after 27 March 2021. For properties acquired before 27 March 2021 (and lending drawn down before that date), the ability to claim interest deductions will continue to be phased out, with a deduction for 50% of the interest being allowed in the current income year (2023/24), a deduction for 25% of the interest being allowed in the next income year (2024/25), and no deductions for interest being allowed in all subsequent income years. Option 2: Reintroduce interest deductibility 23. Option 2 is to phase back in the ability to claim interest deductions for residential investment properties. The option would allow a deduction for 50% of the interest in the current income year (2023/24), a deduction for 80% of the interest in the next income year (2024/25), and full deductions for interest in all subsequent income years. Although the percentage of deductions allowed for the 2023/24 income year does not change from the status quo above, it will apply for all property owners unlike the status quo, so there is some retrospective effect. Options analysis 24. Option 2 is assessed relative to Option 1 (the status quo) against the Government’s objective of reducing upward pressure on rents as well as the tax policy criteria listed above. 25. Reducing upward pressure on rents: Option 2 will remove a tax bias that is discouraging debt-financed investors from acquiring rental properties. This makes it less likely that leveraged investors will withdraw from the property market. This can increase the construction of new dwellings and, over time, reduce upward pressure on rents. 26. Efficiency: Restoring deductions for the costs of earning income will tend to promote economic efficiency. If someone discovered a profitable venture where they could earn revenue of $30,000 by incurring costs of $25,000, this would be a worthwhile venture in Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] the absence of tax because of the $5,000 of net income it generates. If a taxpayer faced an income tax rate of 30%, the venture would still be worthwhile to undertake so long as expenses are deductible. In that case the taxpayer would pay tax of $1,500 on the $5,000 of profit and earn an after-tax income of $3,500. 27.However, if the revenue is taxed but the expense is not deductible, the taxpayer would pay tax of $9,000 on the gross revenue of $30,000, and make a loss of $4,000. Failing to allow deductions for the costs of earning income can create a penalty standing in the way of people making decisions which would be sensible in the absence of tax. By doing so, this will tend to reduce economic efficiency. 28.Denying deductions for interest can also reduce economic efficiency by encouraging investment to be undertaken with a landlord’s own funds rather than through using borrowed funds. Investment in rental property that is debt-financed can be double taxed. If investment in rental property is financed with a landlord’s own funds, rental income will be taxed in the landlord’s hands. But suppose, instead, that the investment in a rental property is financed by borrowing from another New Zealander. The rental income will be taxed in the landlord’s hands in the same way as if the investment were equity financed. There will be no deduction for interest, but the lender of the funds will also be taxed on the interest stream. This creates a tax bias discouraging the debt finance of residential rental property. 29.The current 20-year exemption from the interest limitation rules for new builds can also increase economic inefficiencies by encouraging leveraged landlords to invest in new residential rental properties ahead of existing properties. This biases the stock of rental and owner-occupied housing by encouraging landlords to hold a greater fraction of new builds in their portfolios, and owner-occupiers to hold a smaller fraction of new builds than would be the case under more neutral tax settings. 30.Equity: Denying interest deductions for residential rental property can also reduce horizontal equity. Suppose that A earns $30,000 of residential rental income with no interest expense, B earns $30,000 of residential rental income with $25,000 of interest expense and C earns $30,000 of rental income from a commercial (non-residential) property with $25,000 of interest expense. A (residential rental with no interest) B (residential rental with interest) C (commercial rental with interest) Rental income $30,000 $30,000 $30,000 Interest expense $0 $25,000 $25,000 Rental profit $30,000 $5,000 $5,000 Taxable income if interest is denied for residential rental $30,000 $30,000 $5,000 31.In reality, A has $30,000 of income while B and C have $5,000 of income. C is taxed on their $5,000 of income because their investment is in a commercial property. However, B is taxed on $30,000 as though they were in the same position as A while, in reality, B Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] has only earned $5,000 just like C. If taxes are not horizontally equitable, they will not be vertically equitable because income becomes a poor measure of ability to pay. 32.As has been noted, some might argue that denying B an interest deduction may be an offset for the possibility that B might be generating untaxed capital gains. However, this is a weak rationale for denying interest deductions, given that A or C may also be generating untaxed capital gains. 33.There is another potential fairness issue. Under current settings where interest deductions are denied on rental property, there is a 20-year exemption for new builds. This means that someone who purchased a property that was a new build just before the new rules came into effect is having interest deductions phased out over 4 years while someone who purchased a property just after the new rules came into effect is allowed interest deductions for 20 years. This can be seen as unfair to leveraged investors with sunk investments who purchased a residential rental property shortly before the new rules came into force. 34.Revenue integrity: There are no revenue integrity impacts, other than compliance issues arising from the complex nature of the interest limitation rules. 35.Fiscal impact: The expected fiscal cost of Option 2 over the forecast period (to 2027/28) is estimated to be $2,920m. 36.Compliance and administration costs: Option 2 is likely to reduce ongoing administration and compliance costs. It will reduce the complexity of the rules for taxpayers; interest limitation sits alongside already complex rules for the taxation of investment property, including the bright-line test, loss ring-fencing and rules for mixed- use assets such as holiday homes. A reduction in complexity consequently leads to less customer contact for Inland Revenue in supporting the interest limitation rules. Restoring interest deductibility retrospectively (i.e., changing the proportion of allowed deductions for the 2023/24 income year for property owners currently being denied any deductions) will create some initial administrative work such as providing guidance and education campaigns (detailed in Section 3). 37.Coherence: Limiting interest deductions has reduced the coherence of the tax system. A principle underlying the tax system is that generally only the amount of income after deducting any associated costs is taxable. Denial of interest deductions was an exception to this rule. Restoring interest deductions would therefore increase coherence. Treasury assessment of the options 38.Treasury agrees that allowing deductions for costs incurred in deriving income ensures that income tax reflects ability to pay and that restoring interest deductions will make the income tax system more consistent and coherent. 39.In the short and medium term, the bulk of the impact from restoring interest deductibility is likely to be reflected in house prices, with minimal impacts on rents. House price impacts are highly uncertain and will depend on the final policy design and timing of the reintroduction of interest deductibility. The Treasury will analyse these potential impacts further and may adjust our house price forecasts to reflect them as part of the Budget Economic and Fiscal Update. Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 40.In the long run, tax changes could also impact the supply of housing by incentivising new construction, and could therefore have more significant impacts on rents. The long-run incidence on house prices and rents will depend on the flexibility of urban land supply and the availability of opportunities to intensify existing urban land: a.low flexibility of urban land supply and limited opportunities to intensify mean the policy will primarily raise house prices in the long run. b.high flexibility of urban land supply and significant opportunities to intensify mean the policy will primarily reduce rents in the long run. 41.Research by the Housing Technical Working Group, a cross-agency group of housing experts, suggests that rents are primarily driven by household incomes and the relative supply and demand for rental housing. The Treasury therefore expects that restoring interest deductibility would not significantly impact rents in the short run, as the stock of housing supply is fixed. 42.The Treasury’s assessment of the evidence is that urban land supply has been highly restrictive over the last two decades, as demonstrated by the gradual fall in interest rates pushing up house prices rather than pushing down rents. 43.Recent policy changes (such as the Auckland Unitary Plan) appear to have improved the responsiveness of supply for higher-density housing. However, without further changes, housing supply may continue to be unresponsive to demand in the long term. 44.As a result, the impact of interest deductibility in the long term will depend on future policy. Supporting the flexibility of urban land supply will make it more likely that restoring interest deductibility increases the supply of housing in the long run rather than primarily raising house prices. 45.The Treasury recommends phasing the restoration and consideration of a cap on deductions (either as a maximum dollar amount or a fraction of interest expenses) to manage the large fiscal cost of restoring interest deductibility. Ministry of Housing and Urban Development – Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga assessment of the options 46.HUD agrees with Inland Revenue’s assessment of the impact on supply, house prices, and rents. Based on research by the Housing Technical Working Group, a cross- agency group of housing experts, showing rents are primarily driven by household incomes and the relative supply and demand for housing, HUD believes the impact on rent prices in the short term will be negligible. In the long term, reinstatement should make rents under Option 2 less than under Option 1, with the magnitude of that contingent on any improvements to overall efficiency of urban land supply response.

Section 1: Diagnosi ng the policy proble m W h a t i s t h e c o n t e x t b e h i n d t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m a n d h o w i s t h e st a t u s q u o e x p e c t e d t o d e v e l o p? The purpose of allowing deductions for business costs 1. Building depreciation – the decline in a building’s market value – warrants tax deductions for the same reasons that other business expenses like wages and depreciation on computers do. 2. Allowing deductions for business expenses ensures tax liability is based on ability to pay. It also ensures taxes are as neutral as possible across different forms of investment, ensuring investment flows to the most productive areas of the economy. 1 3. Economic depreciation is the fall in market value of an asset. In the context of a tax on income, supporting productivity means that tax deductions for depreciation mirror economic depreciation as closely as possible. Failure to allow tax depreciation for assets which fall in value results in an effective tax rate for those assets that is higher than the statutory rate. On the other hand, allowing tax depreciation for assets which do not fall in value may result in an effective tax rate for those assets that is lower than the statutory rate. Previous changes to building depreciation in New Zealand 4. New Zealand previously allowed tax depreciation on buildings on a widespread basis at a rate of 3% diminishing value (or 2% straight line) for buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This changed following an announcement in the 2010 Budget to reduce the rate to 0% from the 2011-12 income year. The removal of depreciation deductions applied to both new and existing buildings. Depreciation remained available for buildings with an estimated useful life of fewer than 50 years. 2 5. The decision in 2010 was supported by Treasury analysis of QV data on the value of land and buildings which suggested that buildings appreciated in New Zealand over the data period (1994 to 2008). Officials noted at the time that the weight of international studies indicated that buildings do depreciate. 3 1 In the absence of taxes, investment would flow to the most productive areas of the economy, maximising total welfare. Taxes, however, can distort people’s decisions, with the result that heavily taxed activities may receive less investment, even if they have higher risk-adjusted, pre-tax returns than other investments. The outcome is that capital is allocated less productively, and we are poorer and have lower income and growth than otherwise. 2 These buildings include barns, chemical works, fertiliser works, powder dryer buildings, tanneries, and hydroelectric powerhouses (treated as plant rather than buildings). 3 Probably the most widely quoted estimates are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the United States. These suggest economic deprecation rates of 3.14% for industrial buildings, 2.47% for commercial buildings, 1.14% for residential structures of 1 to 4 units and 1.4% for residential structures of 5 or more units. These Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 6.In 2019, the Treasury and Inland Revenue advised the government that reinstating building depreciation could improve productivity in New Zealand. This was supported by the weight of international evidence that long-lived buildings do depreciate, together with studies suggesting that New Zealand had a high effective tax rate (and high cost of capital) for investments in buildings compared to most OECD countries. 4 7.In 2020, depreciation for long-lived buildings (other than residential buildings) was reinstated from the 2020-21 income year at a rate of 2% diminishing value (or 1.5% straight line). This change was introduced as a component of an economic policy response to COVID-19 to improve productivity and stimulate business activity. W h a t i s t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m o r o p p o r t u n i t y? 8.The coalition Government’s fiscal plan includes a commitment to end depreciation for commercial buildings that was introduced in 2020 as part of a COVID-19 business support package. The Government wishes to remove building depreciation as a revenue generating measure. Changes would apply from the 2024/25 income year (beginning 1 April 2024 for most taxpayers). 9.The changes in 2020 reintroduced depreciation for non-residential buildings which include commercial buildings and industrial buildings. Whether a building is a non- residential building is determined based on the building’s predominant use. For more information on when building owners can currently claim depreciation see: Claiming depreciation on buildings (ird.govt.nz). 10.Since residential buildings are currently not depreciable for tax purposes, this would apply the same tax treatment to all buildings used for investment or business (other than certain short-lived buildings with an estimated useful life of less than 50 years). W h a t o b j e c t i v e s a r e s o u g h t i n r e l a t i o n t o t he p o l i c y p r o b l e m ? 11.The objective is to implement this change as part of the Coalition Government’s tax changes which includes personal income tax reductions. results are consistent with a number of other studies tha t have been undertaken in the United Kingdom and United States. Studies for Canada have tended to suggest higher rates of economic depreciation. For a comprehensive assessment as at 2018, see the following analysis from the secretariat to the Tax Working Group: Appendix C: Depreciation on Buildings: Further information on potential revenue reducing options - July 2018 - Information Release - Tax Working Group - New Zealand. 4 This was explored in depth in Inland Revenue’s Long-term Insights Briefing “Tax, foreign investment and productivity”. Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 Section 2: Deciding upon an option to addres s the policy proble m W h a t c r i t e r i a w i l l b e u s e d to c o m p a r e o p t i o n s to t h e s t a t u s q u o ? 12.The options will be evaluated against the traditional tax policy criteria of efficiency, equity, integrity, fiscal impact, compliance and administration costs, and coherence. These are described below. a.Efficiency: Taxes should be, to the extent possible, efficient and minimise (as much as possible) impediments to economic growth. That is, the tax system should avoid unnecessarily distorting the use of resources (e.g., causing biases toward one form of investment versus another) and imposing heavy costs on individuals and firms. b.Equity: The tax system should promote fairness. The burden of taxes differs across individuals and businesses depending on which bases and rates are adopted. Assessment of both vertical equity (the relative position of those on different income levels or in different circumstances) and horizontal equity (the consistent treatment of those at similar income levels, or similar circumstances) is important. c.Revenue integrity: The tax system should be sustainable over time and minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and arbitrage. d.Fiscal impact: Tax reforms need to be affordable given fiscal constraints, and the tax system must raise sufficient revenue to support the Government’s fiscal strategy. e.Compliance and administration costs: The tax system should be as simple and low cost as possible for taxpayers to comply with and for the Inland Revenue Department to administer. f.Coherence: Individual reform options should make sense in the context of the entire tax system. While a particular measure may seem sensible when viewed in isolation, implementing the proposal may not be desirable given the tax system as a whole. 13.Some of these criteria trade-off with each other so there is some subjectivity to coming to an overall recommendation. The discussion under option 2 provides more information on the exact nature of how the proposal rates against the criteria which helps us to arrive at an overall judgement. W h a t s c o p e w i l l o p t i o n s b e c o n s i d e r e d w i t h i n ? 14.Options are constrained by the coalition Government’s fiscal plan which includes removing building depreciation. We have not been asked to provide advice on alternative options. In addition, we have only considered the impacts of this proposal compared to the status quo, not the suite of tax changes as a whole. Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 W h a t o p t i o n s a r e b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d? Option One – Status Quo 15.Continue to allow depreciation deductions for buildings (other than residential buildings) with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more at a rate of 2% diminishing value (or 1.5% straight line). Option Two – Remove building depreciation 16.The proposal to remove building depreciation could be done in a similar manner to the removal of building depreciation in 2010 (including subsequent remedials). This would mean that: a.changes to depreciation rates for buildings would apply to existing and newly acquired buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. b.special depreciation rates would not be allowed for taxpayers who can establish that they have a different useful life than generally applies. However, depreciation would remain available for buildings with a shorter estimated life e.g., barns, chemical works, dairy sheds, fertiliser works, fowl houses, and tanneries. c.previous depreciation deductions on buildings would remain recoverable if the building is sold for more than its tax book value. This means building depreciation would technically be deducted at a rate of 0%. d.taxpayers would be unable to claim a disposal loss deduction if a building is sold for less than its tax book value (except for certain buildings acquired before August 2009). This is because land and buildings are usually sold together, and it is difficult to establish how much of a total loss or gain is attributable to loss on the building itself. e.building owners would be able to depreciate building fit-out. 17.The main difference between the current proposal and the changes in 2010 is that the depreciation rate for residential buildings is currently 0% and so does not need to change. 18.Efficiency: The denial of deductions for building depreciation will impact the profitability of investments and cause investors to underinvest in buildings relative to other investments where business costs continue to be deductible. 19.In our last Long-Term Insights Briefing, we noted that under some assumptions made by the OECD (including that non-residents demand a 3% real return on their capital), New Zealand was likely to have had the highest hurdle rate of return for investment in commercial and industrial buildings for the 38 countries in the OECD. This was when New Zealand allowed 2% depreciation on these buildings. Denying depreciation deductions will drive up these hurdle rates of return even higher and make New Zealand a less attractive location for investment. 20.This tax distortion does not only impact building owners. To the extent that the additional cost is passed on and there is less investment, it also impacts any business that needs to use a building and the customers of such a business. It thereby negatively impacts productivity more generally. Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 21.Equity: A fundamental principle of New Zealand’s tax system is not to advantage any form of investment relative to other forms of investment, unless there is an over-riding reason for doing so. The goal is to ensure horizontal equity and reduce tax-driven distortions by ensuring that tax is as neutral as possible across different forms of investment. 22.Restricting building depreciation deductions may be considered unfair (violates horizontal equity) as it disallows a deduction for industries whose business rely more heavily on buildings. This tax outcome will have a corresponding negative effect on the balance sheets of those affected. 23.Users of buildings would be at greater risk if safety upgrades such as seismic strengthening are made less frequently due to the inability of the owner to depreciate the cost of the upgrade, although safety regulations are more likely to drive this investment than tax settings. 24.Revenue integrity: Based on the simplicity of the change and past experience implementing the change, it should have little overall impact on revenue integrity. 25.Fiscal impact: The expected revenue gain from this option is $2.31 billion over the forecast period (2024/25 to 2027/28). This estimate is based on a number of assumptions, such as the portion of buildings in some industries being outside of the tax base (e.g., owned by the government). To the extent these assumptions are wrong, the estimate of fiscal cost would also be incorrect. 26.Compliance and administration costs: In addition to paying more taxes, there may be some initial compliance costs for building owners as they separate building fit-out from the rest of the building for depreciation purposes. There will be a transitional rule for owners who have not previously recorded fit-out separately and do not wish to obtain a new valuation. 27.Historically, taxpayers who have elected not to separate out the fit-out costs from the building itself have done so to reduce their compliance costs. Their rationale is generally that while they may not get the full deductions for depreciation, the loss of a deduction is offset by the compliance cost savings. That logic no longer applies at a 0% depreciation rate for buildings, so there will be an increase in taxpayers’ compliance costs. However, those costs are minimised by the transitional rule for fit- out. 28.If taxpayers decide to undertake a complete audit of their fit-out to record them separately from the building, Inland Revenue will need to be mindful of the valuation methodology used by taxpayers/valuers to ensure the costs are based on historic cost, less depreciation claimed to that point. 29.Removing building depreciation deductions would also involve increased initial administration costs for Inland Revenue. This includes providing guidance and support for taxpayers to comply with rules changes. 30.Coherence: Removing building depreciation deductions will decrease the coherence of the tax system. A principle underlying the tax system is that generally only the amount of income after deducting any associated costs is taxable. This policy would create an exception to that general rule. 31.It should also be noted that regularly changing the rules on building depreciation affects taxpayer expectation about the predictability of the tax rules and has the potential to undermine certainty in the tax system with flow-on effects to business investor confidence. Item 04 Regulatory Impact Statement | 2 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] donate, distorts donation behaviour and is widely perceived to be unfair. Businesses may delay donating their trading stock until it has a low or nil market value. In the case of perishable goods such as food, this means the donations are typically not accepted by charities and ultimately add to food wastage. Alternatively, businesses may incur costs by entering sponsorship agreements with recipients so they effectively receive a market value in advertising, which is not something all charities are prepared to do. In many other cases, the valuation rule is simply not complied with when goods are donated. We consider the valuation rule has two issues which justify legislative reform. •Issue one: in relation to disposals that are made in the ordinary course of business, the valuation rule over-reaches where the disposal is between non-associated parties. It imposes income tax where there is unlikely to be an integrity concern to address. •Issue two: in relation to disposals that are not made in the ordinary course of business and which are donations, the valuation rule also over-reaches. However, there are also integrity concerns if the valuation rule is not applied to certain donations, such as donations made to individuals or overseas organisations. The compromise that we think balances these concerns is to not apply the valuation rule where the donations are made to approved donee organisations, Donee organisations are generally registered charities that apply their funds wholly or mainly to charitable purposes in New Zealand, or charities that carry out their charitable purposes overseas and have been specifically approved to be donee organisations by Parliament. Removing the valuation rule for donations made to donee organisations would resolve the over-reach for most donations, ensure the tax concessions for donated trading stock and donations of money are consistently targeted, and minimise integrity risks. Government intervention is required to address these two issues In 2021, the Government enacted emergency provisions as part of the COVID-19 response to temporarily support businesses to donate their trading stock and to temporarily remove the application of the rule to non-associated person transactions. 1 This relief meant that during COVID-19 as well as future emergency events agreed by the Minister of Revenue, donations to donee organisations and public authorities would be excluded from the valuation rule, as would be disposals to non-associated parties. Other donations would be removed from the valuation rule and subject to a valuation rule equivalent to cost or opening book value. This relief addresses the two issues outlined above for times of emergency; however, it is due to expire on 31 March 2024. We consider that providing this relief solely in emergency times does not provide a comprehensive answer to the long-standing issues with the application and effect of the rule, which, although they may be more pronounced in an emergency context, exist at all times. We have considered nine different options to address these two issues In relation to issue one, we considered three different options to address the over-reach where there is a disposal between non-associated parties including the status quo option. In relation to issue two, we considered six different options to address the disincentive to donate trading stock including the status quo option. 1 The changes were included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act. The relief was effective from 17 March 2020. Regulatory Impact Statement | 3 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] All options we considered other than the status quo option are regulatory options. Non- regulatory options could not address either issue given the problems stem from unclear legislation and inappropriate policy settings. To address both issues, our preferred option is to (in effect) make the temporary emergency relief permanent for disposals of trading stock to non-associated persons (option two), and to remove the valuation rule for donations of trading stock to donee organisations (option six). We consider this combination of options best reflects general income tax principles while protecting against integrity risks and minimising compliance costs for taxpayers. This approach also aligns, to a large extent, with the current concessionary framework for donations of money, which limits donation deductions to donee organisations. We have consulted with the public on the problem and possible solutions We initially undertook targeted consultation on the problem in 2020 ahead of the enactment of the temporary emergency response provisions. In July 2023 we publicly released an Officials’ Issues Paper outlining our view of the problem and the possible options to address the issues. 2 We received fifteen submissions on the paper and met with submitters to discuss their submissions and our proposed approach to address them between September and December 2023. All submissions supported reform in this area to better reflect taxpayer practice and general income tax principles, although there were some differing views on the best way to achieve this objective. There were differing views on the problem definition. A number of submitters agreed with officials’ view (communicated in the issues paper) that the valuation rule can result in an over-reach in relation to disposals of trading stock that are not donations between non- associated persons (issue one). Others thought that the current valuation rule did not over- reach, because they did not consider the provision would apply to general business disposals of trading stock. We consider these opposing views reflect general uncertainty as to how and when the valuation rule should apply, and point to the need for legislative reform. Some submitters preferred an additional concession for associated person disposals where a disposal to an associated person is also subject to FBT or deemed dividend rules, because they were concerned a “double tax” can arise. We believe the complex interaction with these rules could raise integrity issues if the valuation rule does not apply to these associated party transactions. In addition, double tax concerns for deemed dividends can be addressed by affected businesses through the use of the imputation rules. However, it is an issue we will continue to monitor and will consider in future reviews of the FBT and deemed dividend rules. Several submitters who represent large businesses noted that a legislative response involving donations could be problematic without an appropriate “gift” definition. They took the view all disposals of their trading stock were business transactions, with some being both altruistic as well as good for business. We agree that the tax status of some disposals 2 Disposals of trading stock at below market value – an officials’ issues paper, July 2023, Inland Revenue, available at: https://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/consultation/2023/2023-ip-disposal-tradingstock-below- mktvalue Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section 1: Diagnosi ng the policy proble m W h a t i s t h e c o n t e x t b e h i n d t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m a n d h o w i s t h e st a t u s q u o e x p e c t e d t o d e v e l o p? 1.When a person disposes of trading stock at below market value a special rule in the Income Tax Act 2007 (the ITA) deems them to derive the market value of the trading stock on the date of the disposal (the valuation rule). Further, an amount equal to the market value of the trading stock at the time of disposal is treated as expenditure incurred by the transferee in acquiring the trading stock. 2.The valuation rule has been a long-standing feature of the ITA. A key rationale for the rule is the potential for tax minimisation arrangements to take place in its absence. Without the rule, trading stock could be sold at a deep discount to an associated person for example, allowing the transferor and transferee to benefit from the transferee’s lower rate when they in turn dispose of the property. However, we consider the rule is unnecessarily wide, resulting in unprincipled tax outcomes in relation to disposals of trading stock between non-associated parties. 3.Since before the COVID-19 pandemic, taxpayer representatives have sought revisions to the valuation rule, citing unfairness and concerns that the rule acts as a disincentive to businesses wanting to donate their trading stock. 4.Over the past two decades three separate legislative overrides to the valuation rule have been enacted to address some of these concerns. The overrides mean that a full deduction of the cost of the trading stock was recognised without any deemed income. Most recently, a temporary override was put in place from 2020 for a four-year period to support businesses as part of the Government’s COVID-19 response. This override ends on 31 March 2024. As part of this reform, provision was also made for the temporary relief to be switched on in relation to future emergencies. 5.Although the temporary measures put in place for the COVID-19 response and potential future emergencies did alleviate some of the more immediate concerns of taxpayers, we consider a more permanent solution that also applies in non-emergency times is necessary. 6.In August 2023 we released a public issues paper on the problem and possible solutions to the valuation rule. We received fifteen submissions – the majority from taxpayer representatives, three from large businesses and two from not-for-profit organisations. This, as well as our targeted consultation in 2020 with six taxpayer representatives and one large not-for-profit, has informed our understanding of the problem definition and our analysis of the options. W h a t i s t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m o r o p p o r t u n i t y? 7.We have identified two related issues with the valuation rule: •Issue one: in relation to disposals that are made in the ordinary course of business, the valuation rule over-reaches where the disposal is between non-associated parties. It imposes income tax where there is unlikely to be an integrity concern to address. •Issue two: in relation to disposals that are not made in the ordinary course of business and which are donations, the valuation rule also over-reaches. However, there are also integrity concerns if the valuation rule is not applied to certain donations, such as donations made to individuals or overseas organisations. The compromise that we think balances these concerns is to not apply the valuation rule where the donations are made to approved donee organisations, Donee organisations are generally registered charities that apply their funds wholly or mainly to charitable purposes in New Zealand, or charities that carry out their Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] charitable purposes overseas and have been specifically approved to be donee organisations by Parliament. Removing the valuation rule for donations made to donee organisations would resolve the over-reach for most donations, ensure the tax concessions for donated trading stock and donations of money are consistently targeted, and minimise integrity risks. 8.While submitters all agreed that there were issues with the valuation rule, there were differing views on the exact nature of those issues. For example, some submitters did not consider that the valuation rule would apply to arm’s-length business transactions, and therefore did not consider that the rule could be said to ‘over-reach’ by deeming someone to derive income above the amount economically derived by them. However, other submitters considered the valuation rule did result in over-reach (described as ‘issue one’ in this paper). We consider this uncertainty points to the need for a permanent legislative solution. The Tax Counsel Office is considering the need for guidance to assist with the interpretation of these changes. 9.In general, our consultation in 2020 and 2023 highlighted that to many businesses the valuation rule is unintuitive and unfair and, perhaps as a result, anecdotal evidence suggests that compliance with the rule may be low. W h a t o b j e c t i v e s a r e s o u g h t i n r e l a t i o n t o t he p o l i c y p r o b l e m ? 10.The main objective of this work is to determine a fair and principled approach to the taxation of trading stock disposed of at below market value and the taxation of donated trading stock. 11.A fair and principled approach should protect the revenue base, support taxpayer compliance and withstand the test of time, removing the need for ad-hoc changes to respond to specific emergencies. Section 2: Deciding upon an option to addres s the policy proble m W h a t c r i t e r i a w i l l b e u s e d to c o m p a r e o p t i o n s to t h e s t a t u s q u o ? 12.We have used the following criteria to assess the options against our objectives: •Revenue integrity. Does the option minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and tax evasion? •Efficiency. Does the option raise tax revenue in a way that minimises distortions and costs to the economy? •Compliance costs: Does the option minimise costs for taxpayers? •Coherence: Does the option make sense within the entire tax system? 13.To the extent that there are trade-offs between these criteria their weighting will be determined in light of the overarching objective of determining a ‘fair and principled approach’ to the taxation of disposals of trading stock at below market value and donations of trading stock. Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] W h a t s c o p e w i l l o p t i o n s b e c o n s i d e r e d w i t h i n ? 14.The scope of feasible options is limited to some extent by New Zealand’s long-standing tax policy settings. These settings have been established in line with a broad-base low- rate framework. This framework supports the consistent application of tax across the economy in a non-distortive manner, and thus any departure, including the provision of concessionary treatment, requires strong justification. 15.These settings rule out any options that significantly deviate from the framework in a manner that is unjustified. What is justifiable in this context is informed by the scope and nature of any current concessions, and the connection between the deviation and the pursuit of wider societal imperatives. W h a t o p t i o n s a r e b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d? 16.We have separated out the options as they relate to the two issues with the valuation rule. These options were included in the public issues paper published in August 2023 and our analysis is informed by feedback from submitters on the options. 17.Other than the status quo option, the options are all regulatory in nature. We did not consider any non-regulatory options because the identified issues arise from unclear legislation and policy settings. The following options relate to disposals that are made in the ordinary course of business: Option One – Status quo 18.Option one would maintain the status quo. When the emergency relief ceases in March 2024, businesses would be required to return deemed income at market value when they dispose of their trading stock at below market value to both associated and non- associated parties (outside of limited emergency times). 19.This option ensures there is a backstop principle for goods exchanges. It promotes revenue integrity by protecting the revenue base from the artificial reduction of business profits through transfers of trading stock in ways that result in an incorrect reflection of the real income generated by the business. 20.However, it does not address the identified over-reach in relation to non-associated transactions. Where parties are not associated, we do not consider a valuation rule is necessary; businesses transacting at an arm’s-length are free to set prices as they see fit and not have these interfered with, unless there is something in the nature of tax avoidance which can be dealt with separately under other provisions in the ITA. Option Two – Limit the valuation rule to associated person transactions (officials’ preferred option) 21.To address the identified over-reach, option two would limit the valuation rule to cases where trading stock is disposed at below market value to an associated person. 22.This option recognises that transfers of trading stock between non-associated persons that are below market value and are not donations are nonetheless made by the business for a valid business purpose and therefore the price set by the parties should stand. Any revenue integrity concerns arising from transactions between non- associated persons can be dealt with by the general anti-avoidance rule in the ITA. This option also aligns with some taxpayers’ current view of the operation of the valuation rule. 23.It would reduce compliance costs for businesses not dealing with associated persons who would no longer have to apply the valuation rule. Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Option Three - Retain the deemed market value adjustment and deem the adjustment to be an expense of the taxpayer for non-associated disposals 24.Under this option, the valuation rule would continue to apply as in option two for associated person disposals. For disposals to non-associated persons, the valuation rule would also continue to apply, however, the market value adjustment would be deductible to the transferor provided the disposal met the general permission. The effect of this would be to allow a net deduction for the opening value of the trading stock disposed of at below market value where the disposal was connected with the derivation of business income. 25.Officials considered this option could support revenue integrity by ensuring any deductions have a connection with the derivation of income. However, submitters pointed out that a disposal that was not a donation, and was not to an associated person, would generally have a connection with income (and thus meet the general permission). Hence they did not support this option as it would increase their compliance costs for no real gain in terms of revenue integrity. The following options relate to disposals of trading stock that are not made in the ordinary course of business and are donations Option Four – Status quo 26.Option four would retain the status quo in relation to donations. A person making a donation of trading stock would be treated as deriving the market value of the trading stock, apart from in limited emergency times when the concessionary relief may be switched on. 27.The relief turns off the valuation rule for donations. For businesses donating trading stock to approved donee organisations and public authorities, a concessionary (compared to a cash donation requirement) net deduction is allowed during the emergency period. For businesses donating trading stock to other persons that are not associated, the business is instead deemed to derive income equal to the cost of the trading stock, resulting in neither a net deduction nor net income for tax purposes. 28.This option recognises that during times of emergency there may be a more pressing need for donations of trading stock and a greater desire on the part of businesses to donate. This targets the relief to short periods of time and so generally maintains the broad base low-rate system. 29.However, the option does not address the disincentive to donate outside of limited emergency times. It also results in administration and compliance costs as the relief must be turned on and off and treatment adjusted accordingly. Option Five – Make the temporary relief permanent 30.Option five would make the temporary relief apply at all times (i.e. outside of emergencies such as floods, earthquakes, and pandemics). 31.This option removes the disincentive to donate by introducing a permanent broad concession. However, it lacks coherence with current settings as it is more concessionary than current concessions for donations of money, which are limited in several ways for integrity and fiscal reasons. This is because the temporary relief was mainly developed with the COVID-19 emergency context in mind and with the understanding that it would apply for limited periods only. A sustainable permanent option should more closely align with the current concessionary regime for donations of money. Regulatory Impact Statement | 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Option Six – Make the temporary relief permanent for donations to donee organisations only (officials’ preferred option) 32.Option six would align the temporary relief with the current donation deduction framework to a large extent, by limiting the relief so that it is only available in relation to donations of trading stock to donee organisations. The concession would be available for all types of trading stock, in contrast to the temporary relief which excluded land and timber. This would remove the current disincentive to donate trading stock to donee organisations whilst utilising an existing integrity measure (the requirements for becoming a donee organisation) to protect the revenue base. The rationale for this relief is the same as the rationale for providing relief for donations of money, which is to encourage and reinforce giving by lowering the cost of giving. 33.Unlike the rules for donations of money made by companies and Māori authorities, this option does not require the net donation deduction to be capped to the donor’s net income. While a cap would align this option more closely with the donation rules, the compliance and administrative costs and complexity of applying a cap to all businesses subject to the valuation rule, including trustees and sole traders, would outweigh the benefits of alignment. We consider that a restriction of the concession to donee organisations is sufficient to address integrity concerns in the case of trading stock disposals. 34.We do not consider that a permanent concession should be extended to include donations to public authorities, as is available under the temporary relief. This would create an inconsistency with the existing donation framework and was only introduced as a temporary measure due to COVID-19 and the donations being made to hospitals. Option Seven – Make the temporary relief permanent for donations to donee organisations subject to several limitations 35.Option seven limits the relief provided in option six for donations to donee organisations to further align the relief with the current donation deduction framework: •In relation to donations of trading stock to donee organisations, the valuation rule would continue to apply; however, a deduction would also be available for the market value adjustment (provided the donation is made to a donee organisation). The net effect of this is to allow a deduction for the opening value of the donated trading stock. This deemed deduction approach would also allow Inland Revenue to monitor use of the concession to ensure businesses comply with the rules and there is no unanticipated abuse of the concession that would warrant application of the avoidance provisions and/or a policy response. However, this approach would not reduce compliance costs for businesses that want to donate their trading stock. •The value of the deduction available to businesses that donate their trading stock to donee organisations would be limited to the net income of the business in the income year the donation is made (if the donee is not an individual) or otherwise their taxable income. 36.This option would ensure the tax rules for donations of trading stock align with the broad donation framework, and that they do not act as a disincentive for businesses donating trading stock to donee organisations. 37.However, this option does not reduce compliance costs for businesses, who are still required to determine the market value of their trading stock upon donating it and return this as income. Compared to the status quo, they are additionally required to claim this market value amount as an expense in order to receive a net deduction. Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Submitters have pointed out that, from a compliance perspective, it would be simpler for businesses to not return any income in relation to the donation, which would also remove the need to create a deemed expense. 38.The imposition of a cap on the value of deductions would also increase compliance costs for businesses compared to the temporary relief, as they would be required to keep track of the value of trading stock donated to donee organisations. Option Eight – Deem all donors to derive income at cost or opening value of the donated trading stock 39.Option eight removes the direct cost of donated trading stock from the tax base entirely (rather than allowing a concession for any donation of trading stock). This is achieved by changing the valuation rule from a market value adjustment to a lower of cost or opening value adjustment. The effect of this option is that the deduction and deemed income net off so that there is minimal tax impact on the making of a donation (the donor would still deduct overhead and indirect costs relating to the trading stock). This treatment would be available for all donations of trading stock, no matter the recipient. 40.This option reduces compliance costs for businesses compared with the status quo, to the extent that it is easier to identify the cost of the trading stock compared to market value. It also maintains the broad-base low-rate framework. However, it would create a significant inconsistency between goods used for private consumption and goods subject to deemed dividend rules (which remain subject to market value calculations) compared to goods which are donated (which would be subject to a cost adjustment). This could create integrity and coherence issues. Further, the requirement to make a cost adjustment for all donation disposals will continue to impose compliance costs on businesses. Option Nine – Provide specific relief for donations of food only 41.Option nine was also considered as a narrow concession for donations of food only that addresses the environmental impact of the current rules. Under the status quo, businesses that donate food may in some cases have a tax liability if the market value of the donation is greater than its opening value. Because food is perishable, this disincentive may result in increased food waste. 42.This would create a more limited concession; however, it would not address the disincentive to donate other types of trading stock with equal benefit to the community.

It also addresses the disincentive to donate trading stock to donee organisations specifically, by turning off the valuation rule (allowing a net deduction for the opening value of the donation) when trading stock is donated to a donee organisation. 45.We consider this approach to donations of trading stock strikes the right balance between achieving alignment with the current rules for donations (and thus protecting the revenue base) and limiting compliance costs for businesses. Although it does not achieve complete alignment with the settings for donations of money (unlike option seven which allowed for monitoring of the deductions claimed by businesses and required the value of deductions claimed to not exceed a net income cap), we consider the requirement for the donation to be to a donee organisation for the business to access the concession sufficiently addresses any integrity concerns, whilst also appropriately limiting compliance costs for businesses. 46.In relation to disposals that are not donations, we consider this combination of options sufficiently addresses revenue integrity concerns by protecting the tax base from artificial transfers of trading stock between associated parties for their timing benefits, whilst promoting efficiency and reducing compliance costs for disposals to non- associates that we consider to be of low-to-no risk from a revenue integrity perspective.

Item 05 Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 12. Most people do not experience any negative effects from online gambling. However, gambling can be highly addictive and can lead to harm to individuals and the wider community. The proportion of people who sought help for gambling harm related to online gambling has almost doubled between 2018 and 2022. 7 Online casino gambling is likely to be at least as harmful as Class 4 gaming machines, with harmful features such as the continuous nature of play, 24/7 accessibility and its appeal to young people. W h a t i s t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m o r o p p o r t u n i t y? 13. Offshore online casino websites face lower taxes compared to New Zealand casinos and gaming machines as well as the taxes that apply to online casinos in the UK and some European countries. This may allow online casinos to offer more attractive odds or promotions to New Zealand gambling customers. To the extent that this encourages gambling activity to be conducted through online casinos, it will result in reduced tax revenues compared to if the gambling had been conducted through New Zealand operators. It is also likely to result in an increase in overall gambling harm given the accessibility of online gambling and that unlike New Zealand licenced operators, offshore providers are not required under New Zealand regulation to employ any harm minimisation practices. 14. That said, many online casinos comply with gambling regulations in other countries which include taxes and harm minimisation, so if New Zealand customers gamble using these compliant operators, harm minimisation will be better compared to non-compliant operators. 15. Regardless, offshore providers are likely to result in increased gambling harm given that, unlike New Zealand licenced operators, they are not subject to New Zealand gambling regulations which require harm minimisation practices. Online gambling is likely to be at least as harmful as gaming machines (pokies). It has features which increase the risk of harm such as the continuous nature of play, its 24/7 accessibility on mobile phones and other devices, and its appeal to young people and other vulnerable members of society. 16. Previous surveys indicate that online gambling is more prevalent among Māori, young people (aged 16 to 24 years), men, and Pacific women, than other population groups. 8 The status quo is expected to have a larger impact on these groups. However, due to data limitations we have not attempted to quantify the impacts for particular segments of gambling consumers. 17. Due to the time constraints mentioned in the constraints section, we have not publicly consulted on the problem or the specific tax options analysed in this RIS with stakeholders, including gambling operators, community groups, or specific populations of gamblers. Instead, we have relied on information from the Department of Internal Affairs gambling officials who have insights about these stakeholders and information provided through previous consultation or public comment. 18. The Department of Internal Affairs publicly consulted on regulating online gambling in 2019. While the focus of that consultation was on potential regulations to minimise harm, 7 Intervention services data, Ministry of Health, 2022 8 The Ministry of Health’s Health and Lifestyles survey found that Māori are more likely to gamble on online casino websites than non-Māori. The rate of Māori gambling on online casino websites has been increasing significantly over the years, from 1.3 percent in 2012 to 4.7 percent in 2020. 32 percent of people accessing clinical services who recorded online gambling as one of the types of gambling causing them harm identified as Māori. While data is limited, evidence suggests that young people (aged 16 to 24 years) and men may also be relatively more likely to have gambled on online casino websites. Pacific women were significantly more likely to gamble online than non-Pacific women, but Pacific men were less likely to gamble online than non-Pacific men. Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] some submitters commented on applying taxes to online gambling operators. 9 One submitter noted the additional revenue from online gambling operators would result in more tax revenue and ensure more gambling activity is conducted through compliant operators (compared to non-compliant operators). Two submitters suggested a taxation system based on gross betting revenue. These submitters believed this would be the most effective method of collecting tax. One submitter stated the taxation rate should be competitive for operators and not exceed global best practice rates. 19.SkyCity, which operates four of New Zealand’s six casinos, has made public comment that “SkyCity supports the taxation of the online gaming market”. 10 W h a t o b j e c t i v e s a r e s o u g h t i n r e l a t i o n t o t he p o l i c y p r o b l e m ? 20.The objectives are to increase tax collection and to minimise gambling harm. 21.There is a trade-off. If the proposed taxes have high compliance costs, some of the affected operators may choose to respond by blocking or reducing promotions to their New Zealand customers or by not complying with the taxes or other regulations. This may lead to New Zealand customers conducting more gambling activity through non- compliant operators which would reduce tax collection and increase gambling harm (as non-compliant operators are less likely to apply harm minimisation measures such as promoting problem gambling services).

Will it protect the sustainability of the gambling tax base going forward? Will the proposed taxes maximise the gambling activity that is conducted through compliant operators (compared to non-compliant operators)? •Harm minimisation: Does the option minimise the harm caused by problem gambling? Does it channel New Zealand gambling customers towards compliant operators who implement harm minimisation measures? •Fairness: Will the option be perceived by stakeholders as improving fairness? Would online casino operators face similar taxes as New Zealand gambling providers, other types of offshore businesses, and the taxes which apply to online casino gambling in other countries? Do the options avoid unintended distortions to competition, consumer, or business decisions? •Compliance costs: Do the options encourage online casino operators to comply with their tax obligations with low compliance costs? Do they minimise the additional compliance costs which would be imposed on operators by the option? 9 Microsoft Word - Online Gambling - Summary of Submissions (dia.govt.nz), page 36. 10 Online casinos ‘aggressively targeting’’ New Zealand (newsroom.co.nz). 10 October 2022. Regulatory Impact Statement | 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] •Coherence: Do the options make sense in the context of New Zealand’s overall tax system including how offshore businesses are generally taxed? Is the option consistent with New Zealand’s international tax and trade agreements. •Administration costs: Are the options possible for Inland Revenue to implement in the necessary timeframe and administer without substantial ongoing administration costs? W h a t o p t i o n s a r e b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d? Option One: Status quo 23.Option one is the status quo where the only tax applying to offshore casino websites is GST. 24.Accordingly, these websites face significantly lower taxes compared to New Zealand casinos and gaming machines that they compete with. This may allow online casinos to offer more attractive odds or promotions to New Zealand gambling customers. To the extent that this encourages gambling activity to be conducted through online casinos it will result in reduced tax revenues and contributions to New Zealand community groups. It is also likely to result in an increase in overall gambling harm given the accessibility of online gambling and that unlike New Zealand licenced operators, offshore providers are not required by New Zealand regulation to employ any harm minimisation practices (although they may do so voluntarily or because they comply with harm minimisation regulations imposed by other countries). 25.These problems are expected to become worse over time as the amount of gambling conducted by New Zealanders on offshore casino websites continues to grow (we have forecast it may grow by 5% each year). Option Two: Tax consistently with New Zealand casinos 26.Option 2 would aim to tax online casinos in the same manner as casinos that are physically located in New Zealand. These taxes are GST, a 4% casino duty on gross betting revenue (GBR) and a 28% income tax on profits. Officials estimate this would equate to an effective tax rate of approximately 26% of GBR. 11 27.To the extent that online casinos have similar characteristics and compete with New Zealand casinos this option would improve fairness. New Zealand casinos provide gambling to people who are in New Zealand (including tourists), whereas online casinos are based offshore and can offer a wide range of gambling products to customers in many countries. New Zealand casinos are also different from online casinos because they have exclusive casino licences, are more regulated, employ many New Zealand staff and offer many other services besides gambling. 28.Although it is technically possible to apply income tax to online casinos which are located offshore, we are not aware of any other country that does this. Instead, they apply gaming duties, which are consumption taxes on GBR. 29.Current international tax settings generally only impose income tax on non-resident business income when it is generated through a physical presence in New Zealand. In this regard, option 2 would provide less fair and coherent taxation of online casinos compared to how other offshore businesses are taxed. 30.New Zealand’s 40 double tax agreements prevent New Zealand from collecting income tax on non-resident businesses from these treaty partners unless the income is attributable to a physical presence in New Zealand. Currently, most online casinos are in jurisdictions such as Malta and Gibraltar which New Zealand does not have double 11 Because GST on gambling is collected on a GST-inclusive basis, it is equivalent to a 13% tax on GBR. The 26% of GBR comprises 13% for GST plus 4% for casino duty plus 9% for income tax (28% income tax on an assumed profit of 33% of GBR is 28% x 0.33 = 9%). Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] tax agreements with. However, there is a risk that an online casino could be relocated so it is a tax resident of one of the 40 treaty partners. It may be possible to require online casinos to be located in New Zealand in order to legally provide gambling to New Zealanders, but such a requirement could potentially be challenged under a relevant trade agreement. 31.Applying income tax would also impose compliance costs on the affected casinos as they would need to calculate their New Zealand-sourced profits and comply with international tax rules. To avoid incurring these compliance costs it is likely that some online casinos would choose to leave the New Zealand market by blocking New Zealand customers, rather than become liable for New Zealand income tax. This could lead to more gambling activity being conducted with non-compliant operators who are less likely to use harm minimisation measures which could increase gambling harm compared to the status quo. 12 32.Because it would require Inland Revenue to monitor and enforce income tax and international tax rules, option 2 would have higher administrative costs than the status quo and option 3. Option Three: Tax consistently with gaming machines 33.This option would seek to tax online casinos consistently with gaming machines. This approach would improve fairness by ensuring online casinos pay similar gaming duties to the gaming machines (pokies) operating in pubs and clubs. 34.These gaming machines are subject to GST and a 20% gaming machine duty on GBR. Income subject to the 20% gaming machine duty is exempt from income tax. 35.Compared to option 2, which involved a low 4% rate of gaming duty and income tax, applying a higher rate of gaming duty (20% under option 3 or 12% under option 4) and not applying income tax would be simpler and more coherent with international tax policy settings. It would also be more consistent with the fact that some European countries apply gaming duties (but not income tax) to offshore online gambling. 36.Under option 3, the total tax collected would be 33% of GBR (a combination of GST 13 and gaming machine duty) which would be higher than taxes imposed by larger online gambling markets in the United Kingdom (21% of GBR) and European countries (ranging from 11% in Belgium to 29% in the Netherlands). 37.Because it imposes the highest overall tax rate, option 3 may collect more revenue than options 2 and 4 but is likely to have the biggest negative impact and downside risk on the amount of gambling activity that occurs through compliant online casino operators. 38.Imposing a high overall tax rate could make the New Zealand market much less profitable for online casinos. This significantly increases the risk that some online casino providers may choose to block or reduce promotions to New Zealand customers and focus on attracting customers from other countries instead. In response, New Zealand customers may shift their gambling activity to non-compliant online casino providers who do not pay any New Zealand taxes (including GST), which would result in a loss of tax revenues. 39.This behaviour would also undermine harm minimisation. Non-compliant operators are unlikely to implement any measures to mitigate harm (such as promoting problem gambling services). In contrast, compliant operators may voluntarily implement or comply with harm minimisation measures required by other countries. 12 Tax compliant operators are more likely to implement harm minimisation measures voluntarily or because they comply with harm minimisation regulations imposed by other countries. 13 Because GST on gambling is collected on a GST-inclusive basis, it is equivalent to a 13% tax on GBR. i.e. if a gambler bets and loses $115, GST of $15 (13% of the $115 of gross betting revenue) is collected. Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 40. Option 3 would impose compliance costs on online casino operators compared to the status quo. These compliance costs include one-off costs of changes to IT systems and commercial practices to account for the new gaming duty (or block New Zealand customers if they choose to leave the New Zealand market). These implementation costs are expected to be low for those operators which already have similar systems in place for collecting GST. 41. Option 3 is expected to have slightly higher administration costs compared to the status quo as it would require Inland Revenue to implement systems changes and allocate compliance resources to assist the affected operators and their tax agents to comply with the new gaming duty. Option 4: Align with tax rates imposed in other countries (officials’ preferred option) 42. This option would seek to tax online casinos at a rate that is in line with the tax that other jurisdictions apply to online casinos. 43. Under option 4, services provided by online casinos would remain subject to GST in New Zealand. It is proposed that a new gaming duty of 12% would apply on top of the GST. This would result in online casinos paying the equivalent to a 25% tax on GBR. 44. An overall tax rate of 25% would put New Zealand near the midpoint of jurisdictions that impose gaming duties on online casino operators. Spain and Portugal apply a 25% tax rate while Denmark (28%) and the Netherlands (29%) apply higher rates. Other countries apply lower tax rates, including Belgium (11%), Italy (20%), UK (21%), Sweden (22%) and the Czech Republic (23%). 45. The main advantage of ensuring that the overall tax rate and compliance costs are internationally comparable is that it reduces the risk of online casinos responding to the higher costs and reduced profitability of operating in the New Zealand market by blocking or reducing promotions to their New Zealand customers. This reduces the corresponding risk that New Zealand customers shift their gambling activity to non-compliant online casinos, who do not pay taxes and are unlikely to implement harm minimisation measures. 46. In the racing and sports betting context, online betting providers are subject to both GST and 10% point of consumption charges in New Zealand. It is noted that this level of taxation (a 23% total tax rate) did not appear to cause any online racing and sports betting providers to leave the New Zealand market. However, the nature of the racing and sports betting market may be different than the online casino market. 47. A total tax of 25% would be a similar overall tax rate as option 2 (tax consistently with New Zealand casinos which is estimated to be roughly 26% of GBR). However, option 4 would have lower compliance costs and is expected to collect more tax revenue than option 2. 48. A disadvantage of option 4 is that it may be perceived as less fair by some gambling stakeholders compared to options 2 or 3. This is because 12% would be less than the 20% gaming machine duty which applies to gaming machines in pubs or clubs. It could be opposed by these gaming machine operators or lead to lobbying to reduce the rate of gaming machine duty to align it with offshore websites. Also, as the proposed 12% gaming duty would be more than the 4% casino duty, New Zealand casinos may seek policy changes to apply a lower 4% duty on gaming conducted through their offshore websites on the basis that they see this as being part of their casino, rather than a separate type of gambling activity. Other countries such as the UK have different gaming duty rates for online gambling (21%) compared to casinos (a progressive 15%-50% structure increasing with GBR) and gaming machines (5% to 25% depending on the cost to play and prize value). 49. As with option 3, option 4 would impose some one-off compliance costs for online casinos from changes to IT systems and commercial practices to account for the new gaming duty, although these costs are expected to be low for those providers which Regulatory Impact Statement | 13 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] W h a t o p t i on i s l i k e l y t o b e s t a d d r e s s t h e p r o b l e m , m e e t t h e p o l i c y o b j e c t i v e s , a n d d e l i v e r t h e h i g h e s t n e t b e n e f i t s? 50. Officials recommend taxing online casino operators in line with the tax rates imposed in other countries (option 4). 51. While option 4 would mean online casinos would face lower tax rates than New Zealand casinos or gaming machines, tax collection and fairness would still be significantly improved compared to the status quo. Compared to the other reform options, option 4 is expected to lead to the most gambling activity being conducted with compliant operators. For this reason, it would significantly improve tax collection without undermining the Government’s harm minimisation objective. 52. Options 2 or 3 would involve a higher risk of New Zealand gamblers moving to non- compliant operators as the overall costs imposed on operators which complied with New Zealand’s tax rules would be significantly higher than the taxes applied by other countries. Compliant operators could put less effort into attracting New Zealand customers and may respond by choosing to block New Zealand customers from accessing their websites rather than face the high tax costs. This makes it likely that more New Zealand gamblers would gamble using non-compliant operators who do not comply with taxes and are unlikely to implement any harm minimisation measures.

Inland Revenue will need to update its systems and allocate compliance resources to assist the affected operators and their tax agents to comply with the changes.

Right of non-disclosure for tax advice
======================================

2005 amendment introduces a statutory right not to disclose certain confidential documents for tax advice provided by tax advisors.

_**Sections 17A, 20B-20G, and 81B of the Tax Administration Act 1994**_

A statutory right not to disclose certain confidential documents, has been introduced for tax advice provided by tax advisors. It applies to communications between advisors and taxpayers for the main purpose of providing or receiving tax advice.

The non-disclosure right is subject to a number of exclusions such as for factual information, debt collection advice, accounting and tax work papers and matters of fraud. Tax advice does not include such matters as valuation and investment advice. The amendments do not affect legal professional privilege.

Inland Revenue has issued a Standard Practice Statement providing guidelines on how the non-disclosure right will operate.

### Background

Under the Tax Administration Act 1994, professional privilege has been available to lawyers for confidential communications with their clients about tax matters. This means that information that is subject to privilege is not required to be disclosed to Inland Revenue. The same right of non-disclosure has not been available to chartered accountants and other tax advisors who have a similar tax advice function to that of lawyers. There have been administrative protocols that govern the means by which Inland Revenue should seek access to information held by accountants but no statutory right of non-disclosure.

However, accountants should be able to give candid and independent advice to their clients, as lawyers do, without the need to disclose that advice to Inland Revenue. The benefit of enabling this to occur is that the advice can promote voluntary compliance by taxpayers with the tax system and give rise to a consequent reduction in compliance and administrative costs.

In May 2002 a government discussion document, _Tax and Privilege: a proposed new structure_, was released for public consultation. The new amendments, while aiming to achieve the same objectives, differ from the earlier proposals set out in the 2002 discussion document.

### Key features

New section 20B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 introduces a non-disclosure right for certain confidential documents created between tax advisors and their clients when the Commissioner is seeking disclosure of these documents under the information-gathering powers contained in sections 16-19 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Such documents ("tax advice documents") are subject to the non-disclosure right if they are brought into existence for the main purpose of giving or receiving advice on New Zealand tax laws. A document that is created for the purpose of committing or promoting an illegal or wrongful act such as fraud does not qualify for the right of non-disclosure.

The right of non-disclosure belongs to the affected taxpayer. This means that taxpayers may withdraw the non-disclosure claim if they choose to provide the relevant tax advice documents to Inland Revenue.

To qualify for the non-disclosure right, the taxpayer's advisor who provided the tax advice needs to be subject to the code of conduct and disciplinary processes of an organisation (an "approved advisor group") that has been approved by Inland Revenue and meets certain other criteria.

New section 20D sets out the rules for claiming the right of non-disclosure. It must be claimed in writing and must include a brief description of the document and the name of the tax advisor who provided the tax advice. The taxpayer (or the tax advisor on the taxpayer's behalf) will need to make the claim within a specific period. This is generally within 28 days from the date that the Commissioner issued the information demand.

New section 20F provides that certain information ("tax contextual information") must be disclosed from the tax advice documents if the Commissioner requires such a disclosure. If it is necessary for proper administration of the revenue, a request for the tax contextual information may be made at the same time as the original information demand is issued.

In most cases, however, when a claim for non-disclosure is made in response to an information demand, only those documents not subject to the non-disclosure right will be required to be produced initially. Inland Revenue will assess that material provided it includes the details provided in the claim for non-disclosure to determine whether it is sufficient to complete the investigation. Disclosure of tax contextual information will be required when the information provided is insufficient.

Examples of tax contextual information are:

*   factual information relating to transactions entered into by the taxpayer, including information about the purpose of the transaction;
*   accounting and tax work papers that contain information which supports the financial statements and/or the tax return;
*   matters concerning the collection of tax debts.

This information must be disclosed by way of a statutory declaration by the tax advisor in a form prescribed by Inland Revenue. This form is the IR 520.

A number of remedies are available if the progress of an investigation is deliberately impeded through abuse of the non-disclosure rules. If a tax advisor is convicted of any of these offences, a court may order that the advisor be barred from making statutory declarations of tax contextual information.

The secrecy provisions have also been amended to allow Inland Revenue to advise the approved advisor group if a recognised tax agent breaches the rules relating to non-disclosure - for example, by making a false statutory declaration.

Inland Revenue has issued a Standard Practice Statement providing guidelines on how the non-disclosure right will operate.

#### Application date

The new non-disclosure right will apply to requests for information made after the date of enactment.

### Detailed analysis

##### Section 20B: No requirement to disclose tax advice document

Certain communications are not required to be disclosed under Inland Revenue's information-gathering provisions (sections 16-19 of the Tax Administration Act).

The non-disclosure right applies to a "book or document" that is a "tax advice document". The term "book or document" is defined to include:

*   ... all books, accounts, rolls, records, registers and papers, and other documents, and all photographic plates, microfilms, photostatic negatives, prints, tapes, discs, computer reels, perforated rolls or any other type of record whatever."

The definition includes both paper and electronic communications such as letters, reports, memos,  
file-notes, mails and electronically stored data.

Under section 20B(2) a document is eligible to be a tax advice document if it is:

*   confidential; and
*   created by a person for the main purpose of instructing a tax advisor who is a member of an approved advisor group to provide advice on tax laws; or
*   created by a tax advisor, or an employee of a tax advisor's firm, if the document was brought into existence for the main purpose of:
    *   recording research and analysis that is performed for the main purpose of enabling the tax advisor to give tax advice on tax laws to a taxpayer about the taxpayer's own affairs; or
    *   giving advice on tax laws by the tax advisor to a taxpayer about the taxpayer's own affairs, or recording the advice given.

The term "tax law" is a defined term in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act and means:

*   a provision of the Inland Revenue Acts or an Act that an Inland Revenue Act replaces;
*   an Order in Council or a regulation made under another tax law;
*   a non-disputable decision; and
*   in relation to an obligation to provide a tax return or a tax form, also includes a provision of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 or a regulation made under that Act or the Accident Insurance Act 1998 or a regulation made under that Act or the Injury Prevention Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2001 or a regulation made under that Act.

Accordingly, the tax advice must be about New Zealand tax rules, as they affect the taxpayer in question. Advice about the effect and application of tax laws in other jurisdictions will not be subject to the non-disclosure right.

Advice given for the furtherance of illegal or wrongful acts, or in relation to impending or future illegal or wrongful acts, is specifically excluded from the non-disclosure right by section 20B(2)(c). This includes fraud and tax evasion.

Under subsection (3) a tax advice document must satisfy the following criteria:

*   it must be eligible to be a tax advice document under subsection (2), as described above; and
*   a valid claim for non-disclosure must be made under section 20D, and the taxpayer on whose behalf the non-disclosure right is claimed must satisfy the requirements of section 20E (attachments to tax advice documents) and section 20F (disclosure of tax contextual information) if required.

The term "tax advisor" is defined in subsection (4) as a natural person who is subject to the code of conduct and disciplinary processes of an "approved advisor group".

##### Section 20C: Treatment of document

Documents that may be eligible for the non-disclosure right will be treated as tax advice documents from the time an information demand is made. If no claim for the right is made, this status will cease when the taxpayer informs Inland Revenue that no claim is to be made, or on the date the claim is required to be made by.

If a claim is made for the non-disclosure right, the status as a tax advice document will cease when:

*   the District Court rules that the document is not a tax advice document; or
*   the taxpayer agrees in writing that the document is not a tax advice document; or
*   the taxpayer withdraws the claim; or
*   the approved advisor group advises that the tax advisor was not a member of the group at the relevant time.

While a document is treated as a tax advice document, a copy of the tax advice document must be held by the tax advisor in a secure place.

##### Section 20D: Claim that document is a tax advice document

Consistent with the fact that the non-disclosure right belongs to the taxpayer, a claim for the right must be made by the taxpayer or the tax advisor on the taxpayer's behalf. If the tax advisor makes the claim, he or she must certify that they are authorised to act on the taxpayer's behalf.

If the tax advice document was prepared by the taxpayer, the claim must include a brief description of the form and contents of the document, the name of the tax advisor and the date of the document. If the tax advice document was prepared by the tax advisor, the claim must include a brief description of the form and content of the document, the name of the tax advisor, the name of the approved advisor group, the statute and type of revenue to which the advice relates, and the date of the document.

A claim relating to an information demand under section 16 (Commissioner may access premises to obtain information) or section 16B (Powers to remove and copy documents) must be made by the day on which Inland Revenue exercises the right to inspection or removal, or a later date that has been agreed by the Commissioner.

If the information demand is issued under section 17 (Information to be furnished on request of Commissioner) the claim must be made by the later of the date when information is required to be provided, or 28 days after the date in the information demand.

If the information demand is made under section 17A (Court orders for production of information or return), section 18 (Inquiry before a District Court Judge) or section 19 (Inquiry by Commissioner) the claim for the non-disclosure right must be made by the date when the information is required to be produced.

##### Section 20E: Document included in tax advice document

Attachments that exist independently of the tax advice document (created for a different purpose than the tax advice subject to non-disclosure) will not be protected unless they qualify for non-disclosure in their own right. For example, a sale and purchase agreement attached to a non-disclosable document would not be subject to non-disclosure. However, attachments that form part of the non-disclosable document (and do not have separate existence) will be treated as part of the tax advice document.

##### Section 20F: Tax contextual information

Even though the tax advice document is protected from disclosure, a description of tax contextual information included in the document may need to be disclosed by way of a statutory declaration made by an authorised tax advisor. The statutory declaration should reflect the tax advisor's view of the relevant transaction. If the tax advisor wishes to disclose the information verbatim from the tax advice document, this is acceptable.

Generally, the initial information demand will not include a requirement to disclose tax contextual information. However, such a requirement may apply if it is considered necessary for the proper administration of the revenue. In most cases, a demand for tax contextual information will not be made until the disclosable material and a claim for non-disclosure has been received and analysed. Generally only if that material does not provide sufficient information to complete the investigation will a subsequent demand be made for the disclosure of the tax contextual information from the tax advice documents.

If an information demand is made under section 16 (Commissioner may access premises to obtain information) or section 16B (Power to remove and copy documents) and the taxpayer claims the right of non-disclosure, the taxpayer (via their authorised tax advisor) will be required to disclose the tax contextual information from those tax advice documents by the date determined by the Commissioner.

If the original information demand is made under section 17 (Information to be furnished on request of Commissioner) the description of tax contextual information must be provided by the later of:

*   the date prescribed by the Commissioner; or
*   28 days after the date given in the information demand requiring disclosure of the tax contextual information.

If the information demand is made under section 17A (Court orders for production of information or return), section 18 (Inquiry before a District Court Judge) or section 19 (Inquiry by Commissioner) the disclosure must be made by the date when the information is required to be produced.

"Tax contextual information" means:

*   facts or assumptions which are provided to a taxpayer in contemplation of actual transactions entered into by the taxpayer, or a similar transaction being investigated by Inland Revenue;
*   steps involved in the performance of a transaction actually entered into by the taxpayer, or a similar transaction being investigated by Inland Revenue;
*   advice that does not concern the operation and effect of tax laws (for example, valuation and investment advice);
*   advice on the collection of tax debts;
*   facts or assumptions relating to non-tax advice; and
*   accounting and tax work papers that contain information which supports the financial statements and/or a tax return of a taxpayer.

The statutory declaration must be made by a tax advisor who has authority to act on behalf of the taxpayer, and has not been barred from making statutory declarations. A court could bar the advisor if he or she is convicted of an offence under:

*   section 111 of the Crimes Act 1961 (false statements or declarations);
*   section 143(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (not supplying information when required to do so by a tax law);
*   section 143A(1)(b) or (c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (knowingly not supplying information when required to do so by a tax law, or providing altered, false, incomplete or misleading information);
*   section 143B(1)(b) or (c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (knowingly not supplying information for the purpose of evading tax, or providing altered, false, incomplete or misleading information); or
*   section 143H of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (obstruction).

##### Section 20G: Challenges

The taxpayer or Inland Revenue can apply to a District Court Judge for an order determining whether:

*   the document is a tax advice document; or
*   information provided is tax contextual information; or
*   a more detailed or better description of tax contextual information is required.

The District Court judge may require the document to be produced to the court.

An application for the court order may be made in the course of a section 18 inquiry to the judge who is holding the inquiry.

##### Secrecy

New section 81B provides that Inland Revenue may divulge information to an approved advisor group about a member who breaches the non-disclosure rules. This will allow the approved advisor group to take disciplinary action, if required against the offending tax advisor

##### Consequential amendments

Section 17A, which relates to court orders for production of information or returns, is being amended. Currently, under subsection (7), a court may order that information should be produced to the court and reviewed in order to determine whether an order should be made for the information to be provided to Inland Revenue, and whether the information is subject to legal professional privilege. Subsection (7) has been amended to provide a similar rule in relation to the non-disclosure right.
Regulatory I mpact Statement | 1 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Regulatory Impact Statement: Approved issuer levy retrospective registration Coversheet Purpose of Document Decision sought: Analysis produced for the purpose of informing final Cabinet decisions Advising agencies: Inland Revenue Proposing Ministers: Minister of Revenue and Minister of Finance Date finalised: 31 May 2024 Problem Definition If a borrower does not register a security for approved issuer levy (AIL) before interest is paid, Inland Revenue does not currently have any administrative flexibility to allow AIL to be paid on that interest. This has significant implications for New Zealand borrowers that do not meet the AIL registration requirements on time, but would otherwise be eligible for AIL, as they are required to withhold non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) at 15% (or 10% under a double tax treaty) on interest payments to non-resident lenders, instead of paying AIL at 2%. This has the effect of increasing the cost of capital for some New Zealand borrowers that the AIL regime was intended to help. While this is not a widespread issue, there is a case to allow retrospective registration in some limited circumstances. Executive Summary Background The AIL regime was introduced in 1991 to help lower the cost of capital to New Zealand borrowers when borrowing from unassociated non-resident lenders. Where a New Zealand borrower pays interest to an unassociated non-resident lender, it would generally be required to withhold NRWT at 15% (or 10% if the lender is in a country that has a double tax treaty with New Zealand) on the interest payments and remit this to Inland Revenue. However, foreign lenders typically demand a certain after-tax return on their investment. Therefore, unless the lender can easily claim a full tax credit for New Zealand NRWT in its home jurisdiction, which can be relatively uncommon, it will likely require the borrower to ‘gross up’ their interest payments to cover the NRWT. 1 This increases the cost of capital for the New Zealand borrower. The AIL regime significantly reduces the tax cost for many New Zealand borrowers by providing them with the option to pay a 2% ‘approved issuer levy’ to Inland Revenue on the interest paid to the foreign lender, instead of having the interest subject to the NRWT regime at 10%/15%. 1 This is where the interest rate is effectively increased so that after NRWT is withheld the lender still receives the amount it would require in the absence of NRWT. Regulatory Impact Statement | 2 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] There were approximately 1,200 taxpayers filing AIL returns and making AIL payments totalling $153m for the year ended 30 June 2023. Registration requirements To be eligible to pay AIL on a particular security, the borrower is required: (i) to register as an approved issuer for AIL; and (ii) to register the security for AIL before an interest payment is made. This is appropriate as NRWT is required to be withheld from the interest payments to the borrower if the security is not registered, and it is much simpler to withhold NRWT at the point the interest is paid. However, most lenders require borrowers to either pay AIL or gross up their interest payments to cover the NRWT, such that the tax cost falls on the borrower and so AIL at 2% is preferred. If a borrower makes a mistake by not registering for AIL in time, they are liable for NRWT on any interest paid on the security to date at 10%/15%. While late registration for AIL is not a common issue, Inland Revenue is aware of several borrowers that have found themselves in this situation and voluntarily disclosed it to Inland Revenue (or had it picked up on review upon registration) asking for the Commissioner to apply his ‘care and management’ discretion under section 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Inland Revenue’s practice in such cases has been to enforce collection of NRWT on any interest paid prior to registration as it does not have the administrative flexibility or discretion to allow retrospective registration for AIL. The lack of administrative flexibility can be a problem for three main reasons: 1. It is contrary to the intent of the AIL regime which is designed to reduce the cost of capital for borrowers where the lender would otherwise pass the tax cost onto the borrower. 2. It provides outcomes in some circumstances that could be seen as unfair and incoherent. For example, a borrower who has registered a security but has not paid AIL or withheld NRWT is still permitted to pay AIL at 2% on the interest when the mistake is discovered (albeit with use of money interest and potential penalties). This can be contrasted with a borrower who has not registered a security but has paid AIL; they remain liable for NRWT at 10%/15%. The second borrower has a significantly higher tax cost even though they were arguably less non-compliant than the first borrower by advising Inland Revenue of the interest payments through the AIL return and paying AIL on time (albeit accepting they were not entitled to do so because of the failure to register the security). 3. If taxpayers know that informing Inland Revenue of an administrative mistake will result in a larger than expected tax bill, they may decide not to disclose it, undermining voluntary compliance in respect of AIL/NRWT. Government intervention is required if the Government wishes for Inland Revenue to have administrative flexibility to allow retrospective registration in some limited circumstances. Regulatory I mpact Statement | 3 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Two options are considered: Option 1: Status quo Borrowers who mistakenly do not register securities for AIL before making the first interest payment would generally continue to have NRWT applied to the interest paid prior to AIL registration once the mistake was discovered by Inland Revenue. Option 2: Retrospective registration (preferred option) Legislative provision would be made for a borrower who had not met the AIL registration requirements for the security (or itself) to be able to register retrospectively with Inland Revenue in limited circumstances. The security could therefore be treated as registered before the first interest payment was made, and accordingly, the borrower would be entitled to pay AIL on the interest payments made up to the date of retrospective registration, rather than NRWT. Use of money interest and penalties could still apply. Conditions should be imposed on retrospective registration to ensure that it is: • available only to borrowers who failed to register the security at the outset due to a genuine error; and • not available indefinitely (e.g. the taxpayer may need to apply for registration within a certain period (say 1-2 years) after the first interest payment). On balance Inland Revenue’s preferred option is Option 2. This is primarily because it provides the administrative flexibility for the Commissioner to subject borrowers to the appropriate tax impost when they borrow from an unassociated non-resident but do not to register the security for AIL before they make interest payments. This may be AIL in some circumstances and NRWT in other circumstances. The key risk is that allowing retrospective registration for AIL could undermine the integrity of the NRWT and AIL regimes. However, this risk should be mitigated by the conditions imposed on retrospective registration, which would target it at cases of genuine error, and limit it to a particular time window. Stakeholder views There has been limited consultation on allowing retrospective registration, although private sector stakeholders have previously sought it as a solution. The limited consultation was broadly supportive of the concept. Fiscal cost Extrapolating from a few past cases, allowing retrospective registration of securities for AIL is estimated to have a fiscal cost of $200,000 per year. This estimate is primarily based on infrequent larger cases being averaged to this amount per year rather than smaller cases in each year totalling to this amount. Limitations and Constraints on Analysis The scope of the options considered was limited to comparing the status quo to allowing retrospective registration in some limited circumstances. This is because that was the simplest way to allow administrative flexibility to deal with late registrations. There were other options that could potentially have dealt with late registrations, including: (i) universal or targeted exemptions for NRWT on interest paid to unassociated non- resident lenders; or (ii) changing the default position for borrowing from unassociated non- Regulatory I mpact Statement | 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] resident lenders to AIL (instead of NRWT). Such wholesale changes to the AIL/NRWT rules were not considered. The preferred option has not been tested in detail with private sector stakeholders, since retrospective registration is what stakeholders have themselves suggested. In our view, the bill process will provide sufficient opportunity for stakeholders to comment on the detail of the proposal. There is no central list of cases of borrowers not registering securities for AIL on time. Therefore, the impact analysis and fiscal cost has been based on various internal discussions and correspondence to understand the cases that some who have worked closely with AIL are aware of. This may not be complete, but should provide a reasonable picture of the scale of the issue (i.e. relatively few cases but some with significant NRWT costs for the taxpayer). Responsible Manager(s) (completed by relevant manager) Sam Rowe P olicy Lead Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue 31 May 2024 Quality Assurance (completed by QA panel) Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Panel Assessment & Comment: The Quality Assurance panel at Inland Revenue has reviewed the regulatory impact statement (RIS) prepared by Inland Revenue. The panel considers that the information and analysis summarised in the RIS Approved issuer levy retrospective registration partially meets the quality assurance criteria. The RIS sets out the problem with the status quo and provides a convincing argument that retrospective registration should be available in certain circumstances. The RIS only partially meets the complete criteria as it does not consider situations where AIL would not be available even under the proposed retrospective registration but there are no deliberate non-compliance concerns. The preferred option in the RIS will reduce the instances of the problem arising but there is a risk that it does not remove it from all potentially valid circumstances. s 9(2)(a) Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section 1: Diagnosing the policy problem What is the context behind the policy problem and how is the status quo expected to develop? 1. Where a New Zealand borrower pays interest to an unassociated non-resident lender, they are generally subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) by default at 10% or 15%. 2 However, they can instead opt to pay a 2% (or in certain cases 0% 3 ) ‘approved issuer levy’ (AIL) which reduces the NRWT liability to zero. 2. The AIL regime was introduced in 1991 to reduce the cost of third-party debt provided by non-residents to New Zealand borrowers. Foreign lenders can typically demand a certain after-tax return on their investment. Therefore, unless the lender can easily claim a full credit for New Zealand NRWT in its home jurisdiction 4 , it will typically require the borrower to gross up their interest payments to cover the NRWT, which increases the cost of capital for the New Zealand borrower. If the borrower is not willing to do this, then the lender will simply take its investment elsewhere, limiting the pool of capital available to New Zealand. The AIL regime significantly reduces the tax cost to the borrower in situations where the lender would pass the tax cost onto the borrower. 5 3. To be eligible to pay AIL rather than NRWT on a particular security, the borrower is required to be registered as an approved issuer and to register the security for AIL before an interest payment is made. If the borrower does not register the security for AIL at the outset and sometime later the Commissioner of Inland Revenue becomes aware of the mistake (whether through audit, review, or a voluntary disclosure by the borrower), the borrower can register the security at that later time, but on a prospective basis, meaning they continue to have an NRWT liability on any interest payments already made. The Commissioner does not have the administrative flexibility to allow retrospective registration for AIL. 6 4. While not common, Inland Revenue has dealt with several cases of borrowers mistakenly not registering securities for AIL on time. In some cases the borrower realised the mistake and disclosed it to Inland Revenue; in other cases the mistake was discovered on review. Regardless, Inland Revenue's practice is to enforce the existing NRWT obligation on the interest payments made prior to registration, in accordance with the AIL/NRWT legislation. 2 The rate of NRWT depends on whether New Zealand has a double tax treaty with the country in which the lender is resident. The standard non-treaty rate of interest NRWT is 15%, whereas many treaties provide for a 10% rate. 3 The 0% rate is applicable to certain widely held retail bonds. 4 This will generally only be the case where the lender is taxable in its own jurisdiction at a rate high enough that the full amount of NRWT can be applied to reduce its domestic tax liability. 5 AIL is set at 2% rather than 0% to preserve the incentive for a borrower to withhold NRWT where the lender will be able to fully credit it in its own jurisdiction and therefore does not require a gross-up. If AIL were 0%, there would be no reason for either party to prefer NRWT in this scenario, so New Zealand would miss out on revenue. 6 This position, which follows from the drafting of section 86I(1) of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, is made explicit in Tax Information Bulletin, Volume 7, No. 5 (November 1995). The TIB states that only interest paid to the non-resident from the date the security is registered for AIL can be subject to AIL instead of NRWT; the Commissioner does not have a discretion to alter the date of registration. Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5. If no action is taken, borrowers that fail to register for AIL within the timeframe specified under the law will continue to be subject to NRWT. At the margin, this may discourage a borrower from disclosing a mistake to Inland Revenue, if they know that doing so will significantly increase their core tax liability. However, it can also be assumed that most borrowers know they could face substantial penalties if found to be non-compliant in this way. What is the policy problem or opportunity? 6. The policy problem is that the Commissioner does not have the administrative flexibility to allow a borrower to retrospectively register a security for AIL in any circumstances. Consequently, the core tax liability of any borrower who is discovered not to have registered a security for AIL before making the first interest payment increases from 2% to 10% or 15% on the interest paid. This is a problem for three main reasons. 7. First, it is contrary to the intent of the AIL regime, which is designed to reduce the cost of capital for borrowers where the lender would otherwise pass the tax cost onto the borrower. 8. Second, it provides outcomes in some circumstances that could be seen as unfair and incoherent. For example, consider a borrower who has registered a security but has not paid AIL or withheld NRWT; such a borrower is still permitted to pay AIL at 2% rather than NRWT on the interest when the mistake is discovered (albeit with use of money interest and potential penalties). 7 This can be contrasted with a borrower that has not registered a security but has paid AIL; such a borrower continues to be liable for NRWT at 10%/15% when the mistake is discovered. The second borrower has a significantly higher tax cost even though they were arguably less non-compliant than the first borrower by advising Inland Revenue of the interest payments through the AIL return and paying AIL on time. 9. Third, there is a risk that if taxpayers know that informing Inland Revenue of an administrative mistake will result in a larger than expected tax bill, some may decide not to disclose it, undermining voluntary compliance in respect of AIL/NRWT. 10. Inland Revenue guidance 8 states that a security will be registered if the registration form is duly completed and the security relates to money lent to an approved issuer after 1 August 1991. No further requirements for approval of registrations are stipulated. One security can be registered online through MyIR with other securities registered separately by completing the registration form (IR 396/397). The form contains various fields in which information about the issuer and the securities is to be recorded. Only one field contains a criterion for declining a registration – ‘Is interest being paid to an associated person or persons?’ Next to the ‘Yes’ box is a note stating 7 Note: when the AIL regime was first introduced, late payment of AIL on a registered security generally resulted in a reversion to NRWT. This was changed in 2001 as one of three amendments to the AIL regime, with the commentary to the Taxation (Beneficiary Income of Minors, Services-related Payments and Remedial Matters) Bill noting that: “A reversion to NRWT was not originally considered a penalty, as in 1991 NRWT was the norm and AIL was a concession. Over time, however, as the payment of AIL has become the norm, the imposition of NRWT has become to be seen as a penalty for late payment out of line with other penalties for late payment. Thus for consistency with all other revenues administered by Inland Revenue, an amendment is being made to incorporate AIL within the compliance and penalty rules.” 8 IR 395 (‘Approved issuer levy – A guide for payers’) and Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 3, No. 2 (August 1991) refer. The relevant legislation is section 86H of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1991. Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] that AIL is not applicable in that case, and NRWT must be deducted. 9 Thus, if the borrower fills out all the fields of the form, indicates they are unassociated with the lender, and the security relates to money lent to them after 1 August 1991, then the security will be registered (unless there is cause for Inland Revenue to question the validity of the registration). 11. It is preferable that registration occurs at the time the security is entered into, and before the borrower makes an interest payment to the lender (as required under the status quo) because it gives Inland Revenue oversight of the securities being registered and provides some level of assurance that the borrower is eligible for AIL before they start paying it in lieu of NRWT. It importantly also means that the borrower is aware of their AIL/NRWT obligations and allows Inland Revenue to set up the borrower as an approved issuer (if this is the first security they are registering) before the first payment is due. But requiring an otherwise-eligible borrower to pay NRWT for neglecting to observe this reporting requirement at the outset could be seen as harsh in some cases. Reasons for failure to register 12. There are a number of possible reasons why a borrower might neglect to register a security for AIL. These reasons fall on a spectrum between genuine error and deliberate non-compliance. 13. Examples of genuine error could include: i) The taxpayer has a strong history of AIL compliance, but omits to register a particular security which the taxpayer still includes in its AIL returns such that AIL was filed and paid on time (just not registered for the security). ii) The taxpayer has a strong history of AIL compliance, but omits to register a security and pay AIL for a short period of time because of a change in personnel, or temporary lack of coordination between those responsible for treasury and tax. iii) Incorrect understanding of compliance obligations at the relevant time (primarily individuals and small businesses that are new to borrowing from foreign lenders). 14. Examples of deliberate non-compliance could include: i) The issuer not wanting to bear any tax cost so not registering the security or paying any AIL (or NRWT). ii) The issuer being an approved issuer but not eligible for AIL on the particular security (e.g. because they are associated with the lender) but not wanting to deduct NRWT, so simply paying AIL without registering the security. 15. There could also be examples that fall somewhere between genuine error and deliberate non-compliance. 9 The legislative basis for this is section RF 12(1)(a)(ii) of the Income Tax Act 2007, which provides that the lender must not be associated with the borrower if NRWT is to be zero rated. Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 16. The boundary between genuine error and other reasons is important in designing a response to the policy problem. Scale of the problem 17. There were approximately 1,200 taxpayers filing AIL returns and making AIL payments totalling $153 million for the year ended 30 June 2023. This represents annual interest of approximately $7.7 billion subject to the 2% rate. 18. Inland Revenue has dealt with several cases in which a corporate borrower neglected to register a new security for AIL and notified the Commissioner of the mistake sometime later. In one case this resulted in the borrower incurring an additional $2 million in NRWT. In other cases, the amounts of additional NRWT were less than $1 million. The corporate cases appear to be sporadic; only a few have been identified over the last fifteen years. However, they contribute the majority of the fiscal cost assumed in this RIS. 19. Inland Revenue has also dealt with a number of individual borrowers who have inadvertently not met AIL registration requirements. Exact figures are not available. 20. The most common scenario involves an individual with a foreign mortgage on an overseas property – the individual does not realise until sometime into the term of the mortgage that they have New Zealand tax obligations in relation to the interest payments flowing from their overseas bank account to the overseas lender. When the individual does become aware of their obligations, they register the loan for AIL, but are required to pay NRWT on the interest paid prior to registration. 10 21. The amounts of additional tax paid in the cases involving individual borrowers are generally less than $10,000. This is reflective of AIL and NRWT being small percentages. For example, suppose an individual borrowed the equivalent of NZ $1 million from a UK bank at a fixed 5% rate of interest. The interest in year 1 would be $50,000, and the tax payable for that year would be $1,000 of AIL at 2% or $5,000 of NRWT at 10%, the differential (‘additional tax’) being $4,000. 11 Thus, for an individual to incur more than $10,000 of additional tax as a result of failing to register a loan for AIL on time, the loan would generally be significant (over $1 million in the example), or the error would have to be discovered several years after interest payments began. 22. The overall picture is that mistakes with AIL registration are uncommon generally, but somewhat more common in an individual context than a corporate context. This is likely because corporates are generally well-advised and familiar with the AIL regime, while some individuals with foreign loans may not be. In either case, the default removal of access to 0% NRWT increases the borrower’s cost of funds. 10 It should be noted, however, that if the foreign lender has a New Zealand branch and the interest is paid to that branch, the individual has no NRWT or AIL obligation as the obligation remains with the foreign lender and its New Zealand branch. 11 In practice the differential could be slightly higher than $4,000 as the NRWT may be grossed up. Regulatory Impact Statement | 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Stakeholder engagement 23. Several private sector firms and groups have written to Inland Revenue and the Minister of Revenue about this issue over the past few years. While mistakes with AIL registration are uncommon generally, as previously noted, they are a pain point for the taxpayers involved, and private sector stakeholders generally view the current policy of enforcing the NRWT liability in these cases as punitive and disproportionate to the gravity of the mistake. 24. There has been limited consultation on allowing retrospective registration, since retrospective registration is what stakeholders have themselves suggested. In our view, the bill process will provide sufficient opportunity for stakeholders to comment on the detail of the proposal. What objectives are sought in relation to the policy problem? 25. The policy objective is to subject borrowers to the appropriate tax impost when they borrow from an unassociated non-resident but fail to register the security for AIL before starting interest payments. Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section 2: Deciding upon an option to address the policy problem What criteria will be used to compare options to the status quo? 26. Four criteria will be used to compare options to the status quo: a. Flexibility: the degree to which the option allows borrowers to access the AIL regime despite making genuine errors with registration. b. Voluntary compliance: the degree to which the option encourages voluntary compliance with the AIL regime and the tax system more broadly. c. Coherence: the alignment of tax outcomes in substantively similar sets of circumstances. d. Administration costs: the costs associated with Inland Revenue implementing and administering the option. What scope will options be considered within? 27. The scope is limited to regulatory options, on the basis that AIL is a regulatory regime and problems with the core mechanics of it cannot be solved without legislative change. 28. The scope of the regulatory options is limited to comparing the status quo to legislative changes to allow retrospective AIL registration in some limited circumstances. This is because that is the simplest way to allow administrative flexibility to deal with late registrations. 29. There are other options that could potentially deal with such late registrations, including: (i) universal or targeted exemptions for NRWT on interest paid to unassociated non-resident lenders; or (ii) changing the default position for borrowing from unassociated non-resident lenders to AIL (instead of NRWT) and abolishing the registration requirement. Such wholesale changes to the AIL/NRWT rules are not considered as they go much further than addressing the specific and relatively uncommon policy problem of failure to register securities for AIL on time, and would need to be considered in a wider review of the AIL regime. 30. Experience from other countries could not be considered, as the AIL regime is unique to New Zealand. What options are being considered? Option One – Status Quo 31. Under the status quo, borrowers who do not register securities for AIL before making an interest payment will continue to be subject to NRWT on the interest paid prior to AIL registration once the mistake is discovered by Inland Revenue (whether through the borrower’s own disclosure or otherwise). This will result in an increased cost of capital for the borrowers on the securities. 32. Flexibility: No flexibility for Inland Revenue to let borrowers benefit from the AIL regime if they make a mistake with AIL registration. Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 33. Voluntary compliance: At the margin, some borrowers may take the risk of not disclosing mistakes with AIL registration if they know that doing so will alter their tax cost from AIL at 2% to NRWT at 10% or 15%. That said, at the margin, the high tax cost differential between the options may be encouraging borrowers to take more care with their AIL registrations such that mistakes are less likely. 34. Coherence: A borrower who registers a security for AIL on time but does not pay AIL will likely continue to get a better tax outcome than a borrower who does not register a security for AIL on time but does pay AIL, which could be seen as unfair and incoherent. 35. Administration costs: Administration costs are low; there are few requests for retrospective registration and these cannot be accepted. Option Two – Retrospective registration (officials’ preferred option) 36. Legislative provision would be made for a borrower who had not met the AIL registration requirements for the security (or itself) before interest payments began to be able to register retrospectively with Inland Revenue in limited circumstances. The security could therefore be treated as registered before the first interest payment was made, and accordingly, the borrower would be entitled to pay AIL on the interest payments, rather than NRWT on interest payments before the security was registered. Use of money interest and penalties could still apply. 37. Conditions should be imposed on retrospective registration to ensure that it is: i) available only to borrowers who failed to register the security at the outset due to a genuine error; and ii) not available indefinitely (e.g. the taxpayer may need to apply for registration within a certain period after the first interest payment (e.g. 1-2 years)). 38. The criteria for considering a retrospective registration should be set out in the legislation. Officials also considered outlining these criteria in guidance issued by Inland Revenue but on balance prefer including them in legislation to increase certainty for taxpayers and operational staff processing retrospective registrations. 12 Including the criteria in guidance has not been considered in this RIS as a separate option because its consideration against the RIS criteria would be very similar to option two. 39. The purpose of restricting retrospective registration to cases of genuine error would be to support voluntary compliance with the AIL regime. If retrospective registration for AIL were permitted in all circumstances, taxpayers could deliberately not comply with the regime in the knowledge that, if they were audited, they would get the same basic outcome as if they registered for and paid AIL on time (although interest and penalties could also be payable in the former case). 12 Tax legislation does provide administrative flexibility for tax elections/tax type registrations in other cases. See for example, section HB 13(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007, which applies to look through company elections, and section 51(4) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (with associated guidance in Standard Practice Statement 18/03) in relation to the effective date of GST registrations (including retrospective registration). Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 40. The purpose of imposing a time limit on availability of retrospective registration would be to preserve fiscal certainty. If retrospective registration were available indefinitely, there would be an ongoing unquantified potential liability on the revenue. The time period should also help support AIL compliance at the margin, as borrowers would be incentivised to review their AIL compliance and identify and rectify registration mistakes in a timely manner. 41. Flexibility: Flexibility would be improved. The Commissioner would have the flexibility to allow borrowers to access the AIL regime when making genuine errors with registration within a particular time period. However, the time period will mean that the Commissioner has less flexibility to allow retrospective registration than if there was no time period. 42. Voluntary compliance: This option would promote voluntary compliance at the margin by keeping borrowers who report mistakes with AIL registration in the AIL regime in relation to past interest payments, rather than enforcing NRWT, which borrowers may perceive as a punitive treatment and thus attempt to evade. However, it would also lessen the incentive for borrowers to be fully compliant in the first place, at the margin, but the time period should mitigate this potential. 43. Coherence: This option would improve coherence by giving a borrower who did not register a security on time but paid AIL the potential for the same basic tax outcome as a borrower who registered a security but did not pay AIL (although interest and penalties could be payable). However, it would also potentially give a borrower who neither registered a security nor paid AIL on time due to a genuine error the same basic tax outcome as a fully compliant borrower that did register on time and paid AIL. 44. Administration costs: Administration costs would increase at the margin because Inland Revenue staff would need to review and process retrospective registrations, although there are not expected to be many cases. Regulatory Impact Statement | 13 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] How do the options compare to the status quo/counterfactual? Option One – Counterfactual Option Two – Retrospective registration Flexibility 0 ++ Voluntary compliance 0 + Coherence 0 + Administration costs 0 - Overall assessment 0 ++ What option is likely to best address the problem, meet the policy objectives, and deliver the highest net benefits? 45. Option two meets the policy objective; the status quo does not. Option two is likely to deliver the highest net benefits. It scores better on all criteria other than administration costs. Increased administration costs are the trade-off for increased flexibility of the AIL regime through the availability of retrospective registration. There is also a partial trade-off between flexibility and voluntary compliance; the more generous the criteria for retrospective registration, the less incentive borrowers have to register securities before an interest payment, though borrowers are more incentivised to report mistakes rather than conceal them. However, imposing conditions which target retrospective registration at cases of genuine error mitigates the adverse impact of increased flexibility on voluntary compliance with the base regime. Key for qualitative judgements: ++ much better than doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual + better than doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual 0 about the same as doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual - worse than doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual - - much worse than doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual Regulatory Impact Statement | 14 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] What are the marginal costs and benefits of the option? 46. One assumption underlying this analysis is that some borrowers will neglect to register securities for AIL at the outset in the future, and will request retrospective registration. This assumption is based on an extrapolation from past occurrences, as described in Affected groups (identify) Comment nature of cost or benefit (eg, ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg, compliance rates), risks.

However, there is no guarantee that the past is an accurate predicter of the future. The frequency of retrospective registration in the future is inherently uncertain, so the level of certainty as to the size of the benefit for borrowers is low. Section 3: Delivering an option How will the new arrangements be implemented? 47. A legislative provision for retrospective registration of securities for AIL would be enacted via amendments to the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, the Income Tax Act 2007, and the Tax Administration Act 1994 as required. These amendments will be included in the upcoming omnibus tax bill, which is scheduled to be introduced in August 2024. 48. Retrospective registration will be available from 1 April 2025, and will not be able to be backdated before that date. This will ensure the change is prospective and does not result in any borrowers coming forward and claiming refunds of NRWT paid as a consequence of past failures to register securities for AIL on time. 49. Inland Revenue will be responsible for processing applications for retrospective registration of a security for AIL, just as it is responsible for processing AIL registrations currently. 50. The exact details of implementation have not yet been determined, however retrospective registration will not require any significant systems changes. How will the new arrangements be monitored, e valuated, and reviewed? 51. Tax policy officials will engage periodically with operational staff to monitor the number of retrospective AIL registrations, the kinds of circumstances in which retrospective registration is utilised, and how the process is working generally. Stakeholders will also have the opportunity to contact Inland Revenue through the usual channels about these matters. If any integrity concerns emerge in relation to retrospective registration, officials will consider a review of the policy.
Regulatory Impact Statement | 1 Regulatory Impact Statement: Crypto-asset Reporting Framework Covers heet Purpose of Document Decision sought: Analysis produced for the purpose of informing final Cabinet decisions Advising agencies: Inland Revenue Proposing Ministers: Minister of Revenue Date finalised: 8 May 2024 Problem Definition Inland Revenue currently has a lack of visibility over income derived through cryptoassets. This presents a tax compliance risk as taxpayers could underreport or conceal income they generate through these assets. This proposal seeks to improve tax compliance regarding cryptoassets. Executive Summary Overview Cryptoassets are digital representations of value that can be transferred, stored or traded electronically. Instead of relying on a financial institution to verify transactions, cryptoasset transactions are confirmed by computers operating on the cryptoasset’s network. This is known as distributed ledger technology. Blockchain is a form of this technology. In almost all cases, the disposal of cryptoassets is taxable in New Zealand. Disposals include selling cryptoassets for money, exchanging one cryptoasset for another type of cryptoasset and using cryptoassets to pay for goods or services. The characteristics of cryptoassets pose unique challenges for tax administrations from a tax compliance perspective, as they can be stored and transferred in a decentralised manner, without reliance on traditional financial intermediaries. This has given rise to a new set of intermediaries, such as cryptoasset exchanges and wallet providers, that are subject to little regulatory oversight. The Financial Markets Authority in New Zealand does not regulate cryptoassets, and only regulates cryptoasset issuers or providers to the extent that a product they are offering meets existing definitions for financial products and services. Cryptoassets are also similarly unregulated in other jurisdictions. These factors mean that tax authorities do not have visibility over incomes derived through cryptoassets, like they do with incomes derived through more traditional sources (such as employment income, investment income, and income from financial institutions. For example, Inland Revenue receives regular income information from employers and investment income payers. New Zealand has also implemented the OECD Common Reporting Standard (CRS) which imposes information gathering and reporting obligations on financial institutions in relation to financial account information, and this information is shared with tax authorities in participating jurisdictions.) Most OECD countries have indicated that they will implement the CARF. Regulatory Impact Statement | 2 Along with the implementation of CARF, the OECD also approved a set of amendments to the CRS in order to bring new financial assets, digital financial products, and intermediaries in scope, because they are potential alternatives to traditional financial products. The amendments include an optional election to report under the CRS the information on certain assets that has to be reported under the CARF to minimise duplicated reporting. Option 1 – Status quo (no action) Under the status quo, Inland Revenue would not receive any information in respect of income derived by New Zealand residents through offshore cryptoasset intermediaries. This is because these intermediaries are not subject to NZ legislation and information demand powers under the Tax Administration Act 1994. Inland Revenue would receive information from New Zealand intermediaries on an ad-hoc basis when utilising these information demand powers but would not receive regular income information from these intermediaries. Under the status quo, Inland Revenue would be reliant on self-reporting by taxpayers of their cryptoasset income and on those taxpayers being aware of their tax obligations (essentially voluntary compliance). Advantages of taking no action Inland Revenue would not need to make necessary system changes to process and analyse a largescale information exchange. Cryptoasset intermediaries would not have to make the necessary system changes to allow for regular exchanges of information. Disadvantages of taking no action The visibility that Inland Revenue has over incomes derived through cryptoassets would remain limited and this would present cryptoasset users with increased opportunity to conceal incomes from Inland Revenue (it effectively relies on voluntary compliance). Ad hoc information requests also arguably impose a greater compliance burden on cryptoasset intermediaries rather than a standardised international schema. As noted above, as of 8 May 2024 most OECD countries have signalled that they intend to implement the CARF (more than 50 jurisdictions have publicly committed to implementing the CARF by signing up to a joint statement supporting its implementation.)Taking no action may have negative reputational impacts on New Zealand Option 2 – OECD Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (the OECD) has developed a Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) that will require intermediaries, such as cryptoasset exchanges, brokers and dealers, to provide tax authorities with income information in respect of users operating through them. Further details on the CARF will be provided in section 2 of this regulatory impact statement. The CARF will be subject to an international information exchange framework. This means that jurisdictions that receive information on the activities of cryptoasset users under the CARF will be required to share that information with tax authorities of other countries that have also implemented the CARF, to the extent that the information relates to persons resident in that jurisdiction. Similarly, tax authorities will also receive information from other jurisdictions’ tax authorities where the rules have been implemented. Advantages of OECD CARF Implementing the CARF in New Zealand domestic legislation will achieve the intended policy objectives of improving Inland Revenue’s visibility over incomes derived through cryptoassets by NZ tax residents, and thereby supports greater tax compliance. Regulatory Impact Statement | 3 One clear advantage of this OECD-led solution is that it promotes a standardised schema with significant buy in and consultation having been undertaken with cryptoasset intermediaries themselves. This standardised schema reduces compliance costs for intermediaries, compared to responding to ad-hoc requests for information from many different tax authorities. Further, if jurisdictions designed their own rules, the variations between jurisdictions would result in increased compliance costs for cryptoasset intermediaries that had to design their information systems to satisfy the requirements of multiple bespoke rules. This solution also leverages existing technological frameworks that have been implemented by tax authorities worldwide for the automatic exchange of information of financial account information, as seen recently in the context of the gig and sharing economy. Limitations of the OECD CARF The success of the information flows from the CARF is dependent on other countries signing up for improved information flows. This is because information will only be shared among tax authorities whose countries have implemented the rules (that is, if New Zealand implemented the rules, Inland Revenue would only receive information from other tax authorities that were also subject to the rules). This will not be much of an issue in practice, as the CARF initiative is a global minimum standard, which means all OECD countries are required to implement it. To date, over 50 jurisdictions have publicly committed to implementing the CARF by signing up to a joint statement supporting its implementation. Option 3 – Bespoke rules The third option considered is for the NZ Government to design and implement its own rules to require cryptoasset exchanges, brokers and dealers to provide information on NZ resident users directly to Inland Revenue. Advantages of bespoke rules One theoretical advantage of developing bespoke rules is that NZ could prescribe the data we wanted to collect from cryptoasset intermediaries along with the frequency and timing of this information. The purpose of collecting this information is to undertake compliance work to ensure New Zealanders who derive income through cryptoassets are complying with their tax obligations. The information prescribed to be shared by the OECD CARF is fit for purpose in this regard and therefore there would be no advantage in practice from developing bespoke rules. Disadvantage of bespoke rules One key disadvantage of a bespoke solution is that it would be difficult for New Zealand to collect data from non-resident cryptoasset intermediaries with NZ users. This is because our domestic law would be unenforceable, and information requests would be sitting outside the internationally agreed OECD framework which has received a large degree of buy-in across many jurisdictions. This is a significant disadvantage given approximately 80% of NZ cryptoasset users’ activity is undertaken through offshore exchanges. Moreover, the CARF is a global minimum standard, and this means all OECD countries are expected to implement it. It follows that if NZ were to elect to implement a bespoke regime that could undermine our participation at the OECD. A bespoke solution for NZ would also increase compliance costs for cryptoasset intermediaries (to the extent that it is enforceable) and could result in a reduced appetite for them allowing NZ users to operate through them. A bespoke regime would also take much Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 longer to implement as a more extensive consultation would be required (noting that under the OECD solution a lot of this work has been done). Option 4 – annual disclosure regime Similar to the annual disclosure that is required under current law in respect of foreign shares, Inland Revenue could require owners of cryptoassets to provide information on their holdings on an annual basis. Advantages of an annual disclosure regime One theoretical advantage of an annual disclosure regime is that it does not require intermediaries to provide tax authorities with information in respect of cryptoassets. This lowers compliance costs for intermediaries. Disadvantages of an annual disclosure regime An annual disclosure regime levies compliance costs on individuals that hold cryptoassets. This is arguably inefficient as the provision of information can more effectively be dealt with by intermediaries who are larger, more sophisticated and have the technological systems in place to process thousands of transactions in real time. Another key disadvantage of an annual disclosure regime is that it relies on voluntary compliance by individual holders of cryptoassets. This would not necessarily translate to increased tax compliance and therefore would not fulfil the policy objectives. This is because individuals who would comply with a disclosure regime are likely to be individuals who would also comply with their tax obligation anyway. Option 2 is the preferred option. Impact of the preferred option The primary purpose of the OECD CARF is to improve tax authorities’ visibility over incomes derived by users through cryptoasset intermediaries. This visibility is important as cryptoassets operate outside the traditional financial system and have given rise to a new form of intermediary (such as exchange and wallet providers). 1 The OECD CARF creates a standardised information exchange framework to minimise compliance costs for cryptoasset intermediaries. The information that Inland Revenue would receive from other tax authorities under the CARF will reduce the ability for cryptoasset holders in NZ to successfully conceal or under- report income derived through these assets. This information will be used by Inland Revenue to ensure tax compliance and also monitor for any high-risk activity or behaviours that may be symptomatic of fraud or illegal activity (due to their decentralised and somewhat anonymous nature, cryptoassets can be used to facilitate illegal activities). In terms of specific impacts, the following parties are affected in the following ways: 1. Cryptoasset intermediaries that are subject to the CARF: These intermediaries will need to provide information to tax authorities about the activity of users on their platforms (although this will be covered later on in this regulatory impact statement, this will include reporting on crypto-to-crypto transactions, crypto-to-fiat transactions 1 Cryptoasset exchanges facilitate the purchase, sale and exchange of cryptoassets for other cryptoassets or fiat currencies. Wallet providers offer digital wallets which individuals can use to store their cryptoassets. Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 and relevant transfers). Cryptoasset intermediaries will also be required to gather and report personal information on their users. As this is a significant reporting obligation, cryptoasset intermediaries will be required to invest in developing the necessary systems. It is anticipated that there are several cryptoasset exchanges in New Zealand that would fall within the CARF. 2. Users of cryptoasset intermediaries: Reduced opportunities to conceal income derived through cryptoasset intermediaries. As transactions will be under increased scrutiny and subject to reporting, this may also change behaviour of the small percentage of users who may utilise cryptoassets for illicit activities (this is because patterns of behaviours that suggest a risk of illicit activity will be more readily identifiable by authorities). Cryptoasset intermediary users may also have to provide some additional personal information or identifying details to these intermediaries to the extent that isn’t already covered by AML regulations. 3. Inland Revenue: Changes will be required to Inland Revenue’s START system to ensure that the information received from cryptoasset intermediaries and other tax authorities is aligned with the OECD’s schema. There will be additional ongoing administration costs to support the information exchange with other tax authorities (ensuring the data meets appropriate data quality standards). Additional compliance resource will be needed to analyse the information received under the CARF in order to determine whether profits derived through cryptoassets are income, and therefore subject to tax. Consultation The OECD released a public consultation document on the CARF in March 2022 which included a draft version of the rules and specific questions for submitters. This consultation closed 29 April 2022. Approximately 80 submissions were received, primarily from tax advisory firms, banks and large cryptoasset exchanges. These were published on the OECD website. Inland Revenue also undertook a round of targeted consultation on the proposed implementation of the CARF. This involved sending a letter to cryptoasset intermediaries potentially impacted by any reporting regime. The letter consulted on both implementing the CARF in New Zealand and sought thoughts on adopting a bespoke regime. Submitters were largely supportive of an OECD-led solution and recognised the benefit of a standardised international solution in minimising compliance costs for reporting crypto-asset service providers. The main concern raised by submitters was ensuring that there was sufficient lead in time to allow reporting entities to make the necessary system changes to be able to comply with the CARF. Limitations and Constraints on Analysis There were no constraints or limitations on the analysis in this statement. Responsible Manager Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 Martin Neylan Policy Lead Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue 8 May 2024 Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Panel Assessment & Comment: The Quality Assurance review panel at Inland Revenue has reviewed the regulatory impact statement (RIS) prepared by Inland Revenue and considers that information and analysis summarised in the RIS Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework meets the quality assurance criteria. Section 1: Diagnosi ng the policy proble m W h a t i s t h e c o n t e x t b e h i n d t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m a n d h o w i s t h e st a t u s q u o e x p e c t e d t o d e v e l o p? Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, the market for cryptoassets worldwide has experienced fast growth and development. There are currently almost 21,000 cryptoassets with a market capitalisation of almost US$4 trillion dollars. The technological innovations brought about by the growth of cryptoassets and blockchain technology has also led to the development of new products such as decentralised finance, non-fungible tokens, and the Metaverse. Between 6% to 10% of New Zealanders own some cryptocurrency, according to three different online surveys which were conducted in 2022. 2 Inland Revenue’s analytics show that 80% of cryptoasset activity by New Zealanders is undertaken through offshore exchanges. The characteristics of cryptoassets pose unique challenges for tax administrations from a tax compliance perspective. Cryptoassets utilise cryptography and can be stored and transferred in a decentralised manner without reliance on traditional financial intermediaries. 3 This has given rise to a new set of intermediaries, such as cryptoasset exchanges and wallet providers, that are subject to little regulatory oversight. In many cases, the intermediary will be located in a different jurisdiction to its users, and it is difficult for tax authorities to obtain information about their tax residents if this information is held offshore. Inland Revenue does not receive regular information on income derived through cryptoassets (like it does from banks or employers in respect of investment income or salary and wages or under the OECD Common Reporting Standard (CRS) on financial account information from international financial intermediaries). The information that Inland Revenue currently receives 2 Financial Markets Authority, 2022 Investor Confidence Survey, Survey conducted March and April 2022; Financial Services Council, Money And You research report. Survey conducted January 2022; Finder Cryptocurrency adoption index, August 2022. 3 Cryptography is a digital process of using algorithms to validate messages and transactions in order to secure digital information against unauthorised access or corruption. Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 is through ad hoc information demands under Inland Revenue’s information gathering powers in the Tax Administration Act 1994, and these information demands can only be applied to cryptoasset intermediaries that are operating in NZ and therefore subject to NZ law. There are mechanisms to request information through tax treaties from other jurisdictions but these can be impractical and difficult to apply on a regular basis. This means that Inland Revenue currently lacks sufficient visibility over incomes derived through cryptoassets and is reliant on voluntary compliance by taxpayers. Increased information flows are required to support tax compliance and ensure that individuals pay the correct amount of tax. This will also provide Inland Revenue with the opportunity to further educate taxpayers on what their tax obligations are with respect to cryptoassets. Inland Revenue receives regular employment and investment income information from employers and banks, and this is generally used to pre-populate income tax returns. Taxpayers in these circumstances will typically confirm that the information that is pre-populated in their income tax returns is correct and can make adjustments if necessary. This reduces their compliance costs as they do not need to collate information about their income earned from various sources and can instead rely on information that has already been provided to Inland Revenue. As the world becomes more digitalised and connected, it is commonplace for income to be derived and facilitated through large platforms or institutions. The OECD has led and co- ordinated measures to ensure that tax authorities retain visibility over incomes generated through such means. Examples include the OECD Common Reporting Standard (CRS), which facilitates the automatic exchange of financial account information between tax authorities, and more recently, the OECD initiative on the taxation of the gig and sharing economy, which requires digital platforms to provide tax authorities with income information in respect of sellers operating through these platforms. Cryptoasset intermediaries are similar to employers, banks, digital platforms and other third parties that hold information that is useful for tax administration purposes. This includes information about the profits derived through cryptoassets. This information would be useful for Inland Revenue if it were available on a regular basis, as it would ensure that sellers were declaring the income they earn through these assets. Cryptoasset intermediaries are generally sophisticated and have business models that allow them to accurately track and process millions of transactions. Because these intermediaries operate in many different countries it is desirable from their perspective that any requirement to provide tax authorities with information about sellers that use their platform is simple to understand and comply with, whilst minimising compliance costs to the extent possible. Given the growth of cryptoassets (which currently have a combined market capitalisation of almost 4 trillion USD, compared to just 17 billion USD at the start of 2017), it is appropriate that the Government consider ways in which it can increase visibility over incomes derived through cryptoassets by New Zealand residents. The OECD have developed a CARF that jurisdictions can implement. The CARF provides for the collection and automatic exchange of information on cryptoassets. Under the CARF, entities that facilitate exchange transactions on behalf of customers (Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Providers) will be required to provide tax authorities with information regarding transactions in Relevant Crypto-Assets by Reportable Users. At a high level, Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Providers must collect and report personal information (such as the name, address, date of birth and tax identification number) for all its Reportable Users, along with aggregate level data on all Relevant Crypto-asset transactions Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 in relation to each Reportable User. This data includes information on crypto-to-crypto transactions, crypto-to-fiat transactions and transfers of relevant cryptoassets (such as to a wallet address) broken down by relevant asset. The CARF also includes various valuation and currency translation rules, such as specifying that the amount paid or received is reported in the FIAT currency in which it was reported or received. Crypto-Asset Service Providers will also be required to follow a self-certification process in respect of each user to determine whether that user is a reportable user. In short, this requires that the provider goes through AML/KYC requirements and obtains a signed certification from each user with relevant personal information, including confirmation of their country of tax residence. There are certain assets, such as shares issued in crypto form, which could qualify as reportable under the CARF and as financial assets that would be reportable under CRS (e.g. shares issued in crypto form). To avoid duplicative reporting, the CRS amendment contain an optional provision to switch-off reporting under the CRS if such information is reported under the CARF. The way in which Inland Revenue would receive information under the CARF is through an information exchange agreement with other jurisdictions. Jurisdictions that receive information on the activities of crypto-asset users from Reporting Crypto-Asset Service providers will be required to share that information with tax authorities of other countries that have also implemented the rules to the extent that the information relates to persons resident in that jurisdiction. Tax authorities will also receive information from other jurisdictions’ tax authorities where the rules have been implemented. International context surrounding the CARF The OECD have been undertaking work over the past few years to develop a CARF that jurisdictions can implement. A draft framework was consulted on by the OECD in early 2022 and the final CARF rules were declassified publicly on 10 October 2022. The success of this initiative depends on its widespread implementation by jurisdictions. If some countries do not implement the CARF, then cryptoasset users could undertake their cryptoasset activity through intermediaries located in a jurisdiction that had not implemented the rules. This would undermine the objective of the CARF of increasing visibility over incomes derived through cryptoassets. It is noted that this should not be an issue in practice as the CARF is a global minimum standard. This means that all OECD countries are expected to implement it. To date, over 50 jurisdictions have publicly committed to implementing the CARF by issuing a joint statement outlining their commitment to its implementation. The CARF is set to apply from the 2026/27 tax year, with the first information exchanges taking place in 2027 in respect of the 2026-year data). The OECD are currently working on finalising the IT schema for the CARF. Once finalised, this will be released to tax administrations and crypto-asset service providers and other financial institutions to enable them to make IT changes to implement the CARF. W h a t i s t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m o r o p p o r t u n i t y ? The policy problem this proposal seeks to address is to improve Inland Revenue’s visibility over incomes derived through cryptoassets. Having access to this information will help improve tax compliance (if individuals do not include income derived through cryptoassets in their tax return then Inland Revenue will know). Regulatory Impact Statement | 9 As mentioned previously in this impact statement, cryptoassets and underlying blockchain technology has grown at a rapid rate in recent years, with the current market capitalisation of these assets nearing 4 trillion USD. The technological advances afforded by blockchain technology also continue to grow at a rapid rate as new financial offerings are brought to market that utilise blockchain technology (such as non-fungible tokens, the development of decentralised finance and the growth of the metaverse). It is important that tax authorities improve their visibility of incomes derived through cryptoassets. If nothing is done to support improved information flows, then this could compromise tax compliance and the ability of Inland Revenue to ensure cryptoasset users pay the correct amount of tax. Increased visibility over cryptoasset incomes is forecast to generate $50m in revenue per annum, as Inland Revenue will utilise this information to support tax compliance. The proposals to require cryptoasset intermediaries to provide Inland Revenue with transaction information in respect of their users would affect: Cryptoasset intermediaries: These intermediaries will have reporting obligations to tax authorities in respect of relevant cryptoasset transactions undertaken by their users. This includes compiling reports and identifying information about users and their transactions. Cryptoasset intermediaries would be required to make the necessary system changes to enable this information reporting to occur. Users of cryptoasset intermediaries: Inland Revenue would have improved visibility over incomes derived through cryptoassets and therefore users would have a reduced ability to conceal any income or criminality. Inland Revenue: Under both the OECD CARF and a bespoke regime, Inland Revenue would receive information from cryptoasset intermediaries on transactions undertaken by their users. This information could be used to support tax compliance and tax administration functions. Inland Revenue would also be required to make the necessary system changes to its computer system, START, to allow for the automatic exchange of information. W h a t o b j e c t i v e s a r e s o u g h t i n r e l a t i o n t o t he p o l i c y p r o b l e m ? The objective is to improve visibility over incomes derived through cryptoassets to ensure increased tax compliance. Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 Section 2: Deciding upon an option to addres s the policy proble m W h a t c r i t e r i a w i l l b e u s e d to c o m p a r e o p t i o n s to t h e s t a t u s q u o ? The critiera that have been used to assess the options are: Fairness: Is the option effective at facilitating the payment of the correct amount of tax by taxpayers? This is often described as horizontal equity: the idea that people in the same position should pay the same amount of tax. Tax should not be easier to avoid just because someone works in a different industry or sector (for example, if a person’s income is derived through cryptoasset trading as opposed to a salary and wage earner). Compliance costs: Does the preferred option achieve the desired policy objective of visibility over incomes derived through cryptoassets whilst minimising compliance costs for cryptoasset intermediaries and users.. Due to the nature of the policy objective, it is recognised that there will be some compliance costs but the preferred option will minimise these to the extent possible. Administration: Is the preferred option possible for Inland Revenue to implement and administer without substantial ongoing administration costs? Efficiency: Does the preferred option minimise impediments to economic growth and avoid distortions to taxpayer decisions? Does the preferred option ensure that comparable investments are effectively taxed in the same way? Coherence: Does the preferred option make sense in the context of the entire tax system and New Zealand’s international tax relations? Is the preferred option consistent with New Zealand’s broad-base low-rate framework? Sustainability: Is the preferred option future-proofed? Will the option be able to apply and extend to future developments in the cryptoasset space without the need for further regulatory change? W h a t s c o p e w i l l o p t i o n s b e c o n s i d e r e d w i t h i n ? In order to improve tax compliance with regard to incomes derived through cryptoassets, it follows that Inland Revenue will need access to income information. The most feasible option to improve these information flows is to require cryptoasset intermediaries to provide this income information to Inland Revenue in some way or another. There is scope in terms of the exact categories of information to be collected and the timing and frequency of this information (for example, if a bespoke regime were implemented). Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 W h a t o p t i o n s a r e b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d? Option One – Taking no action Under the status quo, Inland Revenue would not receive any information in respect of income derived by New Zealand resident through offshore cryptoasset intermediaries. This is because these intermediaries are not subject to NZ legislation and information demand powers under the Tax Administration Act 1994. Inland Revenue would receive information from New Zealand intermediaries on an ad-hoc basis when utilising these information demand powers, but would not receive regular income information from these intermediaries. This means that the visibility Inland Revenue has over incomes derived through cryptoassets would remain limited and this would present cryptoasset users with increased opportunity to conceal incomes from Inland Revenue. Most other OECD countries have recently indicated they will implement CARF. Taking no action would mean that New Zealand would not be aligned with other OECD countries. Option Two – Implementing the OECD CARF The CARF is a global minimum standard. This means all OECD countries are expected to implement it. To date, over 50 jurisdictions have signed up to a joint statement signalling their commitment to implementing the CARF. Countries that have signed up to date include Australia, Canada, the UK, USA and most of Europe. Implementing the CARF will achieve the intended policy objectives of improving Inland Revenue’s visibility over incomes derived through cryptoassets, and thereby supporting greater tax compliance. As mentioned earlier in this regulatory impact statement, the standardised schema provided through the CARF reduces compliance costs for intermediaries, compared to responding to ad-hoc requests for information from many different tax authorities which would apply if jurisdictions implemented bespoke regimes. Standardisation also reduces system build costs for intermediaries as all requests are managed in a standardised format. Inland Revenue would use the information provided under the CARF to promote tax compliance. This would be in the form of specific compliance activity and prompting individuals that do derive income through cryptoassets to include this in their income tax return. This will make it harder for individuals to conceal incomes derived through cryptoassets from Inland Revenue. Although information obtained under the CARF is tightly controlled, the information could also be utilised to monitor for any high risk activity or behaviours that may be symptomatic of fraud or illegal activity (due to their decentralised and somewhat anonymous nature, cryptoassets can be used to facilitate illegal activities). Inland Revenue is not considering using this information to pre-populate income tax returns at this stage. This is because profits derived through selling cryptoassets are not necessarily income (although they will be in most cases). Cryptoassets are taxed on a realisation basis in New Zealand in accordance with section CB 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (based on the dominant purpose at acquisition). This means that it can be unclear if profits derived through cryptoassets and reported under the CARF are taxable (the dominant purpose on acquisition may be to derive a passive income through staking, rather than to make a profit for example), although in a lot of cases they clearly would be taxable. However, pre-population of income tax returns with cryptoasset income is something that may be considered at a later date. This Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 could be of particular benefit once potential policy changes are made to simplify the way tax is calculated on cryptoassets (which is something that could be considered subject to prioritisation as part of the Government’s Tax Policy Work Programme). It is noted that if NZ tax settings and the information flows under the CARF were able to work synergistically with each other to enable accurate pre-population (at least for some categories of cryptoassets where it would be clear that a disposal is taxable), then it is clear that this would bring obvious benefits in reduced compliance costs. This would make it much easier for individuals to comply with their tax obligations as their taxable income would be calculated without them having to do anything, allowing them to avoid complex calculations and rely on information reported under the CARF. This potential benefit points to the CARF being a sustainable and enduring solution. Option 3 – Bespoke regime An alternative solution would be to implement bespoke information reporting requirements in New Zealand’s domestic legislation. Under this option, Inland Revenue would receive information about users’ incomes earned through cryptoasset intermediaries. The difference between this option and the OECD CARF is that Inland Revenue could prescribe what categories of information, along with timing and frequency of information that it receives from cryptoasset intermediaries. Just like option 2, this would provide Inland Revenue with income information to support tax compliance. As Inland Revenue could prescribe the frequency and timing of information, this would allow for easier pre-population to our 1 April – 31 March tax year, in the event that we elected to go down this pathway in the future. There is a risk that this option would not be sustainable long term as cryptoasset intermediaries may refuse NZ customers if we attempted to impose bespoke reporting obligations on them. A bespoke regime would also not be in line with the internationally agreed standards developed by the OECD to which NZ is a member country. As previously mentioned, 80% of New Zealanders conduct their cryptoasset activities through offshore exchanges and a bespoke solution would not be as effective in compelling compliance by offshore exchanges (our laws would not apply to overseas jurisdictions and so it would not be anywhere near as effective as the CARF and its information exchange protocol). The other problem with this approach is that it would increase compliance costs for cryptoasset intermediaries who would need to implement bespoke system changes to comply with New Zealand’s domestic legislation. This could increase the likelihood of non-compliance, and could result in Inland Revenue not receiving any income information. Option 4 – annual disclosure regime Similar to the annual disclosure that is required under current law in respect of foreign shares, Inland Revenue could require owners of cryptoassets to provide information on their holdings. This would result in increased visibility over incomes derived through cryptoassets but would not necessarily translate to increased tax compliance. This is because those who would adhere to a disclosure regime are probably compliant taxpayers anyway. This option does not effectively deal with the tax compliance issue, as the decentralised nature of cryptoassets makes it easier for motivated individuals to conceal their incomes without third party reporting.

The option that is likely to best address the problem, meet the policy objectives, and deliver the highest net benefits is implementing the OECD’s CARF (Option 2). This option will achieve the policy objective of ensuring Inland Revenue has visibility over incomes derived through cryptoassets and thereby supporting tax compliance. This option has clear benefits over option 3 (bespoke rules). Firstly, be adopting a standardised OECD schema this reduces compliance costs for cryptoasset intermediaries. The OECD CARF is also a more sustainable solution given it has buy-in from jurisdictions worldwide and greater support from cryptoasset intermediaries. Although a bespoke regime would provide New Zealand with the theoretical flexibility to mandate timing of reporting and the categories of information to be reported, this is not necessary. This is because the information prescribed to be shared under the OECD CARF is fit for purpose to promote tax compliance in New Zealand. If, at a future date, Inland Revenue decided to utilise the information received through cryptoasset intermediaries to pre-populate income tax returns, a bespoke regime would provide some advantages (such as the ability to ensure that information was provided in accordance with NZ’s 1 April – 31 March tax year, as opposed to a calendar year as is likely under the CARF). This theoretical benefit is far outweighed by the benefits of standardisation and reduced compliance costs afforded under the CARF however.

The operating costs include depreciation and capital charge. There are also ongoing administration costs for Inland Revenue beyond the current forecast period. High Others (cryptoasset intermediaries) New Zealand resident cryptoasset intermediaries would be required to provide Inland Revenue with aggregated information in respect of transactions undertaken by users on their platforms. Offshore cryptoasset intermediaries in jurisdictions that have implemented the CARF would be subject to an information exchange and these jurisdictions would provide Inland Revenue with information in respect of NZ resident users operating through these offshore intermediaries.

There would be a particular focus on taxpayers that have derived large amount of profits through cryptoassets or on taxpayers who are not compliant with their tax obligations. The benefit has been estimated using a macroeconomic approach that estimates the total value of cryptoassets held by New Zealanders and then uses a series of assumptions to form the basis of the model. The size of the cryptoasset market in NZ has been calculated by comparing NZ’s relative share of global GDP against the total market capitalisation for cryptoassets and then scaling this down conservatively based on the percentage of New Zealanders who invest in this asset class. This figure has then been layered with a number of assumptions such as the probability that any given disposal is taxable, rate of return, assumed tax rate, current compliance level, and how much of an uplift in compliance will be achieved through utilising the data for compliance measures. Conservative figures were used in arriving at this estimate given the highly volatile nature of cryptoassets in general. Section 3: Delivering a n option H o w w i l l t h e n e w a r r a n g e m e n t s b e i m p l e m e n t e d? Inland Revenue will be responsible for the implementation and ongoing administration of the new rules. Inland Revenue will provide information to increase awareness regarding the new rules. This will include producing a relevant Tax Information Bulletin item and updating guidance on Inland Revenue’s website along with relevant press releases to advise cryptoasset intermediaries and users of the changes. bolstered if high risk cryptoasset activity that suggests criminal activity is identified and passed on to the relevant authorities. There will also be a general fairness benefit to taxpayers who do not hold cryptoassets.

Total monetised benefits n/a $50 million over the current forecast period, and $50m per annum thereafter Medium Non-monetised benefits Low Medium Regulatory Impact Statement | 17 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Implementing these proposals would require legislative change. Similar to how FATCA/CRS and the taxation of the gig and sharing economy proposals were adopted, a legislative change could be made to state that the OECD CARF, schema and user guide have force in NZ’s domestic legislation. Greater legislative change would be required for a bespoke regime. From an Inland Revenue systems perspective, there would be a sizeable upfront cost to build functionality within START (Inland Revenue’s computer system) to enable for the sharing and receiving of income information with other jurisdictions. The preferred option is that the OECD’s CARF is implemented with the 2026/27 tax year being the first year that information is required to be collected by cryptoasset intermediaries in New Zealand affected by the rules. This means that: • New Zealand cryptoasset intermediaries must adhere to a self-certification process in respect of each user and collect and report this self-certification information along with all aggregate level data on all relevant crypto-asset transactions in relation to each reportable user. This data will cover information on crypto-to-crypto transactions, crypto-to-fiat transactions and transfers of relevant cryptoassets. This information will be subject to various valuation and currency translation rules, such as specifying that the amount paid or received is reporting in the fiat currency in which it was reported or received. • Inland Revenue would need to exchange this relevant information with other jurisdictions, to the extent that the information held related to foreign tax residents in jurisdictions that had also implemented the OECD CARF. • Inland Revenue would use the information it received to support New Zealand users of cryptoasset intermediaries to comply with their tax obligations. This will ensure greater tax compliance and minimise the opportunities for these individuals to conceal incomes derived through cryptoassets.

If the OECD CARF was implemented, it is noted that the OECD will be able to allocate resources to making any changes to the CARF where necessary. Any changes to the OECD schema and rules can then be reflected into domestic legislation in NZ. Given the likely widespread buy-in from jurisdictions, this ensures a more enduring and sustainable policy reform. New Zealand regularly participate in OECD meetings so would be able to provide a contribution towards any discussions evaluating or seeking to make improvements to the CARF. The OECD would also answer questions and issue clarifications on how the OECD rules were to operate to ensure that jurisdictions understood the technical aspects of the rules. Inland Revenue would also allocate resource to compliance initiatives to ensure that the information received was effectively utilised to support users of cryptoasset intermediaries to pay the correct amount of tax. Inland Revenue regularly reviews tax settings on an ongoing basis and provides advice and updates to the Government accordingly. Policy officials maintain strong communication channels with stakeholders in the tax advisory community and these stakeholders will be able to correspond with officials about the operation of the new rules at any time. If problems emerge, they will be dealt with either operationally, or by way of legislative amendment if agreed by Parliament.
Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section 1: Diagnosing the policy problem What is the context behind the policy problem and how is the status quo expected to develop? 1. Tax relief has been provided during emergency events and in the subsequent recovery phase depending on the nature of the event. As noted earlier, emergency events can encompass natural disasters - such as the 2010 and 2011 Canterbury earthquakes and the 2023 North Island floods. They can also include disease outbreaks or pandemics - such as Mycoplasma bovis outbreaks on farms, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, these responses are initiated through a combination of Commissioner of Inland Revenue discretions, Orders in Council and primary legislative amendments. 2. Current tax law enables responses through: Commissioner of Inland Revenue discretions for: • remitting late filing and payment penalties • early withdrawals from or late deposits into the income equalisation deposits scheme, and • the declaration of an event as an emergency event so support payments to relieve the adverse impacts of that event are not included as family scheme income for Working for Families purposes. Orders in Council mechanisms for: • remitting of use-of-money interest (UOMI) charged on late payments of tax • declaring certain support payments not to be taxable grants or subsidies for goods and services tax purposes • increasing the write-off thresholds for small tax debt balances, and • extension of filing times for research and development tax credits. 3. Beyond this, further assistance requires amendments to primary legislation, usually the Income Tax Act 2007. This has been traditionally done when there is an unexpected tax liability that would not have arisen but for the event, such as in the case of the Canterbury and Hurunui-Kaikōura earthquakes, and the 2023 flooding events. 4. Examples of the measures that were provided are: • deferral of depreciation recovery income • turning off the application of the bright-line rules for local authority property buy- outs of residential properties, • capped tax-free employer payments and fringe benefits to support employees who need alternative accommodation and transport, and • extension of the time period for tax free accommodation allowances for those working away from home on major flood-related reconstruction projects. 5. Some events, such as a drought or a very localised event, have required fewer measures and have been largely handled through Commissioner discretions. However, widespread and/or protracted events have needed a wider set of measures Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] irrespective of whether they were declared a national or local emergency. This means the proposed generic measures need to cover both. 6. The status quo involves creating an individual response for each emergency event. This includes amending primary legislation following Ministerial and Cabinet approvals. A continuation of these settings means that the entire process can take up to a year to complete depending on the availability of a tax Bill. 7. The Severe Weather Emergency Recovery Act 2023 did provide for Orders in Council to be made to override certain Acts, but the Inland Revenue Acts were not included within its scope and the Act only related to the 2023 North Island flooding events. What is the policy problem or opportunity? 8. The status quo has timing and efficiency issues. The root cause of this issue is the time intensive process of creating an individual response to each emergency event, particularly when amending primary legislation is needed. This can be resource- intensive and creates uncertainty for taxpayers while the necessary Parliamentary approvals are obtained, which can take up to a year. This was the case for the 2023 North Island floods. 9. Although the legislation can be backdated to ensure that it applies from the emergency, affected taxpayers are left with uncertainty in the meantime. This process becomes particularly cumbersome if there is more than one major emergency in a year. 10. The aim of providing tax relief is to ensure that taxpayers do not have to stress about their tax affairs following an emergency event. Certainty that tax relief is available when it is most needed is important to taxpayers. Further, tax relief assists in recovery by ensuring that an emergency event does not put a taxpayer in a worse tax position after the event. Conversely, leaving taxpayers in a state of uncertainty over their tax positions adds to their distress following the event and can lead to a less efficient recovery. We have not, however, endeavoured to quantify the benefits from reduced uncertainty. 11. The status quo ties up Inland Revenue resources that could be used on other government priorities. Policy resources, in particular, are required to guide tax relief measures through the Parliamentary process. Delays in implementation also impact on Inland Revenue providing advice and addressing taxpayer queries about their tax positions in the meantime. 12. The status quo will become increasingly problematic if there are an increasing number of emergency events arising from climate change, including increased frequency of severe weather events such as flooding, cyclones and droughts. Related issue 13. The information that Inland Revenue collects can be of use to other agencies responding to an emergency event. However, there is no permitted legislative disclosure provision that allows Inland Revenue to share this sensitive revenue information with other agencies in such circumstances. In responding to the COVID- 19 pandemic, a permitted disclosure provision was included in legislation, but this was specific to the pandemic and does not apply to other emergencies. Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 14. A recent example of the issue the limitation can create was a request from the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) for Inland Revenue to provide identity information to assist in the administration of grants to people who had been displaced because of Cyclone Gabrielle. No information could be shared. In contrast, the Information Sharing Code, issued by the Privacy Commissioner, enables other agencies to share information once the Government has declared a state of national emergency. Withholding information could result in delays in providing assistance to affected taxpayers following an emergency event. Inland Revenue would like to assist in emergency event recovery by having the ability to help these people following an emergency event, subject to adequate safeguards. What objectives are sought in relation to the policy problem? 15. The solution to the policy problem should be efficient. It should streamline the process to provide relief and certainty to New Zealanders. It should also form part of a cohesive government-wide response. Finally, it should reduce the use of Inland Revenue fiscal and administrative resources. An efficient and certain approach will support lowering taxpayer compliance costs, be enduring, and remove the need for ad-hoc changes to respond to specific emergencies. 16. However, our approach should also take into account the risks associated with devolving discretionary powers. A generic response may result in Ministers or the Commissioner of Inland Revenue having more discretionary powers. There is also the risk that generic provisions in legislation would raise expectations that the measures would be applied after every emergency when that may not be necessary. Therefore, we aim to seek a solution that is consistent with the established principles for devolving power from primary to secondary legislation as outlined in the LDAC guidelines. Regulatory Impact Statement | 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section 2: Deciding on an option to address the policy problem What criteria will be used to compare options to the status quo? 17. We have used the following criteria to assess the options against our objectives: • Efficiency and consistency: Does the option create an emergency events process that minimises the use of Inland Revenue resources and is consistent with tax policy principles and maintaining the integrity of the tax system? • Compliance benefits: Does the option assist taxpayers in complying with the tax law? • Coherence: Is the option consistent with a government-wide emergency events approach? • Fiscal cost: Does the option minimise fiscal costs? • Administrative cost: Does the option minimise administrative costs? • Consistent with the guidelines on devolving Parliamentary power: Does the option contain adequate safeguards to manage the risks associated with devolving power from Parliament to the Executive or Commissioner of Inland Revenue? 18. To the extent that there are trade-offs between these criteria, their weighting will be determined in light of the overarching objective of determining an approach that is both efficient and consistent with tax policy principles. We have not included equity as a criterion because it is only really relevant for the last option given its policy nature. The other options considered are more about improved process. What scope will options be considered within? 19. The scope of feasible options is limited to some extent by New Zealand’s long- standing tax policy settings. These settings have been established in line with a broad-base low-rate framework. This framework supports the consistent application of tax across the economy in a non-distortive manner, and thus any departure, including the provision of concessionary treatment, requires strong justification. 20. The scope of options has been limited by the time constraints of the project. The changes will be in the next omnibus tax Bill, scheduled for introduction in August 2024. This means that options that would require extensive policy change or consultation under the Generic Tax Policy Process were ruled out. While targeted consultation occurred with Inland Revenue’s key stakeholder channels, longer and public consultation would be required for substantial change, for example, emergency measures not used in a previous event. Future work on new generic measures is not precluded, but it is outside the scope of this project. Emergency event definition 21. As noted earlier, for tax purposes, it is appropriate to rely on the existing definitions of “emergency” and the declarations of an emergency under other legislation. There are existing definitions for local and national emergencies under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002. This is our preferred definition of emergency. Using the existing government-wide definition would mean Inland Revenue’s responses would be compatible with a cross-agency response to emergency events. This definition distinguishes states of national and local emergencies, while still accommodating both types of emergency events. 22. Primary industry biological events (for example, foot and mouth, Mycoplasma bovis) covered by the Biosecurity Act 1993 should also be included in the definition. Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 23. A national state of emergency has been declared three times in New Zealand, in response to: • the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake • the COVID-19 pandemic, and • Cyclone Gabrielle flooding. 24. Setting the definition at the level of only a national state of emergency would generally make the threshold too high and would preclude many events for which emergency tax measures have previously been provided. Option Three does, however, focus on only national emergencies following consultation with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. This is to align it with the Information Sharing Code, which focuses on national emergencies. It is consistent with the approach available to other government agencies in respect of disclosing private information. 25. Some events, such as a drought or a very localised event, have required fewer measures and have been largely handled through Commissioner of Inland Revenue discretions. We envisage a continuation of that process. However, widespread and/or protracted events have needed a wider set of measures irrespective of whether they were declared a national or local emergency, which means the proposed generic measures need to cover both. 26. The above emergency event definition helps to maintain a coherent government-wide response to emergency events. It also ensures a rigid boundary around use of the generic measures, as a safeguard in devolving Parliamentary power. What options are being considered? Option One – Status quo 27. Option One is to maintain the status quo. To the extent that a legislative response is needed to activate specific tax relief, it is achieved through primary legislation. This process requires policy and operational resources and could take up to a year depending on the availability of an omnibus tax Bill. 28. This option has the benefit of being implemented through primary legislation, which means that Ministers, Cabinet and Parliament must approve each measure. 29. This option does not impact the government-wide emergency events approach because Inland Revenue would continue to respond following a major emergency event. 30. Under this option any fiscal cost is only recognised when the Government agrees to use a particular measure for an emergency event. 31. The main issue with this approach is that it is inefficient and creates uncertainty for taxpayers while the legislation needs to be enacted. 32. Stakeholders were not supportive of this option; all stakeholders were supportive of a change in the status quo. Parliamentary Counsel Office indicated that a move away from the status quo would need to be consistent with LDAC guidelines on devolving Parliamentary powers to secondary legislation. Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Option Two –Step-down approach 33. Option Two is a step-down approach. This approach would use tax measures from past major emergency events as the basis for the generic measures. Those measures have proven to be useful for affected taxpayers. The legislation would enable activation of any of those measures by Order in Council in a future emergency. An Order in Council should take no more than two months to activate. 34. Under the step-down approach, measures generally move down a level in the authorisation process. For example, a measure that is currently enacted through primary legislation would become activated by an Order in Council in a future emergency. 35. It would also mean one current Order in Council mechanism – remission of use-of- money interest – would become a Commissioner of Inland Revenue discretion. However, in that case the Commissioner would still be constrained by legislative criteria, such as maintaining the integrity of the tax system, and would not be obligated to exercise those powers. 36. The following measures have been selected for inclusion in this generic approach: 4 Deferral of the unexpected income resulting from an insurance payout on a destroyed asset provided the asset is replaced. Measure Current mechanism Proposed mechanism When previously used Taxation rollover relief 4 for: • revenue account property • depreciable property • amortisable land improvements Primary legislation Order in Council Canterbury and Kaikōura earthquakes, 2023 North Island flooding events Depreciation amendments associated with rollover relief Primary legislation Order in Council Canterbury and Kaikōura earthquakes, 2023 North Island flooding events Capped employer payments and fringe benefits, and extended tax-free accommodation period Primary legislation Order in Council Canterbury earthquakes, 2023 North Island flooding events Income spreading provisions for forced livestock sales Primary legislation Order in Council Mycoplasma bovis outbreak commencing 2017 Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 37. The measures were selected based on research of Inland Revenue’s responses to past emergency events. The key criteria used for selection were: • the measure has been used in multiple past emergency events (either local or national emergency events) or is a measure for a specific type of emergency event (i.e. a biosecurity event) • the measure was used by affected taxpayers, and • the measure has limited fiscal impact. 38. If a past measure was used by a relatively limited number of taxpayers, was overly complex, or had a significant fiscal cost, it was excluded because the measure would likely not be used in future emergency events. Measures with a significant fiscal cost should continue to be subject to both Ministerial and Cabinet decision-making and Parliamentary approval. This ensures that discretionary decision-making is limited. 39. Several stakeholders suggested measures that were used during the COVID-19 pandemic. These suggestions were considered against our objectives and criteria. For example, based on its application during the pandemic, the carry back of losses proved to be complex. It also had a significant fiscal cost. For these reasons it was not used as a North Island flood relief measure. Therefore, we did not include it in the generic response. 40. It is worth noting that the COVID-19 pandemic was an unprecedented emergency event and a ‘high bar’ for emergency events. The tax relief measures used, and the authority provided to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, extended or modified a due date, deadline, time period or time frame or varied an administrative requirement during COVID-19 (under sections 6H and 6I of the Tax Administration Act 1994). These powers should not generally form the basis of a generic response to other emergencies. If an emergency event of the same scale as the COVID-19 pandemic were to occur, these measures should go through the Parliamentary process. 5 If a residential property is sold within a set period of time after acquiring it, the owner may have to pay income tax on any gain on the sale.

Option Two raises issues because most measures would be activated by Order in Council rather than passed by Parliament, and one would become a Commissioner discretion. However, this option manages this risk by Parliament agreeing to which measures to include in the legislation on a generic basis and retaining Ministerial discretion over which of the measures to activate. The Governor-General would also need to agree to any Orders in Council. 42. Under this option, the definition of an emergency would simply set the boundary as to what events might ultimately lead to activation of tax measures but would not guarantee activation. This also manages expectations that the measures would be applied after every emergency when that might not be necessary. 43. This option is certain and efficient. Rather than starting an individual response, officials and Ministers can select measures from the list to implement through an Order in Council. This is a much quicker process because Orders in Council can be applied within two months. This reduces administrative costs for Inland Revenue because there will be a streamlined process for an emergency event response. It also reduces the period of uncertainty for the affected taxpayers over whether the tax relief will become law and can be factored into their tax returns. 44. It is consistent with tax policy principles because the proposed generic measures have been previously applied after being assessed as being consistent with the principles, and the new information sharing provision requires the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to be satisfied about the integrity of the party that has requested the information. 45. Finally, this option has no fiscal cost because it simply involves a change in the process. If a measure is subsequently agreed to be activated, the fiscal cost is determined at that time. 46. Therefore, overall, this option achieves the objectives of a certain and efficient emergency events response, while reducing compliance and administrative costs, and mitigating devolution of power concerns. 47. Stakeholder feedback generally supported this approach. The only differing views were over whether further measures should be added to those proposed, and the need to be consistent with LDAC guidelines. Option Three – Step-down approach with information sharing (officials’ preferred option). 48. Option Two addresses the primary problem definition but does not address the additional problem of information sharing. Option Three is the same as Option Two but introduces an information sharing power consistent with that already available to other agencies in a national emergency. This additional measure is in response to Inland Revenue being unable in previous emergencies to share information to help other agencies deliver assistance. Such a power would contribute to a more coherent and efficient whole-of-government response. It would be activated by Order in Council. Stakeholders were generally supportive of an information sharing provision being introduced. Regulatory Impact Statement | 14 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 49. As noted earlier, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner were concerned that the power should not exceed that provided to other agencies under its Information Sharing Code. 50. Therefore, Option Three involves giving the Commissioner of Inland Revenue a discretion to share sensitive revenue information with other agencies who need that information to help in delivering assistance in an emergency, provided certain safeguards are met. 51. The specific safeguards are: • The power would only be available for events that are declared national emergencies. The power would need to be consistent with Information Sharing Code. 6 • Information could only be shared for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose of the information requests for that event, and within the time limitations set by the Information Sharing Code (i.e. up to 20 working days after the end of a state of emergency). • The Commissioner of Inland Revenue would need to be satisfied about the integrity of the party that has requested the information, and that the information was readily available. • A memorandum of understanding would need to be drawn up and agreed between the Commissioner and the party who requested the information specifying the information to be shared. 52. A limitation of this option is that the information sharing would only be for national emergencies. Ideally other emergencies should also potentially qualify considering the problem being addressed. The 2023 Auckland Anniversary weekend floods, for example, were not initially a national emergency. This limitation was in response to the concerns raised by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner about Inland Revenue having a separate information sharing provision that went beyond that allowed to other agencies under the Information Sharing Code. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner and Inland Revenue subsequently agreed to restrict the proposed Inland Revenue power to align with the Information Sharing Code. This would not preclude our undertaking work with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner at a later stage on the appropriateness of extending the information sharing power to other declared emergencies. 53. Overall, Option Three would have the benefits of Option Two plus would assist in achieving a more coherent government-wide approach for national emergencies. It would only be the same as Option Two for other emergencies. There could be a small increase in administrative costs from having to draw up and agree any m emoranda of understanding, but that cost would be limited by the relative rarity of national emergencies. Option Four – Extend information sharing to other emergencies 54. Option Four is the same as Option Three except the information sharing power would be available for all emergencies, not just national emergencies. This could be of 6 Made under the Privacy Act 2020. Regulatory Impact Statement | 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] greater use than Option Three and, therefore, result in a more efficient outcome with only a marginal increase in administration costs. 55. Officials considered a legislative solution that involved defining more widely the situations when the Commissioner of Inland Revenue would have discretion to share information with any Government agency that made a reasonable and justifiable request for information needed to help them provide assistance in an emergency. As with Option Three, a proposal to share information would still have needed to be considered against Inland Revenue’s obligations under the Tax Administration Act 1994 to maintain the integrity of the tax system. The Commissioner would need to be satisfied about the integrity of the party that has requested the information, and that the information was readily available. It would enable the sharing of information for only as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose of the information request. 56. Option Four would, arguably, go further than is allowed to other agencies in an emergency in terms of disclosing personal information. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner was concerned about this aspect. We are mindful that they may undertake future work on the Information Sharing Code, and we would not wish to pre-empt the outcome of that work by having, in advance, a wider disclosure provision. For this reason, Option Four is not preferred at this stage. 57. Other stakeholders were generally supportive of this option, but the more constrained information sharing option was not included in the consultation options as a comparison. Option Five – Extended definition of emergency when depreciation recovery income arises as a result of an emergency 58. Option Five is Option Three modified to a allow a tax deferral of the depreciation recovery income that can arise when a taxpayer receives an insurance payout for a destroyed asset in any emergency, not just a declared emergency (for example, a taxpayer’s factory burns down and needs to be replaced). 59. This extension could have a small fiscal cost because it would involve a policy change and the deferral of depreciation recovery income element would be available to taxpayers as part of the standard tax rules and would not require an Order in Council to activate it. 7 60. From a tax policy perspective, creating a generic response for emergency events raises questions about the fairness and integrity of the tax system. In theory, a person that has their factory burnt down should have the same tax relief as someone who lost theirs in a widespread flood. Conceptually, these can be similar circumstances leading to depreciation recovery income and, therefore, should be treated the same by the tax system. This argument could also potentially apply to some of the other measures in the proposed set of generic measures. However, with the possible exception of amortised land improvements, there are other tax policy considerations for limiting tax relief to declared emergencies in those cases. 7 Specifically, it would involve excluding depreciable property from the taxation rollover relief measures outlined in paragraph 34 and adding a separate income spreading provision into the Income Tax Act 2007 for self-assessed emergencies. Regulatory Impact Statement | 16 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 61. Option Five is not our preferred option for two policy reasons. First, it would be difficult to define and substantiate the scope of what would qualify as an emergency under this option. It would effectively leave it to the taxpayer to self-assess an emergency for depreciation recovery income purposes, raising potential compliance issues as well as potential uncertainty for taxpayers. An emergency in such cases would essentially become any external event that irreparably damaged an asset. It would also differ from how other departments define an emergency. 62. Second, it would require a policy change, which would require extensive public consultation that is not possible in the current timeframe for the omnibus tax Bill proposed for introduction later this year. To date, stakeholders have identified major emergencies as the priority. 63. As noted above, this policy change would also likely involve a fiscal cost, albeit probably relatively small and unquantifiable. 64. This option was not specifically consulted on because it was outside the scope of the type of generic responses that earlier submissions had suggested. Regulatory Impact Statement | 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] What option is likely to best address the problem, meet the policy objectives, and deliver the highest net benefits? 65. Option Three – Step-down approach with information sharing is likely to best address the problem. 66. This approach streamlines Inland Revenue’s emergency event response to be more efficient and certain. It has compliance benefits for taxpayers, administrative costs for Inland Revenue, and it promotes an overall coherence with Government approach to emergency events. This is aided by the inclusion of the information sharing provision, which will help other agencies in their national emergency event recovery. It achieves these objectives with no fiscal cost. 67. It does involve some issues as a result of devolving an aspect of Parliament’s legislative power to the Executive or Commissioner of Inland Revenue, but this risk is managed through ensuring Ministerial approval is still required, and that the responses are not automatically triggered. Parliament will also have to sanction the generic measures that are proposed to be included in the Income Tax Act 2007. 68. This option helps increase our preparedness for more emergency events due to climate change. It future proofs our response and ensures that administrative resources can be used for other Government priorities.

The preferred option (Option Three – Step-down approach with information sharing) would require amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. 70. The selected option would come into force on 1 April 2025. It would be included in the next omnibus tax Bill, scheduled for introduction in August 2024. 71. The usual guidance on the changes would be published on Inland Revenue’s website and in a Tax Information Bulletin shortly after any changes were enacted. 72. Inland Revenue would be responsible for the implementation and administration of the new rules. Inland Revenue will provide guidance to operational departments affected by any changes to ensure there is an understanding of the new rules. 73. Guidance would need to be published by Inland Revenue explaining the changes and the tax implication. There is existing guidance on emergency event tax relief. Consideration would be given as to whether it needs to be updated. How will the new arrangements be monitored, evaluated, and reviewed? 74. Policy officials would maintain strong communication channels with stakeholders in the tax advisory community and these stakeholders would be able to correspond with officials about the operation of the new rules at any time. If problems emerge, they will be dealt with either operationally, or by way of legislative amendment if agreed by Parliament. 75. A post-implementation review may be considered at a later stage.
Regulatory Impact Statement | 2 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Like transfers to non-QROPS, withdrawals from QROPS before the age of 55 (the UK’s minimum retirement age) are subject to unauthorised payment charges. Under the KiwiSaver rules, a migrant can withdraw money from the KiwiSaver to pay the New Zealand tax due. However, for transfers to a QROPS, a withdrawal to meet a New Zealand tax liability is subject to an unauthorised payment charge like any other withdrawal. While the QROPS regime was intended by HMRC to make the retirement funds of UK emigrants more mobile (without creating opportunities for tax avoidance), two problems have arisen undermining this objective for emigrants to New Zealand. These are: 1) The inability for some migrants to pay the New Zealand tax due on transfer to a QROPS without withdrawing funds from the scheme. 2) The existence of “locked-in” KiwiSavers. Resolving these issues requires legislative change in New Zealand to amend the relevant provisions for pension transfers. Issue 1: Payment of tax on QROPS transfers Some UK emigrants who transfer their retirement funds to a QROPS after many years in New Zealand are met with a substantial New Zealand tax liability which they struggle to pay without accessing the retirement funds. As described above, a withdrawal from the fund to pay the tax triggers UK unauthorised payment charges. The personal liability for the New Zealand tax payment and the risk of the UK’s tax charge creates a barrier to QROPS transfers. Option 1 – Status quo The obligation to pay tax on pension transfer will continue to fall on the migrant, causing hardship in some cases. Migrants may leave their funds in the UK because of the tax barrier, which is contrary to the intent of the rules. Option 2 – Scheme pays – flat rate (preferred option, recommended in Cabinet paper) A migrant wanting to transfer their UK pension funds to a QROPS would be able to elect to have the QROPS provider be liable for the New Zealand tax on their transfer and to pay that tax out of the transferred funds (referred to hereafter as “scheme pays”). The tax would be at a flat 28% rate. The migrant would be liable for the correctness of the information provided and any deficiency in the tax paid. No UK tax charges would apply, because the scheme would be liable for the tax and no funds would flow to the migrant personally. QROPS would be required to do monthly information reporting on transfers to Inland Revenue. QROPS would be required to offer the scheme pays option, which migrants could elect to adopt. Schemes receiving transfers from other countries would also be required to offer the option to ensure the treatment does not discriminate based on the fund’s origin. Inland Revenue and scheme providers will require time to implement the necessary system changes. Accordingly, officials propose that scheme pays is introduced from 1 April 2026. Option 3 – Scheme pays – prescribed investor rate Regulatory Impact Statement | 3 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Same as option 2 but using the migrant’s prescribed investor rate (PIR) instead of a flat 28%. This would reduce the transfer tax for lower-income migrants. Impact of preferred options Providing for a QROPS to withhold and remit transfer tax at 28% on the migrant’s behalf would ensure that migrants are able to use the transferred funds to pay the New Zealand tax due. This would remove the tax barrier to pension transfers in a relatively simple way. Migrants would still have the option to pay the tax themselves if they wanted the benefit of a lower rate. In addition, there is anecdotal evidence of non-compliance under the status quo, with some migrants not returning tax on the transferred funds in their IR3 tax return. There is an opportunity to improve understanding of, and compliance with, New Zealand’s foreign superannuation rules by introducing scheme pays. Issue 2: Locked-in KiwiSavers In 2015, KiwiSaver schemes ceased to be QROPS. and some migrants reportedly still have “locked-in” funds which cannot be transferred to any other KiwiSaver without triggering UK tax charges. This creates issues both for migrants wanting to move their funds to another scheme, and for KiwiSaver providers wanting to merge schemes with low participation. Option 1 – Status Quo Migrants in “locked-in KiwiSavers” are subject to UK rules for a specified period (generally five UK tax years for this population). Fewer individuals should be affected over time because the UK rules ceased to apply to them and their fund. However, scheme providers remain affected by UK reporting requirements for an ongoing period, so they would need to report any unauthorised transfers to HMRC. Further, both migrants and funds are unable to transfer or manage their funds as permitted by the KiwiSaver rules. Option 2 – Election to transfer locked-in KiwiSaver funds to QROPS (preferred option, recommended in Cabinet paper) The KiwiSaver provider would be able to choose to move locked-in UK funds from KiwiSaver into a QROPS (subject to the migrant’s consent), leaving the remaining funds in the KiwiSaver. Officials propose that the election be available from 1 April 2025. Option 3 – One-off expulsion of all locked-in KiwiSaver funds into QROPS On a particular day, all locked-in UK funds in KiwiSavers would be compulsorily expelled into a QROPS. Impact of preferred option Allowing a KiwiSaver provider to move locked-in UK funds into a QROPS would give the provider and the migrant the flexibility to change KiwiSaver providers and reorganise KiwiSaver investments without UK tax risk. Stakeholder views Officials undertook three rounds of targeted consultation with scheme providers and representative bodies between 2018 and 2024. Stakeholders are generally supportive of officials’ preferred options. Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] regimes are well-established, at least one of these problems seems very likely to persist unless there is a targeted policy change to address it. W h a t i s t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m o r o p p o r t u n i t y? 6. The first and primary problem is that many UK emigrants who transfer their retirement funds to a QROPS after many years in New Zealand are met with a substantial tax liability which they struggle to pay without accessing the retirement funds. But doing so triggers UK tax charges. These create a barrier to QROPS transfers. 7. The second problem is that, as of 17 June 2015, KiwiSaver schemes ceased to receive QROPS transfers 4 and some individuals reportedly still have ‘locked-in’ funds which cannot be transferred to any other KiwiSaver without triggering UK tax charges. This creates issues both for individuals wanting to move their funds to another scheme, and for KiwiSaver providers wanting to merge schemes with low participation. 8. According to Inland Revenue data, as of March 2021 there were 38 QROPS in NZ, with 12,229 members in complying funds and 4,669 members in legacy schemes. In 2021- 22, 2,700 individuals reported receipt of a foreign superannuation withdrawals or transfer. The data does not specify the source of the income or whether it is a transfer. In 2022-23, 458 people reported receipt of a foreign superannuation withdrawal or transfer, with 113 reporting that the amount was sourced in the UK (chiefly England). 9. As such, the number of migrants potentially affected by the transfer issue each year are in the hundreds or low thousands at most. Of those who file their annual tax return indicating income from foreign superannuation withdrawals or transfers per year, it is not known how many are unable to pay tax arising from a transfer. 10. It is not known how many migrants still have problematic locked-in KiwiSavers. Of the 4669 members in legacy schemes, it is likely that many, if not most, would no longer be subject to UK charges if they transferred the UK funds to another New Zealand pension scheme. This is because by now (2024), many members will have been non-UK resident for at least five years and will therefore no longer be subject to UK tax charges. 5 As some stakeholders have continued to push for a solution, we assume there must be a non-negligible number of individuals affected. However, it could be a few hundred. In addition, some scheme providers are concerned about their ongoing obligation to report unauthorised transfers to HMRC if they do allow transfers out of the KiwiSaver Schemes, which applies even if the migrant is no longer subject to a UK charge. 11. Inland Revenue became aware of QROPS issues in 2015. Targeted consultation was undertaken in 2018, 2022 and early 2024. The gap between 2018 and 2022 overlapped with the Covid pandemic, during which time this project was deprioritised. 12. The stakeholders are: QROPS providers; industry and professional bodies, including Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Certified Practicing Accountants Australia, and the Financial Services Council; and other tax practitioners. Collectively these groups represent the interests of the individual UK migrants who could stand to benefit from QROPS policy changes. 13. Stakeholders unanimously agree that there is often a cashflow problem for migrants faced with a substantial tax liability on QROPS transfers and support a solution. Only a 4 KiwiSavers ceased to be QROPS because of the ability to withdraw funds for reasons other than retirement, such as financial hardship and first home purchase. 5 The increase of the tax charge period from five to ten years did not come into effect until 2017, so is not applicable for locked-in KiwiSavers, which originated in 2015, unless the individual has had a period of UK residence since that time. In that case, the tax charge window will have reset. Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] small subset of stakeholders are interested in the locked-in KiwiSaver issue, but those who are interested continue to support a solution. 14. A somewhat unusual feature of these problems is that they are largely caused by UK tax policy settings, and any solutions need to be acceptable to HMRC. Officials have corresponded with HMRC and HMRC have confirmed that our preferred options satisfy HMRC’s requirements. W h a t o b j e c t i v e s a r e s o u g h t i n r e l a t i o n t o t he p o l i c y p r o b l e m ? 15. Several objectives are sought in relation to the two policy problems. • The primary objective in addressing problem 1 is to remove the cashflow barrier to QROPS transfers. To the extent migrants are currently choosing to leave their pension funds in the UK because they would be unable to meet a New Zealand tax liability on the transfer without tapping into the funds and incurring UK tax charges, New Zealand is missing out on capital under the status quo. This outcome is also inconsistent with the purpose of the transfer rules, which is to remove any tax barrier to leaving funds overseas. • It is in New Zealand’s interest for migrants to bring their retirement savings here and invest in our markets. It is also in the interest of many migrants to simplify their affairs by locating their pension funds in their country of residence, rather than elsewhere. Although the problem arises in the context of QROPS, for reasons of fairness any solution should be available for transfers from other jurisdictions. • Anecdotally, there is suspected misunderstanding and non-compliance with New Zealand’s tax rules for foreign superannuation. There is an opportunity to improve compliance via reporting requirements. • The main objectives in addressing problem 2 are to provide flexibility and certainty to individuals with locked-in KiwiSavers, and to the KiwiSaver providers. The risk of UK tax charges being triggered by any changes to locked-in KiwiSavers causes governance uncertainty for providers and is an obstacle to the mobility of KiwiSaver funds between providers. Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section 2: Deciding upon an option to addres s the policy proble m W h a t c r i t e r i a w i l l b e u s e d to c o m p a r e o p t i o n s to t h e s t a t u s q u o ? Problem 1 – Payment of tax on transfer 16. The criteria for options to address problem 1 are: facilitation of transfer, fiscal cost, compliance costs, administration costs, and vertical and horizontal equity. The definition of each criterion in this context is given below. 17. Facilitation of transfer is the extent to which the option reduces the tax barrier to pension transfers. 18. Fiscal cost is measured by reference to the impact on Government revenue. 19. Compliance costs are the net monetary, time, or other costs associated with the migrant availing themselves of the option. ‘Net’ means the sum of the individual’s and the scheme provider’s compliance costs to recognise the efficiencies of a smaller population (scheme providers) bearing the compliance burden on behalf of a larger population (individual migrants). 20. Administrative costs are the monetary, time, or other costs associated with Inland Revenue and other agencies implementing the option. 21. Vertical equity is the degree to which the option results in migrants with higher incomes paying a proportionally higher amount of tax than migrants with lower incomes. 22. Horizontal equity is a measurement of fairness based on whether the option discriminates against the fund’s country of origin. 23. Increasing vertical equity necessitates increasing the complexity of the policy option. Thus, it entails increased administration and compliance costs. Problem 2 – Locked-in KiwiSavers 24. The criteria for options to address problem 2 are: flexibility, certainty, proportionality, and integrity. The definition of each criterion in this context is given below. 25. Flexibility is the ability for migrants with locked-in KiwiSavers and KiwiSaver providers to manage their portfolios according to their commercial preferences without tax risk. 26. Certainty is the unambiguous knowledge of migrants with locked-in KiwiSavers and KiwiSaver providers that there will cease to be any UK tax risk in relation to their investments following the implementation of the option. 27. Proportionality is the degree to which the costs of the option are commensurate with the scale of the problem. 28. Integrity is the degree to which the proposal conforms to general KiwiSaver rules. 29. There is a potential trade-off between certainty and proportionality, wherein achieving absolute certainty that all locked-in KiwiSavers no longer carry any UK tax risk requires a disproportionately costly policy intervention given the apparently small scale of the problem. 30. As there are no expected fiscal or administrative costs for the Government or Inland Revenue in relation to this problem, these have not been considered in this regulatory impact statement. Compliance costs have also been excluded from consideration as Regulatory Impact Statement | 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] affected scheme providers seek this change on the basis that it ultimately benefits their ability to manage retirement savings. W h a t s c o p e w i l l o p t i o n s b e c o n s i d e r e d w i t h i n ? 31. One important scope limitation is the acceptability of an option to the UK’s revenue authority, HMRC. Given that the policy issues relate to the prospect of tax charges being imposed by HMRC, it is essential for any solution to have HMRC’s approval. In contrast to most other policy changes, QROPS tax policy changes are largely driven by UK tax concerns, not New Zealand ones. 32. A second limitation is the acceptability of an option for stakeholders – in particular, pension scheme providers. It is providers who will bear the bulk of the costs of implementing any policy solution. 33. A third limitation is the availability of Inland Revenue resources to continue refining solutions to policy problems that were first raised in 2015. By now there is a strong imperative to implement a solution that is an improvement on the status quo, even it is not regarded by all stakeholders as the optimal one. 34. A fourth limitation is the lack of data on certain aspects of the policy issues. In relation to the tax on transfer issue: • We are unable to determine the number of migrants affected by the inability to pay New Zealand tax due. This is in part because current tax return data does not distinguish between withdrawals from an overseas superannuation scheme and transfers from such schemes. It is also because cashflow issues do not arise in every case, they are brought to Inland Revenue’s attention by individuals or their advisors. • We do not know to what extent pension transfers to New Zealand from countries other than the UK pose problems, or even occur. This is due to the non- availability of disaggregated return data in relation to overseas pension transfers. 35. A fifth limitation is that the administrative burden should not be excessive relative to the population size. Options such as using an effective marginal tax rate or a prescribed investor rate (PIR) would require Inland Revenue to “square-up” the tax paid to ensure it was at the correct rate. If this was incorporated into income tax it would add complexity to the customer’s income tax assessments and it would be nearly impossible to ensure over-payments from the scheme weren’t refunded to the customer (in breach of HMRC’s requirements). Alternatively, if this was separated into a new account type with its own tax square-up it would significantly increase administrative costs. 36. For simplicity, a flat rate deduction from the scheme means the tax is full and final and there is no need to build a two-way interface to send money back to the scheme. 37. On the locked-in KiwiSaver issue, we do not know how many individuals are affected. We have relied on anecdotal evidence from providers. 38. There are no non-regulatory options available. Resolving these issues requires legislative change in New Zealand to amend the relevant provisions for pension transfers. 39. In determining the appropriate way forward, we have noted that a version of scheme pays is offered under Australian rules. Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] W h a t o p t i o n s a r e b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d? Problem 1 – Payment of tax on transfer Option One – Status quo 40. Under the status quo, many migrants wanting to transfer their UK pension to a QROPS will continue to face the choice between paying the New Zealand tax on transfer: • out of their own pocket; or • out of a withdrawal from the fund itself, thus incurring UK tax charges 41. Facilitation of transfer: The status quo does not facilitate pension transfers, as some migrants struggle or are unable to pay the New Zealand tax on transfer out of their own pockets, and therefore decide not to transfer their pensions to New Zealand at all. 42. Fiscal cost: There is no fiscal cost for this option. 43. Compliance costs: As no action will be taken, additional compliance costs will not arise. Migrants will continue having to report and pay in their annual self-assessment tax return. 44. Administration costs: As no action will be taken, additional admin costs will not arise. However, Inland Revenue will continue to deal with cases of hardship under existing rules, e.g. instalment arrangements. 45. Vertical equity: Under the status quo, progressive rates apply to the taxable portion of the lump sum transferred. However, the progressivity of this approach is variable due to factors such as the lump sum effect (which pushes the amount into a higher tax bracket as all the income must be reported in a single year even though it arose in several subsequent years), and the fact that lower-income migrants may not have sufficient personal funds to pay the tax. 46. Horizontal equity: As no action will be taken, migrants will continue to pay tax at marginal tax rates, regardless of the fund’s origin or the person’s ability to pay. 47. We think this option is not effective as it does not address the problem and the issues will continue. It is likely that many migrants will continue to leave their pension funds in the UK. In addition, concerns about potential non-compliance with New Zealand’s tax rules will continue as no improvement on the current system will be made. Option Two – Scheme pays – flat rate 48. Under this option, a migrant wanting to transfer their UK pension funds to a QROPS would be able to elect to have the QROPS provider be liable for the New Zealand tax and pay it out of the transferred funds. The tax would be at a flat 28% rate. The QROPS will be responsible for reporting the funds liable for New Zealand tax on the transfer (as this ensures that it is not a withdrawal in breach of QROPS rules). The scheme will also be responsible for providing monthly digital reports of transfers received and tax payments where due. However, liability for providing information and the correct calculation will rest with the migrant (meaning the migrant will be liable for any under-payment of the tax, based on the information provided, rather than the fund). 49. If the migrant opts to pay as an individual, then the scheme will file an information only return. The migrant will file and pay via their self-assessment return (status quo), or the Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] information can be pre-populated their MyIR account, and the tax paid at year end. In both cases, the migrant’s marginal tax rate will apply (status quo). 50. To ensure that transfers from the UK and elsewhere are treated equally, we intend this design to apply to all transfers of pension funds to New Zealand pension providers 6 . 51. Inland Revenue and scheme providers will require time to implement the necessary system changes. Accordingly, we propose that scheme pays be introduced from 1 April 2026. 52. Facilitation of transfer: This option would eliminate the cashflow barrier to paying the tax on pension transfers, enabling all migrants who want to transfer their pensions to New Zealand to do so. 53. Fiscal cost: There is a small fiscal cost associated with this option, estimated at $1.6 million in the first year (2027/28), and $0.9 million in the second and third years, increasing gradually each year thereafter. The cost is small because the average tax rate applied to foreign superannuation withdrawals and transfers is approximately 29%, which is only marginally higher than the proposed 28% flat rate. In addition, the removal of the requirement for a migrant to pay the New Zealand tax due from personal sources means that it is possible that more migrants will transfer their foreign pension funds to New Zealand, which will increase revenue. To the extent that scheme pays improves compliance with the rules revenue should also increase. 54. Compliance costs: There will be a one-off increase in compliance costs for providers in implementing scheme pays. Thereafter, compliance costs are expected to be minimal, as they will be driven by transfers received. Schemes already must comply with monthly investment reporting requirements. Migrants will no longer have to include their transfer on an annual IR 3 income tax return. Accordingly we expect this option to result in a net reduction of compliance costs across both funds and migrants compared with the status quo. 55. Administration costs: There will be a one-off increase in administration costs of $2.5 million (capital and operating costs) in implementing scheme pays, however the design will broadly follow the investment income reporting requirements. The ongoing costs will be minimal. 56. Vertical equity: The flat rate closely mimics the average rate of tax paid on overseas pension withdrawals and transfers – 29%. We also note that the highest rate of portfolio investment entity (PIE) tax is 28%. 7 • For migrants on the 10.5% or 17.5% personal rate, the 28% flat rate may be higher than they otherwise would have paid. However, these individuals will have the option to fund the tax due from personal sources or make an instalment arrangement with Inland Revenue. The amount of tax due at lower rates is, by its nature, capped. • For migrants on the 30% and above rates, the tax payable may be lower than under the status quo. However, for these individuals, a flat rate avoids the lump sum effect which causes income to be taxed at a higher effective marginal rate than it would have been had the income accrued and tax been paid annually. 57. Horizontal equity: Migrants will be able to use scheme pays regardless of the origin of the funds, allowing all migrants to use the flat rate. This option will also allow all 6 Noting that transfers between Australian super funds and KiwiSavers are treated differently under the Trans-Tasman retirement savings portability scheme. We intend this scheme to be unaffected by the proposed changes. 7 PIEs are a widely used investment vehicle, which include KiwiSavers. Many QROPS are PIEs. Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] migrants to use the funds to pay the New Zealand tax due, removing the barrier caused by QROPS requirements. 8 58. The scheme pays mechanism will enable migrants to pay New Zealand tax due without breaching HMRC’s requirements, so it is an improvement on the status quo. A flat rate also provides certainty for providers and migrants. The choice of flat rate means the scheme can be implemented with low fiscal cost. Further, increased reporting of pension transfers received in New Zealand should assist in addressing some concerns raised about non-compliance with New Zealand’s rules. 59. Scheme pays should be open all migrants who transfer their retirement savings to New Zealand as a matter of fairness. The simplicity, effectiveness and the concessionary nature of scheme pays for many migrants, in our view, justifies any compliance cost for scheme providers. Option Three – Scheme pays – prescribed investor rates 60. This option would operate the same way as option 2, except the scheme would pay the tax at the migrant’s PIR, as declared by the migrant. The PIRs are currently 10.5%, 17.5% and 28%, depending on the migrant’s taxable income in the preceding two income years. 9 61. Facilitation of transfer: Same as option 2. 62. Fiscal cost: The fiscal cost of this option would be higher than that of option 2, given the greater divergence of rates from the average. 63. Compliance costs: The cost to the schemes of implementing would be similar to that in option 2, however the ongoing costs will be higher because the scheme will need assurance that it is using the correct PIR for each individual migrant. 64. Admin costs: The cost to Inland Revenue would be greater, assuming that it had to build safeguards to prevent money being refunded directly or indirectly to the migrant. The cost of building these safeguards is, in our view, disproportionate to the size of the population that would benefit from scheme pays. 65. Vertical equity: This option is more vertically equitable than option 2, because there are three PIRs as opposed to one flat rate, and it avoids over-taxation of lower-income migrants. Some stakeholders preferred PIRs for this reason. However, officials consider that on balance, the additional costs of a PIR model are not justified. Instead, to address the vertical equity concerns, we have retained the option for the migrant to pay the tax. 66. Horizontal equity: This option has the same horizontal equity effect as option 2. 67. As noted in option 2, scheme pays is an effective mechanism to resolve the problem. However, option 3 is less effective than option 2 because it could result in money flowing back to the migrant if the PIR was too high (breaching HMRC’s requirements and resulting in a UK tax charge), or the migrant having further tax to pay if the PIR was too low. Ensuring that square ups are not required would entail increased administration costs compared with option 2. 8 The KiwiSaver Act 2006 allows for withdrawals to meet a New Zealand tax liability. However, this did not solve the issue for transfers from the UK. 9 The use of effective marginal tax rates was also considered under a “scheme pays” model but this was complex and did not progress in later consultation. The administrative burden would be the same, or higher, than under option 3, meaning that it was not feasible to proceed. Regulatory Impact Statement | 14 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] W h a t o p t i on i s l i k e l y t o b e s t a d d r e s s t h e p r o b l e m , m e e t t h e p o l i c y o b j e c t i v e s , a n d d e l i v e r t h e h i g h e s t n e t b e n e f i t s? 68. In officials’ view, the ‘scheme pays – flat rate’ option is likely to best meet the policy objectives. Allowing the scheme to pay the tax on the migrant’s behalf will solve the cashflow issue migrants face under the status quo, and making the tax a flat rate will simplify compliance and significantly simplify the administration of the policy. Unlike the PIR option, where there would be the possibility of a subsequent square up if the wrong rate was chosen, the final flat rate would provide greater certainty and eliminate extra compliance and administrative steps. 69. Scheme pays will increase compliance and administrative costs for funds and Inland Revenue compared to the status quo, since it will be a new process. However, we will mitigate these as far as possible by leveraging existing processes for investment income. Scheme pays will reduce compliance costs for migrants, as they will no longer need to file an IR 3 income tax return to report the income from the transfer. Overall we think the flat rate option should result in a net reduction in compliance costs across schemes and migrants over the medium to long term. 70. Flat rate scheme pays would technically decrease vertical equity compared to the status quo, since all migrants would be entitled to the 28% rate, regardless of income. Currently, migrants pay the tax at marginal rates (if at all), which are on a progressive tax scale. PIR scheme pays would only marginally decrease vertical equity compared to the status quo, since there are three PIRs (applying to different income brackets), compared with five personal income tax rates. 71. As scheme pays would be available for transfers from the UK and other jurisdictions, there is no change to horizontal equity. All transfers will be subject to the same rules. 72. An additional factor is that officials understand anecdotally that there is some non-compliance with existing rules. Reporting of pension transfers as part of the scheme pays proposal will address this problem to some extent. Regulatory Impact Statement | 16 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 73. We assume that if a scheme pays option is offered, many migrants who would not otherwise transfer their overseas pensions to New Zealand will now do so. This will be beneficial for migrants, who will be able to have their pension funds in their country of residence and thus have simpler tax affairs. Further, the tax burden will not be paid out of the migrant’s pocket. It will also be beneficial for QROPS, as they will receive more money to invest in the capital markets and increase their potential returns. The increase in investment should in turn benefit New Zealand. 74. We assume that the information reporting requirements associated with scheme pays will give Inland Revenue much better data on pension transfers from overseas and improve compliance generally. There is anecdotal evidence of non-compliance under the status quo, with some migrants not returning the tax due on transfer in their IR3 tax return. Since all QROPS transfers will now be required to be reported to Inland Revenue by schemes, Inland Revenue will be better positioned to enforce the foreign superannuation scheme tax rules. 75. The impacts on each affected group have been determined through stakeholder consultation. W h a t o p t i o n s a r e b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d ? Problem 2 – Locked-in KiwiSavers Option One – Status Quo 76. Under this option, transfers of pension funds from the UK would remain locked into KiwiSaver and grandparented for QROPS purposes. Under UK rules, the QROPS portion of the fund can only be transferred to another QROPS, which is not currently permitted by KiwiSaver rules. The KiwiSaver portion of the fund cannot be a QROPS. The combination of UK and New Zealand rules causes complexity and tax risk for both migrants and scheme providers. 77. Flexibility: There would be no change to the ability of migrants or scheme providers to transfer or manage locked-in KiwiSavers. 78. Certainty: There will be no change to certainty, as UK tax risk will remain. 79. Proportionality: It is arguable that, given the small scale of the problem, no change is needed. This is because the period since UK pension funds in KiwiSaver schemes became ‘locked in’ (2015) will get longer as time goes on, so the number of migrants affected by the issue should slowly decrease even if there is no policy change. However scheme providers will remain affected as they will need to report any unauthorised transfers that remain subject to UK requirements to HMRC. This period differs depending on the date the individual member was last a UK tax resident. Migrants from the UK and other countries Reduced compliance costs – including time and monetary cost – for the migrant if scheme pays tax out transferred funds. And reduces potential hardship. High High Inland Revenue Better reporting on overseas pension transfers and better tax compliance. High High Total monetised benefits Unquantified Medium Non-monetised benefits High High Regulatory Impact Statement | 17 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] However, in most cases, it is expected that the period would lapse on 6 April 2026 at the latest. 80. Integrity: As there would be no change, the integrity of the KiwiSaver rules would not be affected. However, KiwiSavers could not operate as intended as transfers between funds are not possible without potential breach of the QROPS rules. Option Two – Election to transfer locked-in KiwiSaver funds to QROPS (preferred) 81. Under this option, the KiwiSaver rules would be changed so that a KiwiSaver scheme could elect totransfer a migrant’s ‘locked in’ UK retirement savings into a QROPS with the migrant’s consent. This would then allow the remaining balance of the KiwiSaver account to be managed by the existing provider or transferred to another KiwiSaver provider without a UK tax charge being incurred. This option is supported by stakeholders. 82. Officials propose that the election be available from 1 April 2025. 83. Flexibility: This option would improve the ability of migrants and scheme providers to manage locked-in KiwiSavers without UK tax risk. 84. Certainty: Assuming that migrants or scheme providers take up this option, there is an opportunity to reduce tax risk and improve certainty for KiwiSaver schemes, since the locked-in UK funds will no longer be in a KiwiSaver. 85. Proportionality: Because we will not be imposing a requirement to transfer locked-in funds to a QROPS, compliance costs will be proportional to the scale of the problem. 86. Integrity: There will be a decrease in the integrity of the KiwiSaver rules, in that QROPS funds are accessible at the age of 55 under current UK rules, rather than 65 under KiwiSaver rules. However, we think this is an acceptable compromise given that the issue is very limited. The affected population is small and the funds to be transferred will relate to the original transfer from the UK rather than subsequent participation in KiwiSaver. Overall, the separation of KiwiSaver and QROPS funds will improve the ability to manage the affected KiwiSaver schemes. Option Three – One-off expulsion of all locked-in KiwiSaver funds into QROPS 87. Under this option, on a particular date, all locked in KiwiSaver funds would be compulsorily expelled into a QROPS. This would be coordinated between all KiwiSaver providers with members with locked-in funds. As a result, after the date of expulsion, there would cease to be any locked-in KiwiSaver funds. One stakeholder advocated for this option. 88. Flexibility: Like option 2, this option would provide flexibility for migrants and scheme providers to manage locked-in KiwiSavers without UK tax risk. 89. Certainty: If executed successfully, this option would create the most certainty, in that there would no longer be any locked-in UK funds. 90. Proportionality: A compulsory transfer of all locked-in KiwiSavers funds to a QROPS could be difficult to execute because it would require coordination between all affected providers and members, whether or not they seek the change. The risks associated with this option and the associated compliance and administration costs mean it is disproportionate to the size of the problem. 91. Integrity: The integrity effect will be the same as for option 2. Regulatory Impact Statement | 19 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] W h a t o p t i o n i s l i k e l y t o b e s t a d d r e s s t h e p r o b l e m , m e e t t h e p o l i c y o b j e c t i v e s , a n d d e l i v e r t h e h i g h e s t n e t b e n e f i t s ? 92. Option two strikes the best balance between effectiveness and cost. While a one-off expulsion of all locked-in KiwiSaver funds into a QROPS would solve the problem once and for all, the effort required to do this successfully does not seem justified given the small scale of the issue and the likelihood that for many schemes and migrants the locked-in period has expired, or will expire, at some point in the short to medium term. 93. Option two would give migrants and schemes who elect to use it the flexibility to reorganise investments after opting to transfer the UK retirement funds out of KiwiSaver and into a QROPS. As a result the change will enable the ability to transfer and manage KiwiSaver schemes to work effectively, in line with the policy intent. This change will come at the cost of enabling a small number of people to access the funds before the age of 65 (or by meeting other withdrawal criteria). Given the limitations of population and fund origin, we think it is an acceptable compromise to achieve the separation of KiwiSaver and QROPS. Regulatory Impact Statement | 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section 3: Delivering a n option H o w w i l l t h e n e w a r r a n g e m e n t s b e i m p l e m e n t e d? Problem 1 – Payment of tax on transfer 95. The new arrangements will be implemented legislatively by amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 as required. Inland Revenue will issue guidance on how the new arrangements will work. On balance we think it will drive better compliance with foreign superannuation tax rules. 96. Inland Revenue will also update its systems to make scheme pays operable. 97. QROPS and other schemes will update their systems to facilitate scheme pays. It will be mandatory for QROPS and other schemes to offer the “scheme pays” option to individuals, and the individual will choose whether they or the scheme pays the tax. Regardless, the scheme will be responsible for sending to Inland Revenue a monthly digital report of transferred funds in the form prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 98. Inland Revenue and scheme providers will require time to implement system changes. Accordingly, we propose that scheme pays be introduced from 1 April 2026. Problem 2: “Locked-in KiwiSavers” 99. The new arrangements will be implemented legislatively by amendments to the KiwiSaver Act 2006, with effect from 1 April 2025. KiwiSaver providers currently managing locked-in UK funds will be able to arrange to transfer the UK funds to a QROPS, leaving any remaining funds in the KiwiSaver. It will be up to the individual KiwiSaver member and scheme providers to decide how or when to do this. Inland Revenue will not prescribe any particular approach. 100. No implementation risks have been identified with the proposed arrangement. We expect that affected stakeholders will follow the policy through the legislative process and/or be updated on the change by Inland Revenue relationship managers. H o w w i l l t h e n e w a r r a n g e m e n t s b e mo n i t o red, ev a l u a ted, a n d re v i e wed? Problem 1 – Payment of tax on transfer 101. Inland Revenue would monitor the effectiveness of scheme pays through its normal compliance processes. The information gathered can be used to assess the success of scheme pays over time. Stakeholders are likely to raise any concerns with Inland Revenue’s policy team, which would feed into the evaluation of the policy. Problem 2 – “Locked-in KiwiSavers” 102. Monitoring of the solution for locked-in KiwiSavers will be qualitative, by way of intermittent contact with stakeholders.
Regulatory Impact Statement | 2 The IWTC would continue to be paid at a maximum rate of $3,770 per year ($72.50 per week) for a family of up to three children, with an additional $780 each year ($15 per week) for each subsequent child. The impacts of option one This option risks the policy objectives of the IWTC being further eroded if the value of the IWTC in relation t o minimum wage continues to decrease. As such, this option is out of step with improving income adequacy for low to middle income families, increasing work incentives for low to middle income families, and helping the Government meet its child poverty reduction targets. However, this option does not bear an additional cost to the Government and would not require Inland Revenue to implement any changes. Option 2: Increase of the in-work tax credit by $25 per week from 31 July 2024 Under option two, none of the existing statutory parameters in relation to eligibility and abatement would be adjusted. The proposed implementation date would be 31 July 2024. The updated rate would take effect alongside the proposed changes to personal income taxes and the Independent Earner Tax Credit. Ad hoc notices of entitlements will need to be sent to WFF customers in June 2024 to inform them of the change. This is likely to increase administrative costs for Inland Revenue as these notices will be sent out during Inland Revenue’s busiest period and are likely to drive increased customer contact. Consultation has shown general support for increases to tax credit rates In 2018, the previous Government established the Welfare Expert Advisory Group (WEAG) to advise them on the future of New Zealand’s social security system, including the WFF scheme. The WEAG recommended fundamental changes to the design and targeting of WFF, as well as significant increases to main benefits and the Family Tax Credit (FTC). In response, the previous Government established the WFF Review as a result of those recommendations. This review included a targeted engagement process with many stakeholders, including several academics and those representing groups who advocate for children. Most survey respondents were of the view that WFF does not currently pay enough support for families. The impacts of option two There will be increased financial resources available to low and middle income working families This change will benefit approximately 1 70,000 families who currently receive the IWTC. They will benefit by a net average of $16.97 per week when factoring in the average rate at which the IWTC abates amongst all IWTC recipients. There will be increased incentive for low and middle income families to take up and stay in paid employment This change will lower replacement ratios, which measures the gap between income when receiving a benefit versus receiving income when in work. By increasing the IWTC, a family’s income in employment would decrease by a greater proportion if they went onto a main benefit or vice versa. Currently, a coupled family working 40 hours per week at minimum wage would retain 80.5% of their income if they left employment and went on benefit, and for a sole parent in the same Regulatory Impact Statement | 3 situation 66.3% of their income would be retained. After the increase to the IWTC, and all other things being equal, these replacement ratios would decrease to 78.8% for a coupled family, and 64.5% for a sole parent family. There will be reductions to child poverty The impact on child poverty of option 2 (increase the IWTC by $25 per week from 31 July 2024) has not been modelled independently to of the other Tax Package changes, due to time constraints. It is estimated that the Tax Package, which includes a $25 increase to the In-Work Tax Credit, will reduce child poverty by around 14,000 children (+/- 6000) on the fixed-line AHC50 measure, 1 and by around 3,000 children (+/- 7000) on the BHC50 measure 2 in the 2027 tax year. 3 The tax package increases the incomes of low-income working households faster than the increase in the cost of living, which reduces fixed-line AHC50 child poverty. However, the tax package may slightly reduce moving-line BHC50 child poverty, since the poverty line for this measure is set at 50% of the median household income, and the tax package is expected to increase the median household income. The overall cost to the Government of Option 2 is estimated to be $607 million over the forecast period The increase to the IWTC will cost $607 million over the forecast period which extends to 30 June 2028. There is an average cost of $152 million per annum of increasing the rates by $25 dollars per week for the 170,000 recipients who currently receive the IWTC. Preferred option Officials support the proposal to increase the IWTC by $25 a week. This will ensure that the real value of the support increases with wage growth and acts as an effective incentive to take up, and stay in, employment. Minimum Family Tax Credit consequential amendment The base rate of IWTC effects the calculation of the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC) threshold. Therefore, any time the IWTC is adjusted, a consequential amendment to the MFTC should be considered. The MFTC was designed to create a financial incentive, at the margin, for families to work and be better off not receiving a benefit. As of 1 April 2024, the MFTC threshold is set at $35,204. For people receiving MFTC, their after-tax earnings are topped up to this amount to ensure that they are better off in work, and receiving the MFTC, than they would be receiving a main benefit whilst employed. The MFTC ensures that a sole-parent family who 1 AHC50 measures the number of children in households with incomes much lower than a typical 2018 household, after they pay for housing costs, and is measured by the threshold line set at 50 percent of the median income in 2017/2018 (base financial year), after housing costs are removed. 2 BHC50 is a moving-line income measure, with the poverty threshold taken the year the data is gathered (low income before housing costs – moving-line measure). BHC50 measures the number of children in households with much lower incomes than a typical household, and is measured by the threshold line set at 50 percent of the median household income in the year measured. 3 Note on TAWA modelling: poverty estimates use HES 2020/21 augmented using IDI data, inflated and population adjusted with HYEFU 2023 inflation estimates. Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 works more than 20 hours per week will always be at least $1 better off on a weekly basis than they would be on a benefit. The IWTC and MFTC are both work incentive payments. Together, these payments can be considered to ‘top up’ a person’s after-tax earnings to ensure that an individual is financially better off in work without a main benefit. Any increase in the IWTC is generally combined with a decrease in the MFTC threshold, as less of a ‘top up’ is required. Impending overlap of the MFTC threshold and the WFF abatement threshold As the MFTC threshold increases annually, it is also forecast that on 1 April 2027 it will overlap with the WFF abatement threshold. The WFF abatement threshold is currently fixed at $42,700 and is not periodically increased. There is a conflict of respective policy intents if this overlap were to occur. On the one hand, the MFTC threshold is a guaranteed minimum income for low income working families. On the other hand, the WFF tax credit abatement threshold is set at a level at which a family’s income is considered to be too high for full entitlement. The overlap would also result in WFF customers facing effective marginal tax rates (EMTR) 4 of well over 100%. This issue will also be considered when assessing the options for the MFTC consequential amendment. Options considered for assessment Option 1: Allow MFTC recipients to gain from both the IWTC increase and the personal income t ax reductions The MFTC threshold would increase marginally (by $112) following the increase to the IWTC and personal income tax changes on 31 July 2024. This would ensure that MFTC recipients receive the IWTC increase and benefit from the personal income tax change. This option has a fiscal cost of approximately $0.2 million per annum. This option would support income adequacy and child poverty reduction. It would also increase the incentive for beneficiaries to move off benefit and to take up and stay in employment at the margin. However, this continues the wide hours range (from 20 to 34 hours of work) over which the 100% abatement rate applies for the MFTC. Given the high EMTRs that apply for MFTC recipients over this period, incentives for MFTC recipients to take up more work are decreased under this option. This option would also speed up the impending cross-over of the MFTC threshold and the WFF abatement threshold. If these two thresholds cross over, both the work incentive aspects of these payments and the broader WFF income adequacy objective will be significantly hindered due to the resulting EMTRs for recipients being well over 100%. Option 2: Decrease the MFTC threshold i n line with existing policy, so that MFTC recipients receive less than they would currently The MFTC threshold would decrease by approximately $27 per week or $1,404 per annum. This option will result in a reduction of $2.9 million per year for the IWTC costing. Lowering the MFTC threshold by $27 ensures that MFTC recipients remain $1 better off 4 Effective marginal tax rates show the percent by which a dollar increase in gross income is reduced by taxes and the abatement of social security assistance. Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 Section 1: Diagnosi ng the policy proble m W h a t i s t h e c o n t e x t b e h i n d t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m a n d h o w i s t h e st a t u s q u o e x p e c t e d t o d e v e l o p? Context within which action is proposed Government commitment to reducing the cost of living: Currently there are high cost of living pressures as New Zealand families are feeling the effects of inflation. The cost of living for the average New Zealand household increased 7.4 percent in the 12 months to the September 2023 quarter. 6 Higher prices for interest payments and grocery food were the biggest contributors to the 7.4 percent increase, however price increases to rent, insurance, and property rates also contributed. 7 Government commitments in the Tax Package are intended to increase the after-tax pay of low to middle income earners through the following changes: •Shifting income tax brackets to compensate for inflation; •Introducing the FamilyBoost childcare tax credit; and •Increasing WFF tax credits for working families. 8 The proposed changes to WFF are premised on cost-of-living pressures having significant impacts on families raising children. The IWTC is the key instrument to increasing financial incentives to work within the wider context of the WFF package: WFF was implemented between 2004 and 2007 with the purpose of substantially boosting earlier Family Assistance entitlements. The key objectives of the WFF package were to: •Increase financial incentives to work, and remain in work, by supporting families with dependent children, so that they are rewarded for their work effort; •ensure income adequacy, with a focus on low and middle income families with dependent children to address issues of poverty, especially child poverty; and •achieve a social assistance system that supports people into work, by making sure that people get the assistance they are entitled to, when they should, and with delivery that supports them into, and to remain in, employment. It must also achieve these objectives at a sustainable cost to government. Around 56 percent of all families currently receive WFF, at an annual cost of $2.8 billion for the 2022 income tax year. WFF is made up of the following tax credits: 9 •Family Tax Credit: (264,400 families, $1,966 billion annually): the main payment received by both beneficiary and non-beneficiary families and is not dependent on work status. 6 Taken from the household living-cost price index released by StatsNZ on 26 October 2023. 7 Taken from the household living-cost price index released by StatsNZ on 26 October 2023. 8 “National’s Back Pocket Boost” on 30 August 2023. 9 These numbers are based on the 2021-22 income tax year. Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 •In-work Tax Credit: (170,500 families, $502 million annually): the main in-work payment for families who do not receive a main benefit or student allowance. •Best Start Tax Credit (138,200 families, $296 million annually): this payment provides $73 per week to all families with a child under one year old, and for lower income families with a child under 3. •Minimum Family Tax Credit (3,200 families, $13 million annually): this payment tops up incomes of working families and guarantees a minimum income level for those working at least 20 hours per week in low-paying jobs and who do not receive a main benefit. The IWTC is the primary instrument in the WFF package designed to incentivise employment uptake. It supports working parents, especially sole parents, to take up and stay in employment, by providing a boost to the earned income of low and middle income families to help ensure that they are better off in work than they are on a benefit. The payment depends on how much a family household earns, and the abatement rate is 27%. The IWTC specifically addresses the effect of in-work poverty. Work has costs associated with it – both financial costs such as transport and childcare, and non-financial such as effort and opportunity costs, for example less time spent with children. Any additional income from work may be insufficient to meet the various costs associated with work. That is, a person may judge they are overall better off not working, particularly if they can rely on benefit payments. As well as increasing families’ financial incentives to move off benefit and into employment, the IWTC, alongside the Family Tax Credit , contributes to reducing child poverty by increasing the incomes of low-income working families with dependent children. The real value of the IWTC has eroded over time: Incomes derived from employment have increased by significantly more than benefit incomes due to wage growth exceeding the rate of income support over previous decades. This has reduced the real value of the IWTC given the payment rate has not increased as much when compared to wages. Over time the IWTC has become less important to the decision to work compared to wages. The value of the IWTC in relation to the minimum wage has decreased from 9.8 percent to 7.7 percent since 2018. However, recent changes such as indexing main benefits to wage growth, and regular across the board increase to main benefits, 10 have increased the level of income a family can receive whilst on benefit. The effect of these changes on financial incentives to work are usually offset by corresponding increases to the minimum wage. The relevant consideration for setting the level of IWTC is how much a family’s income would decrease if they left employment and went onto a main benefit or vice versa. The table below compares the incomes a coupled family and a sole-parent family could receive if they each work 40 hours per week at the minimum wage, contrasted against the payments they would receive if they did not work and were on a main benefit. 10 $25 per week increase to main benefits from 1 April 2020; $20 per week increase to main benefits from 31 July 2021; and $15 per week increase to amin benefits from 1 April 2022. Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 All WFF tax credits are subject to an income test, so the amount received is reduced as family income increases over the $42,700 abatement threshold. The FTC is abated first, followed by the IWTC. Both payments abate at a rate of 27 cents for each additional dollar of family scheme income (FSI). FSI represents the pooled financial resources of a family unit. FSI is net income of the principal caregiver and their partner plus or minus any relevant adjustments. There are several adjustments that can be made to the net income in order to determine FSI. Consequential impacts on the MFTC Changes to the IWTC and the personal income tax rates have a consequential impact on the MFTC threshold. Main objective of the MFTC The MFTC was designed to create a financial incentive, at the margin, for families to work and be better off not receiving a benefit. For people receiving MFTC, their weekly after-tax earnings are topped up to this amount to ensure that they are at least $1 better off per week in work than they would be receiving a main benefit whilst employed. Eligibility: A principal caregiver is entitled to MFTC for a dependent child when: •they meet the common eligibility criteria for WFF; •the principal caregiver, or their partner, do not receive an income-tested welfare benefit, a student allowance or a partner’s allowance; •the principal caregiver, or their partner, are considered a “full-time earner”. Full-time is defined as 20 hours or more per week for a sole parent, and 30 hours per week or more for a two-parent family; Generally, only the hours worked to receive PAYE income payments – such as salary and wages – are counted towards the above work hours requirement. Hours worked to derive non-PAYE income payments – such as interest, rents, and dividends – do not satisfy the work hours requirement. Entitlement: As of 1 April 2024, the MFTC threshold is set at $35,204 per annum – the threshold is increased annually to account for increases to main benefits. For people receiving MFTC, their after-tax earnings are topped up to this amount to ensure that they are marginally better off in work than they would be receiving a main benefit whilst employed. The MFTC abates at a rate of 100% for every dollar earned over the MFTC threshold. The impending overlap of the MFTC threshold and the WFF Families abatement threshold The WFF tax credit abatement threshold is currently set at $42,700. This is the point at which the FTC and IWTC entitlements start to reduce at 27%. Unlike the MFTC threshold, which is increased every year in line with benefits, the WFF tax credit abatement threshold is not periodically adjusted. It should be noted that the WFF threshold is a gross threshold, whereas the MFTC threshold applies to a customer’s net income. This is due to the MFTC’s function in topping up a customer’s after tax earnings so that they are always marginally better off in work than they would be receiving a main benefit whilst employed. As the MFTC threshold increases annually, it is forecasted that on 1 April 2027 it will overlap with the WFF abatement threshold. This will mean that WFF customers will face EMTRs of Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 well over 100%. MFTC recipients who are some of the lowest income working families would face decreases in their income as they work additional hours. There is a conflict of respective policy intents if this overlap were to occur. On the one hand, the MFTC threshold is a guaranteed minimum income for low income working families. On the other hand, the WFF tax credit abatement threshold is set at a level at which a family’s income is considered to be too high for full entitlement. W h a t i s t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m o r o p p o r t u n i t y? Problem definition The IWTC has helped increase incomes amongst low and middle income working households, however the real value of the support has diminished overtime. Over previous decades, incomes derived from employment have increased by significantly more than benefit incomes due to wage growth exceeding the rate of income support over an extended period. Over time the IWTC has become less important to the decision to work compared to wages. The value of the IWTC in relation to the minimum wage has decreased from 10.7 percent to 7.7 percent since 2016. As such, the IWTC is not meeting its policy objective as a work incentive payment, nor does the IWTC rate reflect the desires of the Government and national, social, and economic contexts, particularly in relation to the cost of living. This is in part due to the lack of legislative requirement to automatically increase the rate of IWTC over time, unlike the regular Consumers Price Index (CPI) adjustments to the FTC and BSTC. The rate of IWTC was last increased in Budget 2015, from $60 a week to $72.50 a week (from 1 April 2016), as part of the Child Material Hardship package. Stakeholders involved The primary stakeholders are low to middle income working families who are in receipt of the IWTC. They have a significant, personal interest in increases to their income. At the margin the IWTC can have a significant impact for parents to move off-benefit and into employment. In addition, the IWTC also contributes to reducing poverty and improving adequacy for this demographic. Restricted access to material goods or restricted capacity for social Example of overlap: Under this example the Minimum Family Tax Credit threshold is increased to $43,000 (before tax) and the Working for Families tax credits abatement threshold remains at $42,700 (before tax). Mila is a sole parent who works at a supermarket for 35 hours per week on minimum wage and earns $42,900 dollars. Following the crossover, she will face an effective marginal tax rate of 128.6%. This means that for an additional $1 she earns, her tax credits reduce by $1.28 and her total income drops as a result. She is not incentivised to work any additional hours. This is a result of the following reductions of her income via: •17.5% personal income tax; •82.5% Minimum Family Tax Credit; •1.6% ACC levy; and •27% Working for Families abatement (the additional abatement once the overlap happens). This could be made worse if Mila has student loan repayments (12%) or receives the Accommodation Supplement (25%). Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 participation can have significant flow on effects to other areas of life such as physical and mental health. These flow on effects can impact a household’s access to work opportunities, which has negative ramifications for the household’s living standards. Wider society is also a stakeholder in this issue. The consequences of poverty lead to greater public expenditure, particularly on healthcare and the justice system, as well as the loss of potential tax revenue. Increased expenditure on in-work welfare has the capacity to encourage work force participation, and any reduction in poverty rates will lead to savings in other areas. What objectives are sought in relation to the policy problem? Working for Families scheme objectives WFF has three primary objectives: 1.Increase financial incentives to work, and remain in work, by supporting families with dependent children, so that they are rewarded for their work effort; 2.ensure income adequacy, with a focus on low and middle income families with dependent children to address issues of poverty, especially child poverty; and 3.achieve a social assistance system that supports people into work, by making sure that people get the assistance they are entitled to, when they should, and with delivery that supports them into, and to remain in, employment. It must also achieve these objectives at a sustainable cost to government. These objectives must be considered when evaluating any proposed changes to WFF along with any more specific objectives that are being sort in relation to a particular proposal. It is generally possible to achieve two of the three objectives for any given policy change, but not all three. 1.Improving financial incentives to work Improving financial incentives to work will encourage people who are able to work to seek (and remain in) employment. For most people, paid work is a key means of achieving improved wellbeing. However, financial incentives are only one (and not necessarily the most important) of many factors that influence people’s decisions on whether, or how much, to work. 2.Improving income adequacy for low and middle income people While recent changes to the welfare system (including the Families Package, the $25 a week increase to main benefits on 1 April 2020 and the indexation of main benefits to average wage) will help to improve the living standards of low-income people, income adequacy and child poverty issues remain. Any changes to WFF should have a net positive impact on these issues, particularly as these credits are an important tool to meet child poverty reduction targets as required under the Child Poverty Reduction Act 2018. 3.Achieve a social assistance system that supports people into work There is a continued need to modernise and simplify the WFF system to better respond to changing work and care arrangements. Any changes to WFF should seek to improve the client experience and improve the interface between benefit and work. Paying welfare support at a cost that is sustainable to government Regulatory Impact Statement | 13 The government is required to act and pursue its policy objectives in accordance with the principles of responsible fiscal management as set out in the Public Finance Act 1989. These principles include managing fiscal risks facing the government, having regard for the impact on present and future generations, and ensuring the Crown’s resources are managed effectively and efficiently. The WFF scheme should be delivered in accordance with these principles. Specific objectives relating to the $25 per week increase to the IWTC The policy objective of this change can be viewed as twofold: Help i ncrease financial incentives to work by increasing the gap between income on benefit and income when in-work A fundamental purpose of the IWTC, as stated in the supporting policy paper to joint Ministers when it was introduced was “to improve replacement ratios, (i.e., the gap between income on benefit and income when in work”) . 11 The relevant consideration for setting the level of IWTC is therefore generally the existing “gap” between benefit levels and wages for low and middle income families, and how the size of the gap has moved. Decrease the cost-of-living pressures for families raising children Inland Revenue understands that Government commitments are intended to increase the after-tax pay of low to middle income earners. The proposed increase to the IWTC is premised on the cost-of-living pressures having significant impacts on families raising children. 11 “Future Directions: Regular Adjustments of Family Income Assistance” on 19 March 2004. Regulatory Impact Statement | 14 Section 2: Deciding upon an option to address the poli cy problem What criteria wil l be used to compare options to the status quo? The following criteria is derived primarily from the WFF objectives. The income adequacy and financial incentives to work criterion will be given the highest weighting, as they align with specific objectives relating to the $25 per week increase to the IWTC. Income adequacy This will measure the degree to which the incomes of low and middle income households are improved. It will demonstrate the average increases households can expect to their incomes once abatement of financial assistance is considered. Impacts on child poverty These will be measured using fixed line AHC50 12 and moving line BHC50. 13 Options which have greater reduction in the number of children in AHC50 and BHC50 poverty are preferred. Options should not be so tightly targeted that, as a result, more children are pushed under the poverty line. Administrative benefit This will measure the degree to which changes to WFF improve the client experience and im prove the interface between benefit and work. Financial incentives to work The impact of these proposals on financial incentives to work are considered. These are primarily measured using replacement ratios, which consider the gap between income on benefit and income when in work. Fiscal cost This will measure the overall cost to the government of each individual option. Ease of implementation This will measure the difficulty for Inland Revenue to implement each individual option. What scope will options be considere d within? •Options are solely concerned with an increase to the existing rate. Out of scope •Changes to the policy settings of the IWTC, including the rules for eligibility and abatement, are not in scope for any of the proposed options. 12 The percentage of children living in households with less than 50 percent of the median equivalised disposable household income after housing costs are deducted (for the 2017/18 base financial year). 13 The percentage of children living in households with less than 50 percent of the median equivalised disposable household income before housing costs are deducted. Regulatory Impact Statement | 15 •Alternative options have not been explored that could also target low and middle income working families. This includes options that would address income adequacy of beneficiary families who are not in receipt of the IWTC. W h a t o p t i o n s a r e b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d? Option One – No increase of the in-work tax credit The status quo is no legislative or policy change. The IWTC would continue to be paid at a maximum rate of $3,770 per year ($72.50 per week) for a family of up to three children, with an additional $780 each year ($15 per week) for each subsequent child. This option risks the policy objectives of the IWTC being further eroded if the value of the IWTC in relation to minimum wage continues to decrease. As such, this option is out of step with improving income adequacy for low to middle income families, increasing work incentives for low to middle income families, and helping the Government meet its child poverty reduction targets. However, this option does not bear an additional cost to the Government and would not require Inland Revenue to implement any changes. Option Two – Increase of the in-work tax credit by $25 per week from 31 July 2024 The IWTC standard rate would be increased to $5,070 per year ($97.50 per week) from 31 July 2024. The IWTC subsequent child rate would remain at $780 each year ($15 per week) for each subsequent child. None of the existing parameters in relation to eligibility and abatement would be adjusted. The principal caregiver, or their partner, must not receive an income-tested welfare benefit, a student allowance or a partner’s allowance. The IWTC would continue to abate at a rate of 27% for each additional dollar of family scheme income earned over the WFF abatement threshold ($42,700), following the full abatement of the FTC. The implementation date would be 31 July 2024. The updated rate would take effect alongside the proposed changes to personal income taxes and the Independent Earner Tax Credit. Ad hoc notices of entitlements will need to be sent to WFF customers in June 2024 to inform them of the change. Modelling of impacts This change will benefit approximately 170,000 families who currently receive the IWTC. They will benefit by a net average of $16.97 per week when factoring in the average rate at which the IWTC abates amongst all IWTC recipients. There will be increased work incentives This change will lower replacement ratios, which measure the gap between income when receiving a benefit versus income when in work. The increase to the IWTC means there is more income available for low and middle income families who are in paid work. This will increase the “gap” between benefit levels and wages for these families. After the increase to the IWTC, and all other things being equal, these replacement ratios would decrease to 78.8 percent for a coupled family, and 64.5 percent for a sole parent family. There will be implementation implications for Inland Revenue and customers To progress this change through Budget 2024, and include it in Budget night legislation, ad hoc notices of entitlement are required to be sent to WFF customers. Usually, notices of entitlement are sent out in February, during the standard WFF rollover process. This could Regulatory Impact Statement | 16 cause confusion for these impacted customers, who already have a high customer contact rate with Inland Revenue due t o their reliance on WFF support. This customer contact will coincide with busy time for Inland Revenue in which it is issuing individual income tax assessments. Inland Revenue will need to undertake significant preparatory work before Budget 2024 announcements. This includes issuing communications and guidance material, as well as updating Inland Revenue’s website. There will be reductions to child poverty The impact on child poverty of option 2 (increase the IWTC by $25 per week from 31 July 2024) has not been modelled independently to of the other Tax Package changes, due to time constraints. It is estimated that the Tax Package, which includes a $25 increase to the In-Work Tax Credit, will reduce child poverty by around 14,000 children (+/- 6000) on the fixed-line AHC50 measure, 14 and by around 3,000 children (+/- 7000) on the BHC50 measure 15 in the 2027 tax year. 16 The tax package increases the incomes of low-income working households faster than the increase in the cost of living, which reduces fixed-line AHC50 child poverty. However, the tax package may slightly reduce moving-line BHC50 child poverty, since the poverty line for this measure is set at 50% of the median household income, and the tax package is expected to increase the median household income. The overall cost of this option is estimated to be $607 million over the forecast period 2024/25 to 2027/28 The i ncrease to the IWTC will cost $607 million over the forecast period which extends to 30 June 2028. Consequential impact on the Minimum Family Tax Cre dit Any increases to the IWTC will have a consequential impact on the MFTC threshold. Options for addressing this impact will be assessed using the following criteria. Income adequacy This will measure the degree to which the incomes of low and middle income households are improved. Financial incentives to work The impact of these options on financial incentives to work are considered. This includes any effect the change will have on the range of working hours over which the MFTC abates, as 14 AHC50 measures the number of children in households with incomes much lower than a typical 2018 household, after they pay for housing costs, and is measured by the threshold line set at 50 percent of the median income in 2017/2018 (base financial year), after housing costs are removed. 15 BHC50 is a moving-line income measure, with the poverty threshold taken the year the data is gathered (low income before housing costs – moving-line measure). BHC50 measures the number of children in households with much lower incomes than a typical household, and is measured by the threshold line set at 50 percent of the median household income in the year measured. 16 Note on TAWA modelling: poverty estimates use HES 2020/21 augmented using IDI data, inflated and population adjusted with HYEFU 2023 inflation estimates. Regulatory Impact Statement | 17 this has a corresponding impact on work incentives – particularly given the 100% abatement rate. Fiscal cost This will measure the overall cost to the government of each individual option. The impending overlap of the MFTC threshold and the WFF abatement threshold This will consider whether the options exacerbate or quicken the eventual crossover between the MFTC threshold and the WFF abatement threshold. Option One: allow MFTC recipients to gain from the IWTC increase and personal income tax cuts Under option one, the IWTC would flow through to MFTC recipients and the MFTC threshold would increase marginally (by $112) per annum on 31 July 2024 to allow MFTC recipients to benefit from the personal income tax changes. This i s a significant departure from the way the MFTC is calculated, as the guaranteed income provided for by the MFTC would be set approximately $27 above the after-tax earnings from employment whilst still on benefit (which accounts for the IWTC increase and the estimated relief from the personal tax rate changes). This option would ensure that MFTC recipients receive the IWTC increase and benefit from the personal income tax changes, which will support income adequacy and child poverty reduction. Allowing the IWTC changes to flow through would further increase the incentive for beneficiaries t o move off benefit and to take up and stay in employment at the margin, particularly at 20 hours per week. However, this option continues the wide hours range (from 20 to 35 hours of work) over which the 100% abatement rate applies for the MFTC currently. 17 A s MFTC recipients are subject to significant EMTRs, particularly between 20 and 35 hours of work, this option decreases incentives to work more hours. Increasing the MFTC threshold would also speed up the impending cross-over of the MFTC threshold and the WFF abatement threshold. If these two thresholds cross over, the work incentive aspect of these payments and the broader WFF income adequacy objective will be significantly hindered due to the resulting EMTRs for recipients being well over 100%. There will also be ongoing issue in deciding what to do about the artificially inflated threshold every year; starting 1 April 2025. This option has a fiscal cost of approximately $0.2 million per annum. This i s a result of letting MFTC recipients benefit from the personal income tax changes. This option is preferred by the Ministry of Social Development and the Child Wellbeing and Poverty Reduction Group in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Option Two: Decrease the MFTC threshold in line with existing policy, so that MFTC recipients receive less than they would currently Under option two, the MFTC threshold would decrease by approximately $27 dollars per week or $1,404 per annum. Lowering the MFTC threshold by $27 per week adheres to the current MFTC threshold calculation, as this amount ensures that MFTC recipients remain $1 17 Assuming no change to the minimum wage rate. Regulatory Impact Statement | 18 better off per week compared with those working and receiving a benefit following the IWTC increase and the changes to the personal income tax rates. 18 This option reduces the MFTC threshold to account for both the IWTC increase artificially inflating the MFTC guaranteed amount and the personal income tax rate changes. MFTC recipients will therefore be made worse off by this change as their net incomes will decrease. For example, if a family i s working less than 33 hours per week, they are likely to experience a reduction in net income of up to $104 per annum under this option. This option therefore does not improve income adequacy or support child poverty reduction. As MFTC recipients will not financially benefit from the IWTC increase following these changes, the increased incentive to take up and stay in work associated with the IWTC increase will not flow through. However, at minimum wage, the earnings range over which the 100% abatement rate applies would be reduced by one and half hours , increasing the incentive for MFTC recipients to work longer hours. This option will also mitigate the urgency of addressing the MFTC/WFF abatement threshold cross over, as reducing the MFTC threshold will delay the eventual cross over. This option will result in a reduction of $2.9 million per year for the IWTC costing. Option three – Decrease the MFTC threshold so that MFTC recipients will receive the same amount that they do currently Under option three, the MFTC threshold would decrease by $23 dollars per week or $1,196 per annum when the increase to the IWTC is introduced. This change reduces the MFTC threshold in such a way that a family does not benefit from the IWTC change but are not worse off as compared to status quo. The MFTC threshold would then be readjusted with the next benefit increase as per the usual process on 1 April 2025. This option is a departure from the existing calculation to the MFTC threshold that has been operating, as it would ensure that the threshold is set at a rate greater than $1 above the after-tax earnings from employment whilst still on benefit. However, option three provides for minimal departure from the MFTC calculation so as to not cause inconsistency with the policy intent of the MFTC. As MFTC recipients will not benefit from the IWTC increase but will not be made worse off, thi s option has a neutral impact on income adequacy and child poverty reduction. The MFTC’s function to incentivise people to move off-benefit and into full time employment will also be preserved. As this option reduces the MFTC threshold, it will delay the MFTC/WFF abatement threshold cross over and mitigate the urgency of addressing this issue. This option will result in a reduction of $2.5 million per year for the IWTC costing. Officials prefer the proposed changes under option 3 to lower the MFTC threshold by $23 per week or $1,196 per annum. This option delays the eventual MFTC/WFF abatement threshold cross-over without making MFTC recipients worse off. The MFTC’s function to incentivise people to move off-benefit and into full time employment will also be preserved. 18 This decrease does not directly correlate to the IWTC increase due to the way main benefits abate. Regulatory Impact Statement | 22 Children in poverty (when considered as a component of a wider Tax Package) Although the rate increase occurs, we cannot predict the duration of its impact. Lifting the income of a child’s family above a threshold does not guarantee that they will no longer suffer the effects of poverty or that their income will remain above the threshold permanently. 14,000 children lifted out of AH50 poverty or 3,000 children out of BHC50 poverty Low. The impact on child poverty reduction of the increase to the IWTC by $25 per week from 31 July 2024 has not been modelled independently of the other Tax Package changes. In addition, there are significant uncertainties with TAWA modelling for poverty impacts. Increased incentive to take-up and stay in employment This change will lower replacement ratios, which measure the gap between income when receiving a benefit versus income when in work. 170,000 households will have increased incentive to take-up and stay in employment. Low. Replacement ratios observe a direct transition between full-time work and benefit for families in a specific scenario. In reality, families’ employment decisions are more fluid than being directly in or out of work, and there ae a range of factors that contribute to these decisions beyond the marginal dollar return. Total monetised benefits 170,000 households will benefit from an ongoing, weekly increase in income. This assumes full take up. Average weekly increase of $16.97. High Non-monetised benefits 170,000 households will have increased incentive to take-up and stay in employment. Child poverty reduction (when considered as a component of a wider Tax Package) Medium 14,000 children lifted out of AH50 poverty or 3,000 children out of BHC50 poverty Medium Low Regulatory Impact Statement | 23 Section 3: Deli vering an option How will the new arra ngements be implemented ? To progress this change through Budget 2024, and include it in Budget night legislation, ad hoc notices of entitlement are required to be sent to WFF customers. Usually, notices of entitlement are sent out in February, during Inland Revenue’s standard WFF rollover process. This could cause confusion for these impacted customers, who already have a high customer contact rate with Inland Revenue due to their reliance on WFF support. This customer contact will coincide with Inland Revenue’s busi est time of the calendar year in which it is issuing individual income tax assessments. Inland Revenue will need to undertake significant preparatory work before Budget 2024 announcements. This includes issuing communications and guidance material, as well as updating Inland Revenue’s website. As this is an extension of an existing tax credit, it is not expected to create significant implementation costs. How will the new arra ngements be monitored, evaluated, and reviewed? This proposed change adjusts the rate of the IWTC, therefore no new or additional monitoring is required. The effects of the proposed changes can be monitored using data Inland Revenue currently collects as part of administering WFF. This data includes the number of WFF recipients, the makeup of those families, the amount and type of payments made, and end of year assessment data on under and overpayments. This administrative data provides descriptive information about WFF recipients, and the actual fiscal cost to the Government of the chosen settings.
Item 01 Income Tax Credit ("the tax offset"), which would be paid out at time of taxation to compensate for a higher bottom tax rate. The National plan would be effective from 1 July 2024 and also includes lifting the abatement threshold of the Independent Earner Tax Credit (IETC) from $48,000 to $70,000. Officials also considered two variations on the ACT plan that make less significant changes to the thresholds and rates, as well as an alternative to the ACT plan that can be achieved at a lower fiscal cost while still achieving the objective of simplifying the personal income tax system by reducing the number of tax rates and thresholds. Three cost-saving variations on the National plan were also considered. Officials judge that the National plan effectively addresses the policy problem of fiscal drag while having minimal negative consequences on other policy objectives. The plan does involve a significant fiscal cost. The ACT plan delivers larger efficiency gains but at a much larger fiscal cost, while also producing significant administrative effort by introducing a new tax offset. Officials therefore support the broad approach of the National plan, with the following further recommendations: i. consider cost-saving alternatives to the plan to support a return to surplus, ii. delay implementation to 1 October 2024 to reduce the fiscal cost, minimise administrative demands for Inland Revenue and ensure all taxpayers receive the benefit of the tax changes on time, iii. do not proceed with the proposed IETC expansion. The longstanding view of officials has been that the objective of improving work incentives could be achieved more effectively by removing the IETC and making other changes to tax and transfer settings for the same fiscal cost. See T2017/164: Removing the Independent Earner Tax Credit 1 for further discussion of the IETC, and iv. prevent the tax changes flowing through to student allowances. Alignment with the benefit system is a principle of the student support system, and since main benefits will not increase from the tax changes, the same approach should be taken for student allowance. The Cabinet Paper recommends progressing the National plan, with an implementation date of 31 July 2024. This involves a large reduction in Crown revenue over the forecast period, estimated at $10.3 billion. This cost could be reduced by around $1 - 2 billion through the cost-saving variations suggested by officials. The reduction in Crown revenue corresponds to an equivalent increase in the disposable income of taxpayers, owing to the reduction in tax levied on personal income. This may result in small efficiency benefits to the wider economy. The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as it not expected to result in any significant, direct emissions impacts. 1 https://www.treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2017-11/b17-3659148.pdf Regulatory Impact Statement I 2 Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 presentation of a range of quantitative analysis of the key fiscal and distributional elements of the package. The key reason the assurance panel considers this RIS does not fully meet the RIS criteria is the absence of public consultation on the specific proposals/options beyond discussions with private sector software providers and payroll service providers. Although the pre-election policies of all the parties forming the current Government included tax cuts, the specific proposals that are the subject of this RIS have not been formally consulted on. However, the Panel does acknowledge the limitations associated with the Budget-sensitive nature of these proposals. Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 Section 1: Diagnosi ng the policy proble m W h a t i s t h e c o n t e x t b e h i n d t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m a n d h o w i s t h e st a t u s q u o e x p e c t e d t o d e v e l o p? 1.New Zealand’s progressive personal income tax (PIT) system means individuals pay higher marginal tax rates as their incomes rise above certain income thresholds. When prices and incomes rise from generalised inflation and wage growth, but nominal income tax thresholds remain unchanged, individuals end up paying a larger proportion of their income in tax. 2.The structure of the PIT system was most recently changed in 2021, with the introduction of a 39% rate for income over $180,000. All other rates and thresholds have been in place since 1 October 2010. Personal incomes have risen since that time, leading to higher average tax rates on personal income. The current rates and thresholds are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Current personal income tax rates For each dollar of income Tax rate Up to $14,000 10.5% Over $14,000 and up to $48,000 17.5% Over $48,000 and up to $70,000 30% Over $70,000 and up to $180,000 33% Over $180,000 39% 3.This phenomenon of rising incomes and fixed tax thresholds, known as “fiscal drag”, increases the amount of PIT revenue collected and has been a significant means by which governments have addressed growing fiscal pressures since 2010. 4.Since 1 October 2010 (the last time personal income tax thresholds were adjusted) the most significant impact from fiscal drag has been on individuals whose incomes had just crossed the $48,000 threshold at the time (assuming their incomes have continued to grow in line with average wage growth). This is because of the steep increase in their marginal tax rate from 17.5% to 30%. 5.The median full-time wage and salary worker earned $48,024 in the year ended June 2011 and paid $7,427 in personal income tax. In the year ended June 2023, the median full-time wage and salary worker earned $73,417 and paid $15,148 in personal income tax. Owing to the effect of fiscal drag, their average tax rate (the total tax paid per dollar of income) increased by 5.1 percentage points from 15.5% to 20.6% between 2011 - 2023. Their marginal tax rate also increased from 30% to 33%. 6.To completely offset the impact of fiscal drag for the median earner, personal income tax thresholds would have to be lifted by the same proportion that the median wage has increased, i.e., by 53%. This would substantially reduce the revenue collected by the personal income tax system and would likely not be a fiscally sustainable option. 7.If adjustments to PIT thresholds are not made, fiscal drag is projected to continue in the future as incomes continue to grow. In the 2024 Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update, average wages were forecast to increase by 16.6% between 2024 and 2028. 8.As more earners move into the higher tax brackets, there is a broad flattening in the taxation of incomes and the progressivity of the PIT system decreases. With the increase in the minimum wage to $23.15 per hour from 1 April 2024, a minimum-wage earner working 40 hours per week will earn $48,284 per year. This means that under Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 current settings, all full-time earners will have a marginal tax rate (the rate they pay on an additional dollar of income) of 30% or more and the most progressive stages of the personal tax system will be below the level of the full-time minimum wage. 9.Similar impacts can be seen for tax credits that have fixed income thresholds where credits start to abate. The Independent Earner Tax Credit (IETC) was introduced in 2009 to provide a targeted tax reduction of up to $520 per year to earners between $24,000 and $48,000 who do not receive other transfer payments. The IETC abates at a rate of 13 cents for every dollar earned over $44,000 and fully abates at $48,000. These abatement thresholds have not been adjusted in the 15 years since the IETC was introduced, meaning the target population has changed significantly. 10.For example, a full-time worker on the minimum wage in 2009 earned around $26,000 and would have received the full IETC payment assuming they met other eligibility requirements. In 2024, an individual working 40 hours per week on the minimum wage would earn just over the income limit of $48,000 and would not receive the IETC. W h a t i s t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m o r o p p o r t u n i t y? 11.As described above, fiscal drag has the potential to erode the progressivity of the personal income tax system and has other impacts that may not align with Government objectives: •The increase in annual tax liability from fiscal drag is uneven across income levels, with the greatest impact occurring as the $48,000 income threshold is crossed. Full-time minimum wage earners will therefore be heavily affected in coming years. •The average rate of tax on total personal income increases over time, reducing economic efficiency as people’s decisions are more heavily impacted by tax. •The increase in tax from fiscal drag is arguably less transparent than explicit changes to tax settings and may engender less public debate. •When inflation exceeds wage growth, people’s tax burden increases even as their ability to pay for goods and services decreases. 12.The desired level of progressivity in the PIT system is a judgement for ministers to make. Any decision to address fiscal drag by adjusting PIT thresholds will also depend on the revenue needs of the Government and their economic goals. W h a t o b j e c t i v e s a r e s o u g h t i n r e l a t i o n t o t he p o l i c y p r o b l e m ? 13.In the National-ACT coalition agreement, a commitment was made to: “Ensure the concepts of ACT’s income tax policy are considered as a pathway to delivering National’s promised tax relief, subject to no earner being worse off than they would be under National’s plan.” 14.Both the National Party and the ACT Party announced plans for PIT relief during the 2023 general election, with the stated objectives as summarised in Table 2. 15.The New Zealand First Party also campaigned on tax relief in response to fiscal drag, and a commitment was made in the National-New Zealand First coalition agreement to, “by or before 2026, assess the impact inflation has had on the average tax rates faced by income earners.” Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 29.Fiscal impact: All options significantly reduce tax revenue over the forecast period (OFP). This policy analysis was prepared in the context of the Government’s intention to fund this package from within Budget 2024 allowances, which was advised by the Treasury in its Briefing to the Incoming Minister of Finance in 2023 and is consistent with the objective of fiscal sustainability. Therefore, these packages would be considered fiscally sustainable when looked at in the wider context of the Budget decisions they are being taken in – as long as they are not so costly that it would no longer be possible to fund within allowances. However, the Treasury has advised the Government to reduce the cost of Budget 2024, and where possible to support a return to surplus. Whilst all the plans would therefore be viewed as fiscally sustainable in theory, there was a difference in cost, which may impact the feasibility of funding some of the plans within Budget 2024 allowances, and consistency with the goal of returning to surplus: •Option 3 has the largest impact of at least $15 billion OFP ($6.1 billion in 2027/28). •Option 2 and Option 4 have impacts of around $10-11 billion OFP ($2.8 billion in 2027/28). •Options 5a, 5b and 5c have the smallest impact of around $8-9 billion OFP ($2.2 - $2.3 billion in 2027/28). •The two variations on Option 3 cost around $6 billion (3a) and $12 billion (3b) OFP, and $1.8 billion (3a) and $5.0 billion (3b) in 2027/28. 30.Efficiency: Personal income tax has a negative impact on economic efficiency to the extent that it affects people’s income earning decisions (in other words, distorting behaviour). All options would be expected to have positive impacts on efficiency by reducing the amount of tax levied on personal income, thereby decreasing distortions to work, investment and savings decisions. The removal of the 39% rate in Option 3 would have a relatively larger impact per dollar of fiscal cost, but the limited population affected would mitigate the aggregate benefits. For those already in work, the decision to work more or fewer hours can be influenced by effective marginal tax rates (EMTR – the fraction of each additional dollar earned that is lost to tax and reduced transfers). Changes that significantly reduce effective marginal tax rates would be expected to enhance incentives to work additional hours and may also encourage workers to increase their wage prospects by upskilling. This could have positive implications for overall labour supply and the productive capacity of the economy. Other factors will also contribute to a person’s decision to work, however, so it is uncertain whether they will respond to increased incentives, and we have not formally modelled the impact of the options on overall labour supply. Annex 1 contains analysis of the impact of the options on EMTRs. The expansion of the IETC will have opposing impacts on financial returns from work. While it will increase overall returns for earners between $44,000 - $70,000, it will also have a negative impact on marginal returns for earners between $66,000 - $70,000, which may reduce their incentive to work additional hours. It is therefore likely that this objective could be achieved more effectively by removing the IETC and making other changes to tax and transfer settings for the same fiscal cost. 31.Distributional impacts: Each option has different distributional impacts, with Options 3 and 4 being more targeted to reducing tax for higher-income earners, and Options 2 and 5 being more targeted to middle-income earners and those impacted by fiscal drag. As the desirability of a particular income distribution is a judgement for ministers, officials do not comment on whether an option is preferable regarding distributional impacts. Annex 2 contains analysis of the distributional impacts of the options. Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 Option 2 is most directly targeted towards addressing fiscal drag, as it makes proportional increases to all of the PIT thresholds that were in place in 2010, thus achieving the exact opposite effect as fiscal drag. The PIT threshold adjustments in Option 2 would reduce the annual tax liability of someone earning the 2023 median full- time wage ($73,417) by $902, reducing their average tax rate by 1.2 percentage points to 19.4%. This compensates for around one quarter of the average tax rate increase from fiscal drag since 2011. The expansion of the IETC would not benefit these earners as they will earn above the new threshold. Fully compensating for the accumulated fiscal drag since 2011 would therefore require an adjustment to PIT thresholds around four times larger than the adjustments in Option 2, which would likely increase the cost by a similar proportion. This would not be a fiscally sustainable option without substantial changes to government spending and/or revenue in other areas. Adjustments to personal income tax thresholds will have flow-on impacts to other components of the tax and transfer system: a.New Zealand Superannuation rates will increase due to both the direct impact of the PIT threshold adjustments and the indirect impact of being tied to the net average wage. b.Student allowances will increase as the rates are set gross in legislation. c.Main benefits will be unaffected by the tax changes as the rates are set net of tax in legislation. 32.Integrity: The revenue-raising capability of the personal income tax system depends on taxpayer compliance, which may be influenced by people’s perceptions of the fairness of the tax system. To the extent adjustments to tax thresholds in response to fiscal drag improve perceptions of fairness, we would expect some small positive impacts on compliance from Options 2 and 5. Option 3 would also be expected to improve integrity by reducing the gap between the company tax rate and the top personal tax rate, thereby reducing incentives for tax avoidance. 33.Macroeconomic impacts: Treasury modelling shows that tax relief funded through an increase in government debt is expected to put some upward pressure on inflation and therefore interest rates. However, if tax relief is funded through an equivalent decrease in government spending, then the overall effect is a slight decrease in modelled interest rates. This is because the “fiscal multiplier” for tax relief is assumed to be lower than for government spending, meaning the decrease in government spending more than offsets the increase in spending by recipients of tax relief. To the extent that tax relief is funded within Budget 2024 operating allowances, a slight decrease in inflation pressures and therefore slightly lower interest rates would be expected. 34.Administrative and compliance costs: Options 2 and 5 are relatively simple changes to the PIT system and would have minimal impacts on administrative and compliance costs. However, implementation in the middle of the tax year would place one-off costs on Inland Revenue, employers and third-party payroll providers. Option 4 would be more complex owing to the changes in marginal tax rates. Option 3 would be the most complex change owing to the introduction of the tax offset (a tax credit paid out at the time of taxation); effectively compensating for the higher bottom marginal tax rate. Introducing the offset would create substantial costs for private and public sector payroll providers and Inland Revenue. For taxpayers, the offset would likely lead to more end-of-year tax bills and place additional burden on those who have more than one source of income and the income from the secondary source occurs in the abatement zone for the tax offset. Those with a second job would Regulatory Impact Statement | 13 have to apply for tailored tax codes each year as the abatement zone is not reflected in the secondary tax codes. 35.Other government commitments: The ACT-National Coalition Agreement made a commitment to no earner being worse off than they would be under National’s plan (Option 2). Option 3 – the ACT manifesto plan – did not meet this test, even with the use of a tax offset to compensate for the higher bottom tax rate. Variations on this plan –Options 3a and 3b – were developed in order to meet this test, but the use of the tax offset in these plans was considered to be a complex change that contradicted the aim of simplifying the tax system. Options 4, 5a, 5b and 5c also did not meet this test, although to a lesser degree than Option 3. In general, it would not be possible to deliver greater tax relief at some parts of the income spectrum compared to Option 2, while also ensuring no earner is worse off, without increasing the fiscal cost compared to Option 2. 36.Overall assessment: Options 2 and 5 are considered to be positive changes overall. They go some way to addressing the impacts of fiscal drag and have minimal negative consequences apart from the large fiscal cost. Insofar as ministers are willing to trade off the fiscal cost to meet their other objectives and can manage the cost within Budget allowances, officials support these options. Option 4 may also be supported if ministers were more focused on the goal of flattening the PIT system by reducing the number of thresholds and rates, noting that some low-income households would be made significantly worse off. However, officials do not support Option 3 as it would create significant additional compliance costs and it is unlikely that the fiscal cost could be managed within Budget allowances without making large sacrifices to other Government priorities. W h a t o p t i on i s l i k e l y t o b e s t a d d r e s s t h e p r o b l e m , m e e t t h e p o l i c y o b j e c t i v e s , a n d d e l i v e r t h e h i g h e s t n e t b e n e f i t s? 37.Option 2 effectively addresses the policy problem of fiscal drag while having minimal negative consequences on other policy objectives, except for the large fiscal cost. The cost could be reduced through the alternatives in Option 5. Option 3 delivers larger efficiency gains but at a much larger fiscal cost, while also producing significant administrative effort and causing some earners to be worse off than under Option 2. Officials therefore support the broad approach in Option 2 (the National manifesto plan), with the following further recommendations: a.consider cost-saving alternatives (Option 5) to support a return to surplus, b.delay implementation to 1 October 2024 to reduce the fiscal cost, minimise administrative demands for Inland Revenue and ensure all taxpayers receive the benefit of the tax changes on time, c.do not proceed with the proposed IETC expansion. The longstanding view of officials has been that the objective of improving work incentives could be achieved more effectively by removing the IETC and making other changes to tax and transfer settings for the same fiscal cost. See T2017/164: Removing the Independent Earner Tax Credit 2 for further discussion of the IETC, and d.prevent the tax changes flowing through to student allowances. Alignment with the benefit system is a principle of the student support system, and since main benefits will not increase from the tax changes, the same approach should be taken for student allowance. 2 https://www.treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2017-11/b17-3659148.pdf Regulatory Impact Statement | 16 43.The changes to RWT will also be made on 31 July 2024. The changes are increasing the income thresholds for the various personal tax rates, but they are not changing the rates themselves. While payers of resident withholding income will need to update their information on RWT and some recipients may need to adjust their selected RWT rates, there should be no changes to the actual withholding system that RWT payers use. In addition, if people are using the incorrect RWT rate, any under or overpayment can be corrected as part of the end of year tax assessment process that Inland Revenue runs. 44.The other consequential tax types including), PIE tax, FBT, ESCT and RSCT will be adjusted from the beginning of the next tax year (1 April 2025). This will allow more time to make the changes and reduce the complexity of the changes. This will in turn reduce compliance costs for employers. The trade-off for this is that investors and employees will receive the benefit of the changes from a later date, and this will be a permanent difference. Third parties 45.Third parties such as payroll software providers and payroll service providers will need to make changes to their systems and their software to implement the personal income tax changes. Officials consulted with private sector software providers and payroll service providers to understand the timeframes needed to make changes. The time required is dependent on the level of complexity of the changes. 46.Ideally, payroll software providers would be given 3 months’ notice of upcoming changes. This is based on a timeframe of 6 weeks to complete and test the changes before providing the software to their clients 6 weeks before the implementation date. This is because clients need to load information for pay runs into their system before they make the payments. Some pay information can be input as much as a month before the pay run and as such the new software would need to be in place for this information to be processed correctly. 47.Shortening this timeframe to 2 months would likely mean clients would receive the software 2 weeks before implementation, instead of 6 weeks. This would likely mean some employees would have their tax calculated under status quo thresholds for a payment after the implementation date. However, this could be corrected in subsequent pay periods, or the difference picked up in the end of year tax assessment process. 48.Similarly, payroll service providers would ideally be given 3 months’ notice of upcoming changes to the Pay as You Earn (PAYE) rules. Shortening this timeframe to 2 will increase the likelihood of errors. However, these could be corrected in subsequent pay periods, or the difference picked up in the end of year tax assessment process. 49.Some public sector organisations with specific payment challenges will need longer to implement the changes due to the special characteristics of the payments they make (i.e., this is not relevant to their standard departmental payroll functions). These include the payments made by the Ministry of Social Development (benefits, allowances and pension systems); Accident Compensation Corporation (compensation system) and the Ministry of Health (doctors and nurses payroll systems). 50.The identified organisations make payments that are subject to PAYE to a significant number of beneficiaries, superannuitants, compensation claimants and the health workforce. If they are unable to update their payment systems in time, incorrect Regulatory Impact Statement | 17 amounts of tax will be deducted, and the recipients (other than beneficiaries) will be likely to receive less of their payments than they are entitled to. 51.These organisations could be given advance notice, prior to Budget Day, on a Budget Secret basis, or errors could be addressed by Inland Revenue during the end of year tax assessment process. The Ministry of Social Development have provided initial indications that approximately three months lead in time (from the Cabinet decision) will be required for it to progress the necessary IT, legislative and operational changes in time; the Accident Compensation Corporation would need 8-13 weeks; and Health New Zealand would need approximately 4 months. Implementation date 52.In 2010 (the last time thresholds were increased), 1 October was the date chosen in order to allow sufficient time for implementation as detailed. Officials have recommended the same date is chosen for these changes. A shorter delivery window is possible, but brings a higher likelihood of increased errors, which in turn will create an increased workload for Inland Revenue during the end of year tax assessment process. 53.The Cabinet Paper recommends progressing the PIT changes from 31 July 2024. With the changes being announced on Budget Day (30 May), this will allow approximately two months for third parties such as payroll software providers and payroll service providers to implement the changes. As noted above, these third parties would ideally be given 3 months’ notice of upcoming changes. 54.Despite this shortened timeframe, we would generally expect most employers to be able to pay their employees under the updated tax scales from 31 July. There are likely to be some exceptions and some incorrect calculations, but these are able to be corrected in subsequent pay runs or as part of the end of year tax assessment process completed by Inland Revenue. Legislative change 55.The tax changes will be included in Budget night legislation. H o w w i l l t h e n e w a r r a n g e m e n t s b e mo n i t o red, ev a l u a ted, a n d re v i e wed? 56.Inland Revenue will continue to monitor the tax system in a range of ways to maintain the integrity of the tax system. Inland Revenue also regularly reports to the Government on the amount of tax being collected. It is not anticipated that any additional monitoring, evaluation or review above that which already occurs will be required as a result of the proposed changes. Regulatory Impact Statement | 18 Annex 1: I mpac t of Opti on 2 on effective margi nal tax rates Treasury modelling can estimate the distribution of EMTRs for the New Zealand population. Table 6 shows the number and characteristics of people who we estimate will experience a change in EMTRs from Option 2 in the year ending 31 March 2027. This analysis was only completed for Option 2 as this was the main option being considered at this stage in the advice process. It is important to note that not all people with income within the income tax ranges in Table 6 would experience the impacts shown – it will be dependent on their receipt of any benefits or tax credits, as well as the design of the final tax package. The personal income tax threshold changes and extending the income range of the Independent Earner Tax Credit reduce EMTRs for 335,000 people (positive impact on work incentives) and increase EMTRs for 85,000 people (negative impact on work incentives). Adding the proposed family-based tax credit changes (the In-Work Tax Credit and FamilyBoost) increases the EMTRs for a further 45,000 people (negative impact on work incentives). These people are in coupled families with children, and are spread across the first 4 income tax bands ($0 to $180,000). Modelling did not indicate an increase in EMTRs for sole parents. These tax credits increase people’s EMTRs because of the way the credits abate as incomes grow. Although people’s income is increased by the credits, their EMTR also increases as they cross the abatement threshold and their payment reduces with each extra dollar of income. This negatively impacts their incentive to work. The proposed changes impact abatement in different ways: a.The increase to the In-Work Tax Credit by $25 per week means the payment will take longer to abate to zero, as the abatement rate is constant. This means some people whose payment would otherwise have fully abated will now receive an abating payment. b.As FamilyBoost is a new credit, people who receive it and whose family income is within the abatement range ($140,000 to $180,000) will have an increased EMTR because of the abatement of the credit. Regulatory Impact Statement | 20 Annex 2: Distri butional analys is of options Option 2 Officials provided distributional analysis of the PIT threshold and IETC changes in Option 2 in combination with other tax and transfer policies included in Budget 2024. These included the $25 per week increase to the In-Work Tax Credit (IWTC) and the introduction of the FamilyBoost policy, which gives parents a rebate of up to $75 per week for money spent on early childhood education fees. These four policies together are referred to as “the package”. Distributional analysis provided in advice was based on economic forecasts from the 2023 Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update, and household data from the 2021 Household Economic Survey (HES). The Cabinet Paper includes distributional analysis based on the latest available economic forecasts and household data (i.e., 2024 Budget Economic and Fiscal Update forecasts and 2023 HES data). The distributional analysis in this Regulatory Impact Statement therefore differs slightly from what is in the Cabinet Paper. Overall, the package increases the income of 93% of households 3 by $30 per week 4 on average. Households with children gain by $39 per week on average. A small number of households (0.5% of all households) have their income reduced from the package by $1 per week on average, due to an unintended interaction with the tax threshold adjustments and the calculation of part-year benefit payments. 135,000 households (7%) are unaffected. Many of these will be receiving main benefits and have no change because benefit rates are set in after-tax terms. Household impacts are in comparison to household incomes at the same point in time (the year ending 31 March 2027) if the policy change was not made. Gains and losses do not indicate whether a household is better or worse off compared to the previous year, but only how their projected income in 2027 with the policy change compares to their projected income in 2027 without the policy change. Figure 1 shows the weekly impact of the package on household incomes, grouped by equivalised income quintiles. 5 The number of households in each quintile who have their income increased or reduced is also shown (e.g., 394,000 households in the third quintile have their income increased by $32 per week on average). Only households in the first quintile have their income reduced, by $1 per week on average. These are households who receive main benefit income for only part of the year, and receive a slight reduction in benefit income due to an unintended interaction with the tax threshold adjustments and the calculation of part-year benefit payments. It is unlikely this could be avoided by designing the package differently. The first quintile contains the smallest number of gaining households (290,000). Most of the households unaffected by the package are in the first quintile (100,000 out of 135,000). Households in the first quintile also gain by the least on average ($13 per week). This reflects the fact that people receiving main benefits, who have relatively low incomes, do not gain from the package as benefit rates are set in after-tax terms. The largest weekly gain goes to 3 Households are defined as one or more people living together in a private dwelling and sharing facilities. A household could contain more than one family, which is defined as a single person or couple and any dependent children. 4 This is a measure of change in household disposable income. Note that while we have used equivalised household income to compare groups, the average gains and losses are not adjusted for household size or composition. 5 Income equivalisation accounts for different household compositions (e.g., the number of adults and children) to allow for like-for-like comparisons across households. Two households with different compositions (e.g., a single person compared to a couple with two children) need different levels of income to meet the same standard of living. Equivalisation attempts to account for the additional income needed to support more people and also economies of scale due to shared housing costs, utilities, etc. Regulatory Impact Statement | 21 the fifth quintile, reflecting the fact that the maximum gain from the PIT threshold adjustments occurs at a relatively high individual income level ($78,100). Figure 1: Impact on household incomes by equivalised income quintile Officials also provided analysis of how each individual component of the package impacts household incomes. The individual package components impact households as follows: i.The PIT threshold changes increase net incomes for 1.831 million households (93% of all households) by an average of $25 per week. These changes will also reduce net incomes for a further 9,000 households (0.5% of all households) by an average of $1 per week due to an unintended interaction with the personal income tax threshold adjustments and the way part-year benefit payments are calculated. ii.The IWTC increase increases net incomes for 160,000 households (8% of all households; 25% of households with children), including around 4,000 households that do not gain from the PIT threshold changes, by an average of $20 per week. iii.The IETC expansion increases net incomes for 381,000 households (19% of all households) by an average of $10 per week. iv.FamilyBoost increases net incomes for 80,000 households (4% of all households and 12% of households with children) by an average of $34 per week. The majority of these households are in the bottom half of the equivalised income distribution, and the lowest earning households gain by the most on average. Individual-level analysis shows the impacts of the package by demographic group. Note that this analysis was developed later in the process and is based on the latest available economic forecasts and household data (i.e., 2024 Budget Economic and Fiscal Update forecasts and 2023 HES data). Compared to the overall population, relatively fewer Māori, Pacific Peoples and women benefit from the package. Overall, 83% of individuals gain by an average of $16 per week. This compares to 74% of Māori gaining, 73% for Pacific Peoples, and 81% for women. Average gains for Māori and Pacific Peoples are equal to the overall population, while women gain by slightly less ($15 per week on average) due to lower incomes. By contrast, almost all seniors benefit from the changes (97%) due to the near-universal receipt of NZ Super, but by a smaller amount ($13 per week). Regulatory Impact Statement: A childcare tax credit - "FamilyBoost" Coversheet Purpose of Document Decision sought: Advising agencies: Proposing Ministers: Date finalised: Problem Definition Analysis produced for the purpose of informing Cabinet decisions on the direction of a childcare tax credit to support parents who have children in early childhood education. Inland Revenue Finance and Revenue 12 March 2024 The assumed policy problem is that the cost of early childhood education (ECE) is high relative to families' incomes. It is anticipated that this will result in some families being unable to afford some ECE hours, restricting the parent's ability to work and for the child to participate in ECE, or resulting in pressure on other types of family spending to maintain ECE hours. This may decrease parental labour market participation, ECE participation rates and families' income adequacy. It is anticipated that without government intervention, the problem will continue to worsen as the current high inflation environment and trends in the price measures for the ECE sector may result in ECE costs continuing to increase compared to incomes. Executive Summary The Government has indicated that it would like to alleviate the increasingly high cost of ECE relative to income by implementing a new childcare tax credit linked to childcare expenditure by 1 July 2024. The preferred parameters of the childcare tax credit, named FamilyBoost, was part of the National party's pre-election documents. The new tax credit sits alongside a package of changes outlined in coalition documents that would increase after-tax incomes through increases to tax credits and increases to tax thresholds. The Government has outlined the primary objective of implementing a childcare tax credit is to directly increase the incomes of families who have children in ECE. Administering a childcare tax credit as outlined in pre-election documents requires access to fees information that is linked to individual parents or caregivers, the children in their care, and to their family income for a broad segment of society. Currently no government agency has this fees information. There are two options for progressing the tax credit: • Option 1 -develop a basic refund model that requires the fees information to be supplied from parents or caregivers, with a 1 July 2024 effective date, or, • Option 2 -similar model but extend the implementation date by approximately two to three years to create information flows from ECE providers to the government on Regulatory Impact Statement I 1 Item 02 individual fee payments, making the product automated from the parents' perspectives. The primary trade-off between these two options is the date the product can be implemented by, and the level of effort required by potential recipients and the ECE sector. Option 1 can be implemented quickly to provide prompt support but would place the onus on families to submit invoices on a regular basis to receive the childcare tax credit. Placing the onus on families could reduce the take-up of the tax credit, reducing the support received by eligible families. It also requires the ECE providers to update their invoices to ensure they are in the correct format for Inland Revenue to provide the tax credit. This option could be progressed with the intention of continuous improvements over time to reduce the burden on parents and align it closer to option 2. However, there is a risk that the basic model will be entrenched, with high compliance costs placed on parents and no replacement model ever designed and implemented. Option 2 does not provide short-term benefit to parents as it would take longer to implement but would greatly reduce the compliance costs on parents, resulting in higher take-up than option 1. Administratively, option 2 would be more efficient for Inland Revenue to administer over the long run despite initial higher capital costs, s 9 (2 )(g)(f) However, this option has the risk that ECE providers may be unable to update their systems to create information flows of fees data to Inland Revenue and therefore the model is not feasible for some ECE providers and parents. The best option depends on the Government's objectives and the resulting weighting given to the individual criteria. For example, if providing prompt support is the priority, a quicker implementation time would be preferred. Limitations and Constraints on Analysis Inland Revenue's ability to do a comprehensive policy analysis of this issue is constrained by the lack of publicly available ECE fees data, the pre-existing settings on the policy parameters, and time constraints. The Government has indicated that providing prompt support to families facing cost of living pressures, through targeted assistance with ECE costs, is the priority. Therefore, it has directed Inland Revenue to implement "FamilyBoost", a childcare tax credit to increase the incomes of families who have children in ECE, by 1 July 2024. This has constrained the analysis to policy alternatives to "FamilyBoost" as outlined in the pre-election documents and precludes alternative policy options such as direct subsidies to providers and wider "care of child" financial support payments. Part of the Government's outlined policy parameters was for Inland Revenue to be the administrator of the payment. This further limited the scope of policy options that were considered to those that only Inland Revenue could implement. In addition to policy design constraints, the lack of comprehensive ECE fees data from any government agency has required Inland Revenue to make assumptions about the severity of the policy problem and the factors causing it, as well as the impact of different options. This makes it difficult for any government agency to provide advice on how effective existing or new interventions are on the overall affordability of ECE. The lack of fees data also impacts the practicability of a tax credit linked to childcare expenditure. Regulatory Impact Statement I 2 Inland Revenue has not been able to undertake any consultation with the public due to time constraints and Budget secrecy conventions, despite the potential for significant compliance costs on the ECE sector and parents in implementing a childcare tax credit. This m eans that in preparing advice on options for implementing a childcare tax credit, we have made assumptions about: • the ability of the ECE sector to make changes to implement the tax credit, • the take-up rate by potentially eligible parents, and, • the impact the tax credit would have on family incomes and ECE costs. To assist in mitigating risks and verifying assumptions, we are requesting a Budget secrecy waiver to consult as soon as possible with the ECE sector. If the ECE sector is unable to make the changes necessary to implement the tax credit, officials will provide further advice to the Government on alternatives. The take-up rate of the policy depends on the option selected but will be monitored during the implementation and educational support provided to encourage take-up. Lastly, if either of the policy options considered in this paper are implemented, Inland Revenue will have some access to fees data (supplied either by parents or ECE providers) alongside income data, which can inform the Government of the tax credit's effect on ongoing ECE costs and family income adequacy. This would be a part of the post-implementation review. It may also support understanding of the impacts of wider government investment in the ECE sector. Responsible Manager(s) (completed by relevant manager) Maraina Hak Policy Lead Inland Revenue , s 912)(a) 12 March 2024 Quality Assurance (completed by QA panel) Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Panel Assessment & The Quality Assurance panel from Inland Revenue has reviewed Comment: the '}\\childcare tax credit-"FamilyBoost"" regulatory impact statement (RIS) prepared by Inland Revenue and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the R/S partially meets the quality assurance criteria. This is because the scope of the options analysis has been constrained by the lack of time to fully consider other options given the directive by the Government to provide the benefit through a tax credit mechanism. A comprehensive analysis of those other options outlined in the R/S may have provided a more appropriate option. In addition, the panel considered that the problem definition could be clearer but given the direction, assumptions and limitations Regulatory Impact Statement I 3 Regulatory I mpact Statement | 4 imposed on the analysis there is limited scope to further define the problem the policy is addressing. Consultation with the sector has not been undertaken. The RIS would have benefi ted from feedback from consultation, including the views of the stakeholders on the options considered in the RIS. Regulatory I mpact Statement | 5 Section 1: Diagnosing the policy problem What is the context behind the policy problem and how is the status quo expected to develop? 1.The assumed policy problem is that the cost of early childhood education (ECE) is high relative to families’ incomes. The following section provides context on the ECE sector and future outlook on ECE affordability. 2.The 2022 Early Childhood Education Census showed that there were just over 181,000 children attending licensed early childhood services. Children attended for an average of 21.6 hours per week. Participation rates are highest for 3- and 4-year-olds, where 80% and 84% of children in the respective age groups were attending ECE in 2022. There were 4,597 licensed services operating at the time of the Census. 1 3.Existing regulatory systems are in place to support families with childcare costs. These range from universal and specific ECE supports, such as childcare subsidies, to broader income adequacy payments that contribute towards the cost of raising children, such as the Family tax credit and Best Start tax credit. These supports have different policy rationales, including increasing workforce participation, increasing ECE attendance rates, providing a greater range of choice for parents (both in where to send their children and whether to send them to ECE at all), and alleviating child poverty by supporting income adequacy through direct payments. 4.Childcare supports are administered by several different agencies, including the Ministry of Education (MoE), the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) and Inland Revenue (IR). Support is provided either direct to the parent or direct to the service provider. 5.Each form of support targets a slightly different group and objective, with different eligibility requirements. People may be eligible for one or more of these supports. Examples of the supports include: •The ECE Subsidy. A universal subsidy paid directly to ECE providers for all children attending the ECE service with a daily limit of 6 hours per day and a weekly limit of 30 hours per week. •20 Hour s ECE Subsidy. A subsidy paid directly by MoE to ECE providers based on the number of children enrolled. The 20 hours covered by this subsidy replace the first 20 hours of the ECE subsidy. Associated with this funding are restrictions that specify parents cannot be charged fees for the 20 hours. •The Childcare Subsidy. Administered by MSD and paid directly to the ECE service provider for children up to the age of six of low- to middle-income families 2 . This subsidy is normally paid for up to nine hours of ECE a week if the parent(s) are not working, studying or training 3 and up to fifty hours a week if the parent(s) are working, disabled, or meet other conditions required by MSD. •Donat ions Tax Credit. Individuals can claim 33 percent of donations up to the amount of their taxable income. ECE payments can be claimed if they are 1 Some of the census information was very recently updated for 2023 data. The total number of children in ECE has increased. 2 Families are eligible if they earn less than: $2,144 before tax a week with 1 dependent child $2,450 before tax a week with 2 dependent children $2,756 before tax a week with 3 or more dependent children. 3 Policy responsibility for the 9-hours component of Childcare Subsidy sits with Oranga Tamariki Regulatory I mpact Statement | 6 optional and go to general funds and the service is an approved donee organisation/charity. •Working for Families (WFF) tax credits, including the Family tax credit, In-work tax credit and Best Start tax credit. This programme is administered by Inland Revenue and MSD and provides a direct payment to families with children, including those in the early childhood age group. Best Start is targeted to parents with children aged 0 to 3 years old. 6.These above payments are periodically increased in value, either by automatic adjustment or periodic review. The exception to this is the Donations Tax Credit, which is set at a fixed proportion of charitable spending and will automatically reflect any increased donations on childcare but is limited to a fixed proportion of taxable income earned. 7.It should be noted that due to a lack of reliable access to fees data it is currently difficult for any government agency to provide advice on how effective the above interventions are in reducing ECE costs for parents and caregivers. Futur e outlook on ECE affordability 8.It is anticipated that without Government intervention, the current high inflation environment and trends in the price measures for the ECE sector may result in ECE costs continuing to increase. 9.Ot her factors for the increase in ECE costs may include lack of fees transparency resulting in inefficient markets (from information asymmetries), increasing operating costs, and demand exceeding the supply of ECE centres in some locations. Additionally, there are non-monetary regulations in place for the ECE sector which can increase the cost of delivery. 10.The r ecent repeal of the planned extension of 20 Hour ECE to 2-year-olds also reduces future support to some families to meet ECE costs. 11.If ECE costs do rise, an increasing number of families may no longer be able to afford some ECE hours. This may restrict their ability to work or could result in pressure on other types of family spending to maintain ECE hours, consequently reducing families’ income adequacy, work incentives and/or ECE participation rates. Limitations on Policy Analysis 12.As providing prompt support to families facing cost of living pressures, through targeted assistance with ECE costs, is a priority, the Government has directed Inland Revenue to implement a childcare tax credit by 1 July 2024 to increase the incomes of families who have children in ECE. 13.This, alongside standard policy limitations such as time constraints and lack of available data, has constrained Inland Revenue’s ability to do a comprehensive policy analysis. This section expands on those limitations and the impact they have had on the policy analysis. Lack of fees data 14.Comprehensive fees data is not available from either MSD or MoE: •MoE has an existing mechanism called the Early Learning Information collection (ELI), which collects attendance data and systems which store each child’s name, date of birth and National Student Number (NSN). However, MoE does not collect any fees data from families or providers. MoE had received funding in Budget 2023 to construct a system through which providers would report their standard fee rates to the Ministry. This system has not yet been implemented and would not provide Regulatory I mpact Statement | 7 granular detail on individual families’ fees, including what portion of those fees are covered by other government supports. •MSD holds comprehensive fees information for a small population, including the portion of the fee that is covered by other government support. However, this data is only held for recipients of the Childcare Subsidy ( 35,000 recipients for the 2022/23 year), therefore is not representative, and is collected via a manual process that places a high administrative burden on families, ECE providers and MSD staff. This process is not easily scalable. 15.Without comprehensive fees data, it is difficult for any government agency to determine the severity of ECE costs on families (including trends for the future), the factors that increase ECE costs (e.g., operational costs, impact of government regulation on the sector), and the efficacy of current and future government interventions in reducing ECE costs for parents and caregivers. 16.Instead, Inland Revenue has had to make assumptions about the severity of the policy problem and find alternative ways to feasibly implement a tax credit linked to childcare expenditure without easy access to current fees data. Policy design limitations 17.The Government has requested a new tax credit, “FamilyBoost”, that prioritises the following parameters: •direct payment to eligible parents on a household basis, •the payment be proportional to parents’ actual childcare costs up to a capped amount per household, •the maximum payment be abated according to household income, •a regular payment, •administered by Inland Revenue, and, •implementable by 1 July 2024 to address current cost of living pressures. 18.These parameters define the set of options officials can examine in this analysis, meaning some significantly different alternatives to those proposed in this paper have not been considered in detail. Instead, the scope of policy options presented to Ministers have been limited to variations of direct tax credits that Inland Revenue can administer to increase incomes of families utilising ECE. 19.If there had been more scope and time available to do a comprehensive options analysis, Inland Revenue (alongside other agencies) would have considered a wider range of policy options to address the problem, including: •reducing ECE fees through a direct subsidy to providers, •regulatory price controls or changes to reduce the impact of other regulatory systems that increase operational costs for providers (e.g., play space requirements), or •increases to incomes of families utilising ECE through other government support and/or wage growth. 20.This options analysis would include considering whether other agencies would be better suited to implement a new or expanded existing support instead of Inland Revenue. Lack of public consultation 21.We have not been able to undertake any consultation with the public at this stage of the policy process due to time constraints and budget secrecy conventions, despite the potential for significant compliance costs on the ECE sector and parents in implementing a childcare tax credit. For example, depending on the tax credit model selected, parents may either be required to periodically upload invoices (with ECE providers being required to ensure those invoices are in the correct format), or ECE providers will be required to share fees data directly with the government. 22. s 9(2)(g)(i) JT herefore, 1t will be particularly crucial to consult witnfhe ECE sector to determine the compliance costs associated with implementing a childcare tax credit, but especially regarding the cost of sharing fees data, and whether the ECE sector will support and are able to take up those necessary systems changes to do so. What is the policy problem or opportunity? 23. The Government has indicated that they would like to increase the incomes of families who have children in ECE. As such, we have assumed the underlying policy problem is that the costs of early childhood education are high relative to families' incomes. 24. This assumption is supported by OECD research 4 that has identified that couples pay 37% of their income towards childcare in New Zealand. This is high both in absolute terms and relative to the OECD average (13% of couple's income), including to countries such as Australia (22% of couple's income) and United Kingdom (25% of couple's income). 25. The only available analysis on ECE affordability Inland Revenue could find is from MSD which reviewed the Childcare Subsidy and therefore only covered lower-income families' ECE affordability. The report indicated that ECE affordability has declined for low-income families because of the Childcare Subsidy not being adjusted to reflect inflation. However, a lack of availability of data on ECE fees over time prevents the analysis from being able to quantify this cost, and the analysis is only applicable to low or low-middle income families who are eligible (or would be if thresholds had been adjusted to reflect inflation) for the Childcare Subsidy. 26. Beyond this analysis, Inland Revenue does not have supporting evidence to back up the OECD data or to define the severity of the policy problem. Implications of the assumed policy problem: 27. 4 High ECE costs relative to income are likely to have implications for decreasing parental labour market participation, ECE participation rates and families· i ncome adequacy. For example, a family may be unable to afford some ECE hours, restricting the parent's ability to work and for the child to participate in ECE, or resulting in pressure on other types of family spending to maintain ECE hours. Alternatively, even if Assumes full-time, centre-based care for two children aged two and three, and after any benefits designed to reduce the gross childcare fees. Due to data quality issues, the fees information that the OECD is believed to be using in their assessment is from 2013, with adjustments for inflation and other macroeconomic trends. Consequently, this figure may not be reliable. See OECD (2023), Net childcare costs (indicator). doi: 10.1787/e328a9ee-en (Accessed on 16 November 2023) Regulatory Impact Statement I 8 Regulatory I mpact Statement | 9 families can afford ECE, they may still be incentivised to not work if the ECE fees exceed the net income gained from working. 28.Inland Revenue does not have data available to support the implications of high ECE costs relative to income on families in New Zealand on income adequacy or various participation measures. Impacts of high ECE costs relative to income on population groups 29.High ECE costs relative to income disproportionately affects women, Māori and Pasif ika, lower-income and rural population groups. 30.Women are disproportionately impacted by high ECE costs as they are more likely to take time out of the labour force to care for children, including as sole parents. 5 This impacts on a woman’s long run labour market outcomes and increasing the gender wage gap. Therefore, any policy intervention to improve accessibility of childcare is more likely to benefit women by increasing work incentives, especially policy interventions that are targeted towards second earners or solo parents. 31.Research indicates that payment for childcare when children are at 4 or 5 years old varies by ethnicity. Survey data by Growing Up in New Zealand (Aotearoa's largest longitudinal study of child health and wellbeing) shows that “76 percent of families overall pay for care, with paying for care high among Europeans (78%) and Asians (77%), and lower among Māori (67%) and Pasifika (61%)”. 6 This means any government support targeted at alleviating ECE costs will provide a reduced benefit to Māori and Pasifika families due to these two groups being less likely to pay for childcare, either due to ECE subsidies covering the cost already, lower ECE participation, or greater participation in informal/non-cash-based childcare. 32.A reduced benefit will also apply to wider groups of parents who have low or no fees. This extends to lower income households (who are likely more eligible for other subsidies) and rural groups (who may have limited geographic access to childcare options). Alternatively, any policy intervention to reduce ECE costs relative to income may increase uptake if cost is a barrier to these groups for accessing childcare, although we are uncertain of the impact of cost on ECE participation. What objectives are sought in relation to the policy problem? 33.There are several potential objectives that a childcare tax credit could accomplish which will inform which of the potential options is preferred. 34.The Government has outlined the primary objective of “FamilyBoost” as directly increasing the incomes of families who have children in ECE ( targeted by level of household income with full abatement at $180,000 household income). 35.Ot her potential objectives of a childcare tax credit include: •Decreasing the amount payable for childcare costs •Greater fee transparency in the ECE sector •Increasing ECE participation •Improving children’s educational and/or development outcomes •Increasing labour market participation rates 5 82.4 percent of single parent households are led by women, and 91 percent of Sole Parent Support recipients are women (Ministry for Women). 6 See Sin, I. (2022). How do childcare experiences differ by ethnicity and for families with previous childcare access issues? Motu Economic and Public Policy Research. https://www.motu.nz/assets/Uploads/Use-of- childcare-after-access-issues-note-FINAL.pdf Regulatory I mpact Statement | 10 36.These alternative objectives have not been a consideration in assessing options to implement a childcare tax credit, but it is likely that these will be impacted by achieving the primary objective nonetheless. 37.Alongside the primary objective of increasing incomes of families who have children in ECE, we have designed policy options within the parameters of the following secondary objectives: •is timely and feasible to be implemented, •aligns as closely as possible with the Government’s policy proposal, and, •minimises cost to government and compliance burden on parents. Regulatory I mpact Statement | 11 Section 2: Deciding upon an option to address th e policy problem What criteria will be used to compare options to the status quo? 38.The criteria which will be used to compare options are: •Increases in the income of eligible families •Potential to promote fee transparency •Compliance costs for providers (including ECE centres and student management system providers) •Compliance costs for parents/caregivers •Administrative costs •Fiscal cost to the government •Time required for implementation What scope will options be considered within? 39.The scope is limited to the parameters requested by the Government for the “FamilyBoost” tax credit. In addition, the administration of a childcare tax credit (if proportional to ECE expenditure) requires access to fees information that is linked to individual parents or caregivers, the children in their care, and to their family income. 40.While Inland Revenue has some of the data required to administer a childcare tax credit (i.e., income data and bank account information for some potential recipients), other essential data is held by ECE providers and parents (i.e., ECE fee payments and enrolment/attendance details, relationship and household details). 41.Ot her agencies (MoE and MSD) also receive some of the necessary data, but not enough to implement “FamilyBoost” by 1 July 2024. •MoE receive enrolment and attendance data for individual children from providers, but this does not include fees information. The child is also not linked to the parent in the MoE data set and neither MoE nor the ECE providers hold household income information. •MSD are provided with some fees information from ECE providers and income information from parents for the Childcare Subsidy (35,000 recipients across 2022/23), but this is limited to fees information for lower-income families, and the information is manually collected and not easily scalable to cover the target group for “FamilyBoost”. In comparison to MSD, Inland Revenue has wider access to individual income information and an existing family’s data set linking a significant number of children to parents for WFF tax credits and Child Support. 42.Without current access to the fees data, the scope of policy options has been further limited to variations of direct payments that Inland Revenue can feasibly administer using known data sources and interactions, to increase incomes of families using ECE. 43.Implementing a product that meets the parameters set out by the Government will require new legislation and regulation and cannot be implemented within the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s existing powers. As such, there is not a non- regulatory option available. What options are being considered? 44. The three options being considered are: • Status Quo - do nothing • Basic refund model using parents to supply fees information, delivered by 1 July 2024 • Detailed refund model using ECE providers data, extending timeline for implementation Option 1 -status quo 45. Under the status quo, ECE costs would remain high, or would potentially continue to increase relative to the income families earn in New Zealand. Support would continue to be provided through Inland Revenue, MoE and MSD through existing subsidy products or through broad income support payments such as WFF payments, which are periodically adjusted by CPI. There would be some increase in after-tax income for families through the periodic adjustments to WFF tax credits, 9(2)(f)(iv} Option 2 -Basic refund model using parents to supply fees information, delivered by 1 July 2024 46. Option 2 is a childcare tax credit that is expected to be effective from 1 July 2024, but relies on parents or caregivers to submit invoices directly to Inland Revenue via mylR every 3 months. Inland Revenue would then calculate the refund based on their most recent income information. Parents are expected to be able to receive payments from October 2024 onwards. The calculation of these refunds would be final upon submission of the invoice and would not be adjusted if more recent income information becomes available. Consequently, parents should not incur debt and there would be no "square-up" process when assessing annual income tax returns. 47. This model uses information Inland Revenue already holds and minimises the additional information required to deliver a payment. New information sharing systems and agreements to collect and pass on fees information would not be required to be developed by MoE or ECE providers. ECE providers may need to update their s stems to ensure fee invoices meet minimum re uired standards. s f8(c}(i} , -.--- . - .- Y. h 1 s appr oac 1 s a variation of the current donations tax credit model, with the additional complication that ECE costs are ongoing, and income is combined for couples rather than based on individual income. Option 3 -Detailed refund model using ECE providers data, extending timeline for implementation 48.Option 3 would extend the timeline for implementation by two to three years to allow the childcare tax credit to be automatically calculated based on data collected from ECE providers, reducing the compliance burden on parents and aligning it with the policy proposed by the Government. 49. Extending the timeline is necessary as the original policy outline of "FamilyBoost" has several features that cannot be delivered without extensive system changes for Inland Revenue, the MoE, and ECE providers - the most significant feature being creating information flows directly from ECE providers to Inland Revenue to reduce parent's compliance costs. 50. We consider it would take two to three years to consult with the sector, design, build and test relevant systems to ensure the data is high quality, secure, reliable and timely before the implementation of this childcare tax credit model. Internal consultation at Inland Revenue indicates that onboarding new providers to use gateway services (that is, enabling their software to interact directly with IR systems via a suite of application Regulatory Impact Statement I 12 programming interfaces) takes approximately nine months. Officials would need to consult with the ECE sector to determine precisely how long this would take and what alternatives would be required for providers that do not use software. Testing would be required to ensure the data sent in is correct, reliable and able to be correctly matched to the registered parent. 51. Allowing time for better information-sharing options to be developed between departments and ECE providers would be more efficient in the long term and reduce the burden on parents:s 9(2)(g)(i) I \_ .---improve th-e-..-m ..- te\_g\_r ..,.. 1tyo-of the claims and reduce he immediate fiscal cost ofthe proposal.

Regulatory Impact Statement I 13 How do the options compare to the status quo? Increase the income of eligible families Potential to promote fee transparency Compliance costs for providers Compliance costs for customers Administrative costs 7 Fiscal cost to the government Time required for implementation Overall assessment Option One - Status Quo 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 The administrative costs include both capital and operational costs. Option Two - Basic refund model ++ + Option Three - Extend timeline for implementation ++ ++ Regulatory Impact Statement I 14 What option is likely to best address the problem, meet the policy objectives, and deliver the highest net benefits? 53. Option 1 (Status Quo) provides no extra support to parents and therefore does not address the problem. It also has no administrative cost, compliance burden or fiscal cost. 54. Options 2 and 3 have different trade-offs but effectively deliver similar net outcomes. Those trade-offs essentially are the date the product can be implemented by (and therefore a tax credit provided) and the level of effort required by potential recipients/providers. 55. Option 2 (basic refund model) can be implemented by 1 July 2024 providing prompt support to parents, but places compliance costs on families to submit invoices to receive the childcare tax credit which could reduce take-up of this policy, also reducing the support available for eligible families. It also requires the ECE providers to update their invoices to ensure they are in the correct format for Inland Revenue to provide the tax credit. This option would have a reduced capital cost to implement, but higher operational costs than Option 3. Option 2 could be progressed with the intention of continuous improvements to integrity checks and some customer experience over time to align it closer to Option 3 , or to run until the systems described in Option 3 are built. However, there is the risk that this option could be entrenched, with high compliance costs placed on parents. 56. Option 3 (extend timelines) does not provide short-term benefit to parents as it would take longer to implement but will greatly reduce the compliance costs on parents, resulting in higher take-up than Option 2. Administratively, this option would be more efficient for Inland Revenue to administer over the long run des ite initial high capital costs ands 9 (2)(g)(i) , -·---- . owever, this depends on whether there 1s proper consultation and ""'n -s .- m\_a\_n\_a\_ g \_e \_m\_ e-nt as O tion 3 does increase the providers' compliance costs, I � 9 (2) ,g)(i) 57. Determining the best option depends on the weighting given to the individual criteria or any other objective and criteria considered relevant but not mentioned in the table. An overall positive proposal would be if the gains from the option far exceed the costs associated. To illustrate, if the Government wants to provide quick support to families with children in ECE, criteria regarding time required to implement and increasing the incomes of eligible families who have children in ECE will hold more weight. However, it should be noted that this comes with significant cost to the Government both fiscally, and to cover the administrative costs imposed on Inland Revenue.

The analysis also only covers the Refund Model - (i.e., assumes that continuous improvements would not occur to align the product closer to the pre-election proposal over time). If the continuous improvements were to occur to the point that the full model becomes available, it is expected that ECE providers would incur larger set-up costs as they amend their systems to provide fees information to Inland Revenue and compliance on parents would reduce. There would be additional costs on Inland Revenue to develop additional systems.

Regulatory Impact Statement I 17 Regulatory Impact Statement | 18 Section 3: Delivering an option How will the new arrangements be implemented? 61.The implementation details are dependent on the option selected, and as such the following is a preliminary indication of our approach. Implementation arrangements 62.The Government has identified Inland Revenue as the administrator of the payment. Introducing a new tax credit would have a significantly high organisational impact on Inland Revenue to support the anticipated increase in initial and ongoing customer contact. 63.The organisational impacts include systems changes (either through developing a new system or utilising an existing system as a base for the tax credit) and investment into change management/staff training to support customers and ensure compliance. Additional staff would be required to manage additional contacts and support parents. This investment includes developing education and guidance thorough the Inland Revenue website to relevant stakeholders (ECE providers, student software system providers and parents) and for customer service to assist in any queries to ensure eligible parents are aware of and can access the credit. 64.Dependi ng on the preferred option, “FamilyBoost” could come into effect as early as 1 July 2024 (Option 2), or as late as 2026 (Option 3) . The design of Option 2 has accounted for an earlier implementation date of 1 July 2024, but does give short notice to ECE providers to update their invoices and to Inland Revenue to build the tax credit. As such it comes with risks around time to deliver. Option Three allows for sufficient consultation and preparation time for all parties. 65.Consultation with the ECE sector as part of the childcare tax credit work programme presents an opportunity for discussion about improving ECE data collections more generally, either as part of, or as a complement to the implementation of a childcare tax credit. Im plementation risks 66.A detailed assessment of implementation risks is yet to be compiled as it depends on which option is to be progressed. However, any option risks adding complexity to an already complex income support system and ECE support system. This can impose a burden on parents to understand and access the various supports, including requiring parents to interact with multiple agencies. Furthermore, it affects agencies’ ability to distinguish the individual and combined efficacy of income and ECE supports. 67.The other risk relevant to either option is that IT system changes pose high uncertainty due to their complexity which can extend the time it takes to build, test, and implement any new products. This means any identified timeframes are an estimate, especially when the two options are reliant on ECE providers updating their systems, either with a minor adjustment (changing their invoices to comply) or a large adjustment (supplying ECE fees information to the government). This also impacts the software providers that ECE providers use. 68.Particular to Option 2, are the risks that there will be lower take-up due to compliance costs on parents, integrity risks associated with invoices or disclosed personal incomes, the implementation date of 1 July 2024 sitting within Inland Revenue’s peak period of demand resulting in reduced levels of customer support available across Inland Revenue. Finally, there is a risk that the basic refund model will become entrenched without a replacement model ever designed and implemented. 69.Option 3 carries less integrity risk (as it would be largely automated) but is reliant on ECE providers being able and willing to update their systems to create information flows of fees data to Inland Revenue. It also relies on accuracy of data and a consistent approach to recording information. If this fails to occur, officials will reconsider the other options listed and provide updated advice. How will the new arrangements be monitored, evaluated, and reviewed? 70. The monitoring, evaluation, and review of the arrangement is yet to be completed as it depends on the option selected, and as such the following is only a preliminary indication of our approach. Monitoring 71. To implement either option, resourcing would be required from Inland Revenue to monitor and verify tax credit registrations, claims, and any data supporting the claim to ensure parents meet the eligibility criteria for the tax credit and are receiving the correct amount. This includes monitoring income information to ensure parents are within the household income abatement thresholds. 72. s f8(c)(l) 73. For Option 3 (extend implementation), Inland Revenue would still have to monitor the fees information received by ECE providers to ensure the information is complete and correctly assigned to parent receiving the tax credit. However, they would not need to verify individual families ECE invoices which reduces the integrity risk and administrative burden on Inland Revenue. Evaluation and review 74. 75. 8 The evaluation and review of any implemented childcare tax credit would likely be led by Inland Revenue in consultation with MoE, MSD and Treasury, but the specifics of the evaluation process are yet to be determined. Regardless of the option selected, fee data could be used to supplement and inform decision making about the policy and its success by enabling officials to monitor impacts on sector fees. Any data collection efforts to support a childcare tax credit would also support improved understanding of the impacts of wider government investment in the ECE sector-noting that ECE is a significant area of government expenditure (currently over $2 billion per annum) 8 . This would support the work MoE, MSD, and Treasury do regarding childcare support. This figure comes from the 2023/24 Estimates for Vote Education. See The Treasury New Zealand. (2023, May 18). Vote Education -Education and Workforce Sector - Estimates of Appropriations 2023124. https://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/estimates/vote-education­ education-and-workforce-sector-estimates-appropriations-2023-24 Regulatory Impact Statement I 19 Item 03 Regulatory Impact Statement | 2 The IWTC would continue to be paid at a maximum rate of $3,770 per year ($72.50 per week) for a family of up to three children, with an additional $780 each year ($15 per week) for each subsequent child. The impacts of option one This option risks the policy objectives of the IWTC being further eroded if the value of the IWTC in relation t o minimum wage continues to decrease. As such, this option is out of step with improving income adequacy for low to middle income families, increasing work incentives for low to middle income families, and helping the Government meet its child poverty reduction targets. However, this option does not bear an additional cost to the Government and would not require Inland Revenue to implement any changes. Option 2: Increase of the in-work tax credit by $25 per week from 31 July 2024 Under option two, none of the existing statutory parameters in relation to eligibility and abatement would be adjusted. The proposed implementation date would be 31 July 2024. The updated rate would take effect alongside the proposed changes to personal income taxes and the Independent Earner Tax Credit. Ad hoc notices of entitlements will need to be sent to WFF customers in June 2024 to inform them of the change. This is likely to increase administrative costs for Inland Revenue as these notices will be sent out during Inland Revenue’s busiest period and are likely to drive increased customer contact. Consultation has shown general support for increases to tax credit rates In 2018, the previous Government established the Welfare Expert Advisory Group (WEAG) to advise them on the future of New Zealand’s social security system, including the WFF scheme. The WEAG recommended fundamental changes to the design and targeting of WFF, as well as significant increases to main benefits and the Family Tax Credit (FTC). In response, the previous Government established the WFF Review as a result of those recommendations. This review included a targeted engagement process with many stakeholders, including several academics and those representing groups who advocate for children. Most survey respondents were of the view that WFF does not currently pay enough support for families. The impacts of option two There will be increased financial resources available to low and middle income working families This change will benefit approximately 1 70,000 families who currently receive the IWTC. They will benefit by a net average of $16.97 per week when factoring in the average rate at which the IWTC abates amongst all IWTC recipients. There will be increased incentive for low and middle income families to take up and stay in paid employment This change will lower replacement ratios, which measures the gap between income when receiving a benefit versus receiving income when in work. By increasing the IWTC, a family’s income in employment would decrease by a greater proportion if they went onto a main benefit or vice versa. Currently, a coupled family working 40 hours per week at minimum wage would retain 80.5% of their income if they left employment and went on benefit, and for a sole parent in the same Regulatory Impact Statement | 3 situation 66.3% of their income would be retained. After the increase to the IWTC, and all other things being equal, these replacement ratios would decrease to 78.8% for a coupled family, and 64.5% for a sole parent family. There will be reductions to child poverty The impact on child poverty of option 2 (increase the IWTC by $25 per week from 31 July 2024) has not been modelled independently to of the other Tax Package changes, due to time constraints. It is estimated that the Tax Package, which includes a $25 increase to the In-Work Tax Credit, will reduce child poverty by around 14,000 children (+/- 6000) on the fixed-line AHC50 measure, 1 and by around 3,000 children (+/- 7000) on the BHC50 measure 2 in the 2027 tax year. 3 The tax package increases the incomes of low-income working households faster than the increase in the cost of living, which reduces fixed-line AHC50 child poverty. However, the tax package may slightly reduce moving-line BHC50 child poverty, since the poverty line for this measure is set at 50% of the median household income, and the tax package is expected to increase the median household income. The overall cost to the Government of Option 2 is estimated to be $607 million over the forecast period The increase to the IWTC will cost $607 million over the forecast period which extends to 30 June 2028. There is an average cost of $152 million per annum of increasing the rates by $25 dollars per week for the 170,000 recipients who currently receive the IWTC. Preferred option Officials support the proposal to increase the IWTC by $25 a week. This will ensure that the real value of the support increases with wage growth and acts as an effective incentive to take up, and stay in, employment. Minimum Family Tax Credit consequential amendment The base rate of IWTC effects the calculation of the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC) threshold. Therefore, any time the IWTC is adjusted, a consequential amendment to the MFTC should be considered. The MFTC was designed to create a financial incentive, at the margin, for families to work and be better off not receiving a benefit. As of 1 April 2024, the MFTC threshold is set at $35,204. For people receiving MFTC, their after-tax earnings are topped up to this amount to ensure that they are better off in work, and receiving the MFTC, than they would be receiving a main benefit whilst employed. The MFTC ensures that a sole-parent family who 1 AHC50 measures the number of children in households with incomes much lower than a typical 2018 household, after they pay for housing costs, and is measured by the threshold line set at 50 percent of the median income in 2017/2018 (base financial year), after housing costs are removed. 2 BHC50 is a moving-line income measure, with the poverty threshold taken the year the data is gathered (low income before housing costs – moving-line measure). BHC50 measures the number of children in households with much lower incomes than a typical household, and is measured by the threshold line set at 50 percent of the median household income in the year measured. 3 Note on TAWA modelling: poverty estimates use HES 2020/21 augmented using IDI data, inflated and population adjusted with HYEFU 2023 inflation estimates. Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 works more than 20 hours per week will always be at least $1 better off on a weekly basis than they would be on a benefit. The IWTC and MFTC are both work incentive payments. Together, these payments can be considered to ‘top up’ a person’s after-tax earnings to ensure that an individual is financially better off in work without a main benefit. Any increase in the IWTC is generally combined with a decrease in the MFTC threshold, as less of a ‘top up’ is required. Impending overlap of the MFTC threshold and the WFF abatement threshold As the MFTC threshold increases annually, it is also forecast that on 1 April 2027 it will overlap with the WFF abatement threshold. The WFF abatement threshold is currently fixed at $42,700 and is not periodically increased. There is a conflict of respective policy intents if this overlap were to occur. On the one hand, the MFTC threshold is a guaranteed minimum income for low income working families. On the other hand, the WFF tax credit abatement threshold is set at a level at which a family’s income is considered to be too high for full entitlement. The overlap would also result in WFF customers facing effective marginal tax rates (EMTR) 4 of well over 100%. This issue will also be considered when assessing the options for the MFTC consequential amendment. Options considered for assessment Option 1: Allow MFTC recipients to gain from both the IWTC increase and the personal income t ax reductions The MFTC threshold would increase marginally (by $112) following the increase to the IWTC and personal income tax changes on 31 July 2024. This would ensure that MFTC recipients receive the IWTC increase and benefit from the personal income tax change. This option has a fiscal cost of approximately $0.2 million per annum. This option would support income adequacy and child poverty reduction. It would also increase the incentive for beneficiaries to move off benefit and to take up and stay in employment at the margin. However, this continues the wide hours range (from 20 to 34 hours of work) over which the 100% abatement rate applies for the MFTC. Given the high EMTRs that apply for MFTC recipients over this period, incentives for MFTC recipients to take up more work are decreased under this option. This option would also speed up the impending cross-over of the MFTC threshold and the WFF abatement threshold. If these two thresholds cross over, both the work incentive aspects of these payments and the broader WFF income adequacy objective will be significantly hindered due to the resulting EMTRs for recipients being well over 100%. Option 2: Decrease the MFTC threshold i n line with existing policy, so that MFTC recipients receive less than they would currently The MFTC threshold would decrease by approximately $27 per week or $1,404 per annum. This option will result in a reduction of $2.9 million per year for the IWTC costing. Lowering the MFTC threshold by $27 ensures that MFTC recipients remain $1 better off 4 Effective marginal tax rates show the percent by which a dollar increase in gross income is reduced by taxes and the abatement of social security assistance. Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 Section 1: Diagnosi ng the policy proble m W h a t i s t h e c o n t e x t b e h i n d t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m a n d h o w i s t h e st a t u s q u o e x p e c t e d t o d e v e l o p? Context within which action is proposed Government commitment to reducing the cost of living: Currently there are high cost of living pressures as New Zealand families are feeling the effects of inflation. The cost of living for the average New Zealand household increased 7.4 percent in the 12 months to the September 2023 quarter. 6 Higher prices for interest payments and grocery food were the biggest contributors to the 7.4 percent increase, however price increases to rent, insurance, and property rates also contributed. 7 Government commitments in the Tax Package are intended to increase the after-tax pay of low to middle income earners through the following changes: •Shifting income tax brackets to compensate for inflation; •Introducing the FamilyBoost childcare tax credit; and •Increasing WFF tax credits for working families. 8 The proposed changes to WFF are premised on cost-of-living pressures having significant impacts on families raising children. The IWTC is the key instrument to increasing financial incentives to work within the wider context of the WFF package: WFF was implemented between 2004 and 2007 with the purpose of substantially boosting earlier Family Assistance entitlements. The key objectives of the WFF package were to: •Increase financial incentives to work, and remain in work, by supporting families with dependent children, so that they are rewarded for their work effort; •ensure income adequacy, with a focus on low and middle income families with dependent children to address issues of poverty, especially child poverty; and •achieve a social assistance system that supports people into work, by making sure that people get the assistance they are entitled to, when they should, and with delivery that supports them into, and to remain in, employment. It must also achieve these objectives at a sustainable cost to government. Around 56 percent of all families currently receive WFF, at an annual cost of $2.8 billion for the 2022 income tax year. WFF is made up of the following tax credits: 9 •Family Tax Credit: (264,400 families, $1,966 billion annually): the main payment received by both beneficiary and non-beneficiary families and is not dependent on work status. 6 Taken from the household living-cost price index released by StatsNZ on 26 October 2023. 7 Taken from the household living-cost price index released by StatsNZ on 26 October 2023. 8 “National’s Back Pocket Boost” on 30 August 2023. 9 These numbers are based on the 2021-22 income tax year. Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 •In-work Tax Credit: (170,500 families, $502 million annually): the main in-work payment for families who do not receive a main benefit or student allowance. •Best Start Tax Credit (138,200 families, $296 million annually): this payment provides $73 per week to all families with a child under one year old, and for lower income families with a child under 3. •Minimum Family Tax Credit (3,200 families, $13 million annually): this payment tops up incomes of working families and guarantees a minimum income level for those working at least 20 hours per week in low-paying jobs and who do not receive a main benefit. The IWTC is the primary instrument in the WFF package designed to incentivise employment uptake. It supports working parents, especially sole parents, to take up and stay in employment, by providing a boost to the earned income of low and middle income families to help ensure that they are better off in work than they are on a benefit. The payment depends on how much a family household earns, and the abatement rate is 27%. The IWTC specifically addresses the effect of in-work poverty. Work has costs associated with it – both financial costs such as transport and childcare, and non-financial such as effort and opportunity costs, for example less time spent with children. Any additional income from work may be insufficient to meet the various costs associated with work. That is, a person may judge they are overall better off not working, particularly if they can rely on benefit payments. As well as increasing families’ financial incentives to move off benefit and into employment, the IWTC, alongside the Family Tax Credit , contributes to reducing child poverty by increasing the incomes of low-income working families with dependent children. The real value of the IWTC has eroded over time: Incomes derived from employment have increased by significantly more than benefit incomes due to wage growth exceeding the rate of income support over previous decades. This has reduced the real value of the IWTC given the payment rate has not increased as much when compared to wages. Over time the IWTC has become less important to the decision to work compared to wages. The value of the IWTC in relation to the minimum wage has decreased from 9.8 percent to 7.7 percent since 2018. However, recent changes such as indexing main benefits to wage growth, and regular across the board increase to main benefits, 10 have increased the level of income a family can receive whilst on benefit. The effect of these changes on financial incentives to work are usually offset by corresponding increases to the minimum wage. The relevant consideration for setting the level of IWTC is how much a family’s income would decrease if they left employment and went onto a main benefit or vice versa. The table below compares the incomes a coupled family and a sole-parent family could receive if they each work 40 hours per week at the minimum wage, contrasted against the payments they would receive if they did not work and were on a main benefit. 10 $25 per week increase to main benefits from 1 April 2020; $20 per week increase to main benefits from 31 July 2021; and $15 per week increase to amin benefits from 1 April 2022. Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 All WFF tax credits are subject to an income test, so the amount received is reduced as family income increases over the $42,700 abatement threshold. The FTC is abated first, followed by the IWTC. Both payments abate at a rate of 27 cents for each additional dollar of family scheme income (FSI). FSI represents the pooled financial resources of a family unit. FSI is net income of the principal caregiver and their partner plus or minus any relevant adjustments. There are several adjustments that can be made to the net income in order to determine FSI. Consequential impacts on the MFTC Changes to the IWTC and the personal income tax rates have a consequential impact on the MFTC threshold. Main objective of the MFTC The MFTC was designed to create a financial incentive, at the margin, for families to work and be better off not receiving a benefit. For people receiving MFTC, their weekly after-tax earnings are topped up to this amount to ensure that they are at least $1 better off per week in work than they would be receiving a main benefit whilst employed. Eligibility: A principal caregiver is entitled to MFTC for a dependent child when: •they meet the common eligibility criteria for WFF; •the principal caregiver, or their partner, do not receive an income-tested welfare benefit, a student allowance or a partner’s allowance; •the principal caregiver, or their partner, are considered a “full-time earner”. Full-time is defined as 20 hours or more per week for a sole parent, and 30 hours per week or more for a two-parent family; Generally, only the hours worked to receive PAYE income payments – such as salary and wages – are counted towards the above work hours requirement. Hours worked to derive non-PAYE income payments – such as interest, rents, and dividends – do not satisfy the work hours requirement. Entitlement: As of 1 April 2024, the MFTC threshold is set at $35,204 per annum – the threshold is increased annually to account for increases to main benefits. For people receiving MFTC, their after-tax earnings are topped up to this amount to ensure that they are marginally better off in work than they would be receiving a main benefit whilst employed. The MFTC abates at a rate of 100% for every dollar earned over the MFTC threshold. The impending overlap of the MFTC threshold and the WFF Families abatement threshold The WFF tax credit abatement threshold is currently set at $42,700. This is the point at which the FTC and IWTC entitlements start to reduce at 27%. Unlike the MFTC threshold, which is increased every year in line with benefits, the WFF tax credit abatement threshold is not periodically adjusted. It should be noted that the WFF threshold is a gross threshold, whereas the MFTC threshold applies to a customer’s net income. This is due to the MFTC’s function in topping up a customer’s after tax earnings so that they are always marginally better off in work than they would be receiving a main benefit whilst employed. As the MFTC threshold increases annually, it is forecasted that on 1 April 2027 it will overlap with the WFF abatement threshold. This will mean that WFF customers will face EMTRs of Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 well over 100%. MFTC recipients who are some of the lowest income working families would face decreases in their income as they work additional hours. There is a conflict of respective policy intents if this overlap were to occur. On the one hand, the MFTC threshold is a guaranteed minimum income for low income working families. On the other hand, the WFF tax credit abatement threshold is set at a level at which a family’s income is considered to be too high for full entitlement. W h a t i s t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m o r o p p o r t u n i t y? Problem definition The IWTC has helped increase incomes amongst low and middle income working households, however the real value of the support has diminished overtime. Over previous decades, incomes derived from employment have increased by significantly more than benefit incomes due to wage growth exceeding the rate of income support over an extended period. Over time the IWTC has become less important to the decision to work compared to wages. The value of the IWTC in relation to the minimum wage has decreased from 10.7 percent to 7.7 percent since 2016. As such, the IWTC is not meeting its policy objective as a work incentive payment, nor does the IWTC rate reflect the desires of the Government and national, social, and economic contexts, particularly in relation to the cost of living. This is in part due to the lack of legislative requirement to automatically increase the rate of IWTC over time, unlike the regular Consumers Price Index (CPI) adjustments to the FTC and BSTC. The rate of IWTC was last increased in Budget 2015, from $60 a week to $72.50 a week (from 1 April 2016), as part of the Child Material Hardship package. Stakeholders involved The primary stakeholders are low to middle income working families who are in receipt of the IWTC. They have a significant, personal interest in increases to their income. At the margin the IWTC can have a significant impact for parents to move off-benefit and into employment. In addition, the IWTC also contributes to reducing poverty and improving adequacy for this demographic. Restricted access to material goods or restricted capacity for social Example of overlap: Under this example the Minimum Family Tax Credit threshold is increased to $43,000 (before tax) and the Working for Families tax credits abatement threshold remains at $42,700 (before tax). Mila is a sole parent who works at a supermarket for 35 hours per week on minimum wage and earns $42,900 dollars. Following the crossover, she will face an effective marginal tax rate of 128.6%. This means that for an additional $1 she earns, her tax credits reduce by $1.28 and her total income drops as a result. She is not incentivised to work any additional hours. This is a result of the following reductions of her income via: •17.5% personal income tax; •82.5% Minimum Family Tax Credit; •1.6% ACC levy; and •27% Working for Families abatement (the additional abatement once the overlap happens). This could be made worse if Mila has student loan repayments (12%) or receives the Accommodation Supplement (25%). Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 participation can have significant flow on effects to other areas of life such as physical and mental health. These flow on effects can impact a household’s access to work opportunities, which has negative ramifications for the household’s living standards. Wider society is also a stakeholder in this issue. The consequences of poverty lead to greater public expenditure, particularly on healthcare and the justice system, as well as the loss of potential tax revenue. Increased expenditure on in-work welfare has the capacity to encourage work force participation, and any reduction in poverty rates will lead to savings in other areas. What objectives are sought in relation to the policy problem? Working for Families scheme objectives WFF has three primary objectives: 1.Increase financial incentives to work, and remain in work, by supporting families with dependent children, so that they are rewarded for their work effort; 2.ensure income adequacy, with a focus on low and middle income families with dependent children to address issues of poverty, especially child poverty; and 3.achieve a social assistance system that supports people into work, by making sure that people get the assistance they are entitled to, when they should, and with delivery that supports them into, and to remain in, employment. It must also achieve these objectives at a sustainable cost to government. These objectives must be considered when evaluating any proposed changes to WFF along with any more specific objectives that are being sort in relation to a particular proposal. It is generally possible to achieve two of the three objectives for any given policy change, but not all three. 1.Improving financial incentives to work Improving financial incentives to work will encourage people who are able to work to seek (and remain in) employment. For most people, paid work is a key means of achieving improved wellbeing. However, financial incentives are only one (and not necessarily the most important) of many factors that influence people’s decisions on whether, or how much, to work. 2.Improving income adequacy for low and middle income people While recent changes to the welfare system (including the Families Package, the $25 a week increase to main benefits on 1 April 2020 and the indexation of main benefits to average wage) will help to improve the living standards of low-income people, income adequacy and child poverty issues remain. Any changes to WFF should have a net positive impact on these issues, particularly as these credits are an important tool to meet child poverty reduction targets as required under the Child Poverty Reduction Act 2018. 3.Achieve a social assistance system that supports people into work There is a continued need to modernise and simplify the WFF system to better respond to changing work and care arrangements. Any changes to WFF should seek to improve the client experience and improve the interface between benefit and work. Paying welfare support at a cost that is sustainable to government Regulatory Impact Statement | 13 The government is required to act and pursue its policy objectives in accordance with the principles of responsible fiscal management as set out in the Public Finance Act 1989. These principles include managing fiscal risks facing the government, having regard for the impact on present and future generations, and ensuring the Crown’s resources are managed effectively and efficiently. The WFF scheme should be delivered in accordance with these principles. Specific objectives relating to the $25 per week increase to the IWTC The policy objective of this change can be viewed as twofold: Help i ncrease financial incentives to work by increasing the gap between income on benefit and income when in-work A fundamental purpose of the IWTC, as stated in the supporting policy paper to joint Ministers when it was introduced was “to improve replacement ratios, (i.e., the gap between income on benefit and income when in work”) . 11 The relevant consideration for setting the level of IWTC is therefore generally the existing “gap” between benefit levels and wages for low and middle income families, and how the size of the gap has moved. Decrease the cost-of-living pressures for families raising children Inland Revenue understands that Government commitments are intended to increase the after-tax pay of low to middle income earners. The proposed increase to the IWTC is premised on the cost-of-living pressures having significant impacts on families raising children. 11 “Future Directions: Regular Adjustments of Family Income Assistance” on 19 March 2004. Regulatory Impact Statement | 14 Section 2: Deciding upon an option to address the poli cy problem What criteria wil l be used to compare options to the status quo? The following criteria is derived primarily from the WFF objectives. The income adequacy and financial incentives to work criterion will be given the highest weighting, as they align with specific objectives relating to the $25 per week increase to the IWTC. Income adequacy This will measure the degree to which the incomes of low and middle income households are improved. It will demonstrate the average increases households can expect to their incomes once abatement of financial assistance is considered. Impacts on child poverty These will be measured using fixed line AHC50 12 and moving line BHC50. 13 Options which have greater reduction in the number of children in AHC50 and BHC50 poverty are preferred. Options should not be so tightly targeted that, as a result, more children are pushed under the poverty line. Administrative benefit This will measure the degree to which changes to WFF improve the client experience and im prove the interface between benefit and work. Financial incentives to work The impact of these proposals on financial incentives to work are considered. These are primarily measured using replacement ratios, which consider the gap between income on benefit and income when in work. Fiscal cost This will measure the overall cost to the government of each individual option. Ease of implementation This will measure the difficulty for Inland Revenue to implement each individual option. What scope will options be considere d within? •Options are solely concerned with an increase to the existing rate. Out of scope •Changes to the policy settings of the IWTC, including the rules for eligibility and abatement, are not in scope for any of the proposed options. 12 The percentage of children living in households with less than 50 percent of the median equivalised disposable household income after housing costs are deducted (for the 2017/18 base financial year). 13 The percentage of children living in households with less than 50 percent of the median equivalised disposable household income before housing costs are deducted. Regulatory Impact Statement | 15 •Alternative options have not been explored that could also target low and middle income working families. This includes options that would address income adequacy of beneficiary families who are not in receipt of the IWTC. W h a t o p t i o n s a r e b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d? Option One – No increase of the in-work tax credit The status quo is no legislative or policy change. The IWTC would continue to be paid at a maximum rate of $3,770 per year ($72.50 per week) for a family of up to three children, with an additional $780 each year ($15 per week) for each subsequent child. This option risks the policy objectives of the IWTC being further eroded if the value of the IWTC in relation to minimum wage continues to decrease. As such, this option is out of step with improving income adequacy for low to middle income families, increasing work incentives for low to middle income families, and helping the Government meet its child poverty reduction targets. However, this option does not bear an additional cost to the Government and would not require Inland Revenue to implement any changes. Option Two – Increase of the in-work tax credit by $25 per week from 31 July 2024 The IWTC standard rate would be increased to $5,070 per year ($97.50 per week) from 31 July 2024. The IWTC subsequent child rate would remain at $780 each year ($15 per week) for each subsequent child. None of the existing parameters in relation to eligibility and abatement would be adjusted. The principal caregiver, or their partner, must not receive an income-tested welfare benefit, a student allowance or a partner’s allowance. The IWTC would continue to abate at a rate of 27% for each additional dollar of family scheme income earned over the WFF abatement threshold ($42,700), following the full abatement of the FTC. The implementation date would be 31 July 2024. The updated rate would take effect alongside the proposed changes to personal income taxes and the Independent Earner Tax Credit. Ad hoc notices of entitlements will need to be sent to WFF customers in June 2024 to inform them of the change. Modelling of impacts This change will benefit approximately 170,000 families who currently receive the IWTC. They will benefit by a net average of $16.97 per week when factoring in the average rate at which the IWTC abates amongst all IWTC recipients. There will be increased work incentives This change will lower replacement ratios, which measure the gap between income when receiving a benefit versus income when in work. The increase to the IWTC means there is more income available for low and middle income families who are in paid work. This will increase the “gap” between benefit levels and wages for these families. After the increase to the IWTC, and all other things being equal, these replacement ratios would decrease to 78.8 percent for a coupled family, and 64.5 percent for a sole parent family. There will be implementation implications for Inland Revenue and customers To progress this change through Budget 2024, and include it in Budget night legislation, ad hoc notices of entitlement are required to be sent to WFF customers. Usually, notices of entitlement are sent out in February, during the standard WFF rollover process. This could Regulatory Impact Statement | 16 cause confusion for these impacted customers, who already have a high customer contact rate with Inland Revenue due t o their reliance on WFF support. This customer contact will coincide with busy time for Inland Revenue in which it is issuing individual income tax assessments. Inland Revenue will need to undertake significant preparatory work before Budget 2024 announcements. This includes issuing communications and guidance material, as well as updating Inland Revenue’s website. There will be reductions to child poverty The impact on child poverty of option 2 (increase the IWTC by $25 per week from 31 July 2024) has not been modelled independently to of the other Tax Package changes, due to time constraints. It is estimated that the Tax Package, which includes a $25 increase to the In-Work Tax Credit, will reduce child poverty by around 14,000 children (+/- 6000) on the fixed-line AHC50 measure, 14 and by around 3,000 children (+/- 7000) on the BHC50 measure 15 in the 2027 tax year. 16 The tax package increases the incomes of low-income working households faster than the increase in the cost of living, which reduces fixed-line AHC50 child poverty. However, the tax package may slightly reduce moving-line BHC50 child poverty, since the poverty line for this measure is set at 50% of the median household income, and the tax package is expected to increase the median household income. The overall cost of this option is estimated to be $607 million over the forecast period 2024/25 to 2027/28 The i ncrease to the IWTC will cost $607 million over the forecast period which extends to 30 June 2028. Consequential impact on the Minimum Family Tax Cre dit Any increases to the IWTC will have a consequential impact on the MFTC threshold. Options for addressing this impact will be assessed using the following criteria. Income adequacy This will measure the degree to which the incomes of low and middle income households are improved. Financial incentives to work The impact of these options on financial incentives to work are considered. This includes any effect the change will have on the range of working hours over which the MFTC abates, as 14 AHC50 measures the number of children in households with incomes much lower than a typical 2018 household, after they pay for housing costs, and is measured by the threshold line set at 50 percent of the median income in 2017/2018 (base financial year), after housing costs are removed. 15 BHC50 is a moving-line income measure, with the poverty threshold taken the year the data is gathered (low income before housing costs – moving-line measure). BHC50 measures the number of children in households with much lower incomes than a typical household, and is measured by the threshold line set at 50 percent of the median household income in the year measured. 16 Note on TAWA modelling: poverty estimates use HES 2020/21 augmented using IDI data, inflated and population adjusted with HYEFU 2023 inflation estimates. Regulatory Impact Statement | 17 this has a corresponding impact on work incentives – particularly given the 100% abatement rate. Fiscal cost This will measure the overall cost to the government of each individual option. The impending overlap of the MFTC threshold and the WFF abatement threshold This will consider whether the options exacerbate or quicken the eventual crossover between the MFTC threshold and the WFF abatement threshold. Option One: allow MFTC recipients to gain from the IWTC increase and personal income tax cuts Under option one, the IWTC would flow through to MFTC recipients and the MFTC threshold would increase marginally (by $112) per annum on 31 July 2024 to allow MFTC recipients to benefit from the personal income tax changes. This i s a significant departure from the way the MFTC is calculated, as the guaranteed income provided for by the MFTC would be set approximately $27 above the after-tax earnings from employment whilst still on benefit (which accounts for the IWTC increase and the estimated relief from the personal tax rate changes). This option would ensure that MFTC recipients receive the IWTC increase and benefit from the personal income tax changes, which will support income adequacy and child poverty reduction. Allowing the IWTC changes to flow through would further increase the incentive for beneficiaries t o move off benefit and to take up and stay in employment at the margin, particularly at 20 hours per week. However, this option continues the wide hours range (from 20 to 35 hours of work) over which the 100% abatement rate applies for the MFTC currently. 17 A s MFTC recipients are subject to significant EMTRs, particularly between 20 and 35 hours of work, this option decreases incentives to work more hours. Increasing the MFTC threshold would also speed up the impending cross-over of the MFTC threshold and the WFF abatement threshold. If these two thresholds cross over, the work incentive aspect of these payments and the broader WFF income adequacy objective will be significantly hindered due to the resulting EMTRs for recipients being well over 100%. There will also be ongoing issue in deciding what to do about the artificially inflated threshold every year; starting 1 April 2025. This option has a fiscal cost of approximately $0.2 million per annum. This i s a result of letting MFTC recipients benefit from the personal income tax changes. This option is preferred by the Ministry of Social Development and the Child Wellbeing and Poverty Reduction Group in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Option Two: Decrease the MFTC threshold in line with existing policy, so that MFTC recipients receive less than they would currently Under option two, the MFTC threshold would decrease by approximately $27 dollars per week or $1,404 per annum. Lowering the MFTC threshold by $27 per week adheres to the current MFTC threshold calculation, as this amount ensures that MFTC recipients remain $1 17 Assuming no change to the minimum wage rate. Regulatory Impact Statement | 18 better off per week compared with those working and receiving a benefit following the IWTC increase and the changes to the personal income tax rates. 18 This option reduces the MFTC threshold to account for both the IWTC increase artificially inflating the MFTC guaranteed amount and the personal income tax rate changes. MFTC recipients will therefore be made worse off by this change as their net incomes will decrease. For example, if a family i s working less than 33 hours per week, they are likely to experience a reduction in net income of up to $104 per annum under this option. This option therefore does not improve income adequacy or support child poverty reduction. As MFTC recipients will not financially benefit from the IWTC increase following these changes, the increased incentive to take up and stay in work associated with the IWTC increase will not flow through. However, at minimum wage, the earnings range over which the 100% abatement rate applies would be reduced by one and half hours , increasing the incentive for MFTC recipients to work longer hours. This option will also mitigate the urgency of addressing the MFTC/WFF abatement threshold cross over, as reducing the MFTC threshold will delay the eventual cross over. This option will result in a reduction of $2.9 million per year for the IWTC costing. Option three – Decrease the MFTC threshold so that MFTC recipients will receive the same amount that they do currently Under option three, the MFTC threshold would decrease by $23 dollars per week or $1,196 per annum when the increase to the IWTC is introduced. This change reduces the MFTC threshold in such a way that a family does not benefit from the IWTC change but are not worse off as compared to status quo. The MFTC threshold would then be readjusted with the next benefit increase as per the usual process on 1 April 2025. This option is a departure from the existing calculation to the MFTC threshold that has been operating, as it would ensure that the threshold is set at a rate greater than $1 above the after-tax earnings from employment whilst still on benefit. However, option three provides for minimal departure from the MFTC calculation so as to not cause inconsistency with the policy intent of the MFTC. As MFTC recipients will not benefit from the IWTC increase but will not be made worse off, thi s option has a neutral impact on income adequacy and child poverty reduction. The MFTC’s function to incentivise people to move off-benefit and into full time employment will also be preserved. As this option reduces the MFTC threshold, it will delay the MFTC/WFF abatement threshold cross over and mitigate the urgency of addressing this issue. This option will result in a reduction of $2.5 million per year for the IWTC costing. Officials prefer the proposed changes under option 3 to lower the MFTC threshold by $23 per week or $1,196 per annum. This option delays the eventual MFTC/WFF abatement threshold cross-over without making MFTC recipients worse off. The MFTC’s function to incentivise people to move off-benefit and into full time employment will also be preserved. 18 This decrease does not directly correlate to the IWTC increase due to the way main benefits abate. Regulatory Impact Statement | 22 Children in poverty (when considered as a component of a wider Tax Package) Although the rate increase occurs, we cannot predict the duration of its impact. Lifting the income of a child’s family above a threshold does not guarantee that they will no longer suffer the effects of poverty or that their income will remain above the threshold permanently. 14,000 children lifted out of AH50 poverty or 3,000 children out of BHC50 poverty Low. The impact on child poverty reduction of the increase to the IWTC by $25 per week from 31 July 2024 has not been modelled independently of the other Tax Package changes. In addition, there are significant uncertainties with TAWA modelling for poverty impacts. Increased incentive to take-up and stay in employment This change will lower replacement ratios, which measure the gap between income when receiving a benefit versus income when in work. 170,000 households will have increased incentive to take-up and stay in employment. Low. Replacement ratios observe a direct transition between full-time work and benefit for families in a specific scenario. In reality, families’ employment decisions are more fluid than being directly in or out of work, and there ae a range of factors that contribute to these decisions beyond the marginal dollar return. Total monetised benefits 170,000 households will benefit from an ongoing, weekly increase in income. This assumes full take up. Average weekly increase of $16.97. High Non-monetised benefits 170,000 households will have increased incentive to take-up and stay in employment.

To progress this change through Budget 2024, and include it in Budget night legislation, ad hoc notices of entitlement are required to be sent to WFF customers. Usually, notices of entitlement are sent out in February, during Inland Revenue’s standard WFF rollover process. This could cause confusion for these impacted customers, who already have a high customer contact rate with Inland Revenue due to their reliance on WFF support. This customer contact will coincide with Inland Revenue’s busi est time of the calendar year in which it is issuing individual income tax assessments. Inland Revenue will need to undertake significant preparatory work before Budget 2024 announcements. This includes issuing communications and guidance material, as well as updating Inland Revenue’s website. As this is an extension of an existing tax credit, it is not expected to create significant implementation costs. How will the new arra ngements be monitored, evaluated, and reviewed? This proposed change adjusts the rate of the IWTC, therefore no new or additional monitoring is required. The effects of the proposed changes can be monitored using data Inland Revenue currently collects as part of administering WFF. This data includes the number of WFF recipients, the makeup of those families, the amount and type of payments made, and end of year assessment data on under and overpayments. This administrative data provides descriptive information about WFF recipients, and the actual fiscal cost to the Government of the chosen settings.
Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 presentation of a range of quantitative analysis of the key fiscal and distributional elements of the package. The key reason the assurance panel considers this RIS does not fully meet the RIS criteria is the absence of public consultation on the specific proposals/options beyond discussions with private sector software providers and payroll service providers. Although the pre-election policies of all the parties forming the current Government included tax cuts, the specific proposals that are the subject of this RIS have not been formally consulted on. However, the Panel does acknowledge the limitations associated with the Budget-sensitive nature of these proposals. Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 Section 1: Diagnosi ng the policy proble m W h a t i s t h e c o n t e x t b e h i n d t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m a n d h o w i s t h e st a t u s q u o e x p e c t e d t o d e v e l o p? 1. New Zealand’s progressive personal income tax (PIT) system means individuals pay higher marginal tax rates as their incomes rise above certain income thresholds. When prices and incomes rise from generalised inflation and wage growth, but nominal income tax thresholds remain unchanged, individuals end up paying a larger proportion of their income in tax. 2. The structure of the PIT system was most recently changed in 2021, with the introduction of a 39% rate for income over $180,000. All other rates and thresholds have been in place since 1 October 2010. Personal incomes have risen since that time, leading to higher average tax rates on personal income. The current rates and thresholds are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Current personal income tax rates For each dollar of income Tax rate Up to $14,000 10.5% Over $14,000 and up to $48,000 17.5% Over $48,000 and up to $70,000 30% Over $70,000 and up to $180,000 33% Over $180,000 39% 3. This phenomenon of rising incomes and fixed tax thresholds, known as “fiscal drag”, increases the amount of PIT revenue collected and has been a significant means by which governments have addressed growing fiscal pressures since 2010. 4. Since 1 October 2010 (the last time personal income tax thresholds were adjusted) the most significant impact from fiscal drag has been on individuals whose incomes had just crossed the $48,000 threshold at the time (assuming their incomes have continued to grow in line with average wage growth). This is because of the steep increase in their marginal tax rate from 17.5% to 30%. 5. The median full-time wage and salary worker earned $48,024 in the year ended June 2011 and paid $7,427 in personal income tax. In the year ended June 2023, the median full-time wage and salary worker earned $73,417 and paid $15,148 in personal income tax. Owing to the effect of fiscal drag, their average tax rate (the total tax paid per dollar of income) increased by 5.1 percentage points from 15.5% to 20.6% between 2011 - 2023. Their marginal tax rate also increased from 30% to 33%. 6. To completely offset the impact of fiscal drag for the median earner, personal income tax thresholds would have to be lifted by the same proportion that the median wage has increased, i.e., by 53%. This would substantially reduce the revenue collected by the personal income tax system and would likely not be a fiscally sustainable option. 7. If adjustments to PIT thresholds are not made, fiscal drag is projected to continue in the future as incomes continue to grow. In the 2024 Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update, average wages were forecast to increase by 16.6% between 2024 and 2028. 8. As more earners move into the higher tax brackets, there is a broad flattening in the taxation of incomes and the progressivity of the PIT system decreases. With the increase in the minimum wage to $23.15 per hour from 1 April 2024, a minimum-wage earner working 40 hours per week will earn $48,284 per year. This means that under Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 current settings, all full-time earners will have a marginal tax rate (the rate they pay on an additional dollar of income) of 30% or more and the most progressive stages of the personal tax system will be below the level of the full-time minimum wage. 9. Similar impacts can be seen for tax credits that have fixed income thresholds where credits start to abate. The Independent Earner Tax Credit (IETC) was introduced in 2009 to provide a targeted tax reduction of up to $520 per year to earners between $24,000 and $48,000 who do not receive other transfer payments. The IETC abates at a rate of 13 cents for every dollar earned over $44,000 and fully abates at $48,000. These abatement thresholds have not been adjusted in the 15 years since the IETC was introduced, meaning the target population has changed significantly. 10. For example, a full-time worker on the minimum wage in 2009 earned around $26,000 and would have received the full IETC payment assuming they met other eligibility requirements. In 2024, an individual working 40 hours per week on the minimum wage would earn just over the income limit of $48,000 and would not receive the IETC. W h a t i s t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m o r o p p o r t u n i t y? 11. As described above, fiscal drag has the potential to erode the progressivity of the personal income tax system and has other impacts that may not align with Government objectives: • The increase in annual tax liability from fiscal drag is uneven across income levels, with the greatest impact occurring as the $48,000 income threshold is crossed. Full-time minimum wage earners will therefore be heavily affected in coming years. • The average rate of tax on total personal income increases over time, reducing economic efficiency as people’s decisions are more heavily impacted by tax. • The increase in tax from fiscal drag is arguably less transparent than explicit changes to tax settings and may engender less public debate. • When inflation exceeds wage growth, people’s tax burden increases even as their ability to pay for goods and services decreases. 12. The desired level of progressivity in the PIT system is a judgement for ministers to make. Any decision to address fiscal drag by adjusting PIT thresholds will also depend on the revenue needs of the Government and their economic goals. W h a t o b j e c t i v e s a r e s o u g h t i n r e l a t i o n t o t he p o l i c y p r o b l e m ? 13. In the National-ACT coalition agreement, a commitment was made to: “Ensure the concepts of ACT’s income tax policy are considered as a pathway to delivering National’s promised tax relief, subject to no earner being worse off than they would be under National’s plan.” 14. Both the National Party and the ACT Party announced plans for PIT relief during the 2023 general election, with the stated objectives as summarised in Table 2. 15. The New Zealand First Party also campaigned on tax relief in response to fiscal drag, and a commitment was made in the National-New Zealand First coalition agreement to, “by or before 2026, assess the impact inflation has had on the average tax rates faced by income earners.” Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 29. Fiscal impact: All options significantly reduce tax revenue over the forecast period (OFP). This policy analysis was prepared in the context of the Government’s intention to fund this package from within Budget 2024 allowances, which was advised by the Treasury in its Briefing to the Incoming Minister of Finance in 2023 and is consistent with the objective of fiscal sustainability. Therefore, these packages would be considered fiscally sustainable when looked at in the wider context of the Budget decisions they are being taken in – as long as they are not so costly that it would no longer be possible to fund within allowances. However, the Treasury has advised the Government to reduce the cost of Budget 2024, and where possible to support a return to surplus. Whilst all the plans would therefore be viewed as fiscally sustainable in theory, there was a difference in cost, which may impact the feasibility of funding some of the plans within Budget 2024 allowances, and consistency with the goal of returning to surplus: • Option 3 has the largest impact of at least $15 billion OFP ($6.1 billion in 2027/28). • Option 2 and Option 4 have impacts of around $10-11 billion OFP ($2.8 billion in 2027/28). • Options 5a, 5b and 5c have the smallest impact of around $8-9 billion OFP ($2.2 - $2.3 billion in 2027/28). • The two variations on Option 3 cost around $6 billion (3a) and $12 billion (3b) OFP, and $1.8 billion (3a) and $5.0 billion (3b) in 2027/28. 30. Efficiency: Personal income tax has a negative impact on economic efficiency to the extent that it affects people’s income earning decisions (in other words, distorting behaviour). All options would be expected to have positive impacts on efficiency by reducing the amount of tax levied on personal income, thereby decreasing distortions to work, investment and savings decisions. The removal of the 39% rate in Option 3 would have a relatively larger impact per dollar of fiscal cost, but the limited population affected would mitigate the aggregate benefits. For those already in work, the decision to work more or fewer hours can be influenced by effective marginal tax rates (EMTR – the fraction of each additional dollar earned that is lost to tax and reduced transfers). Changes that significantly reduce effective marginal tax rates would be expected to enhance incentives to work additional hours and may also encourage workers to increase their wage prospects by upskilling. This could have positive implications for overall labour supply and the productive capacity of the economy. Other factors will also contribute to a person’s decision to work, however, so it is uncertain whether they will respond to increased incentives, and we have not formally modelled the impact of the options on overall labour supply. Annex 1 contains analysis of the impact of the options on EMTRs. The expansion of the IETC will have opposing impacts on financial returns from work. While it will increase overall returns for earners between $44,000 - $70,000, it will also have a negative impact on marginal returns for earners between $66,000 - $70,000, which may reduce their incentive to work additional hours. It is therefore likely that this objective could be achieved more effectively by removing the IETC and making other changes to tax and transfer settings for the same fiscal cost. 31. Distributional impacts: Each option has different distributional impacts, with Options 3 and 4 being more targeted to reducing tax for higher-income earners, and Options 2 and 5 being more targeted to middle-income earners and those impacted by fiscal drag. As the desirability of a particular income distribution is a judgement for ministers, officials do not comment on whether an option is preferable regarding distributional impacts. Annex 2 contains analysis of the distributional impacts of the options. Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 Option 2 is most directly targeted towards addressing fiscal drag, as it makes proportional increases to all of the PIT thresholds that were in place in 2010, thus achieving the exact opposite effect as fiscal drag. The PIT threshold adjustments in Option 2 would reduce the annual tax liability of someone earning the 2023 median full- time wage ($73,417) by $902, reducing their average tax rate by 1.2 percentage points to 19.4%. This compensates for around one quarter of the average tax rate increase from fiscal drag since 2011. The expansion of the IETC would not benefit these earners as they will earn above the new threshold. Fully compensating for the accumulated fiscal drag since 2011 would therefore require an adjustment to PIT thresholds around four times larger than the adjustments in Option 2, which would likely increase the cost by a similar proportion. This would not be a fiscally sustainable option without substantial changes to government spending and/or revenue in other areas. Adjustments to personal income tax thresholds will have flow-on impacts to other components of the tax and transfer system: a. New Zealand Superannuation rates will increase due to both the direct impact of the PIT threshold adjustments and the indirect impact of being tied to the net average wage. b. Student allowances will increase as the rates are set gross in legislation. c. Main benefits will be unaffected by the tax changes as the rates are set net of tax in legislation. 32. Integrity: The revenue-raising capability of the personal income tax system depends on taxpayer compliance, which may be influenced by people’s perceptions of the fairness of the tax system. To the extent adjustments to tax thresholds in response to fiscal drag improve perceptions of fairness, we would expect some small positive impacts on compliance from Options 2 and 5. Option 3 would also be expected to improve integrity by reducing the gap between the company tax rate and the top personal tax rate, thereby reducing incentives for tax avoidance. 33. Macroeconomic impacts: Treasury modelling shows that tax relief funded through an increase in government debt is expected to put some upward pressure on inflation and therefore interest rates. However, if tax relief is funded through an equivalent decrease in government spending, then the overall effect is a slight decrease in modelled interest rates. This is because the “fiscal multiplier” for tax relief is assumed to be lower than for government spending, meaning the decrease in government spending more than offsets the increase in spending by recipients of tax relief. To the extent that tax relief is funded within Budget 2024 operating allowances, a slight decrease in inflation pressures and therefore slightly lower interest rates would be expected. 34. Administrative and compliance costs: Options 2 and 5 are relatively simple changes to the PIT system and would have minimal impacts on administrative and compliance costs. However, implementation in the middle of the tax year would place one-off costs on Inland Revenue, employers and third-party payroll providers. Option 4 would be more complex owing to the changes in marginal tax rates. Option 3 would be the most complex change owing to the introduction of the tax offset (a tax credit paid out at the time of taxation); effectively compensating for the higher bottom marginal tax rate. Introducing the offset would create substantial costs for private and public sector payroll providers and Inland Revenue. For taxpayers, the offset would likely lead to more end-of-year tax bills and place additional burden on those who have more than one source of income and the income from the secondary source occurs in the abatement zone for the tax offset. Those with a second job would Regulatory Impact Statement | 13 have to apply for tailored tax codes each year as the abatement zone is not reflected in the secondary tax codes. 35. Other government commitments: The ACT-National Coalition Agreement made a commitment to no earner being worse off than they would be under National’s plan (Option 2). Option 3 – the ACT manifesto plan – did not meet this test, even with the use of a tax offset to compensate for the higher bottom tax rate. Variations on this plan – Options 3a and 3b – were developed in order to meet this test, but the use of the tax offset in these plans was considered to be a complex change that contradicted the aim of simplifying the tax system. Options 4, 5a, 5b and 5c also did not meet this test, although to a lesser degree than Option 3. In general, it would not be possible to deliver greater tax relief at some parts of the income spectrum compared to Option 2, while also ensuring no earner is worse off, without increasing the fiscal cost compared to Option 2. 36. Overall assessment: Options 2 and 5 are considered to be positive changes overall. They go some way to addressing the impacts of fiscal drag and have minimal negative consequences apart from the large fiscal cost. Insofar as ministers are willing to trade off the fiscal cost to meet their other objectives and can manage the cost within Budget allowances, officials support these options. Option 4 may also be supported if ministers were more focused on the goal of flattening the PIT system by reducing the number of thresholds and rates, noting that some low-income households would be made significantly worse off. However, officials do not support Option 3 as it would create significant additional compliance costs and it is unlikely that the fiscal cost could be managed within Budget allowances without making large sacrifices to other Government priorities. W h a t o p t i on i s l i k e l y t o b e s t a d d r e s s t h e p r o b l e m , m e e t t h e p o l i c y o b j e c t i v e s , a n d d e l i v e r t h e h i g h e s t n e t b e n e f i t s? 37. Option 2 effectively addresses the policy problem of fiscal drag while having minimal negative consequences on other policy objectives, except for the large fiscal cost. The cost could be reduced through the alternatives in Option 5. Option 3 delivers larger efficiency gains but at a much larger fiscal cost, while also producing significant administrative effort and causing some earners to be worse off than under Option 2. Officials therefore support the broad approach in Option 2 (the National manifesto plan), with the following further recommendations: a. consider cost-saving alternatives (Option 5) to support a return to surplus, b. delay implementation to 1 October 2024 to reduce the fiscal cost, minimise administrative demands for Inland Revenue and ensure all taxpayers receive the benefit of the tax changes on time, c. do not proceed with the proposed IETC expansion. The longstanding view of officials has been that the objective of improving work incentives could be achieved more effectively by removing the IETC and making other changes to tax and transfer settings for the same fiscal cost. See T2017/164: Removing the Independent Earner Tax Credit 2 for further discussion of the IETC, and d. prevent the tax changes flowing through to student allowances. Alignment with the benefit system is a principle of the student support system, and since main benefits will not increase from the tax changes, the same approach should be taken for student allowance. 2 https://www.treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2017-11/b17-3659148.pdf Regulatory Impact Statement | 16 43. The changes to RWT will also be made on 31 July 2024. The changes are increasing the income thresholds for the various personal tax rates, but they are not changing the rates themselves. While payers of resident withholding income will need to update their information on RWT and some recipients may need to adjust their selected RWT rates, there should be no changes to the actual withholding system that RWT payers use. In addition, if people are using the incorrect RWT rate, any under or overpayment can be corrected as part of the end of year tax assessment process that Inland Revenue runs. 44. The other consequential tax types including), PIE tax, FBT, ESCT and RSCT will be adjusted from the beginning of the next tax year (1 April 2025). This will allow more time to make the changes and reduce the complexity of the changes. This will in turn reduce compliance costs for employers. The trade-off for this is that investors and employees will receive the benefit of the changes from a later date, and this will be a permanent difference. Third parties 45. Third parties such as payroll software providers and payroll service providers will need to make changes to their systems and their software to implement the personal income tax changes. Officials consulted with private sector software providers and payroll service providers to understand the timeframes needed to make changes. The time required is dependent on the level of complexity of the changes. 46. Ideally, payroll software providers would be given 3 months’ notice of upcoming changes. This is based on a timeframe of 6 weeks to complete and test the changes before providing the software to their clients 6 weeks before the implementation date. This is because clients need to load information for pay runs into their system before they make the payments. Some pay information can be input as much as a month before the pay run and as such the new software would need to be in place for this information to be processed correctly. 47. Shortening this timeframe to 2 months would likely mean clients would receive the software 2 weeks before implementation, instead of 6 weeks. This would likely mean some employees would have their tax calculated under status quo thresholds for a payment after the implementation date. However, this could be corrected in subsequent pay periods, or the difference picked up in the end of year tax assessment process. 48. Similarly, payroll service providers would ideally be given 3 months’ notice of upcoming changes to the Pay as You Earn (PAYE) rules. Shortening this timeframe to 2 will increase the likelihood of errors. However, these could be corrected in subsequent pay periods, or the difference picked up in the end of year tax assessment process. 49. Some public sector organisations with specific payment challenges will need longer to implement the changes due to the special characteristics of the payments they make (i.e., this is not relevant to their standard departmental payroll functions). These include the payments made by the Ministry of Social Development (benefits, allowances and pension systems); Accident Compensation Corporation (compensation system) and the Ministry of Health (doctors and nurses payroll systems). 50. The identified organisations make payments that are subject to PAYE to a significant number of beneficiaries, superannuitants, compensation claimants and the health workforce. If they are unable to update their payment systems in time, incorrect Regulatory Impact Statement | 17 amounts of tax will be deducted, and the recipients (other than beneficiaries) will be likely to receive less of their payments than they are entitled to. 51. These organisations could be given advance notice, prior to Budget Day, on a Budget Secret basis, or errors could be addressed by Inland Revenue during the end of year tax assessment process. The Ministry of Social Development have provided initial indications that approximately three months lead in time (from the Cabinet decision) will be required for it to progress the necessary IT, legislative and operational changes in time; the Accident Compensation Corporation would need 8-13 weeks; and Health New Zealand would need approximately 4 months. Implementation date 52. In 2010 (the last time thresholds were increased), 1 October was the date chosen in order to allow sufficient time for implementation as detailed. Officials have recommended the same date is chosen for these changes. A shorter delivery window is possible, but brings a higher likelihood of increased errors, which in turn will create an increased workload for Inland Revenue during the end of year tax assessment process. 53. The Cabinet Paper recommends progressing the PIT changes from 31 July 2024. With the changes being announced on Budget Day (30 May), this will allow approximately two months for third parties such as payroll software providers and payroll service providers to implement the changes. As noted above, these third parties would ideally be given 3 months’ notice of upcoming changes. 54. Despite this shortened timeframe, we would generally expect most employers to be able to pay their employees under the updated tax scales from 31 July. There are likely to be some exceptions and some incorrect calculations, but these are able to be corrected in subsequent pay runs or as part of the end of year tax assessment process completed by Inland Revenue. Legislative change 55. The tax changes will be included in Budget night legislation. H o w w i l l t h e n e w a r r a n g e m e n t s b e mo n i t o red, ev a l u a ted, a n d re v i e wed? 56. Inland Revenue will continue to monitor the tax system in a range of ways to maintain the integrity of the tax system. Inland Revenue also regularly reports to the Government on the amount of tax being collected. It is not anticipated that any additional monitoring, evaluation or review above that which already occurs will be required as a result of the proposed changes. Regulatory Impact Statement | 18 Annex 1: I mpac t of Opti on 2 on effective margi nal tax rates Treasury modelling can estimate the distribution of EMTRs for the New Zealand population. Table 6 shows the number and characteristics of people who we estimate will experience a change in EMTRs from Option 2 in the year ending 31 March 2027. This analysis was only completed for Option 2 as this was the main option being considered at this stage in the advice process. It is important to note that not all people with income within the income tax ranges in Table 6 would experience the impacts shown – it will be dependent on their receipt of any benefits or tax credits, as well as the design of the final tax package. The personal income tax threshold changes and extending the income range of the Independent Earner Tax Credit reduce EMTRs for 335,000 people (positive impact on work incentives) and increase EMTRs for 85,000 people (negative impact on work incentives). Adding the proposed family-based tax credit changes (the In-Work Tax Credit and FamilyBoost) increases the EMTRs for a further 45,000 people (negative impact on work incentives). These people are in coupled families with children, and are spread across the first 4 income tax bands ($0 to $180,000). Modelling did not indicate an increase in EMTRs for sole parents. These tax credits increase people’s EMTRs because of the way the credits abate as incomes grow. Although people’s income is increased by the credits, their EMTR also increases as they cross the abatement threshold and their payment reduces with each extra dollar of income. This negatively impacts their incentive to work. The proposed changes impact abatement in different ways: a. The increase to the In-Work Tax Credit by $25 per week means the payment will take longer to abate to zero, as the abatement rate is constant. This means some people whose payment would otherwise have fully abated will now receive an abating payment. b. As FamilyBoost is a new credit, people who receive it and whose family income is within the abatement range ($140,000 to $180,000) will have an increased EMTR because of the abatement of the credit. Regulatory Impact Statement | 20 Annex 2: Distri butional analys is of options Option 2 Officials provided distributional analysis of the PIT threshold and IETC changes in Option 2 in combination with other tax and transfer policies included in Budget 2024. These included the $25 per week increase to the In-Work Tax Credit (IWTC) and the introduction of the FamilyBoost policy, which gives parents a rebate of up to $75 per week for money spent on early childhood education fees. These four policies together are referred to as “the package”. Distributional analysis provided in advice was based on economic forecasts from the 2023 Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update, and household data from the 2021 Household Economic Survey (HES). The Cabinet Paper includes distributional analysis based on the latest available economic forecasts and household data (i.e., 2024 Budget Economic and Fiscal Update forecasts and 2023 HES data). The distributional analysis in this Regulatory Impact Statement therefore differs slightly from what is in the Cabinet Paper. Overall, the package increases the income of 93% of households 3 by $30 per week 4 on average. Households with children gain by $39 per week on average. A small number of households (0.5% of all households) have their income reduced from the package by $1 per week on average, due to an unintended interaction with the tax threshold adjustments and the calculation of part-year benefit payments. 135,000 households (7%) are unaffected. Many of these will be receiving main benefits and have no change because benefit rates are set in after-tax terms. Household impacts are in comparison to household incomes at the same point in time (the year ending 31 March 2027) if the policy change was not made. Gains and losses do not indicate whether a household is better or worse off compared to the previous year, but only how their projected income in 2027 with the policy change compares to their projected income in 2027 without the policy change. Figure 1 shows the weekly impact of the package on household incomes, grouped by equivalised income quintiles. 5 The number of households in each quintile who have their income increased or reduced is also shown (e.g., 394,000 households in the third quintile have their income increased by $32 per week on average). Only households in the first quintile have their income reduced, by $1 per week on average. These are households who receive main benefit income for only part of the year, and receive a slight reduction in benefit income due to an unintended interaction with the tax threshold adjustments and the calculation of part-year benefit payments. It is unlikely this could be avoided by designing the package differently. The first quintile contains the smallest number of gaining households (290,000). Most of the households unaffected by the package are in the first quintile (100,000 out of 135,000). Households in the first quintile also gain by the least on average ($13 per week). This reflects the fact that people receiving main benefits, who have relatively low incomes, do not gain from the package as benefit rates are set in after-tax terms. The largest weekly gain goes to 3 Households are defined as one or more people living together in a private dwelling and sharing facilities. A household could contain more than one family, which is defined as a single person or couple and any dependent children. 4 This is a measure of change in household disposable income. Note that while we have used equivalised household income to compare groups, the average gains and losses are not adjusted for household size or composition. 5 Income equivalisation accounts for different household compositions (e.g., the number of adults and children) to allow for like-for-like comparisons across households. Two households with different compositions (e.g., a single person compared to a couple with two children) need different levels of income to meet the same standard of living. Equivalisation attempts to account for the additional income needed to support more people and also economies of scale due to shared housing costs, utilities, etc. Regulatory Impact Statement | 21 the fifth quintile, reflecting the fact that the maximum gain from the PIT threshold adjustments occurs at a relatively high individual income level ($78,100). Figure 1: Impact on household incomes by equivalised income quintile Officials also provided analysis of how each individual component of the package impacts household incomes. The individual package components impact households as follows: i. The PIT threshold changes increase net incomes for 1.831 million households (93% of all households) by an average of $25 per week. These changes will also reduce net incomes for a further 9,000 households (0.5% of all households) by an average of $1 per week due to an unintended interaction with the personal income tax threshold adjustments and the way part-year benefit payments are calculated. ii. The IWTC increase increases net incomes for 160,000 households (8% of all households; 25% of households with children), including around 4,000 households that do not gain from the PIT threshold changes, by an average of $20 per week. iii. The IETC expansion increases net incomes for 381,000 households (19% of all households) by an average of $10 per week. iv. FamilyBoost increases net incomes for 80,000 households (4% of all households and 12% of households with children) by an average of $34 per week. The majority of these households are in the bottom half of the equivalised income distribution, and the lowest earning households gain by the most on average. Individual-level analysis shows the impacts of the package by demographic group. Note that this analysis was developed later in the process and is based on the latest available economic forecasts and household data (i.e., 2024 Budget Economic and Fiscal Update forecasts and 2023 HES data). Compared to the overall population, relatively fewer Māori, Pacific Peoples and women benefit from the package. Overall, 83% of individuals gain by an average of $16 per week. This compares to 74% of Māori gaining, 73% for Pacific Peoples, and 81% for women. Average gains for Māori and Pacific Peoples are equal to the overall population, while women gain by slightly less ($15 per week on average) due to lower incomes. By contrast, almost all seniors benefit from the changes (97%) due to the near-universal receipt of NZ Super, but by a smaller amount ($13 per week).

document combines both the risk strategy, which describes Inland Revenue (IR)’s overall approach to managing risks, and the risk management plan which describes how risks and issues are managed within the B usiness Transformation Programme (BT). The purpose of this document is to support effective risk and issue management. This document supports the Programme Management Plan (PMP) that defines the baseline for the Programme. The Programme’s risk management framework is aligned to IR’s Enterprise Risk Management Policy and Framework, which took effect from May 2014 (Policy scheduled for review in May 2021). 2 BT Risk Strategy 2.1 Introduction IR contributes to the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealand. Its role is to provide high- quality tax and social policy services to the Government and all New Zealanders. IR works with customers and other organisations to make compliance easy and to give New Zealanders confidence that everyone pays and receives the right amount. IR’s vision is to be a world-class revenue organisation, recognised for service and excellence. IR’s Business Transformation Programme aims to deliver this vision and will build the capabilities required to deliver the goals set out in IR for the Future. Risk is inherent in any programme. All projects have some degree of uncertainty due to the assumptions associated with them and the environment in which they are executed. The risk management approach recognises that change initiatives of any size, but particularly major transformation programmes are high-risk undertakings; and that a focused effort is required to ensure effective and successful delivery of the Programme and associated business benefits. It is recognised that Programme risks cannot be eliminated entirely, but many of them can be anticipated and reduced. The overall goal of undertaking risk management is to maximise the probability of achieving success within the baselined scope, schedule and resources. Likewise, risk management practices are designed to support decision-making within the Programme by providing integrated risk and consequence assessments throughout the Programme lifecycle. 2.2 Programme’s Risk Rating Risk Rating from Risk Profile Assessment (RPA) High Overall the Programme is considered to be inherently high risk. Accordingly, considerable emphasis has been placed on developing the capabilities required to manage and mitigate risks and issues. The Programme’s management of risk has been recognised as “an exemplar” in the last six Gateway reviews ( most recently in March 2020). The Programme’s current risks profile can be found here: Programme Risk Meeting Dashboard Page 7 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 2.3 Programme’s Risk Management Framework Risk management is the considered management response to possible future events. The risk management process is the systemic and structured practice to identify, assess and respond to risks. At a strategic level, the Programme’s risk management framework is aligned to IR Enterprise Risk Management Policy and Framework (ERMF). To maintain this alignment, the Programme: • has adopted and applied the ERMF. This includes the Risk Management Process as described by ISO 31000:2009 (refer to Figure 1 below) and ISO Guide 73:2009 to identify, assess, mitigate, monitor and report on risks • uses the CR&A Enterprise and Project Risk Rating Tools to assess risks and issues at Programme, Stage / Sub-Programme and workstream-levels (refer to Appendices A -E) • describes the risk and issue activities undertaken by the Programme in the Risk Management Plan. Figure 1 - The risk management process Page 8 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 2.4 Quality Management Quality is a key aspect to ensuring the artefacts produced by a Programme are of a high quality and meet the expectations of stakeholders. For Business Transformation, quality is managed on two different levels. Firstly, the Programme seeks Assurance for its stakeholders through conducting planned reviews, engaging independent quality assessments and meeting the Government Gateway requirements. Secondly, the Programme seeks internal quality control through ensuring the artefacts that are produced are of a high standard through the setting of guidelines, quality checklists and peer review. 2.4.1 Assurance Management Best practice according to Managing Successful Programmes requires that major programmes have a clear and coordinated approach towards assurance. This has been reinforced by key learning’s from major programmes of work across the public sector. The Quality Assurance Process will ensure: • There is an overall plan for implementing proactive assurance activities. • There is capacity for conducting planned and ad hoc reviews. • Ongoing Independent Quality Assurance (IQA) and internal reviews are undertaken. • Ongoing reviews of our vendors and business partners. • Gateway reviews are undertaken of the Programme. • That progress is continuously monitored by Central Monitoring Agencies (Corporate Centre). Assurance will be coordinated as part of the BT Programme Management Office (BT PMO) function and will be incorporated into regular programme planning and reporting to the Programme Leadership Team (PLT), Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC), Risk and Assurance Committee, Joint Ministers, Central Agencies and other governance groups as required. An Assurance Management Plan is in place for the Programme and is reviewed regularly. 2.5 Vendor Management The Programme undertakes effective contract management through its monthly account review meetings and partner score carding to ensure the relationships with programme suppliers are handled professionally, that consultant performance meets programme expectations and that all services are provided within an effectual contractual framework and in line with Government policy. Account Review Meetings are held monthly to manage the Programme’s commercial arrangements and relationships with key service providers. These meetings cover engagement effectiveness, cost management, schedule attainment and delivery performance, scope and change management, team performance, risk and issues management, delivery assurance and administration and compliance. The meetings also review the status of commercial activities (acceptances, change requests and invoicing), budget forecasts and actuals and resource planning and changes. Page 9 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The Deputy Commissioner (DC) Transformation is accountable for the management of third- party suppliers through the Head of Commercial and Procurement. Vendors are required to comply with the processes and standards set out in this Risk Management Plan and the Programme Management Plan. Page 10 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3 BT Risk Management Plan The purpose of this BT Risk Management Plan is to describe the specific management activities that will be undertaken to support the execution of the Programme’s Risk Strategy. Specifically, it sets out: • the approach to be used for identifying, reviewing and managing risks and issues at Programme, Release / Stage / Sub-Programme and workstream levels. • the roles and responsibilities for risk and issue management within the Programme • the reporting process. This risk and issue management process has been established to ensure that: • a robust risk and issue identification process is carried out as part of Programme planning, with an acceptable level of “due diligence” applied • pr ocesses are in place for risks and issues to be analysed, monitored/controlled and managed on a regular basis • relevant risk and issue information is reported by all workstreams within the Programme, and as appropriate to the Programme’s governing bodies • risks and issues are prioritised and reported at the correct level for decision-making in a timely manner • there is active debate and analysis of risk and issue information at Programme governance and executive management levels. 4 Defining Risks and Issues 4.1 Definition of a risk and an issue Risk: Something that may happen in the future which could impact on objectives if it occurred Issue: Something that has already happened and is impacting on objectives 4.1.1 Statement The risk and issue statement is a clear articulation of four key elements: Part of the definition Description There is a risk/issue .... The risk/issue description should be clear, succinct an d precise. The triggers are: • \[trigger 1\] • \[trigger 2\] ... The trigger describes the causes of the risk/issue. The consequences are: • \[consequence 1\] • \[consequence 2\] ... The consequence describes the impact of the risk/issue event. Page 11 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Part of the definition Description Risk linked to the milestones: • \[deliverable name\] – \[date\] • \[key event name\] – \[date\] ... Or, for an issue: The issue must be resolved by: \[key event name\] – \[date\] ... Each risk is linked to one or more milestones to show when the risk may eventuate as an issue. The risk proximity can be a specific event, milestone from the schedule, or it can be identified as “on-going” if it can happen at any time during the life of the current release. Each issue is linked to a single milestone by when the issue must be resolved. 4.1.2 Proximity The risk/issue proximity is the date linked to the next milestones described in the statement. This date reflects when it is assumed that the risk may eventuate as an issue, or when the issue must be resolved. The mitigations developed (i.e. closed or open/in-progress) should have their completion due date prior to the proximity date. It is the mitigation owner’s responsibility, in conjunction with the risk/issue owner, to track mitigations to completion. 4.1.3 Category Each risk/issue is assigned to a category as described in IR’s ERMP/F. The Enterprise risk categories are applied to risks/issues classified at Programme and Sub- Programme level, and the Project risk categories are used for a workstream risk/issue. 4.1.4 Closed Mitigation A closed mitigation is an existing policy, process, device, practice or other action that is in place to reduce a risk occurring or to reduce the impact of the issue. 4.1.5 Open or In-Progress Mitigation Open or in-progress mitigations are the set of options that may mitigate or resolve a risk/issue if implemented. An open or in progress mitigation should be an “actionable” plan that can be effectively translated into formal action items and to which ownership for execution can be assigned. 4.2 Specific definitions for a risk or an issue For the purposes of this framework, the following definitions are used to define a risk or an issue: 4.2.1 Risk levels Three levels of risk will be assessed for each risk: 1. Inherent risk level: Level of risk without any mitigations in place. 2. Current risk level: Level of risk with mitigations already in place. Page 12 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3. Residual (or Target) risk level: Predicted level of risk once all current and planned mitigations are implemented. 4.2.2 Risk Assessment Two dimensions will be assessed for each risk: Likelihood (Probability) and Consequence (Impact). 1. Likelihood: Probability of the risk happening. Refer to the Likelihood Matrix definition as presented in Appendix B. 2. Consequence: Impact of the risk happening. To assess the consequence of a risk at either Programme or Release / Stage / Sub-Programme levels, refer to the Enterprise Consequence Assessment Matrix as presented in Appendix C. To assess the consequence of a risk at workstream level, refer to the Project Consequence Assessment Matrix as presented in Appendix D. 4.2.3 Risk Matrix All risks use the ERMF risk assessment matrix as presented in Appendix A, B, C and D . The matrix considers both likelihood and consequence, to provide an overall risk rating. 4.2.4 Risk/Issue Levels in JIRA BT has the following levels to place to manage risks and issues in JIRA: • Programme: R isk s and issues at Programme-level can either impact “all of the Programme” or impact a Major Release’s delivery and requires the Programme Leadership’s attention (e.g. at Programme Risk Meetings), to mitigate or accept. In JIRA, Programme level risks can either be classified as “PLT” or “PGC”. Refer Section 5.2 for further guidance on reporting of PLT and PGC risks. • Release / Stage / Sub-Programme: At this level, a workstream cannot self-manage its risks and issues (e.g. a deliverable cannot be met) and requires the support of the Release / Stage / Sub-Programme to help manage. • Workstream: At this level, a workstream can manage its risks and issues without requiring the support at Release / Stage level. 4.2.5 Responding to a risk The Risk Owner 1 has four options for the risk, these are: Avoid: This is when the Risk Owner decides that to continue with the activity is too great a risk to their business delivery. In these instances, the Risk Owner is required to formally state why the activity is to be avoided. This may require wider organisational endorsement. Tolerate: This is when the Risk Owner decides that the existing mitigations are sufficient or effective. The need to introduce any further mitigations is either not cost effective, not proportionate to the consequences of the risk itself, or contingencies can be employed if the risk is realised to meet the business appetite to manage any resulting issues. Consideration must be given to the consequences of not mitigating the risk further. Treat: This is when the Risk Owner decides that further actions are necessary to reduce the likelihood of the event occurring or reduce the impact if it occurs. Mitigations are then 1 Refer to section 8, Roles and Responsibilities Page 13 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] identified and progressed. Factors affecting a decision to further mitigate a risk will include costs, resources, practicality, existing methods used, etc. Consideration must be given to the consequences of mitigating the risk further. Transfer: This is where the Risk Owner decides that the risk is better managed by another entity. This can be anything from another business unit or group, an external provider such as an insurance company or IT provider, or storage and building specialists. This may require wider organisational endorsement and involvement. In choosing to transfer a risk the balance between cost and practicality is a key factor. In some instances, IR may already be using providers both within and outside IR that are providing specialist services. This will introduce new risks relating to service delivery as a result of the dependence on external providers. 4.2.6 Issue rating The issue rating will be based on the analysis of the impacts and the determination of the level of consequences as described in the ERMF. The overall rating of the issue is: 1. Low - Any impact which is assessed as Minimal within the relevant Consequence Matrix. 2. Medium - Any impact which is assessed as Minor within the relevant Consequence Matrix. 3. High - Any impact which is assessed as Moderate within the relevant Consequence Matrix. 4. Very High – Any impact which is assessed as Major within the relevant Consequence Matrix 5. Extreme - Any impact which is assessed as Severe within the relevant Consequence Matrix. Note: For Programme, Sub-Programme and/or Release level issues, use the consequence matrix within the Enterprise Risk Rating Tool ( Refer Appendix C). For workstream-level issues, use the consequence matrix within the Project Risk Rating Tool (refer Appendix D). 5 Risk and issue management processes 5.1 Identification A variety of methods will be used to identify and evaluate risks and issues. These will include meetings, interviews, brainstorming, workshops, and discussions at Programme Risk Meetings (PRM), with the PLT, BT PMO, workstream teams, business, or other stakeholders. The Programme will continuously and proactively assess critical areas identified to determine specific risks and issues, analyse their potential impacts, determine mitigation actions, and monitor them. To help with the risk and issue identification process, the following sources of information should be referred to: • audit and internal assurance recommendations (e.g. prior independent quality assurance recommendations) • Programme plans and scope documents Page 14 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Lessons learned from prior BT releases/stages • existing issues in JIRA • exis ting risks in JIRA • risk prompts as presented in the ERMF. After initial identification, management and mitigation is managed through regular meetings, and monitoring at the various levels of the Programme. 5.2 Reporting path to PRM and PGC (or higher) Risks and issues should be reported up when one or more of the following criteria apply: Reporting up of Risks / Issues to Programme /PRM Reporting up of Programme Risks / Issues to PGC (or Higher) For a risk • risks are systemic (across more than one workstream and impact a major START Release/Stage) • risks rated as Extreme at residual level • risks stop a deliverable impacting the critical path from being met • risks have the following themes: o on -going resource constraints o serious customer, business or external stakeholder impact o legislative implications o public perception/media implications. • The current risk level of a Programme risk is assessed at Extreme, are to be reported to the Performance and Investment Committee (PIC) and Commissioner Inland Revenue (CIR). • Programme risks confirmed by PRM members as “Major” for ongoing monitoring purposes. For an issue • issues are systemic (across more than one workstream and impact a major START Release/Stage) • issues rated as Extreme • issues stop a deliverable impacting the critical path from being met • issues have the following themes: o on -going resource constraints o serious customer, business or external stakeholder impact o legislative implications o public perception/media implications. • issues at workstream or Release/ Stage level that are already monitored at Programme-level and identified to be merged or for closure • Programme issues rated as Extreme to be reported to PIC and CIR • All Programme issues to be reported to PGC Page 15 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Reporting up of Risks / Issues to Programme /PRM Reporting up of Programme Risks / Issues to PGC (or Higher) Reporting All risks and issues for reporting to the PRM are submitted via JIRA, for the BT PMO to review. The workstream Project Co-ordinators are responsible for facilitating this process and maintaining all risk and issue information below Programme level. All Programme-level risks and issues reported to PGC (or higher) are included in the PGC Programme Risk Reporting. The BT PMO is responsible for facilitating this process and supporting the Programme to maintain its Programme-level risk and issue information. The following principles should apply prior to escalating a risk or issue at Programme-level: • all risks and issues should be accepted by the risk owner in JIRA as active risks or issues. • before escalating a risk or issue to the PRM, discuss the risk or issue proposed with the relevant representative in the BT PMO. It is possible that it could already be reflected within the existing Programme-level risks and issues captured in JIRA. • Ensure that the respective risk owner has a good understanding of the risk or issue they will be presenting to P RM. Note: Once the PRM has accepted the risk/issue it becomes a Programme-level risk/issue. There should be no duplication of risks or issues between the Programme and the workstream. 5.3 Closure The BT PMO will report to PRM where Programme risks or issues are proposed for closure when the owner confirms in JIRA that the risk event will no longer occur / the issue has been resolved. Once the closure of a Programme risk or an issue is agreed by PRM, it will be reflected in JIRA to ensure that the Programme’s profile is up to date and consistently reported. All other risks and issues below Programme level, must be approved for closure by the relevant owner in JIRA. 6 Risk and issue monitoring Risks and issues do not remain static therefore ongoing monitoring and management will be required throughout the Programme lifecycle. This monitoring ensures that the Programme’s risks and issues are being effectively managed. Page 16 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6.1 Monitoring process The following table describes the monitoring tasks required at regular intervals: Role Frequency Activities Workstream Leads Monthly Workstream Leads (with support from Project Co- ordinators) to review and update their assigned risks in JIRA. As Required Workstream Leads (with support from Project Co- ordinators) report changes to Programme risks and issues (i.e. new, changed, for closure) to the BT PMO. BT PMO to facilitate owner endorsed Programme risk/issue changes to the PRM, for acceptance BT PMO Monthly The BT PMO will meet with Programme risk owners to review and update their Programme risks, issues and supporting mitigations. BT PMO update the details in JIRA to reflect the confirmed changes. Monthly BT PMO reports to PGC changes to the Programme’s risk and issue profile (new, changed, and closed) during the month, as approved by PRM, in the PGC Programme Status Report. Refer Section 7.1 Reports, for further details The Portfolio Office will receive Programme status reporting, to incorporate into their overall enterprise portfolio delivery reporting to the PGC. Monthly BT PMO provide CR&A with the Programme’s risk profile. Monthly BT PMO facilitate a review of a selection of Programme-level risks at each PRM meeting. BT PMO update the details in JIRA to reflect the confirmed changes. Quarterly BT PMO provide the Risk and Assurance Committee a quarterly update on PGC-level programme risks. Ad hoc BT PMO facilitate other risk and issue workshops as required. 6.2 Capturing of risk and issue information Risks and issues across the Programme are actively managed in JIRA (https://jira.nsp.ird.govt.nz) with a snapshot of this information being reported to various governing forums (refer section 7 Reporting below). On 13 March 2017, the Programme received permission f rom the Deputy Commissioner, Corporate Integrity and Assurance to use JIRA as the primary tool for managing Page 17 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] programme/project risks and issues, as JIRA is utilised by the Programme as a wider tactical tool to better oversee and link risks, issues and dependencies. The BT PMO provide CR&A with a list of current Programme risks and the supporting mitigations, as well as information on PGC tagged Programme-level risks as part of Risk and Assurance Committee reporting. The Programme-level risk and issue updates are co-ordinated by the BT PMO, in conjunction with the risk owners and assignees. Risks and issues below Programme level are managed by the project leads, with the support of their Project Co-ordinators. 7 Reporting 7.1 Reports Risk and issue reporting provides the Programme with an opportunity to communicate the status of its key risks and issues, the mitigations taken and the impact of the mitigations to the overall risk and issue assessment.

Rollover relief
===============

Rollover relief allows you to change the legal ownership of property after 27 March 2021 while allowing you to claim a percentage of your interest expense.  

Rollover relief applies for interest limitation purposes when residential property is transferred as follows:

*   under a settlement of relationship property
*   as part of a company amalgamation that qualifies as a resident’s restricted amalgamation
*   after the death of the owner of the property, to an executor or administrator of the estate or to a beneficiary of the estate.
*   in some cases to or from look-through companies and partnership
*   in some cases to or from family trusts.

Specific relief also applies for certain transfers of land subject to the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993.

Look-through companies (LTCs) and partnerships
----------------------------------------------

Rollover relief applies in certain circumstances to transfers to or from LTCs and partnerships.

It applies for a person who is a shareholder in the LTC or a partner in the partnership, to the extent they have the same ownership interest before and after the transfer.  

Family trust
------------

Rollover relief applies for transfers of residential property to or from family trusts, provided the following apply:

*   each [transferor](/api/glossary/item?id={B5DC346B-E0F9-4339-AC2B-FDE654711346})
     (in the case of transfers to a trust) or each [transferee](/api/glossary/item?id={9746D2E7-12D4-4817-8AD7-116996E34948})
     (in the case of transfers from a trust) of the residential property is also a beneficiary of the trust
*   all [principal settlors](/api/glossary/item?id={A605136F-F9FB-469E-A77D-563DB6B063A3})
     are beneficiaries of the trust
*   each beneficiary is either a principal settlor, has a family connection with a principal settlor, or is a company controlled by a family member beneficiary or is a charity. 

Also, when the trustees of a family trust transfer the property back to the settlors who first transferred the property to the trust, each recipient’s proportionate interest in the property must be the same as what was held before the property was transferred to the trust.

Rollover relief may apply to a transfer from the trustees of a qualifying family trust to the settlors, even if the settlors did not previously transfer the property to the trust, but the trustees instead acquired the property from a third party. In this case for rollover relief to apply all the settlors receiving the property from the trustees must have been principal settlors of the trust both at the time the trustees acquired the property and when the trustees transferred the property to them.

If certain criteria are met, rollover relief also applies when residential property held in a qualifying family trust is resettled onto another family trust.

Rollover relief does not apply when you transfer shares in an LTC to a trust.

Māori authority or Māori family trust 
--------------------------------------

Rollover relief is available for a transfer of residential property to a Māori authority, or person eligible to be a Māori authority, as the trustee of a trust if the following apply:

*   the residential property is subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993
*   each [transferor](/api/glossary/item?id={B5DC346B-E0F9-4339-AC2B-FDE654711346})
     is both a settlor and beneficiary of the trust
*   the transferors of the residential property and the beneficiaries of the trust are all either members of the same iwi or hapū or the descendants of the same tipuna (living or dead).

Also, when the trustees of a trust transfer property that comes under Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 back to the persons who first transferred the property to the trust, each recipient’s proportionate interest in the property must be the same as what was held before the property was transferred to the trust.

Example: Mary and Bob sell their property to their LTC

Mary and Bob, a married couple, are the shareholders in a look-through company, Company A. Mary and Bob jointly own an investment property in equal shares (50:50). They each hold 50 percent of the shares in Company A. Mary and Bob had drawn down a loan in 2018 to purchase the property. In September 2021, the loan has an outstanding balance of $100,000.

In September 2021, Mary and Bob sell the property to Company A. Company A borrows $150,000 from the bank for the purchase of the property and uses its equity to fund the remainder of the purchase price.

Partial rollover relief applies to the transfer of the property, meaning that Company A can claim a percentage of the interest on a loan balance of $100,000 (being the amount of Mary and Bob's original loan balance on the date of the transfer). Company A’s excess loan balance of $50,000 does not qualify for rollover relief.

However from the 2024-25 tax year, a percentage of the interest incurred can be claimed on the whole loan.

Example: Neo sells his property to his family trust

Neo acquired a rental property and drew down a loan of $500,000 for the property on 3 March 2017. On 29 October 2022, Neo sells the property to his family trust. He and his son, Archie, are beneficiaries of the trust. The outstanding balance of Neo’s loan is $400,000. The trustee takes out a loan of $450,000 to purchase the property from Neo. Neo uses $400,000 of the sale proceeds to repay the outstanding balance of his loan.

The transfer of the property to the trust qualifies for partial rollover relief and therefore enables the trustee to claim a percentage of the interest incurred. However, only interest on $400,000 of the trustee’s loan is deductible (being the amount of Neo's loan balance on the date of the transfer). Interest on the additional $50,000 borrowed does not qualify for rollover relief and is not deductible.

From the 2024-25 tax year, a percentage of the interest incurred can be claimed on the whole loan.

Utilisation of a profit emerging basis for purchased debt ledgers by a certain New Zealand Company Limited
==========================================================================================================

Determination S17 (17 Dec 2010) considers the utilisation of a profit emerging basis for purchased debt ledgers by a NZ company.

This determination may be cited as Special Determination S17: "Utilisation of a profit emerging basis for acquired bad debts by a certain New Zealand Company Limited".

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to the ability of New Zealand Company Limited (NZC) to utilise a profit emerging basis for returning income and expenditure arising from the acquisition and collection of a portfolio of distressed debts acquired at a deep discount.
2.  NZC acquires for valuable consideration pools of unpaid loans and receivables, which may consist of a few hundred to a few thousand individual debts (ABDs).
3.  NZC acquires the ABDs at a deep discount to their face value. NZC subsequently seeks to recover the overdue balances from debtors through various means.
4.  The acquisition of an individual ABD is done on the expectation that its recoveries will be in excess of the purchase price and the cost incurred in attempting collection. Some debts may not achieve any recovery and become uncollectable, and others may be partially collected. The volatility of cash collections may be attributed to such things as the nature of the underlying debt, its age and type, as well as external economic conditions and the effort applied.
5.  NZC previously applied IAS 39 to ABDs for financial reporting purposes. From (and including) the financial year ended 30 June 2010, NZC will apply AASB 9 to ABDs for financial reporting purposes.
6.  This determination provides that NZC's tax liability for an income year will be based on actual collections reduced by the proportion of purchase cost allocated to that income year.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under s 90AC(1)(bb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to the tax treatment of ABDs acquired by New Zealand Company Limited (NZC).
2.  ABDs are pools of unpaid loans and receivables. These pools may consist of a few hundred to a few thousand individual debts.
3.  NZC acquires the ABDs at a deep discount to their face value on the expectation that its recoveries will be in excess of the purchase price and the cost incurred in attempting collection.
4.  NZC previously applied IAS 39 to ABDs for financial reporting purposes. From (and including) the financial year ended 30 June 2010, NZC will apply AASB 9 to ABDs for financial reporting purposes.
5.  NZC will apply the spreading method adjustment formula in s EW 27 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to any financial arrangements (forming part of an ABD) to which it was a party at the end of the financial year ended 30 June 2009.
6.  This determination is made subject to the following conditions:
    1.  NZC is satisfied on the basis of objective criteria that five years is the appropriate period over which cashflows from an ABD are to be forecast; and
    2.  NZC will not take a deduction for the acquisition cost of an ABD (or any part thereof) except as set out in this determination; and
    3.  NZC continues to treat all underlying debts to which it becomes a party on the acquisition of an ABD (which would otherwise be excepted financial arrangements) as financial arrangements under s EW 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### 4\. Principle

1.  All underlying debts to which NZC becomes a party on the acquisition of an ABD are either financial arrangements as defined in s EW 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007, or are treated as financial arrangements by NZC under s EW 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007.
2.  This determination specifies that income and expenditure from an ABD for an income year is recognised using a profit emerging method. This method takes into account actual cash flows less an apportionment of the cost of purchase.
3.  The apportionment of the purchase cost of an ABD is based on the original forecasted recoveries for the income year as a proportion of the total original forecasted recoveries from the ABD over a five year period.
4.  Any cash collections will be returned as income in the income year in which they are received.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination (and the Explanation), unless the context otherwise requires-

Words and expressions used (which have not been defined elsewhere within the determination) have the same meaning as in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

"IAS 39" means International Accounting Standard 39 (Financial instruments: recognition and measurement), issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

"AASB 9" means Australian Accounting Standard AASB 9 (Financial instruments), issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board.

### 6\. Method

The profit emerging method is illustrated in the following formula:

AI = AC \- (PC x OF)  
TECC

AI = assessable income of an ABD for an income year

AC = actual cash collected from the ABD during the income year

PC = purchase costs of ABD

OF = original forecast cash to be collected during the income year

TECC = total expected cash to be collected over five years, forecast at date of purchase

Once the cost of the ABD is fully amortised, cash collected after the five year period will be treated as derived in the income year in which it is received.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method (set out in this determination) for determining the income and expenditure attributable to an ABD in each income year.

This example proceeds on the following parameters:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Purchase date | 1 July 2006 |
| ABD purchase cost (PC) | 1,000,000 |
| Forecast cash collection (OF) |     |
| Year 1 | 1,068,000 |
| Year 2 | 582,000 |
| Year 3 | 274,000 |
| Year 4 | 58,000 |
| Year 5 | 18,000 |
| Total expected cash collected over five years (TECC) | 2,000,000 |
| Actual cash collection (AC) |     |
| Year 1 | 1,106,000 |

Mandatory conversion convertible notes with consumer price index adjustments to face value
==========================================================================================

Determination S19 (10 Oct 2011) relates to mandatory conversion convertible issued by a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary of a company, to a third company.

This Determination may be cited as Special Determination SX: "Mandatory Conversion Convertible Notes with Consumer Price Index Adjustments to Face Value".

\[Editor's note: the reference to SX in the paragraph above is an error. This Determination should be referred to as Determination S19\]

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This Determination relates to mandatory conversion convertible notes (MCNs) to be issued by ABC Company (Issuer) a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary of DEF Company (the Shareholder) to XYZ Company (the Noteholder).
2.  The MCNs constitute financial arrangements in respect of which the Noteholder provides funds to the Issuer, with the debt to be discharged at a future date by the issue of Noteholder Shares in the Issuer to the Noteholder. The face value of the MCNs will increase or decrease in line with the All Groups Consumers Price Index (CPI) as measured and published by Statistics New Zealand. Coupon Interest will be paid (in cash) on the Adjusted Face Value of the MCNs, in the period between the issue of the MCNs and the conversion of the MCNs into Noteholder Shares.
3.  An amount (whether it is income, gain, loss or expenditure) that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement (as described in ss EW 5(2) to EW 5(16) of the Income Tax Act 2007) is not taken into account under the Financial Arrangements Rules (in accordance with s EW 6(2)).
4.  As a share is an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(13) of the Income Tax Act 2007, only the Coupon Interest and the CPI Adjustment (provided condition 5(d) of the Deed Poll is not invoked) will be regarded as income or expenditure under the Financial Arrangements Rules. Any fluctuation in the market value of the Noteholder Shares will be disregarded.
5.  This Determination prescribes the method to be used by the Issuer when calculating the aggregate income derived or aggregate expenditure incurred in respect of the MCNs under the Financial Arrangements Rules. It details which amounts are to be included for this calculation and which are attributable to an excepted financial arrangement.

### 2\. Reference

1.  This Determination is made pursuant to s 90AC(1)(bb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This Determination applies only to the MCNs described as follows:
    1.  The Issuer will borrow money from the Noteholder by issuing a MCN to the Noteholder. The amount borrowed will be $100 million. The face value of the MCNs will adjust quarterly in line with the All Groups CPI using the calculation set out in Schedule 1 of the Deed Poll. If Statistics New Zealand ceases to publish the All Groups CPI, the appropriate replacement index or base, as set out in the definition of "Index" in Schedule 1 of the Deed Poll, will be used in place of the All Groups CPI.
    2.  The MCNs will pay Coupon Interest of 4% per annum (payable monthly, in arrears) on the Adjusted Face Value of the MCNs, provided that doing so does not breach the solvency test (under the Companies Act 1993) or any other legal obligation of the Issuer, or if the Noteholder is in default. If the solvency test or other legal obligation of the Issuer is breached, or if the Noteholder is in default, interest payments will be suspended. However, interest will continue to accrue at the Default Interest Rate if the suspension is due to either of the first two of the above events. "Default Interest Rate" is defined as the Coupon Interest rate (which is 4% for the original term and 5% where the term of the MCNs is extended) plus 1% per annum. If an Event of Default (as defined in condition 8 of the Deed Poll) occurs, interest will accrue at the Default Interest Rate. The Noteholder will also have the option to require the Issuer to redeem the MCNs.
    3.  The MCNs will carry the same voting rights as those attaching to the Shareholder Shares.
    4.  After 10 years, where condition 5(d) of the Deed Poll has not been invoked, and where the Adjusted Face Value of the MCNs is equal to, or less than, the value of the Shareholder Shares, the MCNs will convert into Noteholder Shares with a value equal to the Shareholder Shares held by the Shareholder. The Noteholder and the Shareholder will then each have 50% of the shares in the Issuer.
    5.  After 10 years, where condition 5(d) of the Deed Poll has not been invoked, and where the Adjusted Face Value of the MCNs is more than the value of the Shareholder Shares, the Issuer may elect to extend the term of the MCNs by 3 years. Where this occurs, the Coupon Interest will increase to 5% and the MCNs will convert on the Replacement Conversion Date.
    6.  If condition 5(d) of the Deed Poll has not been invoked, and the Adjusted Face Value of the MCNs is more than the value of the Shareholder Shares, whether the term of the MCNs has been extended (as described in paragraph 3(1)(e) above) or not, the Shareholder may subscribe for additional Shareholder Shares under condition 5(b) of the Deed Poll. This involves the Shareholder subscribing for additional Shareholder Shares in the Issuer. The purchase of the additional Shareholder Shares will provide funds to the Issuer, all of which must be used by the Issuer to repay part of the Adjusted Face Value of the MCNs owing to the Noteholder. This subscription increases the Shareholder’s shareholding, while at the same time reducing the value of the Noteholder Shares that the Noteholder is entitled to receive on conversion. The value of the share purchase by the Shareholder is such that on conversion of the remainder, the Noteholder and the Shareholder will each have 50% of the shares in the Issuer.
    7.  The Noteholder will be entitled to appoint 50% of the board of directors of the Issuer. If the Noteholder’s Directors vote against a recommendation made by the property manager and supported by the Shareholder appointed directors (except where that recommendation relates to front loading, or involves a transaction between the Shareholder and a related company), and such vote is ratified by the Noteholder then condition 5(d) of the Deed Poll may be invoked. If condition 5(d) is invoked, the Noteholder will lose its right, on conversion, to receive Noteholder Shares to the value of the Adjusted Face Value of the MCNs. In this event, on the Conversion Date, or Replacement Conversion Date (as the case may be), the Issuer will issue to the Noteholder Shares equal to the number of Shareholder Shares on issue to the Shareholder on the Conversion Date.

### 4\. Principle

1.  (1) The MCNs have both debt and equity components. They can be regarded alternatively as:
    1.  a loan to the Issuer with repayment in shares (debt component); or
    2.  (b) a forward purchase of shares (in which case the holder of the MCNs is buying shares in a company and has equity in it).
2.  As the MCNs have this dual character, when calculating income or expenditure in relation to the MCNs it is first necessary to separate the debt and equity components of the MCNs.
3.  This Determination specifies that the Coupon Interest and (where condition 5(d) of the Deed Poll has not been invoked) the CPI Adjustment, relate to the debt component of the MCNs. Changes in the value of the Noteholder Shares relate to the equity component and will be excluded from the application of the Financial Arrangements Rules when calculating income or expenditure for the Issuer.
4.  This Determination specifies that if condition 5(d) of the Deed Poll is invoked then, from the date the condition is invoked, only the Coupon Interest will relate to the debt component of the MCNs. If condition 5(d) is invoked then the CPI Adjustment and any changes in the value of the Noteholder Shares will relate to the equity component and will be excluded from the application of the Financial Arrangements Rules when calculating income or expenditure for the Issuer. Further, any income or deductions already returned or claimed for the CPI Adjustments must be reversed (see paragraph 6(9) of this determination below).
5.  For the purposes of this Determination any change in the market value of the Noteholder Shares between the issue date of the MCNs and the conversion of the MCNs into shares is solely attributable to the equity component of the MCNs. Therefore, the difference in Noteholder Share price can be ignored when calculating income and expenditure.

### 5\. Interpretation

1.  In this Determination, the following expressions (which have not been defined elsewhere in this Determination) have the following meanings:
    1.  "Adjusted Face Value" means the initial face value of the MCNs together with the quarterly CPI adjustments to the face value of the MCNs.
    2.  "Financial Arrangements Rules" means the rules referred to in section YA 1 and EW 1(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007.
2.  "Coupon Interest" means the cash interest amounts paid on a monthly basis by the Issuer to the Noteholder pursuant to the terms of the Deed Poll.
3.  "CPI Adjustment" means the quarterly adjustments to the face value of the Notes pursuant to the terms of the Deed Poll.
4.  Noteholder Shares in relation to the MCNs means the fully paid ordinary shares in the Issuer to be issued on conversion of the MCNs.
5.  "Shareholder Shares" means the fully paid ordinary shares in the Issuer held by the Shareholder, including any additional shares subscribed for under condition 5(b) of the Deed Poll.

### 6\. Method

1.  When calculating the aggregate income or aggregate expenditure with regard to the MCNs, the income, gain, loss, expenditure or any other consideration receivable by the Noteholder or payable by the Issuer will be:
    1.  where condition 5(d) of the Deed Poll has not been invoked during the term of the MCNs:
        1.  the Coupon Interest; and
        2.  the CPI Adjustment.
    2.  where condition 5(d) of the Deed Poll is invoked during the term of the MCNs, from that date, only the Coupon Interest.
2.  The amount to be attributed to the CPI Adjustment is the net amount by which the face value of the MCNs increases or decreases over the term of the MCNs.
3.  If condition 5(d) of the Deed Poll has not been invoked during the term of the MCNs:
    1.  where the face value of the MCNs increases, the CPI Adjustment shall be expenditure; or
    2.  where the face value of the MCNs decreases, the CPI Adjustment shall be income.
4.  If condition 5(d) of the Deed Poll is invoked during the term of the MCNs, from that date, the CPI Adjustment will cease to be either expenditure or income. In this situation, any income or deduction already returned or claimed for the CPI Adjustment must be reversed (see paragraph 6(9) of this determination below).
5.  All other income, gains, losses or expenditure in relation to the MCNs is solely attributable to the excepted financial arrangement component of the MCNs.
6.  The Coupon Interest payment and the CPI Adjustment (as applicable) will be spread over the term of the MCNs as follows:
    1.  in respect of Coupon Interest, the amount to be attributed to an income year during which the MCNs are on issue will be the total of all interest expenditure incurred in the relevant income year. For example, for the income year ending 30 June 2012, this will include all interest payments falling due for payment up to and including the payment to be made on 1 July 2012.
    2.  in respect of the CPI Adjustment, where condition 5(d) of the Deed Poll has not been invoked, the amount to be attributed to an income year during which the MCNs are on issue will be the amount by which the face value of the MCNs increases or decreases in respect of months falling within that income year. For example, for the income year ending 30 June 2012, this will include the CPI Adjustments made up to and including the CPI Adjustment to be made on 1 July 2012. This net amount of the CPI Adjustment will either be expenditure (where it increases) or income (where it decreases) for that income year.
7.  The Issuer is an International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) taxpayer. At the time that the MCNs are issued, the above method will be consistent with an IFRS financial reporting method (provided that condition 5(d) of the Deed Poll is not invoked during the term of the MCNs).
8.  For the purposes of the base price adjustment, the amount of the consideration that has been paid to the Issuer for the MCNs (based on the definition of "consideration" in s EW 31(7) of the Income Tax Act 2007) is the amount subscribed for the MCNs with no part of the consideration being attributable to the excepted financial arrangement component of the MCNs.
9.  If condition 5(d) of the Deed Poll has not been invoked, for the purposes of the base price adjustment, the amount of the consideration that will be paid by the Issuer for the MCNs by way of the issue of Noteholder Shares (based on the definition of "consideration" in s EW 31(7) of the Income Tax Act 2007) is equal to the Adjusted Principal Amount (which includes the CPI Adjustments).
10.  If condition 5(d) of the Deed Poll has been invoked, the Issuer will complete a calculation applying the method in Determination G25 in the income year in which the condition is invoked so that the CPI Adjustments treated as income or expenditure to date are reversed in that income year.
11.  If condition 5(d) of the Deed Poll has been invoked, for the purposes of the base price adjustment calculated at maturity of the MCNs, the amount of the consideration that will be paid by the Issuer for the MCNs by way of the issue of Noteholder Shares (based on the definition of "consideration" in s EW 31(7) of the Income Tax Act 2007) is equal to the amount that was paid by the Noteholder to the Issuer for the MCNs.

### 7\. Examples

### Example A - Adjusted principal amount is greater than the value of the Shareholder's Shares

1.  This example illustrates the application of the method (set out in this Determination) for determining the amounts attributable to both the debt and equity components of the MCNs to be issued by the Issuer to the Noteholder.
2.  The example assumes the following:
    *   The MCNs are issued on 1 July 2011 and the Noteholder will continue to hold the MCNs until 30 June 2021, when the MCNs will mandatorily convert into shares in the Issuer.  
          
        The amount subscribed for the MCNs is $100 million.  
          
        The CPI, for all relevant quarters, is 2% per annum.  
          
        Interest payments are not suspended during the term of the MCNs.  
          
        On conversion, the Adjusted Principal Amount will be less than the total value of the Issuer’s assets  
          
        On conversion, the Adjusted Principal Amount will be greater than the total value of the Shareholder's Shares.  
          
        Condition 5(d) of the Deed Poll has not been invoked.
3.  The Issuer will be allowed deductions for expenditure arising under the Financial Arrangements Rules during the term of the MCNs. This expenditure is in the form of the CPI Adjustments and the coupon interest payments. The expenditure for the first two income years, for which deductions will be allowed, is set out in the table in Appendix 1 (the deductions will continue on this basis during the term of the MCN). It is noted that the CPI Adjustments will be deductible whether paid in the form of shares only or a combination of shares and cash (where the Shareholder subscribes for additional shares and the Issuer uses the funds raised to redeem part of the MCNs prior to the MCNs being converted to Noteholder Shares).
4.  Any other amounts will be attributable to the equity component of the MCNs.
5.  The base price adjustment required for the 2021 income year will be as follows:

| Example A |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     |     |     |
| _Consideration_ |     |
| Paid/payable to the Issuer |     | 100,000,000.00 |
| Less paid/payable by the Issuer | 100,000,000.00 |     |
| Total CPI Adjustment\* | 21,472,063.33 |     |
| Total Interest | 44,157,430.48 |     |
|     |     | 165,629,493.81 |
| Consideration |     | \-65,629,493.81 |
|     |     |     |
| _Less Income_ |     | 0.00 |
|     |     |     |
| _Plus Expenditure_ |     |
| CPI Adjustment | 19,072,689.04 |     |
| Total interest | 39,334,852.73 |     |
| Total expenditure | 58,407,541.77 |     |
|     |     |     |
| _Plus amount remitted_ | 0.00 |     |
|     |     |     |
| _Base price adjustment_ | **\-7,221,952.04** |     |
|     |     |     |
| **Notes** A deduction will be available to the Issuer in the 2021 tax year of $7,221,952.04 (which is the current year’s coupon interest and CPI adjustment). \*The initial investment plus the total CPI Adjustment will equal the Adjusted Principal Amount. |

### Example B - Adjusted principal amount is equal to or less than the value of Shareholder's Shares

1.  This example proceeds on the same basis as Example A, except that on conversion, the Adjusted Principal Amount will be equal to, or less than, the total value of the Shareholder’s Shares.
2.  The deductions allowed are the same as in Example A.
3.  The base price adjustment is the same as in Example A.
4.  All other amounts will be attributable to the equity component of the MCNs. In particular (and this is the point of this example), the difference between the value of the Noteholder Shares and the Adjusted Principal Amount will be attributable to the equity component of the MCNs.

### Example C Extension of term

1.  This example proceeds on the same basis as Example A, except that the Issuer elects to extend the term of the MCNs by 3 years (as contemplated by the Deed Poll).
2.  The Issuer will be allowed deductions in the same way as described in Example A except that the coupon interest will be calculated at a higher rate for the period after the extension. The expenditure during the 3 year extension period, for which deductions will be allowed, is set out in the table in Appendix 2.
3.  As with Example A, all other amounts will be attributable to the equity component of the MCNs.
4.  The base price adjustment required if the period is extended will be as follows:

| Example C - extension of term |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     |     |     |
| _Consideration_ |     |     |
| Paid/payable to the Issuer |     | 100,000,000.00 |
| Less paid/payable by the Issuer | 100,000,000.00 |     |
| Total CPI Adjustment\* | 28,964,194.40 |     |
| Total Interest | 62,980,811.38 |     |
|     |     | 191,945,005.78 |
| Consideration |     | \-91,945,005.78 |
|     |     |     |
| _Less Income_ |     | 0.00 |
|     |     |     |
| _Plus Expenditure_ |     |     |
| CPI Adjustment | 26,416,831.95 |     |
| Total interest | 56,580,737.65 |     |
| Total expenditure |     | 82,997,569.60 |
|     |     |     |
| _Plus amount remitted_ |     | 0.00 |
|     |     |     |
| _Base price adjustment_ |     | **\-8,947,436.18** |
|     |     |     |
| **Notes** A deduction will be available to the Issuer for the 2024 tax year of $8,947,436.18 (which is the current year’s coupon interest and CPI adjustment). \* The initial investment plus the total CPI Adjustment will equal the Adjusted Principal Amount. |     |     |

This Determination is signed by me on the 10th day of October 2011.

Convertible redeemable notes and preference shares
==================================================

Determination S20 (12 Dec 2011) relates to convertible redeemable notes issued by one company to another and preference shares issued by a third company.

This Determination may be cited as Special Determination S20: "Convertible Redeemable Notes and Preference Shares".

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This Determination relates to convertible redeemable notes (CRNs) issued by Company A (Issuer) to Company B (Noteholder), and to Preference Shares issued by Company C.
2.  The CRNs are perpetual debt securities in respect of which the Noteholder loans funds to the Issuer. Coupon Interest will be paid (in cash) on the Principal Amount of the CRNs until the CRNs are redeemed or converted. The Issuer may redeem the CRNs in cash for the Principal Amount plus the Cash Redemption Premium. Alternatively, the Issuer may convert the CRNs to ordinary shares by issuing Conversion Shares in repayment of the Principal Amount, being a fixed number of ordinary shares in the Issuer.
3.  It was expected at issue that the CRNs would become an expensive form of funding over time, as the Interest Rate increases. As the Cash Redemption Premium increases over time, there is an increasing economic incentive for the Issuer to convert the CRNs to Conversion Shares rather than redeem them for cash.
4.  The Issuer used the Principal Amount to subscribe for Preference Shares in Company C.
5.  An amount (whether it is income, consideration, gain, loss or expenditure) that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement (as described in ss EW 5(2) to EW 5(16) of the Income Tax Act 2007) is not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules (in accordance with s EW 6(2)).
6.  This Determination prescribes a method for determining the part of the consideration receivable by the parties to the arrangement that is solely attributable to the excepted financial arrangements.

### 2\. Reference

1.  This Determination is made pursuant to s 90AC(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This Determination applies to a wider financial arrangement constituted by
    1.  the CRNs;
    2.  the Preference Shares; and
    3.  the Conversion Shares.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The CRNs, the Preference Shares and the Conversion Shares are each part of a wider financial arrangement that has "excepted financial arrangement" components as defined in s EW 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The excepted financial arrangements are:
    1.  the Preference Shares; and
    2.  the Conversion Shares.
2.  The CRNs are a hybrid financial arrangement which have a debt and an equity component. The equity component arises from the option available to the Issuer to issue the Conversion Shares to the Noteholder in lieu of repayment in cash (of the Principal Amount plus the Cash Redemption Premium).
3.  As the CRNs have this dual character, when calculating income or expenditure in relation to the CRNs it is first necessary to separate the debt and equity components of the CRNs. For the purposes of this determination it is assumed that, if the Issuer issues Conversion Shares to the Noteholder in lieu of payment of the Principal Amount in cash, any difference between the market value of the Conversion Shares and the Principal Amount is solely attributable to the Conversion Shares. Consequently, the difference is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement.
4.  Any income, consideration, gain or loss, or expenditure that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement is not included when calculating income or expenditure under the financial arrangements rules.
5.  This Determination specifies that the amounts that are solely attributable to the excepted financial arrangements are:
    1.  the amounts paid under or with respect to the Preference Shares; and
    2.  if the Issuer issues Conversion Shares to the Noteholder in lieu of payment in cash, any difference between the market value of the Conversion Shares and the Principal Amount.
6.  This Determination specifies that no part of the Principal Amount, the repayment of the Principal Amount, the Coupon Interest, and any Cash Redemption Premium under the CRNs is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement.

### 5\. Interpretation

1.  In this Determination, unless the context otherwise requires, words and expressions which have not been defined elsewhere within the determination have the same meaning as in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.
2.  In this Determination, the following expressions (which have not been defined elsewhere in this Determination) have the following meanings:
    1.  “Cash Redemption Premium” means any amount paid by the Issuer to the Noteholder in excess of the Principal Amount on redemption of the CRNs for cash. If the CRNs are redeemed for cash under clause 4.5(b)(ii) of the Terms and Conditions, the Cash Redemption Premium is 2% if the CRNs are redeemed on or before 31 December 2011, 4% if the CRNs are redeemed from 31 December 2011 but on or before 31 December 2012, 6% if the CRNs are redeemed from 31 December 2012 but on or before 31 December 2013, then it continues to increase by a further 2% for each successive two yearly Interest Rate reset period (as stated in clause 4.2(b)(ii) of the Terms and Conditions).
    2.  "Conversion Shares" means a fixed number of fully paid ordinary shares in the Issuer issued to the Noteholder pursuant to clause 4.3 of the Terms and Conditions, after making any adjustment required pursuant to clause 5 of the Terms and Conditions. Pursuant to clause 4.3, the $1 Principal Amount of each CRN will convert to 2.1 fully paid ordinary shares in the Issuer.
    3.  "Coupon Interest" means quarterly interest payments by the Issuer to the Noteholder pursuant to clause 3 of the Terms and Conditions, and includes any amount of unpaid interest which is subsequently paid pursuant to clause 3.2(b) of the Terms and Conditions.
    4.  "Interest Rate" means 8% until 31 December 2011, and subsequently the rate determined under clause 3.5 of the Terms and Conditions. Under clause 3.5 the interest rate is: from 31 December 2011 until 31 December 2013, a two year interbank swap rate on 31 December 2011 plus a margin of 550 basis points; from 31 December 2013 until 31 December 2015 a two year interbank swap rate on 31 December 2013 plus a margin of 650 basis points; and from 31 December 2013 reset at a 2 year interbank swap rate plus a margin of 650 basis points every two years (while the CRNs remain on issue).
    5.  "Preference Shares" means preference shares in Company C which the Issuer subscribed for in accordance with clause 2.2 of the Subscription Agreement for Convertible Redeemable Notes between the Issuer and the Noteholder, or any such shares that are reclassified as ordinary shares.
    6.  "Principal Amount", in relation to each CRN, means $1. References to the aggregate Principal Amount are to the aggregate of the Principal Amount of all the CRNs, being an aggregate Principal Amount of approximately NZ$32.5 million.
    7.  "Terms and Conditions" means the CRN terms set out in Schedule 1 to the Subscription Agreement for Convertible Redeemable Notes between the Issuer and the Noteholder.

### 6\. Method

1.  Where the CRNs are converted to Conversion Shares pursuant to clause 4.1 of the Terms and Conditions, any amount by which the value of the Conversion Shares is above or below the aggregate Principal Amount of the CRNs is solely attributable to the Conversion Shares.
2.  The amounts that are solely attributable to the Preference Shares are:
    1.  The issue price per Preference Share of $1;
    2.  Any dividends paid on the Preference Shares by the Issuer;
    3.  Any other distributions paid on or with respect to the Preference Shares; and
    4.  Proceeds derived by the Issuer from the disposal or redemption of the Preference Shares.
3.  No other income, gain, loss, expenditure or consideration paid under or with respect to the wider financial arrangement is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement component of the wider financial arrangement. Consequently, all other amounts in relation to the CRNs (such as the Principal Amount, Coupon Interest and any Cash Redemption Premium) are taken into account under the financial arrangements rules.

### 7\. Examples

### Example A: Value of Conversion Shares exceeds the aggregate Principal Amount

1.  This example illustrates the application of the method (set out in this Determination) for determining the amounts attributable to both the debt and equity components of the CRNs to be issued by the Issuer to the Noteholder.
2.  The example assumes the following:
    *   The CRNs are issued on 16 January 2010 and the Noteholder will continue to hold the CRNs until 31 December 2015.
    *   The aggregate Principal Amount subscribed for the CRNs is NZ$32.5 million.
    *   The Issuer uses the aggregate Principal Amount to subscribe for Preference Shares in Company C, and derives dividends from them.
    *   Coupon Interest payments are not at any time suspended.
    *   The Issuer exercises its option to convert the CRNs to Conversion Shares on 31 December 2015.
    *   On conversion, the value of the Conversion Shares is NZ$40 million, ie exceeding the aggregate Principal Amount.
3.  The Coupon Interest will not be solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement. Consequently it will be expenditure under the financial arrangements rules.
4.  All other income or expenditure will be solely attributable to the excepted financial arrangement components of the wider financial arrangement. Consequently the financial arrangements rules will not apply to such amounts.
5.  The difference between the value of the Conversion Shares and the aggregate Principal Amount will be attributable to an excepted financial arrangement, and so will not be income or expenditure under the financial arrangements rules.

### Example B: Aggregate Principal Amount is equal to or less than the value of Conversion Shares

1.  This example proceeds on the same basis as Example A, except that the value of the Conversion Shares is less than the aggregate Principal Amount.
2.  The amounts solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement are the same as in Example A. Consequently the expenditure under the financial arrangements rules will be the same as in example A.

### Example C: Value of Conversion Shares less than the aggregate Principal Amount

1.  This example proceeds on the same basis as Example A, except that the Issuer exercises its option to redeem the CRNs for cash on 31 December 2015.
2.  The Coupon Interest and the Cash Redemption Premium equal to 6% of the aggregate Principal Amount payable on redemption will not be solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement. Consequently these amounts will be expenditure under the financial arrangements rules.

This Determination is signed by me on the 12th day of December 2011.

Spreading of acquisition cost of agreements for the sale and purchase of services
=================================================================================

Determination S21 (3 May 2012) relates to the spreading of expenditure arising on the acquisition of agreements for the provision of property maintenance services.

This determination may be cited as Special Determination S21: "Spreading of acquisition cost of agreements for the sale and purchase of services".

**1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)**

1.  This determination relates to the spreading by a certain company (the Company) of expenditure arising on the acquisition of certain agreements for the provision of property maintenance services.
2.  The Company acquired the businesses of two other companies on 1 April 2011 pursuant to separate sale and purchase and novation agreements (the Agreements). The first of those companies (and its shareholders) is not, and has never been, associated with the second of those companies (and its shareholders) for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007. Two-thirds of the Company is owned by the shareholders of the first company, and one-third by the shareholders of the second company.
3.  Part of the purchase price under the Agreements was allocated on an arm’s length basis to the acquisition of existing contracts for the provision of maintenance services (the Contracts). The Contracts were for a fixed term beginning on 1 July 2010 and ending on 30 June 2012, with a two-year right of renewal (subject to the satisfaction of certain performance and other criteria).
4.  The Company must now provide the relevant maintenance services over the remaining term of the Contracts. The Company issues regular invoices, and payment is due within 21 working days of the date on which the invoice is received.
5.  The Company has adopted the International Financial Reporting Standards for the purpose of preparing its accounts.

**2\. Reference**

This determination is made under s 90AC(1)(bb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

**3\. Scope of determination**

1.  This determination applies to the tax treatment of the Contracts and any other short-term agreements for sale and purchase with the same term as the Contracts.
2.  The Company acquired the Contracts from two other companies pursuant to the Agreements.
3.  The first of the two other companies (and its shareholders) is not, and has never been, associated with the second of those companies (and its shareholders) for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007.
4.  This determination is made subject to the following conditions:
    1.  The consideration the Company paid for the acquisition of the Contracts was not greater than the amount that a wholly unrelated arm’s length party in the place of the Company would have agreed to pay the two other companies for those Contracts.
    2.  The Company will treat the Contracts and any other short-term agreements for sale and purchase with the same term as the Contracts as financial arrangements under s EW 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007.
    3.  The Company will continue to recognise income derived from the Contracts and deduct expenditure incurred in relation to the Contracts under general principles (other than amounts dealt with under this determination).

**4\. Principle**

1.  The Company treats the Contracts and any other short-term agreements for sale and purchase with the same term as the Contracts as financial arrangements under s EW 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007.
2.  This determination specifies that the only amounts payable to or by the Company for or under the Contracts that are required to be spread under the financial arrangements rules are the amounts allocated to the acquisition of those Contracts in the Agreements. Those amounts must be allocated to an income year on a pro-rata basis applying the principles of Determination G1A (on a 365-day basis) from 1 April 2011 to 30 June 2014.
3.  If any one or more of the Contracts is not renewed in accordance with its terms, the Company must apply the principles of Determination G25 as if the term of the relevant Contract had been varied from four years to two years.

**6\. Interpretation**

In this determination (and the Explanation), unless the context otherwise requires:

Words and expressions used (that have not been defined elsewhere in the determination) have the same meaning as in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

"Agreements" means the separate sale and purchase and novation agreements under which the Company acquired the businesses of the other two companies on 1 April 2011.

"Contracts" means the contracts for the provision of maintenance services.

**6\. Method**

1.  The amounts allocated to the acquisition of the Contracts in the Agreements must be allocated to an income year on a pro-rata basis applying the principles of Determination G1A (on a 365-day basis) from 1April 2011 to 30 June 2014.
2.  If any one or more of the Contracts is not renewed in accordance with its terms, the Company must apply the method in Determination G25 as if the term of the relevant Contract had been varied from four years to two years.

**7\. Example**

This example illustrates the application of the method (set out in this determination) for determining the expenditure attributable to the Contracts in each income year.

The example is based on the following parameters:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Acquisition date | 1 April 2011 |
| End date | 30 June 2014 |
| Aggregate acquisition cost of Contracts | $5,000,000 |
| Balance date | 31 March |

Deduction allocated to the income year ending:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 31 March 2012 | $1,538,785.83 |
| 31 March 2013 | $1,538,785.83 |
| 31 March 2014 | $1,538,785.83 |
| 31 March 2015 | $383,642.51 |

This determination is signed by me on 3rd May 2012.

Application of the financial arrangements rules to a public-private partnership
===============================================================================

Determination S22 (27 Aug 2012) relates to the design, construction and provision of services to a prison by a certain company under a PPP agreement.

This determination may be cited as Special Determination S22: Application of the financial arrangements rules to a public-private partnership.

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to an arrangement (the Project) involving the design, construction and ongoing provision of operation and maintenance services in respect of a prison by a certain company (the Company) under a public-private partnership agreement (the Project Agreement) with the Crown. The Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings. The Company and Holdings are members of a consolidated group.
2.  The Project Agreement comprises three basic components:
    *   a construction phase under which the Company agrees to design and construct the prison for the Crown in consideration for a fixed lump-sum payment (the Construction Phase)
    *   the lease of the completed prison by the Crown to the Company in consideration for rental payment (the Lease), and
    *   a services phase under which the Company will provide operation and maintenance services to the Crown over a 25-year term in consideration for monthly payments (the Services Phase).
3.  The Company will enter into:
    *   a Construction Agreement with a contractor (the Contractor), under which the Contractor will design and construct the prison in consideration for capped monthly payments
    *   an Operation and Maintenance Contract with a service provider (the Service Provider), under which the Service Provider will provide the ongoing operation and maintenance (and other) services in consideration for monthly payments, and
    *   an Asset Management Agreement with the Service Provider, under which the Service Provider will provide management and administrative services to the Company and Holdings in consideration for periodic payments.
4.  The Company will borrow funds (the Senior Debt) from a consortium of banks (the Banks). The Company will enter into interest rate swaps in respect of the Senior Debt (the Swaps). Holdings will also borrow money from a single shareholder during the Construction Phase (the Shareholder Pre-subscription Loan), and each of the other shareholders shall provide an investment support in the form of a stand-by letter of credit (LC) and/or cash collateral to be held in equity collateral accounts of Holdings (ECA) (for each Deferred Investor). Holdings will also borrow from each of its shareholders during the last part of the Construction Phase and during the Services Phase in the form of optional convertible notes (the Notes).
5.  The Services Phase of the Project Agreement, Construction Agreement, Operation and Maintenance Contract, Asset Management Agreement and Lease are all excepted financial arrangements. The Construction Phase of the Project Agreement, Senior Debt, Swaps, Shareholder Pre-subscription Loan, Notes, and investment support represented by LCs and/or cash collateral in the ECAs are financial arrangements to which Holdings and/or the Company is a party. The Project, including all of these agreements, is a wider financial arrangement.
6.  This determination prescribes:
    *   the amount of consideration that is solely attributable to the Lease
    *   how the financial arrangements rules apply to the Construction Phase of the Project Agreement, Services Phase of the Project Agreement, Construction Agreement, Operation and Maintenance Contract, and Asset Management Agreement, and
    *   the method for spreading the payments made under the Senior Debt, Shareholder Pre-subscription Loan, Swaps and Notes.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb) and 91AC(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to the Company in respect of the Project (more fully described in private ruling BR Prv 12/33 issued on 27 August 2012), including the following agreements:
    *   Construction Phase of the Project Agreement, under which the Company agrees to design and construct the prison for the Crown and will receive a fixed lump-sum payment (which will be equal to and offset against the rental prepayment referred to below), once the prison is ready for operation.
    *   Services Phase of the Project Agreement, under which the Company will provide ongoing operation and maintenance services for 25 years to the Crown in consideration for monthly payments.
    *   Lease in respect of the prison, under which the Company will lease the prison from the Crown for 25 years and will prepay the rental to the Crown. This payment will be equal to and will offset the payment in relation to the Construction Phase.
    *   Construction Agreement, under which the Contractor will design and build the prison and receive capped monthly payments from the Company.
    *   Operation and Maintenance Contract, under which the Service Provider will provide services in respect of the prison and receive monthly payments from the Company.
    *   Asset Management Agreement, under which the Service Provider will provide management and administrative services to the Company and Holdings in consideration for periodic payments.
    *   Senior Debt, under which the Company will borrow an agreed sum from the Banks during the Construction Phase for a term of 7 years from financial close of the Project (Financial Close). Interest will be capitalised during the Construction Phase and payable at a market rate thereafter. It is intended that the Senior Debt will be refinanced within 7 years, and every 5 years thereafter over the term of the Project. While the Base Case has assumed 5 yearly refinancings, the Company has flexibility to refinance at any time. As at the date of this determination there is no intention to deviate from the Base Case. Under IFRS (as the standards apply at the date of this Determination), the Senior Debt (and any subsequent refinancings) will initially be recognised at fair value, and subsequently measured using the amortised cost/effective interest method (regardless of whether or not hedge accounting is applied), and will not be treated as a hedge of another financial arrangement.
    *   Shareholder Pre-subscription Loan, under which Holdings will borrow an agreed sum from a shareholder during the Construction Phase for a market rate of interest. It is yet to be determined whether Holdings will treat the Shareholder Pre-subscription Loan, in part, as an equity instrument under IFRS.
    *   Swaps, under which the Company will pay a fixed rate of interest to the swap counterparties, and receive a floating rate in return. It is intended that each refinancing of the Senior Debt will be matched by an interest rate swap on materially the same terms as the Swaps (the New Swaps).
    *   Notes, under which Holdings will issue convertible notes to its shareholders for a term of 25 years and 5 months (assuming that the Services Phase commences on the planned date). The Notes will pay an agreed rate of interest quarterly in arrears in cash after the commencement of the Services Phase. If an interest payment is not paid because of insufficient project cash flows, the interest will be capitalised and added to the principal. Any capitalised interest must be paid in cash by the earlier of conversion or expiry (being, 25 years and 5 months, assuming that the Services Phase commences on the planned date). It is intended at the outset that all interest payments will be paid in cash on the quarterly due dates occurring after the commencement of the Services Phase. The Notes are also subject to a fixed inflation adjustment, that is added to the principal amount of the Notes each 1 July occurring after the Service Commencement Date. The Notes are redeemable in cash in accordance with an amortisation schedule that amortises the principal to zero over 25 years and 5 months. The Notes are convertible into shares in Holdings at the option of Holdings if Holdings experiences a material cash flow deficit because of events not taken into account in cash flow projections prepared before Financial Close and where conversion of the Notes would assist Holdings to manage its liabilities and solvency (subject to the consent of the Banks). There are no planned conversion dates for the Notes, and there is no fixed intention to convert the Notes before maturity. It is yet to be determined whether Holdings will treat the Notes, in part, as an equity instrument under IFRS.
    *   Investment support by the Deferred Investors under the Investment Commitment Deed to provide and maintain investment support in the form of a stand-by letter of credit (LC) and/or cash collateral to be held in equity collateral accounts of Holdings (ECA) (for each Deferred Investor). Interest received by Holdings on amounts in the ECA representing a Deferred Investor's cash collateral is, in turn, payable by Holdings to that Deferred Investor (subject to certain criteria). Holdings will pay each Deferred Investor a quarterly fee in arrears (Investment Support Fee) for the period from Financial Close to the Deferred Equity Subscription Date.
2.  This determination is made subject to the following conditions:
    *   The agreed rate of interest payable on the Notes (including the inflation adjustment) will not exceed a rate that would be agreed between wholly unrelated parties having regard to the terms of the Notes and applying orthodox pricing methodologies.
    *   The Notes will be converted only in circumstances in which the Company and/or Holdings experiences a material cash flow deficit because of events not taken into account in cash-flow projections prepared before completion, and where conversion of the Notes would assist the Company and/or Holdings to manage its liabilities and solvency.
    *   The Company will recognise income derived from the Crown during the Construction Phase of the Project Agreement and the Services Phase of the Project Agreement, and will deduct expenditure incurred in relation to the Lease, Construction Agreement, Operation and Maintenance Contract, and Asset Management Agreement, in each case, under the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 (outside of the financial arrangement rules).
    *   The method applied to determine the income derived and the method applied to determine the expenditure incurred in respect of the investment support represented by cash collateral in each ECA will be the same.
    *   The continued application of private ruling Br Prv 12/33 (under s 91EB of the Tax Administration Act 1994).

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Lease in respect of the prison is an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(9). Any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in s EW 5(2) to (16) is not an amount that is taken into account under the financial arrangement rules (s EW 6(2)). This determination specifies the amounts that are solely attributable to the Lease that are not taken into account under the financial arrangement rules.
2.  The Services Phase of the Project Agreement, Construction Agreement, Operation and Maintenance Contract, and Asset Management Agreement are “short-term agreements for sale and purchase”, and are excepted financial arrangements under s EW 5(22). Any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in s EW 5(17) to (25) that is part of a financial arrangement is an amount that is taken into account under the financial arrangements rules (s EW 6(3)). This determination specifies that no amounts payable to or by the Company in respect of the Services Phase of the Project Agreement, Construction Agreement, Operation and Maintenance Contract, or Asset Management Agreement are required to be spread under the financial arrangements rules.
3.  The Construction Phase of the Project Agreement, Senior Debt, Swaps, Shareholder Pre-subscription Loan, Notes, and investment support in the form of LCs and/or cash collateral in the ECAs are “financial arrangements” under s EW 3. This determination specifies that no amounts payable to or by the Company in respect of the Construction Phase of the Project Agreement are required to be spread under the financial arrangements rules, and that the payments made to or by the Company under the Senior Debt, Swaps, Shareholder Pre-subscription Loan and Notes must be spread under the financial arrangements rules in accordance with this determination.

### 5\. Interpretation

1.  In this determination, unles the context otherwise requires - "IFRS" means International Financial Reporting Standards.

### 6\. Method

1.  The prepaid rental the Company will pay in respect of the Lease and the leasehold property interest granted to the Company under the Lease are solely attributable to the Lease, and are not taken into account under the financial arrangement rules.
2.  The Company is not required to spread any amounts under the financial arrangements rules in respect of the:
    *   Construction Phase of the Project Agreement
    *   Services Phase of the Project Agreement
    *   Construction Agreement
    *   Operation and Maintenance Contract
    *   Asset Management Agreement
3.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than “non-integral fees” as defined in s YA 1) over the term of the Senior Debt. None of the restrictions for application of this reporting method in s EW 15D(2B) applies.
4.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than “non-integral fees” as defined in s YA 1) in respect of any subsequent refinancings of the Senior Debt over the term of the relevant refinancing, provided that the terms of any such refinancings are materially similar to the terms of the Senior Debt. This determination paragraph does not affect the Company’s obligation to perform a base price adjustment under s EW 31 at the time of each refinancing.
5.  Determination G3: Yield to maturity may be used to allocate the income and expenditure (other than “non-contingent fees” as defined in s YA 1) of the Shareholder Pre-subscription Loan (under s EW 15I if Holdings treats the Shareholder Pre-subscription Loan, in part, as an equity instrument under IFRS, or under s EW 15E if not).
6.  The expected value method in s EW 15F may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than “non-contingent fees” as defined in s YA 1) over the term of the Swaps, provided that the Swaps are not treated under IFRS by the Company as a hedge of other financial arrangements for each of which the Company uses the “fair value method” (as defined in s YA 1). None of the mandatory spreading methods in s EW 15H or s EW 15I applies to the Swaps.
7.  The expected value method in s EW 15F may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than “non-contingent fees” as described in s YA 1) in respect of any New Swaps over the term of the relevant New Swap, provided that the terms of any New Swaps are materially similar to the terms of the Swaps, and further provided that the New Swaps are not treated under IFRS by the Company as a hedge of other financial arrangements for each of which the Company uses the “fair value method” (as defined in s YA 1). None of the mandatory spreading methods in s EW 15H or s EW 15I applies to the New Swaps. This determination paragraph does not affect the Company’s obligation to perform base price adjustments under s EW 31 in respect of the Swaps and New Swaps.
8.  Determination G3: Yield to maturity may be used to allocate the income and expenditure (other than “non-contingent fees” as defined in s YA 1) of the Notes (under s EW 15I if Holdings treats the Notes, in part, as an equity instrument under IFRS, or under s EW 15E if not.
9.  If interest payable under the Notes is capitalised in accordance with the terms of the Notes, Holdings must apply the method set out in Determination G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement to calculate income or expenditure under the Notes in the year of variation and subsequent years.
10.  This determination does not determine the method that is applied to determine the income derived or expenditure incurred in respect of the investment support represented by LCs and/or cash collateral in the ECAs.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

This example is based on the following parameters:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Commencement of Construction Phase | 1 April 2013 |
| Completion of Construction Phase | 31 March 2017 |
| Completion of Services Phase | 31 March 2042 |
| Construction Payment from the Crown | $1,000 |
| Aggregate payments to the Contractor | ($850) |
| Lease Prepayment | ($1,000) |
| Monthly payments from the Crown under the Services Phase | $30 |
| Monthly payments to the Service Provider | ($15) |
| Annual interest on the Senior Debt | ($85) |
| Annual interest on the Shareholder Pre-subscription Loan | ($7) |
| Annual interest (and inflation adjustment) on the Notes | ($15) |
| Annual net payments in respect of the Swaps | ($7) |

The Company is not required to spread any amounts under the financial arrangements rules in respect of the Lease, Construction Phase of the Project Agreement, Services Phase of the Project Agreement, Construction Agreement, Operation and Maintenance Contract, or Asset Management Agreement.

The amounts that must be spread under the financial arrangement rules are:

*   interest on the Senior Debt calculated in accordance with the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D
*   interest on the Shareholder Pre-subscription Loan calculated in accordance with Determination G3: Yield to maturity
*   interest on the Notes calculated in accordance with Determination G3: Yield to maturity, and
*   payments in respect of the Swaps calculated in accordance with the expected value method in s EW 15F

This Determination is signed by me on the 27th day of August 2012.

Transfer of acquired bad debts by a certain New Zealand company to another New Zealand company in the same consolidated group and the utilisation of a profit emerging basis by the transferee company
======================================================================================================================================================================================================

Determination S23 (Nov 2012) relates to the transfer of acquired bad debts from New Zealand Company Limited to a newly incorporated company.

This determination may be cited as Special Determination S23: "Transfer of acquired bad debts by a certain New Zealand company to another New Zealand company in the same consolidated group and the utilisation of a profit emerging basis by the transferee company".

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to the transfer of acquired bad debts from New Zealand Company Limited (NZC) to a newly incorporated company, New Zealand Company (2) Limited (NZC-2). NZC and NZC-2 are members of the same consolidated group at the time the acquired bad debts are transferred.
2.  NZC originally acquired for valuable consideration pools of unpaid loans and receivables, which may consist of a few hundred to a few thousand individual debts (ABDs).
3.  NZC can use the profit emerging method of returning income and expenditure pursuant to Special Determination S17: "Utilisation of a profit emerging basis for purchased debt ledgers by a certain New Zealand Company Limited".
4.  This determination also relates to the ability of NZC-2 to utilise a profit emerging basis for returning income and expenditure arising from ABDs that are either transferred from NZC (transferred ABDs) or acquired from a person other than NZC (third-party ABDs).
5.  NZC-2 acquires the ABDs at a deep discount to their face value. NZC-2 subsequently seeks to recover the overdue balances from debtors through various means.
6.  The acquisition of an individual ABD is done on the expectation that its recoveries will be in excess of the purchase price and the cost incurred in attempting collection. Some debts may not achieve any recovery and become uncollectable, and others may be partially collected. The volatility of cash collections may be attributed to such things as the nature of the underlying debt, its age and type, as well as external economic conditions and the effort applied.
7.  NZC-2 will apply NZ IFRS 9 to ABDs for financial reporting purposes.
8.  This determination provides that NZC-2's contribution to the assessable income and tax liability of the consolidated group for an income year will be based on actual collections reduced by the proportion of purchase cost allocated to that income year.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb) and 90AC(1)(j) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to the tax treatment by NZC of transferred ABDs, which were transferred to a member of the same consolidated group. NZC and the transferee company, NZC-2, were not members of the same consolidated group for the whole of the income year of transfer.
2.  The determination also applies to the tax treatment by NZC-2 of both transferred ABDs and third-party ABDs.
3.  ABDs are pools of unpaid loans and receivables. These pools may consist of a few hundred to a few thousand individual debts.
4.  NZC originally acquired the transferred ABDs at a deep discount to their face value on the expectation that its recoveries would be in excess of the purchase price and the cost incurred in attempting collection. NZC applied the profit emerging basis for the recognition of income and deduction of expenditure on the transferred ABDs pursuant to Special Determination S17: "Utilisation of a profit emerging basis for purchased debt ledgers by a certain New Zealand Company Limited".
5.  NZC-2 will apply NZ IFRS 9 to ABDs for financial reporting purposes.
6.  This determination is made subject to the following conditions:
    1.  NZC-2 is satisfied on the basis of objective criteria that a period of no less than five years and no more than seven years is the appropriate period over which cashflows from a third-party ABD are to be forecast. This period is to be ascertained at the time of purchase of the ABD and must match the accounting spreading period for that ABD, and
    2.  NZC-2 will not take a deduction for the acquisition cost of either a transferred ABD or a third-party ABD (or any part thereof) except as set out in this determination, and
    3.  NZC-2 treats all underlying debts to which it becomes a party on the acquisition of either a transferred ABD or a third-party ABD (which would otherwise be excepted financial arrangements) as financial arrangements under s EW 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### 4\. Principle

1.  NZC will recognise all income and expenditure on the ABDs using a profit emerging basis for the part income year prior to forming the consolidated group in its separate return of income under s FM 14 of the Income Tax Act and ss 33 and 92 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.
2.  NZC will perform a base price adjustment pursuant to s EW 31, as modified by s FM 19, when the ABDs are transferred to NZC-2. The consideration for the transfer will be the tax book value of the ABDs on the date of transfer, pursuant to s FM 19(2).
3.  All underlying debts to which NZC-2 becomes a party on the acquisition of an ABD are either financial arrangements as defined in s EW 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 or are treated as financial arrangements by NZC-2 under s EW 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007.
4.  This determination specifies that income and expenditure from an ABD for an income year is to be recognised by NZC-2 using a profit emerging method. This method takes into account actual cash flows less an apportionment of the cost of purchase.
5.  The apportionment of the purchase cost of a third-party ABD is based on the original forecasted recoveries for the income year as a proportion of the total original forecasted recoveries from the ABD over a period of no less than five years and no more than seven years.
6.  For transferred ABDs, NZC-2 will be allowed a deduction in the income years following the transfer for the amount apportioned to the relevant income year as set out in the original forecast for the ABD by NZC.
7.  Any cash collections on ABDs will be returned as income in the income year in which they are received.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination (and the Explanation), unless the context otherwise requires:

1.  Words and expressions that are not defined elsewhere in the determination have the same meaning as in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007
2.  "NZ IFRS 9" means the New Zealand Equivalent to International Financial Reporting Standard 9 - Financial Instruments, or equivalent as updated or changed from time to time".

### 6\. Method

#### Profit emerging method

The profit emerging method is illustrated in the following formula:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| AI = AC \- | (PC x OF)  <br>TECC |

  
Where:

*   AI  = assessable income of an ABD for an income year  
    AC = actual cash collected from the ABD during the income year  
    PC = purchase costs of ABD  
    OF = original cash forecasted to be collected during the income year  
    TECC = total expected cash to be collected over the spreading period, forecast at date of purchase

Once the cost of the ABD is fully amortised, cash collected after the spreading period will be treated as derived in the income year in which it is received.

#### Base price adjustment calculation

The base price adjustment calculation arising upon the transfer of ABDs from NZC to NZC-2, members of the same consolidated group at the date of transfer (but not for the whole income year), is illustrated in the following formula:

*   BPA = C \- I + E + AR

Where:

*   C = Consideration
    *   \= total cash collected + consideration for transfer \- purchase cost
*   Consideration for transfer = PC \- D \- (F x 336 / 366)
*   PC = purchase costs of ABD
*   D = total deductions allowed in prior income years for the ABD
*   F = NZC's original forecast deduction for the ABD for the whole of the 2012 income year, expressed as PC x OF / TECC
*   I = income
*   E = expenditure
*   AR = amounts remitted

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method (set out in this determination) for determining the income and expenditure attributable to a transferred ABD in each income year. Balance date is 30 June.

This example uses the following parameters.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Purchase date | 1 July 2009 |
| ABD purchase cost (PC) | 1,000,000 |
| Forecast cash collection (OF) |     |
| Year 1 | 1,068,000 |
| Year 2 | 582,000 |
| Year 3 | 274,000 |
| Year 4 | 58,000 |
| Year 5 | 18,000 |
| Total expected cash collected over five years (TECC) | 2,000,000 |
| Actual cash collection |     |
| Year 1 | 1,106,000 |
| Year 2 | 600,000 |
| Year 3 | 293,000 |
| Year 4 | 88,000 |
| Year 5 | 20,800 |
| Year 6 | 6,800 |
| Year 7 | 500 |

**BPA = 852**

Where:

*   AC = 1,601 (for this example the amount is based on 2/366 days, actual cash collected to be used by NZC)
*   (PC x OF / TECC) x 2 / 366 days = 749
*   Consideration for transfer = 1,000,000 \- (825,000 + (137,000 x 336 / 366)) = 49,229

### Appendix 4. Taxable income of NZC-2 from 1 June 2012

Application of the financial arrangements rules to the sale of shares in Meridian by the Crown
==============================================================================================

Determination S24 (19 Sep 2013) relates to the application of the financial arrangements rules to the sale of shares in Meridian by the Crown.

This determination may be cited as Special Determination S24: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the sale of shares in Meridian by the Crown

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to an arrangement involving the sale of up to 49% of the ordinary shares (the Shares) in Meridian Energy Limited (Meridian) by the Minister of State Owned Enterprises and the Minister of Finance on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen in Right of New Zealand (the Crown) as vendor to purchasers (IR Holders), pursuant to the terms of the Retail Offer and the Institutional Offer contained in a combined Investment Statement and Prospectus (the Offer Document).
2.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Determination does not apply to the Participating Iwi Offer contained in the Offer Document. This determination also does not apply to holders of Instalment Receipts to the extent to which the Shares to which those Instalment Receipts relate are held by an Australian trustee entity.
3.  The purchase price will be paid in two instalments (the First Instalment and the Final Instalment). All Shares sold under the Offer Document (other than Shares sold to applicants whose address as recorded in the Instalment Receipt register (Registered Address) is in Australia) will be held in trust by a New Zealand trustee entity until payment of the Final Instalment. Upon payment of the First Instalment, an IR Holder will receive an instalment receipt for each Share acquired under the Offer Document (the Instalment Receipt), which will be evidence of the IR Holder's beneficial interest in that Share.
4.  Instalment Receipts will be tradable and are expected to be listed on the New Zealand and Australian stock exchanges. The Final Instalment will be payable by the holder of the Instalment Receipt on the Final Instalment Payment Date (which will be approximately 18 months after the Instalment Receipts are issued).
5.  IR Holders will be entitled to receive dividends paid by Meridian on the underlying Shares. If the Final Instalment is not paid on time, penalty interest may be charged.
6.  The arrangement is the subject of product ruling BR Prd 13/11 issued on 19 September 2013, and is fully described in that ruling.
7.  The arrangement for the sale of the Meridian Shares is a financial arrangement and an "agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services" (as defined in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007). The Meridian Shares are excepted financial arrangements, as defined in s EW 5(13), and form part of that financial arrangement.
8.  An amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in any of ss EW 5(2) to (16) is not an amount taken into account under the financial arrangements rules. This determination prescribes the method to be used for determining the amount that is solely attributable to the Shares.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3.Scope of determination

This determination applies to the sale of Meridian Shares by the Crown, the sale or purchase of Instalment Receipts by IR Holders on the relevant stock exchange and the acquisition of the Shares by the IR Holders on payment of the Final Instalment.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The sale of the Meridian Shares is a financial arrangement and an "agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services" (as defined in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007). The Meridian Shares are excepted financial arrangements, as defined in s EW 5(13), and form part of that financial arrangement.
2.  Any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in ss EW 5(2) to (16) is not an amount that is taken into account under the financial arrangements rules (s EW 6(2)).
3.  This determination specifies that the amounts that are solely attributable to the Meridian Shares, which are not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules, are:
    1.  any dividends paid by Meridian in relation to the underlying Shares; and
    2.  any gain or loss made by an IR Holder who buys or sells an Instalment Receipt on the stock exchange or who receives the Shares on payment of the Final Instalment.
4.  Any penalty interest charged for late payment of the Final Instalment will not be solely attributable to the Meridian Shares.
5.  Due to the amounts set out in (3) being solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement (the Meridian Shares), no income or expenditure will arise for any IR Holder under the financial arrangements rules (other than an IR Holder who is required to pay penalty interest for the late payment of the Final Instalment). This is because the consideration paid or payable to the IR Holder will equal the consideration paid or payable by the IR Holder.
6.  Any gain or loss made by an IR Holder may be subject to other provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 (outside of the financial arrangements rules). Any IR Holder is required to fulfil their obligations under those other provisions of the Act.

### 5\. Interpretation

This determination has no specialised terms that need to be defined further.  

### 6\. Method

1.  The amounts that are solely attributable to the Meridian Shares are:
    1.  any dividends paid by Meridian in relation to the underlying Shares; and
    2.  any gain or loss made by an IR Holder who buys or sells an Instalment Receipt on the stock exchange or who acquires the Shares on payment of the Final Instalment.
2.  All other amounts paid or payable under the arrangement, including any penalty interest charged for late payment of the Final Instalment, will not be solely attributable to the Meridian Shares.

### 7\. Examples

These examples illustrate the application of the method set out in this determination. The figures and values used in these examples are indicative only and cannot be relied on as an indication of the expected value of Instalment Receipts or Meridian Shares.

#### Example A

An IR Holder acquires an Instalment Receipt under the Offer Document for $2.00. The IR Holder sells the Instalment Receipt on the stock market to a third party for $3.20. The IR Holder makes a realised gain from the sale of $1.20. The IR Holder does not receive any dividends in the period that they are holding the Instalment Receipt.

The gain of $1.20 is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement (the Meridian Shares) and is not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules.

#### Example B

A purchaser buys an Instalment Receipt on the stock market for $3.20. The purchaser holds that receipt until the Final Instalment Payment Date, and pays the Final Instalment of $1.80. The purchaser receives the Meridian Shares from the trust, which are valued at $6.00 on the date of receipt. The purchaser therefore has an unrealised gain of $1.00.

The purchaser also receives dividends from Meridian during the period that they hold the Instalment Receipt.

The gain of $1.00 and the dividends received from Meridian are solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement (the Meridian Shares) and are not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules.

#### Example C

A purchaser buys an Instalment Receipt on the stock market for $3.00. Three months later, the purchaser sells the Instalment Receipt on the stock market for $2.60. The purchaser has a realised loss of $0.40. The purchaser receives a dividend from Meridian during the period that they hold the Instalment Receipt.

The loss of $0.40 and the dividend received from Meridian are solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement (the Meridian Shares) and are not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules.

This Determination is signed by me on the 19th day of September 2013.

Valuation of Shares Issued by Bank and HoldCo Following a Non-Viability Trigger Event
=====================================================================================

Determination S25 (10 Mar 2014) relates to a funding transaction involving the issue of notes by a bank to the public pursuant to a deed poll.

This determination may be cited as Special Determination S25: Valuation of Shares Issued by Bank and HoldCo Following a Non-Viability Trigger Event.

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to a funding transaction involving the issue of Notes by the Bank to the public pursuant to a Deed Poll. The Notes will contain an exchange mechanism, in order to allow them to be recognised as Tier 2 capital for the purposes of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and Australian Prudential Regulation Authority frameworks relating to the capital adequacy of banks.
2.  At the same time that the Notes are entered into, Bank, HoldCo and Parent will enter into a Co-ordination Agreement, which will set out the steps that will occur if a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, requiring exchange of the Notes.
3.  If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, the relevant number of Notes must be immediately and irrevocably exchanged for ordinary shares in Parent. The Co-ordination Agreement provides for a series of share subscriptions and payments from Bank to HoldCo and from HoldCo to Parent.
4.  The Arrangement is the subject of private ruling BR Prv 14/06 issued on 10 March 2014, and is fully described in that ruling.
5.  The share subscriptions provided for in the Co-ordination Agreement are each a financial arrangement (as defined in s EW 3) and an "agreement for the sale and purchase or property or services" (as defined in s YA 1). The Notes and the Co-ordination Agreement are, together, a wider financial arrangement.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under s 90AC(1)(i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to a funding transaction involving the issue of Notes by the Bank to the public pursuant to a Deed Poll. At the same time that the Notes are entered into, Bank, HoldCo and Parent will enter into a Co-ordination Agreement, which will set out the steps that will occur if a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, requiring exchange of the Notes.
2.  If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, the relevant number of Notes must be immediately and irrevocably exchanged. In summary, the steps for the exchange of the Notes will be as follows:
    1.  Each Note (subject to the exchange requirement) will be immediately transferred by the holder to HoldCo.
    2.  In consideration for the holders transferring their Notes to HoldCo, Parent will allot and issue a specified "exchange number" of Parent ordinary shares to such holders for each Note assigned.
    3.  Immediately following the transfer referred to in (a), the Notes will become immediately due and payable and Bank will be required to repay the Face Value of the Notes to HoldCo as assignee. Under the terms of the Co-ordination Agreement, the Face Value owed to HoldCo will be repaid by being applied on HoldCo’s behalf to subscribe for ordinary shares in Bank. The number of ordinary shares in Bank to be subscribed for will be calculated in accordance with a formula in the Co-ordination Agreement.
    4.  Under the Co-ordination Agreement, HoldCo will be required to pay a sum to Parent equal to the Face Value of each Note assigned to it. This amount will be automatically applied on Parent’s behalf to subscribe for ordinary shares in HoldCo. The number of ordinary shares in HoldCo to be subscribed for will be calculated in accordance with a formula in the Co-ordination Agreement.
3.  This determination applies in the situation that shares are issued by Bank and HoldCo following a Non-Viability Trigger Event, to determine the value of the shares for the purposes of the financial arrangement rules.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Co-ordination Agreement and Notes are, together, a financial arrangement (as defined in s EW 3). The subscription for shares in Bank by HoldCo and the subscription for shares in HoldCo by Parent contained in the Co-ordination Agreement are both an "agreement for the sale and purchase of property and services" (as defined in s YA 1), as they are conditional agreements to acquire property.
2.  The share subscriptions are not a "short-term agreement for sale and purchase" (as defined in s YA 1), as settlement will not occur within 93 days of the Co-ordination Agreement being entered into. As such, they are not excepted financial arrangements under s EW 5.
3.  For the purposes of determining the consideration paid or payable under the financial arrangements rules, the value of the shares issued by Bank and HoldCo must be established under s EW 32. None of subs (3) to (5) of s EW 32 apply to the share subscriptions.
4.  Under s EW 32(6), the Commissioner is required to determine the value of the property. Both parties are required to use this amount.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

*   "Bank" means the bank issuing the Notes.
*   "HoldCo" means the parent company of Bank.
*   "Non-Viability Trigger Event" has the meaning set out in the terms of the Deed Poll and as described in private ruling BR Prv 14/06, issued on 10 March 2014.
*   "Notes" means Notes issued to the public by the Bank pursuant to a Deed Poll.
*   "Parent" means the parent company of HoldCo.
*   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.

### 6\. Method

1.  The Arrangement does not involve the advancement or deferral of income or expenditure.
2.  For the purposes of s EW 32(6), the value of the shares issued by Bank is equal to the amount HoldCo paid for those shares, and the value of the shares issued by HoldCo is equal to the amount Parent paid for those shares.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

Following a Non-Viability Trigger Event, Notes having a face value of $100 are transferred to HoldCo by the holders of the Notes.

Bank immediately repays the face value of the Notes to HoldCo. This amount is automatically applied on HoldCo’s behalf to subscribe for ordinary shares in Bank. Bank issues the number of shares to HoldCo calculated in accordance with the formula in the Co-ordination Agreement. The value of the shares, for the purposes of s EW 32, is $100.

HoldCo then pays an amount equal to the face value of the Notes to Parent. This amount is automatically applied on Parent’s behalf to subscribe for ordinary shares in HoldCo. HoldCo issues the number of shares to Parent calculated in accordance with the formula in the Co-ordination Agreement. The value of the shares, for the purposes of s EW 32, is $100.

This Determination is signed by me on the 10th day of March 2014.

Valuation of Shares Issued by Bank Following a Trigger Event
============================================================

Determination S26 (15 Apr 2014) relates to the valuation of shares issued by a bank following a non-viability trigger event.

This determination may be cited as Special Determination S26: Valuation of Shares issued by Bank following a Trigger Event.

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to a funding transaction involving the issue of Notes by Bank to Issuer. The Notes will contain a conversion mechanism, in order to allow them to be recognised as Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital for the purposes of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) frameworks relating to the capital adequacy of banks.
2.  Bank and Issuer will enter into a Deed Poll, which will set out the steps that will occur in the event that a Trigger Event occurs, requiring conversion of the Notes.
3.  If a Trigger Event occurs, the relevant number of Notes may be immediately and irrevocably converted into ordinary shares in Bank.
4.  The Arrangement is the subject of private ruling BR Prv 14/15 issued on 15 April 2014, and is fully described in that ruling.
5.  The share subscriptions provided for in the Deed Poll are each a financial arrangement (as defined in s EW 3) and an "agreement for the sale and purchase or property or services" (as defined in s YA 1). The Notes and the share subscriptions are, together, a wider financial arrangement.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under s 90AC(1)(i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to a funding transaction involving the issue of Notes by Bank to Issuer. Bank and Issuer will enter into a Deed Poll, which will set out the steps that will occur in the event that a Trigger Event occurs, requiring conversion of the Notes into shares in Bank
2.  If a Trigger Event occurs, the relevant number of Notes may be immediately and irrevocably converted into shares in the Bank. In summary, the steps for the conversion of the Notes will be as follows:
    1.  Each Note (subject to conversion) will become immediately due and payable and Bank will be required to repay the Face Value of the Note and, in the case of Tier 2 Notes, all accrued but unpaid interest on the relevant series of Tier 2 Notes, to Issuer.
    2.  Under the terms of the Deed Poll, Issuer will be required to pay a sum to Bank equal to the face value of each Note converted and, in the case of Tier 2 Notes, all accrued but unpaid interest on the relevant series of Tier 2 Notes, to subscribe for ordinary shares in Bank.
    3.  The number of ordinary shares in Bank to be subscribed for will be calculated in accordance with a formula set out in the Deed Poll.
3.  This determination applies in the situation that shares are issued by Bank to Issuer following a Trigger Event, and the net tangible assets of Bank are positive immediately prior to the conversion of Notes into ordinary shares in Bank (such that the "NTA" item in the "Value per Share" formula as set out in the Deed Poll is not deemed to be NZ$1,000,000) to determine the value of the shares for the purposes of the financial arrangement rules.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The share subscriptions and the Notes are, together, a financial arrangement (as defined in s EW 3). The subscription for shares in Bank by Issuer contained in the Deed Poll is an "agreement for the sale and purchase of property and services" (as defined in s YA 1), as they are conditional agreements to acquire property.
2.  The share subscriptions are not a "short-term agreement for sale and purchase" (as defined in s YA 1), as settlement will not occur within 93 days of the Deed Poll being entered into. As such, they are not excepted financial arrangements under s EW 5.
3.  For the purposes of determining the consideration paid or payable under the financial arrangements rules, the value of the shares issued by Bank must be established under s EW 32. None of subs (3) to (5) apply to the share subscriptions.
4.  Under s EW 32(6), the Commissioner is required to determine the value of the property. Both Bank and Issuer are required to use this amount.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

*   "Bank" means the bank issuing the Notes.
*   "Issuer" means a sister company of Bank.
*   "Trigger Event" has the meaning set out in the Deed Poll, as described in private ruling BR Prv 14/15, issued on 15 April 2014.
*   "Notes" means the Notes issued to Issuer as described in private ruling BR Prv 14/15, issued on 15 April 2014.
*   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.

### 6\. Method

1.  The Arrangement does not involve the advancement or deferral of consideration.
2.  For the purposes of s EW 32(6), the value of the shares issued by Bank is equal to the amount paid for those shares by Issuer where the net tangible assets of Bank are positive immediately prior to the conversion of Notes into ordinary shares in Bank (and not deemed to be NZ$1,000,000 in the "Value per Share" formula as set out in the Deed Poll).

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

Following a Trigger Event, Notes with a face value of $100 are to be converted to ordinary shares in Bank. Bank immediately repays the face value of the Notes and, if the Notes are Tier 2 Notes, all accrued but unpaid interest on the relevant series of Tier 2 Notes, to Issuer.

Issuer pays an amount equal to the face value of the Notes and, if the Notes are Tier 2 Notes, all accrued but unpaid interest on the relevant series of Tier 2 Notes, to Bank to subscribe for ordinary shares in Bank. Bank issues the number of shares to Issuer calculated in accordance with the formula set out in the Deed Poll. The value of the shares, for the purposes of s EW 32, is $100 plus, in the case of Tier 2 Notes, the amount of interest paid by Bank to Issuer upon conversion.

This Determination is signed by me on the 15th day of April 2014.

Convertible Notes in respect of a limited partnership interest
==============================================================

Determination S27 covers convertible notes in a limited partnership interest – replaced by s27A on 8 Sep 2015.

This determination may be cited as Special Determination S27: Convertible Notes in respect of a limited partnership interest.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Note |     |
| This determination was varied and replaced by Special Determination s27A on 8 September 2015. It therefore applies for the period from 25 July 2014 to 8 September 2015. |     |

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to the subordinated convertible notes (Convertible Notes) issued by the Holding Partnership to Limited Partner A which will convert to a 45% partnership interest at a single or several nominated dates in the future to match the partnership contributions by Limited Partner B and some of the partnership contributions by Limited Partner C. The Convertible Notes are being issued to provide equity funding to the Holding Partnership as part of an arrangement (the Project) involving the finance, design, construction and ongoing operation of the facility by the Partnership under a public-private partnership agreement with the Crown.
2.  Limited Partner A and Limited Partner C have agreed that Limited Partner A will have the option to sell up to 9.9% of the equity interest in LP1 (along with up to 9.9% of the shareholding in General Partner 1, in equal proportions) to Limited Partner C. It is envisaged that if the option is exercised it will be exercised after the Convertible Note has converted to committed capital, noting that early exercise rights do exist in limited situations.
3.  The Convertible Notes will earn a fixed rate of interest that is payable monthly (Coupon Interest Payments) until the Convertible Notes are converted. The Coupon Interest Payments will be capitalised on each interest payment date but will be paid to Limited Partner A on the first partnership distribution date, and therefore will not convert to a partnership interest.
4.  The conversion to a partnership interest will be effected by way of a mandatory set off. Limited Partner A’s obligation to make its capital contribution(s) will be satisfied by setting off that obligation against the Holding Partnership’s obligation to repay that portion of the Convertible Notes equal to the capital contribution(s) required to be made on the relevant date.
5.  The rate of interest will be an arm’s length rate determined under an agreed rate setting process.
6.  No commitment fees or upfront fees are payable on the Convertible Notes.
7.  In accordance with s EW 6(2) an amount (whether it is income, consideration, gain, loss or expenditure) that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement is not taken into account under the financial arrangement rules.
8.  As an interest in a partnership is an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(11), only the Coupon Interest Payments are regarded as income or expenditure for the purposes of calculating accrual income or expenditure.
9.  This Determination prescribes a method for determining the part of the consideration receivable by the parties to the arrangement that is solely attributable to the excepted financial arrangement as well as the method for spreading the accrual income, gain or loss, or expenditure under the financial arrangement rules.

### 2\. Reference

1.  This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb) and 90 AC(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to the Convertible Notes issued by the Holding Partnership to Limited Partner A as part of the Project (which is set out in detail in Private Rulings BR Prv 14/31 and BR Prv 14/32 issued on 25 July 2014). The terms of the Convertible Notes are as follows:
    *   Limited Partner A will loan an amount to the Holding Partnership (subject to the prevailing market rates at Financial Close) with repayment being set off against the obligation to make capital contribution(s) in respect of a 45% interest in the Holding Partnership at a single or several nominated dates in the future. The Convertible Notes will have a face value equal to 45% of the total equity requirement (being all of Limited Partner A’s 45% interest in the Holding Partnership).
    *   The Convertible Notes will earn a fixed rate of interest that is payable monthly until conversion, defined as the construction swap rate exclusive of charges, plus a margin. For Financial Close, the construction swap rate will be calculated based on the prevailing swap rates as determined by standard market methodology.
    *   The Coupon Interest Payments will be capitalised on each interest payment date, and paid out to Limited Partner A on the first partnership distribution date, that is, the Coupon Interest Payments will not convert to a partnership interest.
    *   The rate of interest will be an arm’s length rate determined under an agreed rate set process.
    *   No commitment fees or upfront fees are payable on the Convertible Notes.
    *   The Convertible Notes (and any interest payable on the Convertible Note) are subordinated to senior debt. After conversion of the Convertible Notes, Limited Partner A will rank equally with Holding Partnership contributions made by the other limited partners.
2.  This determination is made subject to the condition that the executed documentation is not materially different from the final documentation that was provided to Inland Revenue on 23 July 2014 to the extent that it impacts on the scope of the determination or the application of the financial arrangement rules to the Applicants and the scope of the determination.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Convertible Notes have both debt and partnership interest components. They can be regarded alternatively as:
    *   a loan to a partnership with repayment by way of an interest in a partnership (debt component); or
    *   a forward purchase of a partnership interest (in which case the holder of the Convertible Notes is buying an interest in the partnership).

The financial arrangement rules in the Act classify an interest in a partnership as an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(11).

2.  As the Convertible Notes have this dual character, when calculating income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to the Convertible Notes it is first necessary to separate the debt and partnership interest components of the Convertible Notes.
3.  This determination specifies that, apart from the Coupon Interest Payments, all amounts relate to the underlying interest in a partnership, and will not be dealt with under the financial arrangement rules (subpart EW) when calculating income derived or expenditure incurred.
4.  Income and expenditure in respect of the Convertible Notes is calculated by daily apportionment of the Coupon Interest Payment to income years in accordance with Determination G1A: Apportionment of Daily Income and Expenditure.
5.  For the purposes of this determination it is assumed that any change in the market value of the interest in the partnership between the issue date of the Convertible Notes and the conversion into the partnership interest relates to the partnership interest component and therefore can be ignored when calculating income derived or expenditure incurred under the financial arrangements rules.

### 5\. Interpretation

1.  In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:
    *   "Coupon Interest Payment" means any amount payable on the Convertible Notes by the Convertible Note issuer (borrower) to the Convertible Note holder (lender) other than payments relating to the redemption or conversion of the Convertible Notes.
    *   "Financial Close” has the same meaning as set out in the Project Agreement referred to in Private Rulings BR Prv 14/31 and BR Prv 14/32.
    *   "Limited Partner A" is the holder of the Convertible Notes.
    *   "the Holding Partnership" is the issuer of the Convertible Notes.
    *   "Subordinated Convertible Notes" or "Convertible Notes" means the arrangement described in clause 3(1) of this determination.
    *   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
2.  For convenience, words and phrases defined in this determination are indicated by initial capital letters, but the absence of a capital letter shall not alone imply that the word or phrase is used with a meaning different from that given by its definition.

### 6\. Method

1.  Amounts to be included when calculating income or expenditure under the financial arrangements rules with regard to the Convertible Notes in respect of income, gain or loss, or expenditure, and also of any other consideration receivable by the holder or payable by the issuer, consist of the Coupon Interest Payments.
2.  The income derived or expenditure incurred in respect of the Convertible Notes shall be calculated by daily apportionment of the Coupon Interest Payments to income years. The required method is outlined in Determination G1A: Apportionment of Daily Income and Expenditure.
3.  All other income, gain, loss, expenditure or consideration paid under or with respect to the wider financial arrangement is solely attributable to the excepted financial arrangement component of the wider financial arrangement.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

The example assumes the following:

*   On 1 April 2014 a Convertible Note is issued to the holder for $1,000 with an interest coupon set at the arm’s length interest rate of 8.5%. The Convertible Note will convert to a 45% interest in a partnership on 31 March 2019.
*   The conversion to a partnership interest will be effected by way of a mandatory set off. The holder’s obligation to make its capital contribution will be satisfied by setting off that obligation against the issuer’s obligation to repay the Convertible Note.
*   Coupon payments accrue monthly, in arrears and are compounding. Interest will be paid to the holder on the first partnership distribution date.
*   On the date of issue, the limited partners have agreed that the market value of a 45% partnership interest on 31 March 2019 is $1,000.00.
*   The parties use a 31 March balance date and apply Determination G1A on a 365 day basis when apportioning daily income and expenditure.
*   The annual sum of Coupon Interest Payments is as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 31 March 2015 | 88.39 |
| 31 March 201 | 96.20 |
| 31 March 2017 | 104.71 |
| 31 March 2018 | 113.96 |
| 31 March 2019 | 124.04 |
|     | **527.30** |

The amounts that must be spread under the financial arrangements rules are the Coupon Interest Payments which shall be apportioned using the method outlined in _Determination G1A: Apportionment of Daily Income and Expenditure_.

This Determination is signed by me on the 25th day of July 2014.

Convertible notes in respect of a limited partnership interest
==============================================================

Determination S27A (8 Sep 2015) relates to convertible notes in respect of a limited partnership interest.

This determination was replaced by [Special Determination 27B: Convertible Notes in Respect of a Limited Partnership Interest](/determinations/financial-arrangements/special/s27b)
, December 2020.

This determination may be cited as Special Determination S27A: Convertible Notes in respect of a limited partnership interest.

This determination was replaced by [Special Determination 27B: Convertible Notes in Respect of a Limited Partnership Interest](/determinations/financial-arrangements/special/s27b)
, December 2020. 

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination varies and replaces _Special Determination S27: Convertible Notes in respect of a limited partnership_ _interest_ following a change of partners in the limited partnership.
2.  This determination relates to the subordinated convertible notes (Convertible Notes) issued by the Holding Partnership to Limited Partner A which will convert to a 45% partnership interest at a single or several nominated dates in the future to match the partnership contributions by Limited Partner B and some of the partnership contributions by Limited Partner C.  The Convertible Notes are being issued to provide equity funding to the Holding Partnership as part of an arrangement (the Project) involving the finance, design, construction and ongoing operation of the Facility by the Partnership under a public-private partnership agreement with the Crown. 

3.  Limited Partner C intends to transfer their interest in the Holding Partnership to Limited Partner C1 in late 2015.  This determination applies to:
    1.  Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B from the date of signing;
    2.  Limited Partner C from the date of signing until the date that they transfer their interest to Limited Partner C1; and
    3.  Limited Partner C1 from the date that the interest is transferred to them.

4.  Limited Partner A and Limited Partner C1 have agreed that Limited Partner A will have the option to sell up to 9.9% of the equity interest in the Holding Partnership (along with up to 9.9% of the shareholding in General Partner 1, in equal proportions) to Limited Partner C1.  It is envisaged that if the option is exercised it will be exercised after the Convertible Note has converted to committed capital, noting that early exercise rights do exist in limited situations. 
5.  The Convertible Notes will earn a fixed rate of interest that is payable monthly (Coupon Interest Payments) until the Convertible Notes are converted. The Coupon Interest Payments will be capitalised on each interest payment date but will be paid to Limited Partner A on the first partnership distribution date, and therefore will not convert to a partnership interest.
6.  The conversion to a partnership interest will be effected by way of a mandatory set off.  Limited Partner A's obligation to make its capital contribution(s) will be satisfied by setting off that obligation against the Holding Partnership's obligation to repay that portion of the Convertible Notes equal to the capital contribution(s) required to be made on the relevant date.
7.  The rate of interest will be an arm's length rate determined under an agreed rate setting process.
8.  No commitment fees or upfront fees are payable on the Convertible Notes.
9.  In accordance with s EW 6(2) an amount (whether it is income, consideration, gain, loss or expenditure) that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement is not taken into account under the financial arrangement rules.
10.  As an interest in a partnership is an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(11), only the Coupon Interest Payments are regarded as income or expenditure for the purposes of calculating accrual income or expenditure.
11.  This Determination prescribes a method for determining the part of the consideration receivable by the parties to the arrangement that is solely attributable to the excepted financial arrangement as well as the method for spreading the accrual income, gain or loss, or expenditure under the financial arrangement rules.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb) and 90AC(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This determination varies and replaces _Special Determination S27A: Convertible Notes in respect of a limited partnership interest_ and applies to:

1.  Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B from the date of signing;
2.  Limited Partner C from the date of signing until the date that they transfer their interest to Limited Partner C1; and
3.  Limited Partner C1 from the date that the interest is transferred to them.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to the Convertible Notes issued by the Holding Partnership to Limited Partner A as part of the Project (which is set out in detail in Private Rulings BR Prv 15/38 and BR Prv 15/39 issued on 8 September 2015). The terms of the Convertible Notes are as follows:
    1.  Limited Partner A will loan an amount to the Holding Partnership (subject to the prevailing market rates at Financial Close) with repayment being set off against the  obligation to make capital contribution(s) in respect of a 45% interest in the Holding Partnership at a single or several nominated dates in the future.  The Convertible Notes will have a face value equal to 45% of the total equity requirement (being all of Limited Partner A's 45% interest in the Holding Partnership). 
    2.  The Convertible Notes will earn a fixed rate of interest that is payable monthly until conversion, defined as the construction swap rate exclusive of charges, plus a margin.  For Financial Close, the construction swap rate will be calculated based on the prevailing swap rates as determined by standard market methodology. 
    3.  The Coupon Interest Payments will be capitalised on each interest payment date, and paid out to Limited Partner A on the first partnership distribution date, that is, the Coupon Interest Payments will not convert to a partnership interest.
    4.  The rate of interest will be an arm's length rate determined under an agreed rate set process.
    5.  No commitment fees or upfront fees are payable on the Convertible Notes.
    6.  The Convertible Notes (and any interest payable on the Convertible Note) are subordinated to senior debt.  After conversion of the Convertible Notes, Limited Partner A will rank equally with Holding Partnership contributions made by the other limited partners. 

2.  This determination is made subject to the condition that the executed documentation is not materially different from the final documentation that was provided to Inland Revenue on 23 July 2014 to the extent that it impacts on the scope of the determination or the application of the financial arrangement rules to the Applicants and the scope of the determination.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Convertible Notes have both debt and partnership interest components. They can be regarded alternatively as:
    1.  a loan to a partnership with repayment by way of an interest in a partnership (debt component); or
    2.  a forward purchase of a partnership interest (in which case the holder of the Convertible Notes is buying an interest in the partnership).
2.  The financial arrangement rules in the Act classify an interest in a partnership as an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(11).

2.  As the Convertible Notes have this dual character, when calculating income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to the Convertible Notes it is first necessary to separate the debt and partnership interest components of the Convertible Notes.
3.  This determination specifies that, apart from the Coupon Interest Payments, all amounts relate to the underlying interest in a partnership, and will not be dealt with under the financial arrangement rules (subpart EW) when calculating income derived or expenditure incurred.
4.  Income and expenditure in respect of the Convertible Notes is calculated by daily apportionment of the Coupon Interest Payment to income years in accordance with _Determination G1A: Apportionment of Daily Income and Expenditure_.
5.  For the purposes of this determination it is assumed that any change in the market value of the interest in the partnership between the issue date of the Convertible Notes and the conversion into the partnership interest relates to the partnership interest component and therefore can be ignored when calculating income derived or expenditure incurred under the financial arrangements rules.

### 5\. Interpretation

1.  In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:
    *   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
    *   **Coupon Interest Payment** means any amount payable on the Convertible Notes by the Convertible Note issuer (borrower) to the Convertible Note holder (lender) other than payments relating to the redemption or conversion of the Convertible Notes.
    *   **Financial Close** has the same meaning as set out in the Project Agreement referred to in Private Rulings BR Prv 15/38 and BR Prv 15/39. 
    *   **Limited Partner A** is the holder of the Convertible Notes
    *   **the Holding Partnership** is the issuer of the Convertible Notes
    *   **Subordinated Convertible Notes** or **Convertible Notes** means the arrangement described in clause 3(1) of this determination.

2.  For convenience, words and phrases defined in this determination are indicated by initial capital letters, but the absence of a capital letter shall not alone imply that the word or phrase is used with a meaning different from that given by its definition.

### 6\. Method

1.  Amounts to be included when calculating income or expenditure under the financial arrangements rules with regard to the Convertible Notes in respect of income, gain or loss, or expenditure, and also of any other consideration receivable by the holder or payable by the issuer, consist of the Coupon Interest Payments.
2.  The income derived or expenditure incurred in respect of the Convertible Notes shall be calculated by daily apportionment of the Coupon Interest Payments to income years. The required method is outlined in _Determination G1A: Apportionment of Daily Income and Expenditure_.
3.  All other income, gain, loss, expenditure or consideration paid under or with respect to the wider financial arrangement is solely attributable to the excepted financial arrangement component of the wider financial arrangement.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

The example assumes the following:

*   On 1 April 2014 a Convertible Note is issued to the holder for $1,000 with an interest coupon set at the arm's length interest rate of 8.5%. The Convertible Note will convert to a 45% interest in a partnership on 31 March 2019.
*   The conversion to a partnership interest will be effected by way of a mandatory set off.  The holder's obligation to make its capital contribution will be satisfied by setting off that obligation against the issuer's obligation to repay the Convertible Note.
*   Coupon payments accrue monthly, in arrears and are compounding. Interest will be paid to the holder on the first partnership distribution date.
*   On the date of issue, the limited partners have agreed that the market value of a 45% partnership interest on 31 March 2019 is $1,000.00.
*   The parties use a 31 March balance date and apply Determination G1A on a 365 day basis when apportioning daily income and expenditure.
*   The annual sum of Coupon Interest Payments is as follows:
*     
    
    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | 31 March 2015 | 88.39 |
    | 31 March 2016 | 96.20 |
    | 31 March 2017 | 104.71 |
    | 31 March 2018 | 113.96 |
    | 31 March 2019 | 124.04 |
    |     | **527.30** |
    
    The amounts that must be spread under the financial arrangements rules are the Coupon Interest Payments which shall be apportioned using the method outlined in _Determination G1A: Apportionment of Daily Income and Expenditure_.

DETERMINATIONS > FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS > SPECIAL Special Determination 27B: Convertible Notes in Respect of a Limited Partnership Interest Issued: 17 December 2020 S27B This determination relates to convertible notes in respect of a limited partnership interest in a public private partnership. This determination replaces Special Determination 27A: Convertible Notes in respect of a limited partnership interest (Inland Revenue, 2015) to take into account amendments to the convertible notes under the 2020 Amendments. S27B | 17 December 2020 Page 1 of 8 Determination This determination may be cited as Special Determination S27B: Convertible Notes in Respect of a Limited Partnership Interest. 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) 1. This determination varies and replaces Special Determination S27A: Convertible Notes in respect of a limited partnership interest due to amendments to the terms of the subordinated convertible notes (Convertible Notes) under the 2020 Amendments. 2. This determination relates to Convertible Notes issued by the Holding Partnership to Limited Partner A that will convert to a 45% partnership interest at a single date or several nominated dates in the future to match the partnership contributions by Limited Partner B and some of the partnership contributions by Limited Partner C. The Convertible Notes were issued to provide equity funding to the Holding Partnership as part of an arrangement (the Project) involving the finance, design, construction and ongoing operation of the Facility by the Partnership under a public-private partnership agreement with the Crown. 3. Limited Partners A and C have agreed that Limited Partner A will have the option to sell up to 9.9% of the equity interest in the Holding Partnership (along with up to 9.9% of the shareholding in General Partner 1, in equal proportions) to Limited Partner C. It is envisaged that if the option is exercised it will be exercised after the Convertible Note has converted to committed capital, noting that early exercise rights do exist in limited situations. 4. The Convertible Notes earn a fixed rate of interest that is payable monthly (Coupon Interest Payments) until the Convertible Notes are converted. The Coupon Interest Payments are capitalised on each interest payment date and will be paid to Limited Partner A on the Final Repayment Date (subject to the waiver arrangements described below), so will not convert to a partnership interest. 5. The conversion to a partnership interest will be effected by way of a mandatory set off. Limited Partner A’s obligation to make its capital contribution(s) will be satisfied by setting off that obligation against the Holding Partnership’s obligation to repay that portion of the Convertible Notes equal to the capital contribution(s) required to be made on the relevant date. S27B | 17 December 2020 Page 2 of 8 6. At the time the Convertible Notes were issued, the rate of interest was set at an arm’s length rate determined under an agreed rate setting process. 7. As part of the 2020 Amendments, Limited Partner A and the Holding Partnership have agreed to amend the Convertible Notes so that from 2 November 2020, interest will be payable at a reduced rate. 8. The 2020 Amendments include various other additional amendments to the Project, as described in the Private Rulings. 9. No commitment fees or upfront fees are payable on the Convertible Notes. 10. In accordance with s EW 6(2), an amount (whether it is income, consideration, gain, loss or expenditure) that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement is not taken into account under the financial arrangement rules. 11. As an interest in a partnership is an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(11), only the Coupon Interest Payments are regarded as income or expenditure for the purposes of calculating accrual income or expenditure. 12. This Determination prescribes a method for determining the part of the consideration receivable by the parties to the arrangement that is solely attributable to the excepted financial arrangement as well as the method for spreading the accrual income, gain or loss, or expenditure under the financial arrangement rules. This Determination also requires an adjustment calculation to be undertaken in the income year in which the Convertible Notes are amended. 2 Reference This determination is made under s 90AC(1)(bb) and (h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This determination varies and replaces Special Determination S27A: Convertible Notes in respect of a limited partnership interest. 3 Scope of determination 1. This determination applies to the Convertible Notes issued by the Holding Partnership to Limited Partner A as part of the Project as set out in detail in the Private Rulings. The Convertible Notes were issued on the following terms:  Limited Partner A loaned an amount to the Holding Partnership (subject to the prevailing market rates at Financial Close) with repayment to be set off against the obligation to make capital contribution(s) in respect of a 45% interest in the S27B | 17 December 2020 Page 3 of 8 Holding Partnership at a single date or several nominated dates in the future. The Convertible Notes have a face value equal to 45% of the total equity requirement (being all of Limited Partner A’s 45% interest in the Holding Partnership).  The Convertible Notes earn a fixed rate of interest that is payable monthly until conversion. At the time the Convertible Notes were entered into, the interest rate was defined as the construction swap rate exclusive of charges, plus a margin, being the rate specified in the base case financial model at Financial Close.  The Coupon Interest Payments are capitalised on each interest payment date, and will be paid out to Limited Partner A on the Final Repayment Date; that is, the Coupon Interest Payments will not convert to a partnership interest.  The rate of interest was originally set at an arm’s length rate determined under an agreed rate setting process.  As part of the 2020 Amendments, Limited Partner A and the Holding Partnership have agreed to amend the Convertible Notes so that from 2 November 2020, interest will be payable at a reduced rate.  No commitment fees or upfront fees are payable on the Convertible Notes.  The Convertible Notes (and any interest payable on the Convertible Notes) are subordinated to senior debt. After conversion of the Convertible Notes, Limited Partner A will rank equally with Holding Partnership contributions made by the other limited partners. 2. This determination is made subject to the continued application of the Private Rulings. 4 Principle 1. The Convertible Notes have both debt and partnership interest components. They can be regarded alternatively as: a) a loan to a partnership with repayment by way of an interest in a partnership (debt component); or b) a forward purchase of a partnership interest (in which case the holder of the Convertible Notes is buying an interest in the partnership). The financial arrangement rules in the Act classify an interest in a partnership as an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(11). S27B | 17 December 2020 Page 4 of 8 2. As the Convertible Notes have this dual character, when calculating income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to the Convertible Notes it is first necessary to separate the debt and partnership interest components of the Convertible Notes. 3. This determination specifies that, apart from the Coupon Interest Payments, all amounts relate to the underlying interest in a partnership, and will not be dealt with under the financial arrangement rules (subpart EW) when calculating income derived or expenditure incurred. 4. Income and expenditure in respect of the Convertible Notes is calculated by daily apportionment of the Coupon Interest Payment to income years in accordance with Determination G1A: Apportionment of Daily Income and Expenditure (Inland Revenue 1989). Any potential waiver of interest will not be taken into account when applying the spreading method, but will be taken into account in the base price adjustment calculation under s EW 30. 5. An adjustment calculation must be undertaken in the income year in which the amendments to the Convertible Notes take place, following the methodology in Determination G25: Variations in the terms of a financial arrangement (Inland Revenue, 1992). 6. For the purposes of this determination, any change in the market value of the interest in the partnership between the issue date of the Convertible Notes and the conversion into the partnership interest relates to the partnership interest component, and therefore can be ignored when calculating income derived or expenditure incurred under the financial arrangements rules. 5 Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:  All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.  Convertible Notes are the subordinated convertible notes issued by the Holding Partnership to Limited Partner A.  Coupon Interest Payment is any amount payable on the Convertible Notes by the Convertible Note issuer (the borrower) to the Convertible Note holder (the lender) other than payments relating to the redemption or conversion of the Convertible Notes.  Final Repayment Date has the meaning provided in the Subscription Agreement. S27B | 17 December 2020 Page 5 of 8  Financial Close has the same meaning as set out in the Project Agreement referred to in the Private Rulings.  Private Rulings means BR Prv 20/64 and BR Prv 20/65, issued on 17 December 2020, and includes any private rulings issued to replace those Rulings, provided that the change to the relevant Ruling does not affect the application of this Determination. For convenience, words and phrases defined in this determination are indicated by initial capital letters, but the absence of a capital letter does not alone imply that the word or phrase is used with a meaning different from that given by its definition. 6 Method 1. Amounts to be included when calculating income or expenditure under the financial arrangements rules with regard to the Convertible Notes in respect of income, gain or loss, or expenditure, and also of any other consideration receivable by the holder or payable by the issuer, consist of the Coupon Interest Payments. 2. The income derived or expenditure incurred in respect of the Convertible Notes must be calculated by daily apportionment of the Coupon Interest Payments to income years. Any potential waiver of interest is not included in that calculation. The required method is outlined in Determination G1A. 3. All other income, gain, loss, expenditure or consideration paid under or with respect to the wider financial arrangement is solely attributable to the excepted financial arrangement component of the wider financial arrangement. 4. An adjustment calculation must be undertaken in the income year in which the amendments to the Convertible Notes take place, following the methodology in Determination G25. 7 Example This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination. The example assumes the following:  On 1 April 2014 a Convertible Note was issued to the holder for $1,000 with an interest coupon set at the arm’s length interest rate of 8.5%. The Convertible Note was intended to convert to a 45% interest in a partnership on 31 March 2019. S27B | 17 December 2020 Page 6 of 8  The conversion to a partnership interest will be effected by way of a mandatory set off. The holder’s obligation to make its capital contribution will be satisfied by setting off that obligation against the issuer’s obligation to repay the Convertible Note.  Coupon payments accrue monthly, in arrears and are compounding. Interest will be paid to the holder on the first partnership distribution date.  On the date of issue, the limited partners have agreed that the market value of a 45% partnership interest on 31 March 2019 is $1,000.  The parties use a 31 March balance date and apply Determination G1A on a 365 day basis when apportioning daily income and expenditure.  With effect from 1 November 2020, the terms of the Convertible Notes are amended as follows: o The interest coupon will be 4% per annum. o The Convertible Notes will convert into a 45% interest in a partnership on 22 November 2021. Prior to amendment, the annual sum of capitalised Coupon Interest Payments, and the deduction permitted under Determination G1A is as follows: Date Coupon Interest ($) Deduction under Determination G1A ($) 31 March 2015 85.00 108.28 31 March 2016 92.23 108.28 31 March 2017 100.06 108.28 31 March 2018 108.57 108.28 31 March 2019 117.80 108.28 31 March 2020 127.81 108.28 1 November 2020 81.69 63.78 Following the amendment to the terms of the Convertible Notes, the annual amount of capitalised Coupon Interest Payments, and the deductions that would have been permitted under Determination G1A had the amendments been known at the outset are: S27B | 17 December 2020 Page 7 of 8 Date Coupon Interest ($) Deduction under DeterminationG1A ($) 31 March 2015 85.00 106.13 31 March 2016 92.23 106.13 31 March 2017 100.06 106.13 31 March 2018 108.57 106.13 31 March 2019 117.80 106.13 31 March 2020 127.81 106.13 31 March 2021 89.04 106.13 22 November 2021 68.36 68.33 In the year ended 31 March 2021, an adjustment calculation must be undertaken in accordance with Determination G25.

================================================================================================

Determination S28 (25 July 2014) relates to application of the FA rules to the design and construction phase of a PPP. Replaced by Determination S28A on 8 Sep 2015.

This determination may be cited as Special Determination S28: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase in a public-private partnership.

| --- | --- |
| Note |     |
| This determination was varied and replaced by Special Determination s28A on 8 September 2015. It therefore applies for the period from 25 July 2014 to 8 September 2015. |     |

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to an arrangement (the Project) involving the finance, design, construction and on-going provision of operation and maintenance services in respect of the Facility by a limited partnership (the Partnership) under a public-private partnership agreement (the Project Agreement) with the Crown.  The Holding Partnership will be the sole limited partner in the Partnership, holding 100% of the Partnership.  The limited partners in the Holding Partnership are Limited Partner A, Limited Partner B and Limited Partner C.  This determination does not apply to Limited Partner C.
2.  The Project Agreement comprises three basic components:
    *   A design and construction phase (the D&C Phase) under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown in consideration for a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment), payable on completion of the D&C Phase;
    *   A Facility Lease in which the Partnership and the Crown enter and under which the Partnership pays an amount representing the rental under the Facility Lease to the Crown (the Rental Prepayment); and
    *   An operations and maintenance phase (the O&M Phase) under which the Partnership will provide operation and maintenance services to the Crown over a 25 year term in consideration for monthly payments (the Unitary Charge).
3.  The Partnership will enter into:
    *   A Construction Agreement with a contractor (the Contractor), under which the Contractor will design and construct the Facility in consideration for monthly and milestone payments; and
    *   an Operation and Maintenance Contract (the O&M Contract) with a service provider (the Service Provider), under which the Service Provider will provide the on-going operation and maintenance (and other) services in consideration for monthly payments.
4.  The Partnership will raise external debt from a range of third party financiers (the Bank Debt).  Limited Partner C will provide a term debt facility (the Term Debt Facility) to the Partnership to supplement the Bank Debt.
5.  The Holding Partnership will receive funding from Limited Partner C during the D&C Phase in the form of a convertible debt instrument (the Convertible Note).  Limited Partners A and B will provide investment support during the D&C Phase in the form of a letter of credit to the external lenders.
6.  The Partnership will enter into Interest Rate Swaps in respect of the Bank Debt.
7.  The Facility Lease, O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, Construction Agreement and O&M Contract are all excepted financial arrangements.  The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, Bank Debt, Term Debt Facility and Swaps are financial arrangements to which the Partnership is a party.  The Project, including all of these agreements, is a wider financial arrangement. 
8.  _Special Determination S27: Convertible Note in respect of a limited partnership_ applies to the Convertible Notes.  _Special Determination S29: Application of the financial arrangement rules to a public-private partnership_ applies to arrangements in the wider financial arrangement, excluding the D&C Payment.
9.  This determination prescribes the portion of the D&C Payment treated as income under the financial arrangement rules (the Interest Component) and the method for spreading that income.

### 2\. Reference

1.  This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb) and 90AC(1)(i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to the Partnership in respect of the Project (which is set out in detail in Private Rulings BR Prv 14/31 and BR Prv 14/32 issued on 25 July 2014), including the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown and will receive a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment) once the Facility is ready for operation.
2.  This determination is made subject to the following conditions:
    *   The design and construction costs of the Facility are agreed between the Partnership and the Crown on an arm's length basis and set out in the Base Case under the Project Agreement as referenced to in the definition of "Design and Construction Payment" in section 1.1 of the Project Agreement.
    *   Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B use IFRSs to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements.
    *   The continued application of private rulings BR Prv 14/31 and BR Prv 14/32 issued on 25 July 2014.
    *   The executed documentation not being materially different from the final documentation that was provided to Inland Revenue on 23 July 2014 to the extent that it impacts on the scope of the determination or the application of the financial arrangement rules to the Applicants and the scope of the determination.

### 4\. Principle

1.  During the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, the Partnership will receive consideration from the Crown (in the form of the D&C Payment) and will in turn provide consideration to the Crown (in the form of the completion of the TG Project and the transfer of its rights, set out in clause 11.2(c) of the Project Agreement, in the Facility). The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement is a "financial arrangement" under s EW 3 and an "agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services" under s YA 1.
2.  The Partnership and the Crown have agreed that the D&C Payment includes capitalised interest (clause 12.5(c) of the Project Agreement). The Interest Component of the D&C Payment will be income under the financial arrangements rules under subpart EW.
3.  During the D&C Phase the Partnership has variable expenditure commitments which will accrue. The capitalised interest component of the D&C Payment is intended to offset the expected funding costs incurred in relation to these commitments.
4.  The Interest Component is calculated with reference to expected funding costs.  No adjustment is made for variances between actual and expected costs as the D&C Payment, including capitalised interest, is agreed in advance.
5.  The Interest Component needs to be spread over the term of the D&C Phase.

### 5\. Interpretation

1.  In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires-
    *   "IFRS" means International Financial Reporting Standards as defined in s YA 1.
    *   Capitalised terms have the same meaning as set out in the Project Agreement.
    *   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.

### 6\. Method

#### Calculation of Interest Component

1.  The value of the completion of the TG Project and transfer of the Partnership's rights to the Crown, set out in clause 11.2(c) of the Project Agreement, is the agreed design and construction costs of the Facility (excluding Fitout) set out in the Base Case under the Project Agreement.
2.  The D&C Payment less the agreed design and construction costs of the Facility (excluding Fitout) set out in the Base Case under the Project Agreement, is the Interest Component that is income under the financial arrangements rules.
3.  BR Prv 14/31 rules on the portion to the D&C Payment that is not income under the financial arrangements rules, and is not considered in this determination. 

#### Spreading of Interest Component

4.  The method for determining the amount of income that is to be allocated to each income year is as follows:
    1.  The expected design and construction costs of the facility (excluding fitout) as set out in the Base Case are treated as having been incurred at the beginning of each of the six income years (the Annual Expenditure).  No adjustment will be made to the Annual Expenditure in any income year to reflect actual expenditure in that year.
    2.  The interest allocated to each income year is then calculated in accordance with the following formula:  
          
        Interest = OB x R  
          
        Where:  
          
        **OB** is the sum of the Annual Expenditure for that income year, plus the Annual Expenditure and interest attributable to any previous income year.  
          
        **R** is the internal rate of return (based on annual rests) calculated using the notional cash flows in paragraph (a) above at the beginning of each income year as outflows, and the D&C Payment at the end of the D&C Phase as the only inflow.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

The Partnership and the Crown agree to the D&C Payment under the Base Case sheet that the D&C Payment equals $1,200,000.

The Base Case sets out that the agreed design and construction costs of the TG Project (excluding Fitout) are to be $970,748.

The value of the "completion of the TG Project and the transfer of the rights set out in clause 11.2(c)" of the Project Agreement, as set out in Clause 12.3 of the Project Agreement, is equal to $970,748.

The Interest Component of the D&C Payment is $229,252 by implication of the valuation under this determination.

Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B will spread the Interest Component over the term of the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, as follows.

The Annual Expenditure incurred and treated as having been incurred at the beginning of the relevant income year is as follows:

| Years | Actual D&C costs |
| --- | --- |
| 1   | ($190,494) |
| 2   | ($296,488) |
| 3   | ($245,464) |
| 4   | ($173,759) |
| 5   | ($62,168) |
| 6   | ($2,376) |
| D&C Payment | $1,200,000 |
|     | ($970,748) |

Based on receipt of the $1,200,000 D&C Payment in Year 6 the Project has an internal rate of return of 4.9171%. 

The Interest Component is therefore spread as follows:

| Years | Actual D&C costs | Cumulative | Interest income |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | ($190,494) | ($190,494) | $9,367 |
| 2   | ($296,488) | ($496,348) | $24,406 |
| 3   | ($245,464) | ($766,218) | $37,675 |
| 4   | ($173,759) | ($977,652) | $48,072 |
| 5   | ($62,168) | ($1,087,892) | $53,492 |
| 6   | ($2,376) | ($1,143,761) | $56,239 |
| D&C Payment |     | $1,200,000 |     |
|     | ($970,748) |     | $229,252 |

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination varies and replaces _Special Determination S28: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase in a public-private partnership_ following a change of partners in the limited partnership.
2.  This determination relates to an arrangement (the Project) involving the finance, design, construction and on-going provision of operation and maintenance services in respect of the Facility by a limited partnership(the Partnership) under a public-private partnership agreement (the Project Agreement) with the Crown. The Holding Partnership will be the sole limited partner in the Partnership, holding 100% of the Partnership. As at the date this determination is signed, the limited partners in the Holding Partnership are Limited Partner A, Limited Partner B and Limited Partner C. This determination does not apply to Limited Partner C.

3.  Limited Partner A intends to transfer their interest in the Holding Partnership to Limited Partner A1 in late 2015. This determination applies to:
    1.  Limited Partner A from the date of signing until the date that they transfer their interest;
    2.  Limited Partner A1 from the date that the interest is transferred to them; and
    3.  Limited Partner B from the date of signing.

4.  The Project Agreement comprises three basic components:
    1.  A design and construction phase (the D&C Phase) under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown in consideration for a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment), payable on completion of the D&C Phase;
    2.  A Facility Lease in which the Partnership and the Crown enter and under which the Partnership pays an amount representing the rental under the Facility Lease to the Crown (the Rental Prepayment); and
    3.  An operations and maintenance phase (the O&M Phase) under which the Partnership will provide operation and maintenance services to the Crown over a 25 year term in consideration for monthly payments (the Unitary Charge).

5.  The Partnership has entered into:
    1.  A Construction Agreement with a contractor (the Contractor), under which the Contractor will design and construct the Facility in consideration for monthly and milestone payments; and
    2.  an Operation and Maintenance Contract (the O&M Contract) with a service provider (the Service Provider), under which the Service Provider will provide the on-going operation and maintenance (and other) services in consideration for monthly payments.

6.  The Partnership will raise external debt from a range of third party financiers (the Bank Debt). Limited Partner C will provide a term debt facility (the Term Debt Facility) to the Partnership to supplement the Bank Debt.
7.  The Holding Partnership will receive funding from Limited Partner C during the D&C Phase in the form of a convertible debt instrument (the Convertible Note). Limited Partners A and B will provide investment support during the D&C Phase in the form of a letter of credit to the external lenders.
8.  The Partnership will enter into Interest Rate Swaps in respect of the Bank Debt.
9.  The Facility Lease, O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, Construction Agreement and O&M Contract are all excepted financial arrangements. The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, Bank Debt, Term Debt Facility and Swaps are financial arrangements to which the Partnership is a party. The Project, including all of these agreements, is a wider financial arrangement.
10.  _Special Determination S27A: Convertible Note in respect of a limited partnership_ applies to the Convertible Notes. _Special Determination S29A: Application of the financial arrangement rules to a public-private partnership_ applies to arrangements in the wider financial arrangement, excluding the D&C Payment.
11.  This determination prescribes the portion of the D&C Payment treated as income under the financial arrangement rules (the Interest Component) and the method for spreading that income.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb) and 90AC(1)(i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This determination varies and replaces _Special Determination S28: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase in a public-private partnership_ and applies to:

1.  Limited Partner A from the date of signing until the date that they transfer their interest to Limited Partner A1;
2.  Limited Partner A1 from the date that the interest is transferred to them; and
3.  Limited Partner B from the date of signing.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to the Partnership in respect of the Project (which is set out in detail in Private Rulings BR Prv 15/38 and BR Prv 15/39 issued on 8 September 2015), including the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown and will receive a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment) once the Facility is ready for operation.
2.  This determination is made subject to the following conditions:
    1.  The design and construction costs of the Facility are agreed between the Partnership and the Crown on an arm’s length basis and set out in the Base Case under the Project Agreement as referenced to in the definition of “Design and Construction Payment” in section 1.1 of the Project Agreement.
    2.  While this determination applies to them, Limited Partner A, Limited Partner A1 and Limited Partner B use IFRSs to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements.
    3.  The continued application of private rulings BR Prv 15/38 and BR Prv 15/39 issued on 8 September 2015.
    4.  The executed documentation not being materially different from the final documentation that was provided to Inland Revenue on 23 July 2014 to the extent that it impacts on the scope of the determination or the application of the financial arrangement rules to the Applicants and the scope of the determination.

### 4\. Principle

1.  During the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, the Partnership will receive consideration from the Crown (in the form of the D&C Payment) and will in turn provide consideration to the Crown (in the form of the completion of the Project and the transfer of its rights, set out in clause 11.2(c) of the Project Agreement, in the Facility). The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement is a “financial arrangement” under s EW 3 and an “agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services” under s YA 1.
2.  The Partnership and the Crown have agreed that the D&C Payment includes capitalised interest (clause 12.5(c) of the Project Agreement). The Interest Component of the D&C Payment will be income under the financial arrangements rules under subpart EW.
3.  During the D&C Phase the Partnership has variable expenditure commitments which will accrue. The capitalised interest component of the D&C Payment is intended to offset the expected funding costs incurred in relation to these commitments.
4.  The Interest Component is calculated with reference to expected funding costs. No adjustment is made for variances between actual and expected costs as the D&C Payment, including capitalised interest, is agreed in advance.
5.  The Interest Component needs to be spread over the term of the D&C Phase.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

*   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
*   Capitalised terms have the same meaning as set out in the Project Agreement.
*   **IFRS** means International Financial Reporting Standards as defined in s YA 1.

### 6\. Method

_Calculation of Interest Component_

1.  The value of the completion of the Project and transfer of the Partnership’s rights to the Crown, set out in clause 11.2(c) of the Project Agreement, is the agreed design and construction costs of the Facility (excluding Fitout) set out in the Base Case under the Project Agreement.
2.  The D&C Payment less the agreed design and construction costs of the Facility (excluding Fitout) set out in the Base Case under the Project Agreement, is the Interest Component that is income under the financial arrangements rules.
3.  Private Ruling BR Prv 15/39 rules on the portion to the D&C Payment that is not income under the financial arrangements rules, and is not considered in this determination.

_Spreading of Interest Component_

1.  The method for determining the amount of income that is to be allocated to each income year is as follows:
    1.  The expected design and construction costs of the facility (excluding fitout) as set out in the Base Case are treated as having been incurred at the beginning of each of the six income years (the Annual Expenditure).  No adjustment will be made to the Annual Expenditure in any income year to reflect actual expenditure in that year.
    2.  The interest allocated to each income year is then calculated in accordance with the following formula:
        *   Interest = OB x R
    3.  Where:  
        **OB** is the sum of the Annual Expenditure for that income year, plus the Annual Expenditure and interest attributable to any previous income year.  
        **R** is the internal rate of return (based on annual rests) calculated using the notional cash flows in paragraph (a) above at the beginning of each income year as outflows, and the D&C Payment at the end of the D&C Phase as the only inflow.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

The Partnership and the Crown agree to the D&C Payment under the Base Case sheet that the D&C Payment equals $1,200,000.  The Base Case sets out that the agreed design and construction costs of the Project (excluding Fitout) are to be $970,748.

The value of the “completion of the Project and the transfer of the rights set out in clause 11.2(c)” of the Project Agreement, as set out in Clause 12.3 of the Project Agreement, is equal to $970,748.

The Interest Component of the D&C Payment is $229,252 by implication of the valuation under this determination.  The Limited Partners will spread the Interest Component over the term of the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, as follows.

The Annual Expenditure incurred and treated as having been incurred at the beginning of the relevant income year is as follows:

| Year | Actual D&C costs |
| --- | --- |
| 1   | ($190,494) |
| 2   | ($296,488) |
| 3   | ($245,464) |
| 4   | ($173,759) |
| 5   | ($62,168) |
| 6   | ($2,376) |
| D&C Payment | $1,200,000 |
|     | **($970,748)** |

Based on receipt of the $1,200,000 D&C Payment in Year 6 the Project has an internal rate of return of 4.9171%. 

The Interest Component is therefore spread as follows:

| Year | Actual D&C costs | Cumulative | Interest income |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | ($190,494) | ($190,494) | $9,367 |
| 2   | ($296,488) | ($496,348) | $24,406 |
| 3   | ($245,464) | ($766,218) | $37,675 |
| 4   | ($173,759) | ($977,652) | $48,072 |
| 5   | ($62,168) | ($1,087,892) | $53,492 |
| 6   | ($2,376) | ($1,149,761) | $56,239 |
|     |     | $1,200,000 |     |
|     | **($970,748)** |     | **$299,252** |

In particular, this determination relates to the design and construction phase of the public-private partnership agreement. This determination replaces Special Determination 28A: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase in a public-private partnership (Inland Revenue, 2015) to take the 2020 Amendments into account. S28B | 17 December 2020 Page 1 of 8 Determination This determination may be cited as Special Determination S28B: Application of the Financial Arrangements Rules to the Design and Construction Phase in a Public-Private Partnership. 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) 1. This determination varies and replaces Special Determination S28A: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase in a public-private partnership to take the 2020 Amendments into account. 2. This determination relates to an arrangement (the Project) involving the finance, design, construction and on-going provision of operation and maintenance services in respect of the Facility by the Partnership under a public-private partnership agreement (the Project Agreement) with the Crown. The Holding Partnership will be the sole limited partner in the Partnership, holding 100% of the Partnership. The limited partners in the Holding Partnership are Limited Partners A, B and C. This determination does not apply to Limited Partner C. 3. The Project Agreement comprises three basic components: a) a design and construction phase (the D&C Phase) under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown in consideration for a fixed lump-sum payment (the Original D&C Payment), payable on completion of the D&C Phase; b) a Facility Lease in which the Partnership and the Crown enter and under which the Partnership pays an amount representing the rental under the Facility Lease to the Crown (the Rental Prepayment); and c) an operations and maintenance phase (the O&M Phase) under which the Partnership will provide operation and maintenance services to the Crown over a 25 year term in consideration for monthly payments (the Unitary Charge). 4. The Partnership has entered into: a) a Construction Agreement with a contractor (the Contractor), under which the Contractor will design and construct the Facility in consideration for monthly and milestone payments; and S28B | 17 December 2020 Page 2 of 8 b) an Operation and Maintenance Contract (the O&M Contract) with a service provider (the Service Provider), under which the Service Provider will provide the on-going operation and maintenance (and other) services in consideration for monthly payments. 5. Under the original arrangements:  The Partnership raised external debt from a range of third-party financiers (the Bank Debt) and Limited Partner C provided a term debt facility (the Term Debt Facility) to the Partnership to supplement the Bank Debt.  The Holding Partnership received funding from Limited Partner C during the D&C Phase in the form of a convertible debt instrument (the Convertible Note). Limited Partners A and B provided investment support during the D&C Phase in the form of a letter of credit to the external lenders.  The Partnership entered into Interest Rate Swaps in respect of the Bank Debt. 6. The Facility Lease, O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, Construction Agreement and O&M Contract are all excepted financial arrangements. The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, Bank Debt, Term Debt Facility and Swaps are financial arrangements to which the Partnership is a party. The Project, including all of these agreements, is a wider financial arrangement. 7. In 2020, the Partnership and the Crown entered into the 2020 Amendments that (among other things):  extended the duration of the D&C Phase and provided for additional payments to be made for the design and construction work (the Additional D&C Payments); and  provided for certain Unitary Charge payments to be paid by the Crown to the Partnership before the O&M Phase commences. 8. The 2020 Amendments included various additional amendments to the Project, as described in the Private Rulings. 9. Special Determination S27B: Convertible Notes in Respect of a Limited Partnership applies to the Convertible Notes. Special Determination S29B: Application of the Financial Arrangement Rules to a Public-Private Partnership applies to arrangements in the wider financial arrangement, excluding the D&C Phase. 10. This determination prescribes the portion of the Original D&C Payment treated as income under the financial arrangement rules (the Interest Component) and the method for spreading that income. This determination also prescribes that no part of the Additional D&C Payments is income under the financial arrangements rules. S28B | 17 December 2020 Page 3 of 8 2 Reference This determination is made under s 90AC(1)(bb) and (i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This determination varies and replaces Special Determination S28A: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase in a public-private partnership. 3 Scope of determination 1. This determination applies to the Partnership in respect of the Project (which is set out in detail in the Private Rulings), including the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown and will receive a fixed lump-sum payment (the Original D&C Payment) once the Facility is ready for operation and Additional D&C Payments periodically from the Effective Date of the 2020 Amendments. 2. This determination is made subject to the following conditions:  The design and construction costs of the Facility are agreed between the Partnership and the Crown on an arm’s length basis and the original design and construction costs are set out in the Base Case under the Project Agreement as referenced to in the definition of “Original Design and Construction Payment” in clause 1.1 of the Project Agreement (as amended in December 2020).  Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B use IFRSs to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements.  The Private Rulings continue to apply. 4 Principle 1. During the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, the Partnership will receive consideration from the Crown (in the form of the Original D&C Payment and the Additional D&C Payments) and will in turn provide consideration to the Crown (in the form of the completion of the Project and the transfer of its rights, set out in clause 11.2(c) of the Project Agreement, in the Facility). The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement is a “financial arrangement” under s EW 3 and an “agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services” under s YA 1. 2. The Partnership and the Crown have agreed that the Original D&C Payment includes capitalised interest (clause 12.5(c) of the Project Agreement). The Additional D&C Payments do not include any capitalised interest. The Interest Component of the S28B | 17 December 2020 Page 4 of 8 original D&C Payment will be income under the financial arrangements rules under subpart EW. No part of the Additional D&C Payments will be income under the financial arrangement rules in subpart EW. 3. During the D&C Phase, the Partnership has accrued variable expenditure commitments. The capitalised interest component of the original D&C Payment is intended to offset the expected funding costs incurred in relation to these commitments. 4. The Interest Component was calculated with reference to expected funding costs. No adjustment is made for variances between actual and expected costs as the original D&C Payment, including capitalised interest, was agreed in advance. 5. The Interest Component needs to be spread over the term of the D&C Phase. 5 Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:  All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.  Capitalised terms have the same meaning as set out in the Project Agreement.  IFRS means International Financial Reporting Standards as defined in s YA 1  Private Rulings means BR Prv 20/64 and BR Prv 20/65, issued on 17 December 2020, and includes any private rulings issued to replace those Rulings, provided that the change to the relevant Ruling does not affect the application of this Determination. 6 Method Calculation of Interest Component 1. At the time the Project Agreement was entered into, the value of the completion of the Project and transfer of the Partnership’s rights to the Crown, set out in clause 11.2(c) of the Project Agreement, was the agreed design and construction costs of the Facility (excluding Fitout) set out in the Base Case under the Project Agreement. 2. The Original D&C Payment less the agreed design and construction costs of the Facility (excluding Fitout) set out in the Base Case under the Project Agreement, is the Interest Component that is income under the financial arrangements rules. S28B | 17 December 2020 Page 5 of 8 3. No part of the Additional D&C Payments is income under the financial arrangements rules. 4. The Private Rulings apply to the Additional D&C Payments and the portion to the D&C Payment that is not income under the financial arrangements rules. Those amounts are not considered in this Determination. Spreading of Interest Component 5. The method for determining the amount of income that is to be allocated to each income year is as follows: a) The expected design and construction costs of the Facility (excluding Fitout) as set out in the Base Case are treated as having been incurred at the beginning of each of the six income years (the Annual Expenditure). No adjustment will be made to the Annual Expenditure in any income year to reflect actual expenditure in that year, the extension of the D&C Phase or the Additional D&C Payments. b) The interest allocated to each income year is then calculated in accordance with the following formula: Interest = OB x R Where: OB is the sum of the Annual Expenditure for that income year, plus the Annual Expenditure and interest attributable to any previous income year. R is the internal rate of return (based on annual rests) calculated at the time the Project Agreement was signed using the notional cash flows in paragraph (a) above at the beginning of each income year as outflows, and the Original D&C Payment at the end of the original term of the D&C Phase as the only inflow. 7 Example This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination. The Partnership and the Crown agree to the Original D&C Payment under the Base Case sheet that the Original D&C Payment equals $1,200,000. The Base Case sets out that the agreed design and construction costs of the Project (excluding Fitout) are to be $970,748. The value of the “completion of the Project and the transfer of the rights set out in clause 11.2(c)” of the Project Agreement, as set out in Clause 12.3 of the Project Agreement, is equal to $970,748. S28B | 17 December 2020 Page 6 of 8 The Partnership and the Crown subsequently agree that Additional D&C Payments will be made from the Effective Date of the 2020 Amendments until completion of the Facility. No part of the Additional D&C Payments will be treated as income under the financial arrangements rules. The Interest Component of the D&C Payment is $229,252 by implication of the valuation under this determination. The Limited Partners will spread the Interest Component over the original term of the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, as follows. The Annual Expenditure incurred and treated as having been incurred at the beginning of the relevant income year is as follows Year Actual D&C costs 1 ($190,494) 2 ($296,488) 3 ($245,464) 4 ($173,759) 5 ($62,168) 6 ($2,376) Original D&C Payment $1,200,000 ($970,748) Based on expected receipt of the $1,200,000 D&C Payment in Year 6 the Project has an internal rate of return of 4.9171%. The Interest Component is therefore spread as follows: Year Actual D&C costs Cumulative Interest income 1 ($190,494) ($190,494) $9,367 2 ($296,488) ($496,348) $24,406 3 ($245,464) ($766,218) $37,675 S28B | 17 December 2020 Page 7 of 8 4 ($173,759) ($977,652) $48,072 5 ($62,168) ($1,087,892) $53,492 6 ($2,376) ($1,149,761) $56,239 Original D&C Payment $1,200,000 Total ($970,748) $299,252 This Determination is signed by me on the 17 th day of December 2020.
