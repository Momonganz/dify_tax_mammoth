Rewriting the Income Tax Act Exposure Draft Part G Rewrite Project Team First published in August 2005 by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, P O Box 2198, Wellington. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft – Part G ISBN 0-478-27129-8 1 Introduction This exposure draft has been prepared by the project team responsible for rewriting New Zealand’s income tax legislation. It contains draft legislation for the rewrite of Part G of the Income Tax Act 2004, which relates to special rules that modify the way other Parts of the Act operate when tax avoidance occurs or when specific valuation rules are provided for certain transactions. The key objective of rewriting the Act is to produce tax legislation that is clear, uses plain language and is structurally consistent. This should make it easier for taxpayers to identify and comply with their income tax obligations, and ultimately save them time and money. We are rewriting the law as it currently stands. Changes to the law, other than minor ones in the interests of clarity or simplicity, will continue to be handled through the normal legislative programme. The presence or absence of provisions in the rewritten draft legislation does not necessarily indicate any future change in tax policy. We invite submissions on any aspect of this work, including the points raised in this commentary. The closing date for submissions is 31 October 2005. Submissions should be made to: The Rewrite Project Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Electronic submissions should be sent to: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz . Please note submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with the Act. If you feel any part of your submission could be properly withheld under the Act (for example, for reasons of privacy), please indicate this clearly in your submission. 2 COMMENTARY ON REWRITTEN PART G OF THE INCOME TAX ACT 2004 Introduction Part G came into being during the reorganisation of the Income Tax Act 1976 as the Income Tax 1994. It contains two types of provisions: • those dealing with avoidance; and • those dealing with certain transactions treated as taking place at market value. This Part therefore has wide impact across the Act because of the scope of its provisions. Two structural issues were identified in rewriting Part G: • It was not entirely clear in what circumstances a provision’s anti-avoidance nature merited locating it in Part G. This point arises because, in many cases, technical base-maintenance remedial provisions could be viewed as dealing with matters of avoidance. • As other Parts of the Act also contain many provisions treating transactions as occurring at market value, the rationale for having valuation provisions in Part G was unclear. As a result, the provisions proposed to be retained in Part G are those which do not have a suitable alternative location or have an anti-avoidance element. The exposure draft adopts a structural approach of locating in subparts GA and GB only those provisions that, in broad terms, apply to arrangements having a purpose or effect of generally defeating the purpose the Act or specific provisions in other Parts of the Act. This commentary also outlines the drafting changes proposed in rewriting Part G. The drafting changes relate mainly to structural relationships, are relatively minor, and are intended to improve the legislation. They fall into four main types: • modernising the style and language; • ordering the subparts from the most generally applicable to the more specific sets of rules; • improving the clarity of the law; and • removing of redundant material and relocating some provisions, as appropriate. 3 Some minor policy changes are proposed for the rewrite of Part G. These policy changes are mainly concerned with: • replacing some discretions given to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with objective tests to provide consistency with the law and practice relating to self-assessment, and are identified individually; and • technical corrections relating to drafting errors or when there is a lack of clarity. Benefits of the proposed structure Although current readers may be familiar with the concepts contained in Part G, the rewriting of this Part must also take into account the needs of future readers. Future readers will come to the legislation without knowledge of how the various rules in Part G interact with the core provisions and other Parts of the Act. In identifying these interrelationships, the draft legislation assists readers in their understanding the relationship between provisions in other Parts of the Act and the transactions and situations dealt with in Part G. In particular, provisions in other Parts of the Act which relate to Part G provisions are identified and their relationships to the anti-avoidance rules are noted or clarified. The ordering of the subparts and provisions in the subparts reflects the drafting policy that more generally applicable provisions should appear earliest in each Part. Cross-references in this exposure draft to Parts H or I relate to the 2004 Act, not to the recently released exposure drafts of those rewritten Parts. This is because further intensive specialist reviews of these Exposure Drafts are planned and may lead to changes in draft Parts H and I. Specific feedback Questions for specific consideration by readers of the exposure draft are set out in the commentary under the relevant sections. 4 Minor policy changes and technical corrections Replacing some discretions given to the Commissioner with objective tests Draft sections containing this change are GB 4, GB 6, GB 33, GB 36(1), GZ 1, Schedule 2A, Part A, Clause 2. Commentary on technical corrections and clarifications in individual draft sections GA 1: Commissioner’s power to adjust Draft section GA 1(2) is simplified to refer to an adjustment in any way to taxable income. This is consistent with the law as set out in section 99 of the 1976 Act and section BG 11 of the 1994 Act (before enactment of the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996). The amendments to section BG 11 by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 were intended to complement the global/gross approach adopted in the core provisions, rather than change the outcomes under the law. The elements of taxable income that can be taken into account in this adjustment remain as set out in section GA 1(4). Question for comment on GA 1 Does the proposal to simplify the wording of the reconstruction provision and allow for an adjustment to taxable income give rise to a change in outcome? Other comments on GA 1 Section GB 1(1)(b) of the 2004 Act has been removed in rewriting section GB 1 because its role is performed by the draft section GA 1(1) and (4). The words “without limiting the generality of the preceding subsections... section GA 1(1)-(3)” have been removed. Examination of the 2004 Act provision in section GB 1(2A) indicates that these words have no effect on the operation of section GB 1(2A). Section GB 1(1)-(2) of the 2004 Act is concerned with the reconstruction of taxable income, as calculated under sections BC 1 to BC 7. 5 The use of credits to satisfy an income tax liability is dealt with in section BC 9 (and possibly section BC 8 if rebates are considered to be credits) of the 2004 Act. Use of credits occurs after taxable income has been determined. Therefore, an adjustment of credits under section GB 1(2A) of the 2004 Act has no effect on the determination of taxable income and so cannot affect section GB 1(1) and (2) of the 2004 Act. GB 14: Combination of changes increases loss Section GC 9(5) of the 2004 Act has been removed because its effect is duplicated in the rewritten structure and cross-referencing elsewhere. GB 26: Commercial bill repatriation arrangements Under section GC 14A(2), the New Zealand transferee is treated for the purpose of this rule as redeeming the bill, even if the actual redemption is delayed. It is implicit in this rule that the time of the “deemed” redemption is the time at which the actual redemption was originally provided for under the commercial bill. The rewritten provision makes explicit this timing. This timing rule overrides the financial arrangement rules provided by the reference to “necessary implication” in section EW 2(1)(b). GB 27(3): Attribution rule for income from personal services The attribution rule does not apply to an associated entity that is a natural person and is not a partner of a partnership. What is not clear is the relationship between this rule and how the attribution rule applies to a trustee. Draft section GB 24(2) makes it clear that the attribution rule is intended to apply to a trustee. This means that the exclusion for natural persons in section GB 22(3) is not intended to apply to a natural person that is a trustee when acting as a trustee, and this relationship is made explicit in the rewritten section. The rewritten draft provision relies on the definition of “trustee” in section OB 1 of the 2004 Act for this effect. Draft section GB 27 now refers to the “income year” of the associated entity to give consistency to the value of “substantial business assets” in section GC 14C(6) which was measured at the end of that entity’s “accounting year”. 6 GB 35: Imputation arrangements to obtain a tax advantage GB 36: Reconstruction of arrangements to obtain a tax advantage The language of the corresponding provision in the 2004 Act (section GC 22) refers to an arrangement which has “the purpose (not being an incidental purpose)” that a party will obtain a tax advantage for a party to the arrangement. The words “the purpose” have been changed to “a purpose” on the basis that 2004 Act provision clearly contemplates multiple purposes. GB 43: Reconstruction of arrangements to obtain a tax advantage The words “or refund” which appears in section GC 27A(5)(c) of the 2004 Act has been removed as it seems unnecessary to refer to a refund. Relationship of Part G to other Parts The relationship between Part G provisions and provisions in other Parts of the Act has been signalled with new draft linkage provisions in Parts C, D, E, H, K, L, M and N. Moving 2004 Act Part G provisions to subpart GZ Section GC 6 is now largely spent (although a new provision may be needed if legislation in the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2005 is enacted. This provision is moved to draft section GZ 1. The references in section GC 12 to transactions occurring before 1992 or 1991 are likely now to be largely spent. This provision is moved to draft section GZ 2. Moving 2004 Act provisions from Part G to other Parts Part C Section GD 6(1), (2) has been moved to draft section CS 18. Section GD 6(3) has been moved to draft section CZ 20. Section GD 15(3), (4) has been moved to draft section CX 16A. The treatment of the associate as an employee has been removed as it is considered to conflict with the operation of draft section GB 27 (2004 Act provision section GC 15(1), (2)) which treats the benefit as being received by the actual employee. 7 Part D Section GD 4 has been moved to draft sections DB 45 and DC 4A. Part E Section GD 8 has been moved to draft section EY 10A. Part O Section GC 9(6) has been moved to draft section OE 2(2A). Schedules Section GC 16(a) and (b) have been moved to Schedule 2, Part A, Clause 2. 2004 Act provisions to be removed from Part G Section GC 14D(6) This subsection has been removed as the draft section GB 29(4) incorporates its effect. Section GC 14F(2) This subsection has been removed as its effect is dealt with in the definition of “arrangement” in section OB 1. GC 19 Section GC 19 has been removed on the basis that it duplicates the effect of section NF 13 and is therefore unnecessary. Its existence as a general anti-avoidance provision directed at one type of tax (other than income tax) is also inconsistent with the approaches to anti-avoidance of other taxes. 8 GC 18, GC 20 Public policy law operates to void any agreement not to comply with New Zealand legislation. These two provisions are therefore unnecessary. GC 27A(6)(d) This paragraph is removed as it is unnecessary. The Commissioner chooses which of subsection (5) or (6) applies and so both subsections cannot apply at the same time. GD 3(3) Subsection GD 3(3) has been removed as its effect is taken up in draft section GB 23(1), (2) and (3). GD 10(3) This subsection’s effect is incorporated in draft subsections GC 5(1) and (2). GE 1, GZ 1 These two provisions have been removed on the basis they are spent provisions. GC 17(a) The reference to vehicles acquired before 23 September 1985 has been removed on the basis it is a spent provision.

Rewriting the Income Tax Act Exposure Draft Part H Rewrite Project Team First published in March 2005 by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, P O Box 2198, Wellington. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft - Part H ISBN 0-478-27124-7 Introduction This exposure draft has been prepared by the project team responsible for rewriting New Zealand's income tax legislation. It contains draft legislation for the rewrite of Part H of the Income Tax Act 2004, which relates to special rules that modify the way in which Parts B to E operate for certain persons and entities. Rewritten Parts A to E of the Act were enacted in May 2004, with effect from the 2005-06 tax year. The key objective of rewriting the Act is to produce tax legislation that is clear, uses plain language and is structurally consistent. This it is intended to make it easier for taxpayers to identify and comply with their income tax obligations, ultimately saving them time and money. We are rewriting the law as it currently stands. Changes to the law, other than minor ones in the interests of clarity or simplicity, will continue to be handled through the normal legislative programme. The presence or absence of provisions in the rewritten draft legislation does not necessarily indicate any future change in tax policy. We invite submissions on any aspect of this work, including the points raised in this commentary. The closing date for submissions is 30 April 2005. Submissions should be made to: The Rewrite Project Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Electronic submissions should be sent to: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz . Please note submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with the Act. If you feel any part of your submission could be properly withheld under the Act (for example, for reasons of privacy) please indicate this clearly in your submission. COMMENTARY ON REWRITTEN PART H OF THE INCOME TAX ACT 2004 Introduction Part H of the Income Tax Act 2004 contains groups of rules that modify the calculation of taxable income for a tax year for certain persons and entities. Some provisions within Part H also affect provisions in Parts F to N of the Act. This commentary outlines the drafting changes proposed in rewriting Part H. No policy changes are proposed. The drafting changes relate mainly to structural relationships, are relatively minor, and are intended to improve the legislation. They fall into four main types: • modernising the style and language; • ordering the subparts from the most generally applicable to the more specific sets of rules; • improving the clarity of the law; and • removing redundant material and relocating some provisions, as appropriate. Benefits of the proposed structure Although current readers may be familiar with the concepts contained in Part H, the rewriting of this Part must also take into account the needs of future readers. Future readers may come to the legislation without knowledge of how the various rules in Part H interact with the core provisions and Parts C to E. In identifying these interrelationships, the draft legislation assists readers in their understanding of the operation of core provisions when applied to the various persons and entities addressed in Part H. The ordering of the subparts reflects the drafting policy that the more generally applicable provisions should appear earliest in each Part. Draft subpart HB: Attributing companies Terminology The draft legislation uses the terms “attributing company” and “loss attributing company” in place, respectively, of “qualifying company” and “loss attributing qualifying company”. The policy is to treat dividends distributed from this type of company as a non-taxable transaction, similar to the way in which the Act applies to drawings made from a partnership. For loss companies, the policy is to attribute the net loss of the company in a manner similar to the way partners share in losses of the partnership. This results in an attributing company satisfying its income tax obligations in relation to its taxable income. The company is then able to pay dividends to its shareholders without any further income tax liability for the shareholders. If the company elects to attribute its losses, the company’s net losses are attributed to the shareholders in proportion to their effective interest in the company. The term “attributing” is already used in this set of rules for a “loss attributing company” and is considered to better reflect their nature. In contrast, the word “qualifying” that is currently in use is not very meaningful. Also, it is used in a variety of ways in the Act, which can be confusing to readers. Reorganisation of material The requirements set out in section OB 3 of the 2004 Act are relocated within draft subpart HB, primarily in draft sections HB 5 and HB 6. This draws important provisions of these rules closer together, making it easier for readers to find the relevant detail. Relationship with Part C Distributions from an attributing company are either treated as fully imputed dividends or as exempt income. This effect is reflected in a draft provision for subpart CW. The reference to “transitional capital amount” in section HG 13(1)(a)(i) of the 2004 Act has been removed. This reference is redundant as it related to unexpired, ten year bonus issues, which terminated in 1998. Relationship with Part D Section HG 9(3) of the 2004 Act provides a restriction on the amount of deduction a person is allowed for interest incurred. This restriction is proposed to be included in subpart DB as a limitation on the deduction, although it continues to be detailed in draft section HB 24. As interest is allowed as a deduction under the general permission, the limiting effect of draft section DB 8A requires an override of the general permission. Timing of attribution of attributed CFC loss and FIF loss Draft section HB 29 clarifies that the time at which the shareholder incurs the attributed loss is subject to the differing balance date rule in draft section HB 31. Draft subpart HC: Trusts Terminology and definitions Complying and non-complying trusts The word “qualifying” is not very meaningful. Because it is used in a variety of ways in the Act, to continue to use the term in association with trusts is not consistent with the goal of achieving clear and unambiguous legislation. Therefore the defined terms “qualifying trust” and “non-qualifying trust” are replaced with “complying trust” and “non-complying trust”, to better reflect the underlying policy. Trust rules The definition of “trust rules” is simplified to refer to those provisions that have general application, rather than including provisions that are narrowly focused. Beneficiary income A beneficiary is taxable on the basis of residence and source. The draft definition of “beneficiary income” clarifies this by removing paragraphs (a)(iii) and (iv) (section OB 1 2004 Act) as they are no longer necessary. The treatment of income derived by a non-resident trustee and the relationship of that income to beneficiary income is now more clearly set out in draft section HC 22(5) Transfer of value and terms “distribution”, “settlor” and “settlement” The defined terms “distribution”, “settlor” and “settlement” rely on the common law but also extend the common law concepts for certain classes of transaction or event. In reviewing the effect of these two terms, it seems that both a “distribution” and a “settlement” involve a transfer of value in a very similar way to the concept used in subpart CD of the 2004 Act. In rewriting the dividend rules in subpart CD, a transfer of value is a transaction or event that leads to a value passing from one person to another for an unequal consideration (if any) in return. These two concepts have been re-drafted on the basis they are a transfer of value which is intended to simplify and harmonise concepts that have similar effect throughout the Act. Charitable trust The concept of “charitable trust” is defined for the purpose of the trust rules in section HH 1 of the 2004 Act, even though the definition is virtually the same as the concept of “charitable trust” used in subpart CW. The draft section HC 10 therefore rationalises the legislation because it is not necessary to retain a separate definition of “charitable trust” for the trust rules. Relocated provisions The income aspects of sections HH 1(7), HH 3(1), HH 3(3), HH 4(3), HH 5A, and HH 8 of the 2004 Act are relocated to draft subpart CV, to ensure structural consistency with sections BD 1, CA 1, and CA 2 (2004 Act). The exempt income provisions in sections HH 3(1), HH 3(3B), HH 4(6) and HH 3A to HH 3F (2004 Act) are now located in subpart CX, also to ensure structural consistency with sections BD 1, CA 1, and CA 2 (2004 Act). The agency placed on trustees and settlors is signalled also in the agency provisions in draft subpart HD, for completeness. Section HH 1(9) (2004 Act) is relocated to subpart FC, as this rule re-characterises the nature of the trust on the date referred to in that section. Non-resident trustee treated as New Zealand resident Draft section HC 22 introduces a link to section BD 1(4) in the core provisions of the 2004 Act. The link is intended to assist the reader identify that this rule overrides a core concept of the Act: taxation on the basis of both source and residence. This link is an illustration of the underlying theme of Part H, being to modify the operation of Parts B to E in relation to certain type of person or entity. Draft subpart HD: Agency Reorganisation The main feature of the draft subpart HD is a consolidation into a single section of the obligations (draft section HD 3) that a person declared to be an agent must satisfy. The rewritten provisions also draw together other agency provisions (by way of cross- reference) that are located in other parts of the 2004 Act. Possible relocation Section HK 18 of the 2004 Act places an obligation on Customs officials to comply with a valid request of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. It is proposed that this provision be relocated within the Tax Administration Act 1994. Section HK 11 of 2004 Act Section HK 11 of the 2004 Act contains sets of rules to assist the recovery of tax in situations where an arrangement leaves a company with insufficient assets to meet its income tax obligations. This rule is also the basis for recovery under section 61 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The section is included as draft section HD 14 on the basis that an agency is created for the purpose of satisfying tax obligations under the core provisions. Equally, the recovery aspects could be relocated or repeated in the Tax Administration Act because it has many characteristics of a recovery provision. We invite comment on whether the recovery aspects of section HK 11 should be relocated to the Tax Administration Act, since this may have wider policy implications for other revenue Acts. Draft subpart HE: Mutual associations Income provisions relocated Section HF 1(1) and HF 1(5) (2004 Act), relating to income derived by, respectively, a mutual association and a member of a mutual association, are relocated to sections CB 29 and CB 30 respectively. This is signalled at the beginning of draft subpart HE. This relocation ensures that provisions making a transaction income are placed within Part C, as required by sections BD 1, CA 1, and CA 2 (2004 Act). Deduction provision relocated Section HF 1(2) of the 2004 Act is relocated to draft subpart DV, again to provide structural consistency within the Act for the treatment of deductions. This relocation is signalled at the draft section HE 1. Section HF 1(6) of the 2004 Act This rule is absorbed into draft section CB 30(4). Draft subpart HF: Maori authorities Draft section HF 3(3) The redrafting of section HI 1(2)(b) of the 2004 Act is intended to provide consistency with the redrafted loss rules. (See Exposure Draft Part I.) Under those rules, the Act permits or restricts the use of loss balances or tax loss components, rather than restricting the offsetting of net income. The effect is the same, and no policy change is intended. Draft subpart HG: Joint activities Section HD 1 of the 2004 Act Subsection (1) is relocated to draft subpart HC (Trusts). Subsections (2) and (3) are rationalised into one section in draft subpart HG as there is little practical difference in the effect of the two subsections. The Tax Administration Act 2004 also addresses the obligations to file an income tax return which leaves draft section HG 1 as identifying who must satisfy tax obligations imposed under Part B of the Income Tax Act. Consolidated companies Subpart HB 2004 Act We propose relocating subpart HB of the 2004 Act to Part F, drawing together many of the consolidated company rules. This is to be addressed in the rewriting of Part F.

Defined in this Act: amount, associated person, attributing company, bonus issue, deduction, dividend, effective interest, exempt income, exempt income limitation, general permission, income year, interest, non-cash dividend, pay, share, shareholder, taxable bonus issue Origin (1) HG 9(3) (2) HG 9(4) (3) HG 9(3A) (4) HG 9(5) (5) new Parts C to O, and Tax Administration Act 1994 10 Subpart DV - Expenditure specific to certain entities DV 14 Association rebates When this section applies (1) This section applies when an association,— (a) enters into a transaction of a kind described in section HE 2 (Classes of mutual transaction) with members, or with members and other persons who are not members, from which it derives income to which section CB 29 (Amounts derived by mutual associations) applies; and (b) in relation to the transactions, pays an amount of profits as association rebates to members in the income year. Deduction (2) The association is allowed a deduction for the lesser of— (a) the amount described in subsection (3); or (b) the amount calculated using the formula in subsection (4). Amount paid (3) The amount referred to in subsection (2) is the total amount that the association pays in the income year to members for those mutual transactions that the association takes into account in determining its net income or net loss under section BC 4 (Net income and net loss). In the calculation of the total amount, it is irrelevant that the amount paid may be limited or reduced because a member of the association has a share or interest in the capital of the association. Amount under formula (4) The amount is calculated using the formula— assessable income - (deductions + amount distributed). Items in formula (5) In the formula,— (a) assessable income is the association’s assessable income attributable to the transactions: (b) deductions are the total deductions that the association is allowed (other than under this section) that are attributable to the assessable income: (c) amount distributed is the total amount that the association distributes to members in the income year through a cash distribution for which a determination is made under section ME 35(1)(a) (Co-operative companies may make annual determination to attach imputation credit to certain distributions).

Rewriting the Income Tax Act Exposure Draft Part K and Part L Rewrite Project Team First published in December 2005 by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, P O Box 2198, Wellington. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft – Part K and Part L ISBN 478-27131-X 1 Introduction This exposure draft has been prepared by the project team responsible for rewriting New Zealand’s income tax legislation. It contains draft legislation for the rewrite of Parts K and L the Income Tax Act 2004, which relate to rebates of income tax and tax credits that are used in satisfying a person’s income tax liability for a tax year. The key objective of rewriting the Act is to produce tax legislation that is clear, uses plain language and is structurally consistent. This should make it easier for taxpayers to identify and comply with their income tax obligations, and ultimately save them time and money. We are rewriting the law as it currently stands. Changes to the law, other than minor ones in the interests of clarity or simplicity, will continue to be handled through the normal legislative programme. Cross-references to sections outside Parts K and L are to provisions within the Income Tax Act 2004. The presence or absence of provisions in the rewritten draft legislation does not necessarily indicate any future change in tax policy. We invite submissions on any aspect of this work, including the points raised in this commentary. The closing date for submissions is 17 March 2006. Submissions should be made to: The Rewrite Project Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Electronic submissions should be sent to: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz . Please note submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with the Act. If you feel any part of your submission could be properly withheld under the Act (for example, for reasons of privacy), please indicate this clearly in your submission. 2 COMMENTARY ON REWRITTEN PART K AND PART L OF THE INCOME TAX ACT 2004 Introduction This commentary deals with the rewrite of Parts K and L as the two parts contain rules that have a similar effect for a person determining their terminal tax for a tax year. Part K in the 2004 Act contains a range of rules that give a tax credit for a variety of rebates, including the entitlement to and delivery of family support and family plus. The rewritten Part K contains only the rules relating to the entitlements under what is referred to in the draft legislation as the family income assistance scheme. The retention of these rules within Part K is considered appropriate because they mostly relate to the delivery of family income assistance scheme tax credits on an interim basis during a tax year. Under the rewritten Part L, a person who has received these credits during a tax year includes the total amount of their credits in the assessment of their income tax liability and terminal tax for that year. The rewritten Part L contains all other tax credit rules. It has been expanded to include rebates that were located in Part K, other than for the family income assistance scheme, and also the core tax credit rules that are currently situated in sections BC 8, BC 9 and BC 10 of the 2004 Act. This commentary outlines the main drafting changes made in rewriting Part K and Part L. These drafting changes relate mainly to structural relationships, are relatively minor, and are intended to improve the legislation. They fall into three main types: • modernising the style and language; • improving the clarity of the law; and • removing redundant material and moving some provisions to other parts of the Act. A number of provisions within Part K that have the same outcome have been rationalised and moved to draft section LA 6. This draft rule merges the effect of several provisions that require the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to apply unused tax credits against unsatisfied income tax obligations in tax years other than the year in which the tax credit arises. One minor policy clarification is being made for the rewrite of Part L. Under the 2004 Act, there is an inconsistent approach taken to the time at which tax credits arise and the tax year in which those tax credits are used to satisfy an obligation under the Act, particularly in a business context. 3 In the rewritten Part L, the time at which a person becomes entitled to a tax credit is, in general, related to the income year in which the underlying income or tax payment is made. A person can use their entitlement to a tax credit in satisfying an income tax liability for the tax year that corresponds to the income year in which the entitlement to the tax credit arises. However, this clarification will not apply to credits of tax that arise under subpart KB or KD of the 2004 Act as these credits can only arise and be used in relation to a tax year. Some provisions in Part L determine the amount of a tax credit attached to a payment of a dividend or a Maori authority distribution. These rules will be included in the rewrite of Part M and so are not included in the exposure draft for Part L. Benefits of the proposed structure Although current readers may be familiar with the concepts contained in Parts K and L, the rewriting of these two Parts must also take into account the needs of future readers. Future readers will come to the legislation without knowledge of how the various rules in Parts K and L interact with the core provisions and other Parts of the Act. In identifying these interrelationships, the draft legislation helps readers understand the relationship between provisions in other Parts of the Act and the transactions and situations dealt with in Parts K and L. The ordering of the subparts and provisions in the subparts reflects the drafting policy that more generally applicable provisions should appear earliest in each Part. Cross-references in this exposure draft to Parts outside Parts K and L relate to the 2004 Act, not to the recently released exposure drafts of other rewritten Parts. This is because further intensive specialist reviews of these exposure drafts are planned and may lead to changes to these draft provisions. Specific feedback There are no specific questions raised on any of the rewritten provisions. Comment on any of the drafting clarifications is welcomed. Relationship of Parts K and L to other Parts The main relationship between Part K and the rest of the Act is that the tax credit a person is entitled to for family income assistance is taken account of in draft subpart LA. 4 The rewritten Part L links to the core provisions through draft subpart LA, which contains the rules under which a person can use a tax credit arising in a tax year in satisfying their income tax liability. To achieve this outcome, the substantive tax credit rules in sections BC 8, BC 9, and BC 10 have been relocated to draft subpart LA. Credits that arise through sections in other Parts of the Act – for example, provisional tax and resident withholding tax – will also contain a link to the specific rules in Part L. The core provisions in subpart BC will be reviewed after releasing the exposure draft on rewritten Part O, to ensure that all links between the core provisions and the rewritten Parts F to O are properly reflected. Comment is invited on the advantages and disadvantages of providing general linking provisions within the rewritten Part L to the relevant provisions in other Parts of the Act. Moving 2004 Act Part K provisions to Part L Apart from subpart KD, all provisions in Part K have been relocated to the rewritten Part L. Moving 2004 Act provisions to subpart LZ Sections LF 6(1) and LF 6(3) have been moved to draft section LZ 1. Section KE 1 has been moved to draft sections LZ 6, LZ 7, and LZ 8.

The relatively high global oil prices and the run down of the Maui gas field make alternative energy sources for power generation attractive. It is against this background that officials have been looking at a number of tax issues relating to exploration and development of geothermal energy. 1.2 Geothermal energy has been used for power generation in New Zealand since the 1950s. While the government undertook early geothermal exploration and development, it is now being done by commercial businesses, for whom tax is obviously an important matter. 1.3 Taxpayers involved in the power generation industry have identified two tax- related problems: • the non-deductibility of expenditure incurred in exploration drilling when the geothermal well is not subsequently used for production purposes; and • the non-deductibility of expenditure on drilling a geothermal well, in a productive field, when the resulting well is unusable. 1.4 This paper, which has been prepared by officials from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue and from the Treasury, outlines the two problems and suggests a range of possible solutions. It seeks views on the suggested changes before we make recommendations to the government on the matter. The government has indicated that it would like to see legislative changes included in a taxation bill to be introduced in early 2006. Summary of suggested legislative changes 1.5 An “exploration well” would be a well drilled before a company applies for resource consents to develop a geothermal field. Furthermore: • The cost of exploration wells would be amortised and the value of the annual deduction would be a straight line rate of 11 per cent of the costs of drilling. 2 • Tax deductions for exploration wells would be allowed from the date that well completion testing begins. Failed exploration drilling would be amortised at the same rates as successful wells. The possibility of failed wells is taken into account in the amortisation rate. • Expenditure on drilling geothermal wells incurred after the date that the first application is made to develop a geothermal field would have to be capitalised and treated under normal depreciation rules. 1.6 It is also suggested that a write-off for the value of a geothermal well be allowed in limited circumstances. For wells drilled in the production phase, a tax deduction would be allowed if the well could not be used and the expenditure was written off for accounting purposes. For expenditure incurred on wells when the field is subsequently abandoned, a deduction for losses would be allowed if a geothermal well were sold or the rights to develop a geothermal field were abandoned. 1.7 The suggested changes would apply from the 2003-04 income tax year. How the changes would work – example Hotwater Co is looking for a geothermal field that is suitable for its business of power generation. It has a resource consent to explore the Waiariki field and after initial survey work, it drills ten exploration wells. On the basis of the information provided by these wells, Hotwater Co decides to build a power station on the field. It lodges resource consent applications to develop the field, including water use, water discharge and building consents. Under the suggested approach, the cost of the first ten exploration wells would be capitalised and amortised. The annual deduction is 11 percent of cost, from the date that the well’s completion testing starts. If the resource management applications are unsuccessful or the project is subsequently abandoned any resulting losses can be written off. In this case, Hotwater Co is committed to use the field for production purposes. It decides to drill two more wells after lodging applications for the necessary resource consent. The tax implications of this decision, under the suggested changes, are that this expenditure would be capitalised as field development and would be subject to the normal depreciation rules. In other words, the expenditure would be deemed to be incurred for production wells, since it was incurred after the exploration drilling phase. It would be depreciable over 20 years, the current estimate of estimated useful life, from the date that the wells are in use or available for use. 3 How to make a submission on the suggested changes 1.8 We would appreciate receiving any comments on the suggested changes by 31 January 2006. 1.9 Submissions should be sent to: Geothermal expenditure project C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 Wellington New Zealand 1.10 Alternatively, submissions can be made in electronic form, in which case ‘Geothermal expenditure project’ should appear in the subject line.

The issue of blackhole expenditure on geothermal drilling has been raised in the context of: • expenditure incurred in exploration drilling of wells that are not subsequently used for production purposes; and • expenditure on production drilling that result in wells that cannot be used in the production process. 2.3 Analysis of these tax issues is made more problematic because it is difficult to define a successful exploration well or the contribution that a well makes toward any future income-earning asset. 2.4 When businesses spend money on exploration drilling, they do not know whether a well will be used for producing income. Not only are there the physical aspects of the field and each well to consider. There are also broader economic considerations, such as whether the business can make enough money from building a new power station. Thus a well could be successful in one sense, in that it produces enough steam to be used to generate power, but it may not be sensible to build a power station for the foreseeable future. 2.5 It is also difficult to know to what extent an exploration well, successful or otherwise, contributes towards a better understanding of the field and the location of any eventual production wells. Geothermal energy and power generation 2.6 Geothermal power generation involves finding and harnessing a geothermal resource. The stages of developing a geothermal field for power generation include: • discovery phase: determining that a geothermal resource exists and warrants further examination; 5 • an exploration phase: determining the size, quality and viability of using the geothermal field to generate electricity; and • production phase: developing the power station/steam field concept, getting the necessary resource and building consents, drilling production wells and building the power station. 2.7 Geothermal exploration and production are managed under the Resource Management Act 1991. Local regional councils are the organisations responsible for the resource consenting processes. In practice, there are separate resource consents for the exploration phase and the production phase. 2.8 Under the current resource consent process there is no certainty that the company that does the initial exploration will be the company that develops the geothermal field. Thus it is possible that the first exploration company could be left with exploration wells on a field that another company takes into the production phase. In practice, the initial explorer will have the advantage of additional information from its exploration drilling programme. It should also have developed a workable relationship with local landowners and other interest groups. 2.9 The major risks with trying to harness geothermal energy are associated with the fluid conditions (and the risks of well scaling or corrosion) and permeability of the reservoir. Geothermal exploration typically costs between $25 and $60 million per field. These costs typically include: • pre-drilling cost – land access, analysis of any existing field data and surface surveying and analysis (mapping, geological, geochemical and geophysical work), with ecology studies carried out in preparation for consent applications; • the exploration drilling consent process; • drilling exploration wells (the bulk of the costs) – typically involves drilling a number of wells at between $3-5 million per well; • subsurface data analysis – which tends to occur as the drilling is being done, including analysis of cores and cuttings, sampling and analysis of deeper fluids, testing of specific well characteristics and general assessment of reservoir conditions and response; and • development of a computer simulated reservoir model. 6 2.10 When a field is found to be a good prospect, the explorer proceeds to develop a station/steam field concept, possibly in partnership with local interests. The firm then applies for the necessary resource consents only if the field is sufficiently attractive. When development resource consents have been obtained, the developer may hold them for years before it commits to the production phase. 1 2.11 The decision whether to build a power station hinges on the attractiveness of a steam field and on many other variables – notably expectations about the future wholesale price of electricity. 2.12 If a geothermal field is developed, the power station and steam field concept is drawn up and implemented. A proportion of the earlier exploration wells may be used. Some may be suitable to use to produce the steam required to generate electricity. Others may be suitable to re-inject the spent water back into the ground or may be suitable for monitoring the condition of the geothermal field. Additional production, monitoring and re-injection wells may also be drilled at this time. The power station and steam field infrastructure are also built. 2.13 Once up and running, a geothermal power station requires new wells from time to time. Existing wells may run out of pressure or be damaged by corrosion, scaling within the well (or surrounding formation), earth movement (subsidence or earthquake), or during well workovers. Other wells may be required to develop new sectors of the wider resource. Replacement rates tend to be field-specific depending on the nature of the fluid being produced or re-injected. Some of this production drilling may not be suitable for use. Current tax law 2.14 The current tax rules work to create non-depreciable and non-deductible capital expenditure. 2.15 Section DA 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 limits deductions for capital expenditure. It says that a person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent that the expenditure is of a capital nature. 1 Resource consents may have a “use it or lose it” condition that indicates that consent rights are forfeited if no work is done within a specified period. However, the Resource Management Act 1991 allows local councils to extend this period. 7 2.16 Section DA 4 says that the capital limitation (section DA 2(1)) does not apply to an amount of depreciation loss merely because the item is itself of a capital nature. 2.17 Section EE 1(2) describes when an amount of depreciation loss arises. In broad terms, the asset must be owned by the taxpayer, must be property that in the normal course of events is expected to depreciate, and must be in use or be available for use. 2.18 Section EE 41(2) allows the amount of depreciation loss to include, losses arising from the difference between the tax book value and the amount received when an asset is sold or scrapped. 2.19 The concerns that certain drilling costs are blackhole expenditure seem valid. The cost of unused exploration wells falls within section DA 2(1) unless section EE 1(2) applies. However, such a well is not in use or available for use and it is therefore non-depreciable and non-deductible expenditure. The same analysis holds for the cost of unsuccessful production drilling. That is, the well is never in use or available for use and also appears to be non- depreciable and non-deductible expenditure. The economic framework 2.20 From an economic perspective, we are concerned about the non-deductibility of capital expenditure only when the expenditure provides an asset that falls in value immediately or over time. 2.21 For taxes not to interfere with investment decisions, it is necessary for the investment decisions of taxpayers and non-taxpayers to be identical. As people will wish to invest if the present value of the benefits from an investment exceeds its cost, asset valuations must be independent of tax rates. 2.22 For asset valuations to be independent of tax rates, economic depreciation (the fall in market value of assets) must be deductible. 2 Conversely, if assets rise in value, the accruing capital gain (the rise in the market value) would need to be taxed, irrespective of whether or not assets were sold. In practice, there are formidable problems in taxing accruing capital gains. Even countries with capital gains taxes generally do not levy taxes on accruing gains. 2 This proposition is often referred to as the “invariant-valuations proposition”. For a formal discussion, see P.A. Samuelson (1964), “The Deductibility of Economic Depreciation to Insure Invariant Valuations”, Journal of Political Economy, 72(6), 604- 606. Samuelson’s article ignores uncertainty. For an extension that considers uncertainty see, G. Fane (1987) “Neutral Taxation under Uncertainty”, Journal of Public Economics, 33, 95-105. 8 2.23 Most business assets depreciate, however. Allowing deductions for economic depreciation for depreciating assets would, at least in theory, be a way of ensuring that, at least for these assets, investment decisions are independent of tax rates. 2.24 As discussed earlier, it may be difficult at the time of drilling to determine whether a useful asset has been created. It is also difficult to estimate the value the asset might have. 2.25 One approach when faced with such uncertainty is to capitalise the value of all unsuccessful wells into the next successful well. This approach recognises that the amount spent on exploration is related to the expected gains from exploring. However, this approach would be harsh in cases where the field never proves successful. For most depreciating assets, the law allows depreciation deductions as well as a deduction for any loss on scrapping. We therefore suggest treating expenditure on geothermal exploration wells in a way that is reasonable given the tax treatment of depreciable assets. The suggested tax solution 2.26 The depreciation rules seem to be generally working in relation to the production phase of geothermal drilling. The one exception is when production drilling produces a well that cannot be used. In this instance, we suggest allowing a deduction for expenditure incurred on failed production drilling. 2.27 For exploration drilling, we suggest that expenditure on geothermal exploration wells be guided by rules that allow the expenditure to be amortised. The amortisation rate would be an estimate of the likely success rate multiplied by the estimate of useful life of a successful geothermal well. The amortisation rate applies to all exploration wells, regardless of whether they are or are not successful. 2.28 The suggested approach is set out in more detail in chapters 3 and 4. 9 Chapter 3 EXPLORATION DRILLING 3.1 As discussed earlier, we suggest that expenditure on exploration drilling be treated separately from production drilling. To do this we need a reasonably robust and workable definition of exploration drilling. 3.2 The date of filing resource consents applications to develop a geothermal field, taking it to the production phase, is a way of differentiating between exploration and production drilling. Under this approach, expenditure on drilling incurred before the date of lodging applications to develop a field (typical resource applications for field development relate to the water extraction and water discharge and the relevant building consents) would be subject to the suggested amortisation rules. 3.3 We invite feedback on the way that we have suggested exploration drilling could be defined. Amortising exploration drilling 3.4 We suggest that expenditure incurred on exploration drilling be amortised at 11 per cent per annum. The deductions would be calculated from the start of well completion testing. Using an average success rate for exploration drilling 3.5 As discussed earlier, defining a successful exploration well and its contribution toward an income-earning asset is problematic. There is the question of whether the well will ever be used and the physical aspects of the field and each well to consider. When faced with such uncertainties a pragmatic approach seems best. 3.6 We suggest using an estimate of the average success rate for geothermal exploration drilling to assist in working out an amortisation rate for expenditure on all geothermal exploration wells. The benefit of this approach is that it is not necessary to identify whether a particular exploration well is or is not a failure. This would deal with the practical problem of determining whether an exploration well is successful or unsuccessful. 10 3.7 Since we are considering exploration drilling, it is appropriate to consider the success rates for the first few wells drilled in a geothermal field. In the past, seven to 15 exploration wells were normally required to answer critical questions about the suitability of a geothermal field for power generation. 3 However, changes to the structure of the industry suggest that exploration programmes of five to ten wells are now likely to be the typical approach. 4 3.8 Table 1 summarises the success rate for geothermal drilling in New Zealand and is based on research by Barr, Grant and McIachlan. 5 Their definition of success was any well capable of producing 1MW or more of power. These data clearly suggest that treating all exploration wells as successes is too harsh. They also suggest that expensing all exploration drilling is too generous. What we need is an estimate of the likely success rate for exploration drilling. 3.9 Table 1 data suggest a 53 percent success rate for well drilling, meaning a ten-well exploration programme will find, on average, 5.3 productive wells. 6 Table 1: Success rates for geothermal well drilling Success rate (percent) per 5 wells drilled\* Field 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th Wairakei 20% 40% 40% 80% 40% Kawerau 20% 80% 60% 100% 60% Broadlands 60% 60% 40% 80% 80% Mokai 60% n.a n.a n.a n.a Ngawha 40% 100% 60% n.a n.a Average success rate 40.0% 70.0% 50.0% 86.7% 60.0% \*A success is denoted as a well that produces 1MW or more 3.10 It is not clear whether the 53 percent average success rate is appropriate. On one hand, the 53 per cent average success rate for geothermal exploration drilling may be too generous because the Table 1 definition of a success excludes wells that produce less than 1MW or more of steam. Some of these unsuccessful wells may still have an economic value. They may have been useful for field monitoring or re-injection purposes or have contributed information about where to drill next, or where best to locate of the final production wells (assuming that the geothermal field is developed). 3 Proving and development of geothermal fields(1984), Hugh Barr, Malcolm A. Grant, and Robert Mclachlan, Report no. 116, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Wellington, pp 2, 18, and 24. 4 This is based on advice from the Resources and Networks Branch, Ministry of Economic Development. 5 Proving and development of geothermal fields(1984), Hugh Barr, Malcolm A. Grant, and Robert Mclachlan, Report no. 116, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Wellington. 6 (1+1+3+3+2+2+4+3+5)/(9\*5)=0.53 11 3.11 On the other hand, the average success rate of 53 percent counts wells that produce more then 1MW of steam, even though these wells may be unsuitable for production purposes. Such wells may be either too distant or too difficult to use for production purposes. 3.12 On balance, we suggest that a 53 percent success rate is not an unreasonable estimate to use, although we invite feedback on this estimate. We would also be interested in receiving information about the success rates for exploration drilling in other geothermal fields and any different approaches that could take into account the uncertainty round what is or is not a successful well. Working out the amortisation rate 3.13 Under the current depreciation rules, a geothermal well would be depreciated over 20 years once it is in use or is available for use. This suggests that a geothermal well can be used, on average, for 20 years – for example, the period for which it is connected to a power plant or can be connected to a power plant or some other income-generating asset. 3.14 A possible way of working out the amortisation period would be to multiply the average success rate for exploration drilling by the estimated useful life of a geothermal well. However, there is a draw back with this approach. 3.15 The current estimate of average useful life of a production well is 20 years. 7 Under the preceding assumptions, the amortisation period equals 10.67 years (0.53 x 20). This equals an annual straight-line deduction of 9.5 percent (1/10.67=.0938 rounded up). However, this approach does not produce the same present value of deductions as would allowing an immediate deduction for failed exploration drilling. 3.16 The amortisation rate of 9.5 per cent seems harsh when the present value of this stream of deductions is compared to the present value of deductions where an immediate deduction is allowed for failed wells and successful wells are depreciated over 20 years. 8 To address this concern we suggest an alternative approach. 3.17 We suggest using an amortisation rate of 11 percent straight line. Applying this rate results in the present value of deductions being approximately equal, between this approach and allowing an immediate deduction for failed wells and depreciating the successful wells over 20 years. 7 Geothermal wells are treated the same as “borewells”. In Determination 1 of the 2004 Income Tax Act, borewells have an estimated useful life of 20 years. 8 For comparing the present value of these streams of deductions, we use a discount rate of between 7 to 8 percent. For the depreciation stream of deductions we use the same average success rate of 53 per cent and assume a two year lag between the well being drilled and being used or available for use. This lag is based on the estimated time that it takes to build a power station. 12 3.18 We invite submissions on the suggested modified averaging approach. When to begin amortising 3.19 We suggest, again for pragmatic reasons, that the calculation of the deductions for each well begin from the date that completion testing starts. Such an approach is likely to be more generous than the treatment under the ordinary depreciation rules as it can take around two years to construct and bring into production a geothermal power plant. However, given the uncertainties that surround the decision to build a power station, it seems a pragmatic starting point. 3.20 This suggestion is an approach to amortising expenditure on exploration drilling to resolve the issue of blackhole expenditure. We invite feedback and are especially interested in new information that may affect the estimate of average success rates for exploration drilling, comments on the proposed definition of exploration drilling and the suggested amortisation rate. 13 Chapter 4 AN IMMEDIATE WRITE-OFF FOR WELL DRILLING EXPENDITURE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES 4.1 We also suggest that taxpayers be allowed to write off expenditure incurred on geothermal wells in certain situations. Unsuccessful production drilling 4.2 From time to time, new geothermal wells are required in a production field. While this production drilling is not as risky as exploration drilling, it sometimes produces wells that cannot be used for any purpose. 4.3 Because it is necessary to have a definition of “production drilling”, we suggest it is drilling done after the date the first resource consent application that relates to the production phase is lodged. Here we assume that an explorer will seek to lock in as quickly as possible the rights to develop a viable geothermal discovery. 4.4 When production drilling turns out to be unusable, we suggest that a deduction be allowed for this expenditure. Examples of problems that make production drilling useless include well casing failures and discovering that the ground around the well has poor permeability. 4.5 To claim a tax deduction for failed production drilling, the accounting treatment must also mirror the tax treatment. This means that the well must also be written off for accounting purposes. 4.6 We invite submissions on this approach and invite ideas on how best to define “production drilling” in legislation. When the right to develop a field is abandoned 4.7 As discussed in chapter 2, a geothermal field that is suitable for development may remain undeveloped for a number of years. During this time, deductions for the cost of exploration wells are allowed under the suggested amortisation rules. However, we also need rules to account for a total loss of value of the exploration wells. This could occur when: • the application to develop is not approved; or 14 • the rights to develop a field lapse (under the provisions of the Resource Management Act 1991); or • the proposed project is completely abandoned. 4.8 We suggest that a deduction for losses actually incurred on expenditure on the remaining wells in the field when a taxpayer abandons or sells the rights to develop the particular geothermal field. Examples of the type of rights that contribute to the development of a geothermal field are land access rights, water use and discharge rights issued under the Resource Management Act and any relevant building consent. How the new rules might work – example Hotwater Co spends $50 million on exploration wells and finds a usable resource. In order to develop the geothermal field, the developer applies for and is granted field development rights. At this point, Hotwater Co decides not to develop the geothermal field and decides to re- evaluate this decision in five years. Under the suggested amortisation rules, Hotwater Co is able to make a deduction of $5,500,000 9 per year for the cost of the exploration wells. After five years, it decides to abandon the idea of developing the field. It lets the development resource rights lapse and exits all the land access arrangements to the geothermal field. It receives no payments for giving up these rights and their financial accounts reflect that the project has been abandoned. It is able to claim a loss on abandonment of the remaining book value of the exploration wells. The total deduction for the loss on abandonment is $22,5000,000 ($50,000,000 – (5 x $5,500,000)). 4.9 We invite submissions on this approach and welcome alternative suggestions on how to approach the issue of deductions for the remaining book value of wells that are abandoned. Application date 4.10 We suggest that the proposed new rules apply from the 2003-04 income year on the basis that the current rules result in an economically incorrect result and that a significant amount of exploration expenditure has been incurred since this date. 4.11 However, we invite submissions on other possible application dates. 9 $50,000,000\*0.11=$5,500,000.
International treaty examination of the Agreement between New Zealand and the Republic of Poland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee The Finance and Expenditure Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the Agreement between New Zealand and the Republic of Poland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and has no matters to bring to the attention of the House. The National Interest Analysis for the Agreement is appended to this report. Clayton Cosgrove Chairperson INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION—DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH POLAND 2 NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS Agreement between New Zealand and the Republic of Poland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Protocol Date of proposed binding treaty action 1 An Agreement between New Zealand and the Republic of Poland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Protocol (the DTA) was signed on 21 April 2005. Subsequent to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The DTA will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and Poland, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the DTA in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the treaty 2 New Zealand currently has 29 double tax agreements (DTAs) in force. They are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 DTAs give residents of both countries who are considering entering into cross- border trade and investment greater certainty of tax treatment. DTAs also contain a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes or issues that might arise in relation to the DTA. DTAs also assist tax administrations in the prevention of fiscal evasion by providing for the exchange of information on tax matters between two countries coupled with an “Assistance in the Collection of Taxes” Article. 4 Negotiations with Poland were entered into as Poland is currently the focus of government interest in Central and Eastern Europe. As a recent European Union (EU) accession State, Poland is a net capital importer within the EU and thus found our Model, which predominately reserves source taxation, agreeable. The Prime Minister opened the New Zealand Embassy in Warsaw on 21 April 2005, which coincided with the signing of the DTA. Poland is also an OECD member, and New Zealand is the only OECD country with which Poland does not have a DTA. 5 The level of trade is also a major factor in deciding with which countries to negotiate a DTA. In terms of area and population, Poland is one of the larger countries in Europe. Its integration into the European Union economy should lead to strong economic growth in the coming years and, in time, significant trade opportunities for New Zealand. In the year to June 2004 New Zealand exported $NZ19.5 million worth of goods to Poland, and imported $NZ15 million from Poland. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION—DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH POLAND 3 Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty entering into force 6 The advantages to New Zealand of this DTA entering into force are: • It will remove tax impediments to cross-border transactions between New Zealand and Poland — in particular, it shares the cost of relieving the double taxation of income. The DTA will regulate how transactions should be taxed between the two counties so the income is effectively taxed only once. • It will generally reduce withholding taxes on dividends, interest and royalties to 15 percent, 10 percent, and 10 percent, respectively, and will exempt many short-term activities of individuals and businesses in the host country. • When both countries are permitted to impose tax, it will ensure that the country of residence allows a credit or exemption for the tax paid in the country of source. • The DTA will provide taxpayers with greater certainty of tax treatment, along with a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputed issues that may arise in relation to the DTA. • The DTA will also assist the tax administrations of both countries by facilitating the exchange of information relating to taxes. 7 One disadvantage of the DTA is that New Zealand may forgo some revenue because of the reduction in New Zealand tax and the allocation of taxing rights to Poland under the DTA. Although, as explained in the discussion under “Costs” (below), the reciprocal nature of the DTA mean that these revenue costs will be offset by increases in revenue where taxing rights are allocated to New Zealand and where Polish tax is correspondingly reduced under the DTA. 8 The requirement for New Zealand to provide information on tax matters to Poland under the DTA’s exchange of information provisions may be seen as a disadvantage. However, again, the ability to request information is reciprocal, and New Zealand’s experience with exchange of information in relation to its 29 other DTAs is predominately positive (the benefit gained from being able to request information from the other country more than offsetting the administrative burden of having to provide information pursuant to their requests). 9 The DTA also has an “Assistance in the Collection of Taxes” Article. An advantage of this is that it will provide a mechanism for the New Zealand Government to recover unpaid tax from taxpayers living in Poland. This will result in the New Zealand Government being able to collect tax more effectively and efficiently than it would be able to in the absence of the Agreement. However, this obligation is reciprocal in nature. In other words, the Polish Government is able to require the New Zealand Government to collect its unpaid tax from taxpayers in New Zealand. 10 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interest to conclude a DTA with Poland. It is expected to enhance cross-border trade and investment and will assist the New Zealand Government in the prevention of fiscal evasion. It will also advance New Zealand’s INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION—DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH POLAND 4 interests in the new EU accession States of Central and Eastern Europe and in Poland, in particular, by signalling our continued willingness to treat them as serious economic partners. Obligations 11 The DTA does not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it imposes are on the Contracting States and restricts their taxing rights under domestic law on a reciprocal basis (a DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot impose tax). 12 Under domestic law, New Zealand taxes its residents based on their New Zealand and worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income, and Poland has a similar system. This gives rise to the possibility that cross-border flows of income will be subject to double taxation. The DTA provides a way of allocating taxing rights as between New Zealand and Poland. Under this DTA, New Zealand and Poland will be required to comply with the following rules when imposing tax on residents of either country: • Income from immovable property will generally be taxed in the country where the property is situated (Article 6 refers). • Business profits will generally be taxable only in the country where the business is resident. However, the profit derived through a permanent establishment situated in the other country may be taxed in that country. A permanent establishment generally exists when there is a fixed base in the country in question where the business of an enterprise is carried on (Article 7 refers). • Profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft shall be taxable only in that country, subject to various specific rules applicable in specific situations (Article 8 refers). • Dividends paid by a company of one country to a resident of the other country may be taxed in that other country. The source country resident may also tax the dividend up to a maximum of 15 percent on the gross amount of the dividends (Article 10 refers). • Interest may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the interest arises must not impose tax in excess of 10 percent (Article 11 refers). • Royalties may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the royalties arise must not impose tax in excess of 10 percent of the royalties (Article 12 refers). • Specific rules apply to the taxation of income, profits or gains derived from the sale of property. In the case of immovable property, the profits are taxable where the property is situated (Article 13 refers). • Income from employment will be taxable only in the country where the employee is resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country. In this case, the INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION—DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH POLAND 5 country where the employment is performed may also tax the income, if the employee is present for at least 183 days and various conditions are met (Article 14 refers). • Directors’ fees may be taxed on the country where the relevant company is resident (Article 15 refers). • Entertainers and sportspersons may be taxed in the country in which the activities of the sportsperson or entertainer take place (Article 16 refers). • Pensions and annuities are only taxable in the country where the recipient is resident. Any alimony or maintenance payments are also only taxable in the country where the payment was made (Article 17 refers). • Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country are generally exempt from tax in the other country (Article 18 refers). • Tertiary students are generally not taxed on payments received from outside the country when those payments are for the maintenance and education of the student (Article 19 refers). New Zealand has to comply with the various administrative requirements of the DTA that make its operation possible. These include, in particular, the elimination of double taxation by exempting or giving credits for overseas tax paid in certain situations; not enacting tax laws that discriminate against residents of Poland (vis-à-vis residents of any other State); complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the DTA; complying with the exchange of information procedures; and assisting Poland with the collection of unpaid tax from taxpayers in New Zealand (Articles 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25 refer). Economic, social, cultural and environmental effects 13 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 14 New Zealand may forgo some revenue from the limitation of our taxing rights in relation to income flows between New Zealand and Poland and which we are currently able to tax under our domestic laws. This revenue cost could include, for instance, tax forgone in relation to short-term activities of Polish residents in New Zealand, which the DTA will exempt. It could also include tax forgone on dividends, interest and royalties paid by New Zealand residents to the residents of Poland in respect of which the DTA will lower withholding rates. 15 Poland will also be similarly constrained from taxing certain income flows between Poland and New Zealand, and this reduced Polish tax will often flow through to the New Zealand tax base through a reduction in credits for foreign tax paid. It is likely that these factors will offset each other to some extent over time. But, to the extent that the cost to New Zealand revenue is not fully offset by the reduction in creditable Polish tax, we would expect that the economic benefits of the DTA will outweigh these costs. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION—DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH POLAND 6 Future protocols 16 No future protocols are anticipated. Implementation 17 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented domestically by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004. 18 The DTA will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 2004 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 19 The Treasury has been consulted and agrees with the terms of the DTA. No private sector consultation was entered into. Withdrawal or denunciation 20 Article 28 of the DTA provides that either Contracting State may terminate the DTA by giving notice through diplomatic channels of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of 5 years from the date of its entry into force.
