Gains on liabilities of controlled foreign companies
====================================================

2011 changes to the Income Tax Act relating to investors in controlled foreign companies who have been taxed on foreign exchange rate gains on liabilities.

_**Sections DZ 19, EX 20C and EZ 32C of the Income Tax Act 2007**_

New and temporary provisions have been added to the Income Tax Act 2007. These provide relief to investors in controlled foreign companies who have been taxed on foreign exchange rate gains on liabilities, if certain requirements are met.

### Background

The taxation of investments in controlled foreign companies (CFCs) was reformed in 2009. Investments in CFCs are now taxed only when the CFC earns passive income such as financial arrangement income, royalties and rent.

In unusual cases involving foreign currency loans and significant foreign exchange movements, financial arrangement income may arise from money that a CFC has borrowed; that is, from a liability. This may result in taxation of the investment in the CFC.

In general, it was not intended that a CFC's borrowing on its own would affect its taxation. Even CFCs undertaking entirely active businesses - manufacturing, retailing and so on - need to borrow money to finance their operations. Such CFCs would not be able to claim deductions for financial arrangement expenditure, so taxation of financial arrangement income can result in over-taxation when exchange rates fluctuate.

However, there are concerns that simply ignoring financial arrangement income from liabilities might open a loophole. Indeed, legislation was enacted to close such a loophole in the old controlled foreign company rules.

Therefore, as a temporary solution to the problem that has been identified, deductions for some financial arrangement expenditure are instead allowed to offset taxation of financial arrangement income.

This solution applies only to holding companies in a narrow range of circumstances. Further work is being undertaken to establish whether a more comprehensive but less complex solution can be developed that does not pose unacceptable risks to the tax base.

### Key features

Investors in a CFC may be entitled to claim deductions for financial arrangement expenditure that would otherwise be denied under section EX 20C(2) because the item "fraction" in the formula in that section would be less than 1, if the CFC:

*   is not a banking or insurance business and is not controlled by one;
*   has a main activity of borrowing to invest in shares in foreign companies that it controls;
*   has financial arrangements that are liabilities providing funds to the CFC (loans);
*   has net foreign currency gains or losses on the loans, and any net currency gains included in the investors' income exceed the total net currency gains or losses; and
*   has net gains (taking into account the whole arrangement, not just currency movements) from the loans that are included in the investor's income.

Net gains and losses are to be calculated over a period that will generally include the current year and the preceding four years (the offset period).

In such cases, the excess of the net currency gains that are taxed over the total net currency gains is available to reverse the denial of deductions, including denial in a prior period within the offset period.

However, the total reversal of denied deductions may never exceed the total net gains (currency or otherwise) from the arrangements in question. That is, relief provided by the new provision will never go further than effectively ignoring the arrangements altogether.

If the investor has a net loss from the CFC as a result of reversing the denial of deductions, or an increased net loss, the loss or increase in the loss may be carried back to an earlier year in the offset period.

The amount of loss that may be carried back to a year must not exceed the lesser of:

*   the amount of net income in that year that is due to currency movements on loans; or
*   the amount of net income in that year from the loans (whether due to currency movements or otherwise).

The new provisions apply on a per-CFC basis. It is not possible to average currency movements across CFCs.

### Application date

The new provisions are temporary. They apply for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009 and ending before 1 July 2013.

### Detailed analysis

**_Subsection EZ 32C(1) - when the provision applies_**

The new provision in section EZ 32C applies if a number of conditions are met.

_Paragraph (a) - CFC not involved in banking or insurance_  
If the CFC is in the business of banking or insurance, or is controlled by a person in a business of banking or insurance, the provision does not apply.

_Paragraph (b) - CFC's main activity is borrowing to invest in shares_  
The provision does not apply unless the CFC's main activity is borrowing to invest in shares in foreign companies that it controls.

That is, the provision is intended only for use by holding companies which debt-fund the capitalisation of subsidiaries.

_Paragraph (c) - CFC has loans and anti-avoidance rule does not apply_  
For the provision to apply, the CFC must be a party to financial arrangements that are liabilities of the CFC and that provide funds for the CFC (put briefly, loans). The provision is intended only to relieve tax effects that arise from currency gains on money the CFC has borrowed.

In addition, at the time the financial arrangement is entered into, or at a later time when the terms of the arrangement are altered, there must not be any reasonable expectation that the CFC will have more income than expenditure from the financial arrangement.

This is an anti-avoidance rule to prevent use of the provision when, through manipulation, a person might deliberately create income from a liability to take advantage of the relief offered.

The provision is meant to apply in the much more likely situation that a person has taken a loan on arm's-length terms with an expectation that there will be net expenditure on the loan (interest expenditure will exceed net exchange rate gains).

_Paragraphs (d) and (e) - CFC is affected by currency movements on its loans, and calculation of_ loan currency amount  
As a result of foreign exchange rate movements the CFC must have had gains or losses from its loans in at least two periods within a certain period (usually a five-year period, but see subsection (9)). The provision is only useful when there is an exchange rate loss that has been effectively ignored in one period, but a gain in another that has been taxed.

The example below is a loan denominated in United States dollars. Conversion to New Zealand dollars required under section EX 21(7), along with movements in the NZD-USD exchange rate, lead to increases or decreases of the outstanding loan principal. Those increases or decreases are gains or losses.

The amount of currency gain or loss for a particular loan in a particular income year is called the _loan currency amount_.

##### Example

CFC Co has an interest-only loan of US$100 million, which it takes out at the end of the 2010 income year.

The NZD-USD exchange rate at the beginning of the 2011 year is 0.76. At the end of the 2011 year it is 0.74. There is a currency loss of 100 ÷ 0.74 \- 100 ÷ 0.76 = NZ$3.6 million, and a loan currency amount of \- $3.6 million.

The exchange rate at the end of the 2012 year returns to 0.76. There is a currency gain of NZ$3.6 million and a loan currency amount of + $3.6 million.

_Paragraphs (f) and (g) - there has been expenditure relating to the loan in a period and some of the expenditure has not been taken into account for tax purposes_  
The provision is only useful if there has been some denial of deductions for financial arrangement expenditure under section EX 20C(2) because the item fraction is less than one. The effect of the provision is to reverse some or all of the denial in such a case.

Paragraph (f) contains the requirement that a loan currency amount must have been included in the calculation of expenditure that contributes to the item "limited funding costs" in the formula in section EX 20C(2), limited funding costs being subject to multiplication by the item "fraction".

Paragraph (g) contains the requirement that the item fraction, in the year that limited funding costs includes a contribution from a loan currency amount, is less than 1.

_Paragraph (h) - person chooses to use the provision or has used it in the past_  
Use of the new provision in section EZ 32C is optional. It does not apply unless the taxpayer elects to apply it.

However, once it has been used to reduce income or increase loss in an income year, it must continue to be used in every later income year.

**_Subsections (2) and (3) - calculation of included currency amount_**

If all the requirements in subsection (1) are met, the provision in EZ 32C operates firstly by comparing amounts of currency gain or loss (_loan currency amounts_ determined in subsection (1)) to amounts of currency gain or loss that would be subjected to tax under the CFC rules.

Roughly speaking, if more net gain would be subjected to tax than has actually arisen, then the difference should be available to relieve tax obligations.

Subsection (2) defines amounts of currency gain or loss that would be subjected to tax under the CFC rules. These are called _included currency amounts_. Subsection (3) defines the items used in the formula in subsection (2).

A loan currency amount for a particular arrangement and a particular year is an included currency amount to the extent it contributes to items in the formula for net attributable CFC income or loss in subsection EX 20C(2), other than the item "later losses" in that formula. Where the loan currency amount contributes to more than one item, a separate included currency amount is calculated for each item.

##### Example

CFC Co has financial arrangement income of $50 million for the 2011 income year. This consists of an interest expense of $150 million and a loan currency amount of $200 million (a gain). The $50 million is all included in the item attributable CFC. Therefore, the loan currency amount is also included in the item attributable CFC and the included currency amount is $200 million.

If the loan currency amount relates to a financial arrangement for which there is income in the relevant year, then to the extent that the loan currency amount is included in the item "attributable CFC" in the formula in section EX 20C(2), the loan currency amount is an included currency amount.

If the loan currency amount relates to a financial arrangement for which there is financial arrangement expenditure in the relevant year, then there are two ways in which the amount may be an included currency amount.

Firstly, to the extent the expenditure contributes to the item "other deductions" in the formula, the loan currency amount is an included currency amount. And secondly, to the extent the expenditure contributes to the item "limited funding costs" in the formula and is not reduced by the item "fraction", the loan currency amount is also an included currency amount.

##### Example

Alter Co, a CFC, has borrowed money and on-lent 40% of the money to an associated active CFC. Apart from the on-lent money, 80% of Alter Co's assets produce active (non-attributable) income. Because of its borrowing, Alter Co has financial arrangement expenditure of $10 million for the 2018 income year. This consists of an interest expense of $5 million and a loan currency amount of -$5 million (a $5 million currency loss).

$2 million of the $5 million currency loss is included in the item "other deductions" in the formula in section EX 20C(2). That is, 40% of the $5 million loss is not part of limited funding costs under subsection EX 20C(5). The $2 million is fully deductible under paragraph EX 20C(9)(b). The included currency amount is -$2 million (-$10 million x 50% x 100% x 40% = -$2 million).

$3 million of the $5 million currency loss is included in the item "limited funding costs" in the formula in section EX 20C(2). The item "fraction" is 20% because Alter Co has 20% of its assets that generate attributable income. Therefore, the included currency amount is -$0.6 million (-$10 million x 50% x 20% x 60%).

Total included currency amounts for the 2018 year are -$2.6 million.

In summary:

|     | $m  |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Loan currency amount | \-5 |     |
| Other amounts | \-5 |     |
| Loan currency amount as percentage of total | 50% | \[1\] |
| Contribution of loan currency amount to other deductions | \-2 | (40% x -10 x \[1\]) \[2\] |
| Applicable fraction | 100% | \[3\] |
| **Included currency amount** | **\-2** | **\[2\] x \[3\] = \[4\]** |
| Contribution of loan currency amount to limited funding costs | \-3 | (60% x -10 x \[1\]) \[5\] |
| Applicable fraction | 20% | \[6\] |
| **Included currency amount** | **\-0.6** | **\[5\] x \[6\]** |

##### Example

CFC Co has financial arrangement expenditure of $350 million for the 2012 income year. This consists of an interest expense of $150 million and a loan currency amount of -$200 million (a loss). This $350 million is all included in the item "limited funding costs" in the formula in section EX 20C(2). However, the item "fraction" in the formula in section EX 20C(2) is zero because CFC Co has no assets that generate attributable income. Therefore, the included currency amount is zero.

##### Example

Fortune Co has financial arrangement income of $1 million for the 2011 income year. This consists of an interest expense of $150 million and a loan currency amount of $151 million (a gain). The $1 million is all included in the item -"attributable CFC" in the formula in section EX 20C(2). Therefore, the included currency amount is $151 million.

Short Co has financial arrangement expenditure of $1 million for the 2011 income year. This consists of an interest expense of $150 million and a loan currency amount of $149 million (a gain). The $1 million is all included in the item limited funding costs in the formula in section EX 20C(2). Short Co has no assets that generate attributable income, so the item fraction in the formula in section EX 20C(2) is zero and the included currency amount is also zero.

When the included currency amounts exceed the loan currency amounts for a CFC, the excess may be available to reverse the effective denial of deductions in section EX 20C(2) (if the item fraction is less than 1). To the extent effective denial is reversed, part of the excess is not available to be used again. This is reflected in the item _earlier adjustments_ in the formula in subsection EZ 32C(2).

##### Example

CFC Co's included currency amounts for 2011 and 2012, before taking into account earlier adjustments, are $200 million. This amount exceeds the total of loan currency amounts, which is nil, by $200 million.

Suppose that once the calculation for 2011 and 2012 is done, $50 million of the excess is able to be applied to effectively increase deductions in the 2011 year.

In 2013, and assuming no further exchange rate change, the total of included currency amounts for the period 2011-2013 will be $150 million, being $200 million less $50 million of earlier adjustments. The excess of this amount over total loan currency amounts is $150 million, which is the amount that may be available to provide further relief.

**_Subsection (4) - when denial of deductions may be reversed_**

Subsection (4) states that effective denial of deductions may be reversed when the included currency amounts are both positive and in excess of the loan currency amounts. That is, when more net currency gain has been taxed than has actually arisen.

Subsection (4) is a precondition. Effective reversal of denial actually occurs in subsection (7). The reversal of denial makes nil or negative included currency amounts more negative; that is, it decreases nil or negative included amounts.

**_Subsections (5) and (6) - amount available for reversing denial of deductions_**

Subsection (5) says that the amount of denial that may be reversed is limited to the lowest of three amounts calculated for the CFC.

The first amount is the total of the included currency amounts for the offset period (subsection (9) describes the offset period). Relief will never exceed the amount of net currency gain that has actually been brought to tax.

The second amount is the excess of the total included currency amounts over the total loan currency amounts for the offset period. Relief is only available to the extent that the taxable net gain exceeds the actual net gain.

The third amount is the total of _all_ amounts brought to tax under the relevant financial arrangements for the offset period, including currency gains or losses but also any other contributions. Relief is only available to the extent some net income has been brought to tax over the period (no relief is given if there has been net expenditure allowed in the calculation of net attributable CFC income or loss, even if the allowed expenditure is less than total net expenditure). The detailed calculation of total amounts is given by paragraph (5)(c) and subsection (6).

The maximum amount of denial that may be reversed is called the _total current adjustment_.

_Paragraph (5)(c) and subsection (6) - calculating total contributions of the financial arrangement_

The formula for the total of all amounts brought to tax under the relevant financial arrangement follows the model in subsections (2) and (3). However, instead of including all or part of currency gains or losses, all or part of all income or expenditure under the arrangement is included.

##### Example

CFC Co has financial arrangement income of $50 million in 2011, consisting of a $200 million foreign exchange gain and a $150 million interest expense, and financial arrangement expenditure of $350 million in 2012, consisting of a $200 million foreign exchange loss and $150 million of interest expenditure.

The total of the loan currency amounts in 2011 and 2012 is $0. The item fraction is zero in the formula in section EX 20C(2), so that the total of included currency amounts for 2011 and 2012 is $200 million. Thus, the excess of included currency amounts over loan currency amounts is $200 million.

In the formula in paragraph (5)(c) the loan contribution made in 2011 is $50 million and fraction is 1. In 2012, the loan contribution is -$350 million and fraction is 0. As a result, the total current adjustment is limited to $50 million.

**_Subsections (7) and (8) - how to reverse effective denial_** 

The total current adjustment is to be applied to reverse effective denial of deductions; that is, to allow more financial arrangement expenditure to be taken into account when it relates to currency movements and has been limited by a fraction that is less than 1 in section EX 20C(2).

Effective denial may be reversed in the current year or in any of the prior years in the offset period.

Subsection (7) requires that the total current adjustment be first used in the current accounting period of the CFC (the year for which the total current adjustment is calculated, referred to in subsection (1)). Any amounts remaining may then be used in earlier periods in the offset period, beginning with the earliest period.

Within an accounting period, cases are identified in which included currency amounts are nil or negative but would have been more negative but for the item fraction being less than 1 in section EX 20C(2).

##### Example

Esra Co has two loans. In 2011, there is financial arrangement income of $50 from loan 1, comprising a $200 currency gain and $150 of interest expense. There is financial arrangement expenditure of $350 from loan 2, comprising a $200 currency loss and $150 of interest expense. The item fraction in the formula in section EX 20C(2) is zero.

For loan 1, there is no difference, since the included currency amount is positive. For loan 2, there is a difference of $200, being the positive amount subtracted from the included currency amount ($0) to get the loan currency amount (-$200).

The difference of $200 is able to be reduced if there is a total current adjustment. Since the total current adjustment in 2011 is only $50 (because of the item in paragraph (5)(c)) not all of the $200 can actually be reduced in 2011, and $150 will remain available to be reduced if there are suitable currency movements in later years

The formula in paragraph (d) is applied to allocate the total current adjustment across the positive differences found in paragraph (c).

If the total current adjustment t is enough to reduce all positive differences in the accounting period, any remaining amount is available to be used in other years in the offset period.

##### Example

Luc Co has two loans. In 2011, there is financial arrangement expenditure of $250 from loan 1, comprising a $100 currency loss and $150 of interest expense. There is financial arrangement expenditure of $100 from loan 2, comprising a $50 currency gain and $150 of interest expense. The item fraction in the formula in section EX 20C(2) is 0.5 at all times.

For loan 1, there is a difference of $50 (the positive amount subtracted from abbr title="minus">-$50 to get abbr title="minus">-$100). For loan 2, there is no difference because the included currency amount is positive.

In 2011, the total current adjustment is zero, so no amount is actually applied to loan 1 at that time.

In 2012, there is financial arrangement income of $50 from loan 1 ($200 of currency gain and $150 of interest expense) and financial arrangement income of $150 from loan 2 ($300 of currency gain and $150 of interest expense).

For loans 1 and 2 in 2012, there is no available difference since included currency amounts are positive.

The total current adjustment for 2012 is $25. There is nothing to apply this to in 2012. However, the difference of $50 for loan 1 remains available in 2011. The total current adjustment of $25 may be applied to that arrangement in the 2011 income year.

If the total current adjustment is not enough to reduce all positive differences in the accounting period, the total current adjustment is to be used on a pro-rata basis to reduce all the positive differences.

##### Example

Lana Co has three loans. In 2011, there is financial arrangement income of $50 from loan 1, comprising a $200 currency gain and $150 of interest expense.

Loans 2 and 3 are identical. There is financial arrangement expenditure of $175 from each, comprising a $100 currency loss and $75 of interest expense. The item fraction in the formula in section EX 20C(2) is zero.

For loan 1, there is no available difference. For each of loans 2 and 3, there is a difference of $100.

The total current adjustment for 2011 is $50. This is allocated according to the formula in paragraph (7)(d), giving $100 x $50 ÷ $200 = $25. $25 is applied to each of loans 2 and 3 in the 2011 year.

**_Subsection (9) - when current period is able to be adjusted (the offset period)_**

Subsection (9) gives the periods in which, for any year in which section EZ 32C is applied, adjustments may be made. This is referred to in subsection (1) as the offset period, and is also the period from which figures are included for the calculations in subsections (4) and (5).

In general, the offset period is the current accounting period (when section EZ 32C is applied), as well as the previous four accounting periods.

However, it does not include any period corresponding to an income year that ends before 1 July 2009. This means that only years in which the new CFC rules apply (they were introduced in 2009) are included in the offset period.

The offset period may be shortened if the CFC has changed its residence or if its ownership has changed. This is intended as a safeguard against relief being transferred between jurisdictions or taxpayers.

**_Subsections (10) and (11) - adjustment of income_**

The application of section (7) results in decreased net attributable CFC income or increased net attributable CFC loss in the current year or an earlier year in the offset period, through the item _later losses_ in the formula in section EX 20C(2) and subsection (10). It also results in increased financial arrangement expenditure for the relevant financial arrangement, in the unlikely event that such expenditure has not already been included, for the purposes of any base price adjustment, through subsection (11).

**_Subsection (12) and section DZ 19 - carrying back losses_**

Subsection (12) and section DZ 19 permit certain losses resulting from the application of section EX 32C to be carried back from an income year to an earlier year in the offset period.

This treatment may result in tax paid in an earlier year (because of currency gains at that time) being refunded in a later year because of subsequent currency losses.

The amount of loss that may be carried back may not reduce net income or increase net loss in the earlier year by more than would have been the case had all loan currency amounts in the year been reduced to nil or the relevant financial arrangements been completely ignored in that year.

**_Complete example_**

##### Example

CFC Co has no passive assets at any time, so that the item fraction in section EX 20C is always zero. It has a loan of US$1 billion.

In 2011, it makes a foreign exchange gain of NZ$200 million on the loan and has a NZ$150 million interest expense (after currency conversion). In the formula in section EZ 32C(2), the item "currency contribution" is NZ$200 million and the amount fraction is 1, giving an included currency amount of $200 million (and a loan currency amount of $200 million). The amount under section EZ 32C(5)(c) would be $50 million, being the amount included in the item attributable CFC.

In 2012, CFC Co makes a foreign exchange loss of NZ$200 million and has a NZ$150 million interest expense. The item "currency contribution" is -NZ$200 million and the amount fraction is 0, giving an included currency amount of $0 (and a loan currency amount of -$200 million). The amount under section EZ 32C(5)(c) would be zero because the item fraction in EX 20C(2) is zero.

The total amount of loan currency amounts is $0 and the total of included currency amounts is $200 million. This means that, in principle, up to $200 million is available for adjustments. However, summing the total amounts of arrangement income and expenditure (not just those due to currency) gives $50 million, so the total current adjustment in 2012 is limited to $50 million. This is allocated against the 2012 year, so that "later losses" in section EX 20C(2) becomes $50 million and $50 million is subtracted from net attributed CFC income or loss.

Suppose that the CFC has no income or loss other than from its loan and the CFC investor has no income or loss from other sources. Then there is a $50 million loss as a result of the operation of sections EZ 32C(7) and (10).

In 2011, if the loan had not been denominated in a foreign currency there would have been no net income, as opposed to $50 million of net income. Similarly, if the loan had not existed there would have been no net income. Therefore, the amount given by subsection EZ 32C(13) in relation to the 2011 year is $50 million. The loss of $50 million in the 2012 year may be carried back to 2011, leading to a refund of income tax paid on 2011 income. The loss then ceases to be available in the 2012 year.

In 2013, suppose that there is income from the arrangement of $100 million, made up of a foreign exchange gain of $250 million and interest expense of $150 million. At the end of 2013, the total current adjustment amount will be $100 million (note that this is after removal of $50 million because of the earlier adjustment made in 2012). This amount of $100 million will be available to apply to the 2012 year.

Gateway services
================

Each software provider has, at their discretion, chosen which of the gateway services they will integrate with and offer to their customers. Through their software, you can use these gateway service offerings to file your clients' income tax returns. or, you can do it in myIR.

Return acknowledgements (RA) and Notices of assessment (NOA) are available in myIR or through the document service in gateway services.

Your software provider should let you know what you need to do to get set up for gateway services in their software.

To use gateway services, all you need is a myIR account with the appropriate level of access.

If the software that you use requires an upgrade, you may need to log into it and provide your myIR credentials again.

### If you or your staff, don’t have a myIR logon

Each of your staff members that will be using gateway services will need their own myIR logon.

The ability to perform certain actions in gateway services is based on the user’s level of access in myIR.

Once the new logon is created, you will need to grant access to the relevant client list(s) you want staff to have access to. You grant access from 'Manage agency' within the Intermediary centre.

You can find the Manage agency guide – IR1104 in the Manage agency service in myIR and on our website.

Set up new myIR logons for your staff.

[Create web logon access for a myIR account](/topics/myir-secure-online-services/add-web-logon-access-for-a-myir-account)

### Gateway services permissions

The permissions for myIR will be replicated for gateway services. For example, ‘full account access’ in gateway services is the same as it is in myIR.

There is however 1 difference relating to access permissions. In gateway services you can do credit transfers when filing returns if you have ‘File’ permissions. In myIR, if you only have ‘File’ permission, you cannot do a credit transfer when filing.

### Services each software provider offers

As this is commercially sensitive, we cannot give this level of detail. Please talk directly to your provider(s) about their specific service offerings.

Key changes
-----------

We have created a number of operations (API’s) that now let software providers integrate with our new system to perform certain functions. Each software provider has the discretion to choose which operations they build for their customers.

Again, we ask that you talk to your software provider to understand what their specific service offerings are. In the meantime, you can still use myIR to access any services your software provider does not offer.

### Linking

You must first link the client to your agency before performing action(s) in gateway services. Talk to your software provider to see if they offer this option. If they do not, you can still link the client to your agency in myIR or SPK2IR.

### Transfer requests - income tax return service

When you file a return, gateway services let you request up to 20 transfers.

You cannot request a specific effective date for a transfer request. Our system will determine the best effective date. To get the earliest date you should let us know if the transfer is between associated customers.

### Calculating your client’s correct PIR for their returns for 2021 onwards

If your software provider does not offer or give you the client’s PIR rate, in myIR, you can use  ‘View my PIR’ in the client’s income tax account to work out the correct PIR. We also have an unauthenticated calculator.

Document service
----------------

You cannot send correspondence through gateway services.

If you need to send correspondence to us asking for some form of action, you will still need to use secure mail in myIR.

The document service lets you upload and send any supporting material, for example copies of invoices or financial statements when you file your client’s return. Talk to your software provider and ask if they offer this service. The document service is a repository service, and it only supports the associated return being filed. Uploading and sending documents to us does not hold the return. It does not trigger any manual intervention by us either.

### Attaching IR10s and financial statements

The IR10 has been included as part of the income tax return service offering. You can complete it as an attachment.

You can also upload and send in financial statements to us using the document service. Talk to your software provider and ask if they offer this service.

### Maximum file size that can be sent via gateway services

The maximum file size is 9MB.

### Customer details

Ngā aratohu tāpui pūtea rīanga General insurance reserving guidelines
=====================================================================

Summary
-------

### Unearned premium reserve

The unearned premium reserve ("UPR") is the portion of gross premium that relates to the cover of risks beyond the insurer's balance date, calculated on a daily basis. Alternative calculation methods may be acceptable where the daily basis is not appropriate.

### Reinsurance premiums

*   Reinsurance premiums should be recognised separately as expenditure when applying the deductibility provisions in the Act and are not required to be netted off against premium income.
*   Any unexpired portion of deductible reinsurance premiums at the end of an income year is to be included in gross income as accrual expenditure under section EF 1 of the Act, subject to the exemptions in Determination E 10.

### Acquisition costs

*   Acquisition costs should be recognised separately as expenditure when applying the deductibility provisions in the Act and are not required to be netted off against premium income or in calculating the UPR.
*   Any unexpired portion of deductible acquisition costs at the end of an income year is to be included in gross income as accrual expenditure under section EF 1, subject to Determination E 10.

### Outstanding claims reserve ("OCR")

*   An insurer may deduct a reasonable estimate of the outstanding claims incurred and not paid at the end of an income year. This may include those claims incurred but not reported ("IBNR") where the insured event occurred before the end of that income year.
*   Policy benefit amounts and direct claim settlement costs are incurred at the time of the insured event, and a reasonable estimate of costs is deductible in that income year.
*   Indirect claim settlement costs constitute ongoing business expenses that will be incurred over time whether or not any particular claim is received by an insurer. Indirect claim settlement costs should not be included in the estimation of the insurer's outstanding claims reserve or IBNR.
*   Any deductible unexpired portion of direct claims settlement costs at the end of an income year is to be included in gross income as accrual expenditure under section EF 1, subject to any determination of exemption under section EF 1(3) (currently Determination E 10).
*   Section EF 1 does not require policy benefit amounts under an insurance policy to be included in gross income as accrual expenditure at year end, whether such amounts are paid directly to the insured or on the insured's behalf, or whether they are paid to third parties providing goods or services to an insured in discharge of the insurer's liability under the policy. However, unexpired expenditure on direct claims settlement costs is required to be adjusted but the unexpired portion of such costs can be estimated.

### Section DK 5 Outstanding claims reserve

Section DK 5 of the Act sets out the valuation method to be adopted for outstanding claims in relation to insurance to which the provisions of the Accident Insurance Act 1998 apply. Section EF 1 does not apply to reserves claimed as a deduction under section DK 5.

### Salvages and other recoveries

Current industry practice is to credit the expected net recovery against claims expenses. At year end the OCR is reduced by the amount of any expected net recovery.

*   For tax purposes Inland Revenue considers third party receivables constitute debts subject to the bad debt write-off provisions. Salvages are considered to constitute trading stock.
*   However, Inland Revenue accepts that the derivation of any gross income, bad debts written off and the value of any trading stock are effected through the claim process with adjustments to the OCR and therefore does not require them to be separately reported, provided movements in these items within the OCR are adequately recorded.
*   Section EF 1 does not apply to the costs associated with salvages and recoveries.

Te tono whakaaetanga whānui mō ō mahi rangahau me te whakawhanake Applying for general approval on your R&D activities
======================================================================================================================

From the 2020-21 and future income years, unless you're eligible and elect to be a significant performer, you must get general approval on your R&D activities before claiming the R&D tax credit.

You’ll use the general approval process if either:

*   your R&D expenditure will be less than $2 million during the application year
*   you choose not to opt into the significant performer regime on some or all of your R&D activities.

If your R&D expenditure will be in excess of $2 million during the application year, you have a choice between either:

*   applying for general approval
*   electing to be a significant performer.

[Electing to be a significant performer for your R&D activities](/research-and-development/tax-incentive/claiming/significant-performer)

Support
-------

Callaghan Innovation can support you with your application if you’re new to the R&D tax incentive. Request support on the R&D tax incentive website.

[Free tailored R&D tax incentive support - rdti.govt.nz](https://rdti.govt.nz/we-provide-free-tailored-support)

General approval on your R&D activities
---------------------------------------

General approval is intended to provide certainty to customers that their activities are eligible for the tax incentive. Applying for general approval is free. Approval is granted before you file your R&D supplementary return and submit your income tax return.

You must describe the core and supporting R&D activities that you are seeking approval for. In your application, you must also set out the income years you want approved. If you expect that your activities will take longer than a year to complete, you may apply for general approval for up to a maximum of three years.

Research and development (R&D) tax incentive credit - eligible R&D activity guidance - March 2021
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eligible R&D activity has a specific statutory definition for the purposes of the tax credit which is not the same as the commercial, engineering or accounting definitions. The tax credit is not just for scientific research but also for development activity that meets the eligibility criteria.

This guidance introduces core R&D activities. If you have eligible core R&D activities, you may also receive the tax credit for supporting R&D activities which are referenced later in the guidance.

### ANZSRC codes

When you apply for general approval, you need to include the Australian and New Zealand Standard Research Classification (ANZSRC) code most relevant to your area of research.

ANZSRC is a statistical classification used for R&D measurement and analysis in Australia and New Zealand. The code is for statistical purposes only and will not be used during the appraisal process.

Choose from the full list of ANZSRC codes.

### Joint ventures, partnerships and look-through companies

Each individual party to a joint venture, partnership or look-through company needs to either apply for general approval or, if eligible, enrol as a significant performer. To make sure your applications are processed consistently, you and the other individuals should agree on a standard description for your R&D project and activities.

You will also need to apply for general approval for any other R&D activities not undertaken jointly.

If you are completing the general approval process as part of a joint venture, partnership or look-through company, you'll need to give us information relating to each party. For look-through companies, this means you’ll need to give us details of the other look-through company shareholders.

### Due date for your general approval application

General approval applications are due by the 7th day of the 2nd month following the end of your income year. For taxpayers with a standard balance date of 31 March, the due date is 7 May.

We encourage you to apply for general approval as soon as you have enough detail. Once approved, your R&D activities are eligible for a claim at the end of the income year. You can apply for new activities to be included even after approval and regardless of being part of a wider project. However, you’ll need to make sure you apply for these changes before the 7th day of the 2nd month following the end of your income year.

### Preparation and timeline for general approval

Before making a general approval application, you’ll need to register for the R&D tax incentive.

[Register for the research and development tax incentive](/research-and-development/tax-incentive/claiming/enrol)

Here are some examples of timelines for claiming R&D tax credits according to your situation. If you have a non-standard balance date, adjust your dates accordingly. We do not accept late applications in any of the timelines.

[Balance dates](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/balance-dates)

#### Example - standard balance date with a tax agent and an extension

| Date | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 7 May 2021 | Due date for your application for general approval. |
|     | We will review your application before you're required to file your R&D supplementary return. |
| 31 March 2022 | Your income tax return for the tax year ending 31 March 2021 is due. |
| 30 April 2022 | You must file your R&D supplementary return by this date. |

#### Example - standard balance date without a tax agent or extension

| Date | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 7 May 2021 | Due date for your application for general approval. |
|     | Due to the narrow timeframe, it’s good practice to submit your application earlier than 7 May if you have the information ready. |
| 7 July 2021 | Your income tax return for the tax year ending 31 March 2021 is due. |
| 6 August 2021 | You must file your R&D supplementary return by this date. |

General depreciation determination - fishing nets
=================================================

QB (2003) considers depreciation and how to account for allowable deductions when fishing nets become unusable, and the allowable deductions for fishing lines.

We have been asked for clarification of depreciation determination DEP50 (published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) at page 18).  Two separate matters have been raised.

**Background**

Determination DEP50 inserted two general asset classes in the "Fishing" industry category.  The general asset classes are "Nets (fishing) bottom trawl, complete with accessories" and "Nets (fishing) other, complete with accessories".  The depreciation rate set for bottom trawl fishing nets is based on an expected useful life of 1 year.  All other nets have an expected useful life of 2 years.

There were corresponding changes to the six specific asset classes which previously covered fishing net and its associated parts.  "Nets (fishing)" was removed.  "Bridles", "Sweeps" and "Trawl Boards" were also removed and are now to be treated as "accessory" items.  The estimated useful life of "Wire (trawl)" was amended to 1 year.  A further change applies to "Lines (fishing)".  This has been deleted from the industry category and is now to be treated as an allowable deduction.

**The First Query - Fishing Nets Become Unusable**

17.  Ordinarily fishing nets are depreciated over the expected useful life of the particular asset.  However, it may be that due to accident or other damage beyond normal wear and tear, the net is lost, damaged beyond repair, with the result that the actual life of a particular net is less than its expected useful life.  It has been suggested that actual life of nets is highly variable and may (depending on unpredictable events) be as short as a one-off use or, with regular repairs and maintenance, a year or more.  We have been asked how to account for allowable deductions for depreciation in that situation.

1.  These types of situations are covered by section EG 19 of the Income Tax Act 1994 which deals with dispositions of depreciable property (other than a building).  The definition of "disposal" in section EG 19 is wide and includes any event as a consequence of which the property is irreparably damaged, or lost and not recovered.  For example, when a net is lost in one trawl through snagging or becomes unusable as a result of other circumstances.  This broad concept of "disposal" is important because, for the purposes of section EG 19, such property is deemed to have been disposed of by a taxpayer for a consideration that is less than its adjusted tax value at the time of disposition.  In that situation the loss on disposition is **deductible in the income year in which the disposition occurs** (rather than there being ongoing depreciation deductions claimed).

**The Second Query - Allowable Deductions for Fishing Lines**

17.  We have also been asked to clarify the correct treatment to be applied to fishing lines.  This issue is significant for long-lining operators, whose vessels do not carry nets (and so cannot account for lines as an "accessory" item), but will also be of interest to the wider fishing industry.

1.  Taxpayers operating in the fishing industry will normally be entitled to claim a tax deduction in respect of expenditure outlaid on the acquisition and use of fishing lines.  Information available to the Commissioner indicates that a long-lining operation will typically consume large quantities of line coils each year, thus supporting the treatment of lines as potentially an allowable deduction and not depreciable property (as was previously the case).  This means that the expenditure will now be allowed as an immediate deduction under section BD 2(1) as an ordinary business expense (as long as the normal tests of deductibility are met).  As such, fishing lines are not covered by the potential range of accessory items now included in the two general asset classes for fishing nets.  This will be the case for all fishing industry taxpayers and not only long-lining operators.  It is not expected that this will result in any significant change, as lines were described as an "expense" item previously.  
      
    The effective timing of the deduction may, however, be subject to section EF 1 in the event that the lines have not been fully used up in deriving gross income at the end of the income year.

[Part 5 - General provisions](/new-legislation/act-articles/kiwisaver-act-2006/part-5-general-provisions "Part 5 - General provisions")

General provisions
==================

KiwiSaver Act 2006 - Part 5 clarifies Crown and employer liability.

#### Clarification of Crown and employer liability

Section 205 ensures that there is no Crown guarantee of any KiwiSaver scheme or investment product relating to a KiwiSaver scheme.

Section 206 clarifies the liability of employers, the Crown and any other person in relation to information that they provide about KiwiSaver. If an employer or the Crown, for example, only supplies an information pack, gives a factual description of the features of a KiwiSaver scheme, provides KiwiSaver information in the course of promoting the benefits of retirement savings in general or otherwise performs a function, duty or power under the Act, they will not be liable for giving investment advice under the Investment Advisers (Disclosure) Act 1996.

#### Unique identifiers

Section 207 overrides Information Privacy Principle 12(2) and (4) of the Privacy Act 1993 (which relate to unique identifiers) to allow a provider of a KiwiSaver scheme to:

*   require an individual to disclose any unique identifier that has been assigned to that person by the Commissioner for the purposes of carrying out specified functions, duties or powers; and
*   assign to a proposed member, or member of the KiwiSaver scheme any unique identifier assigned to that person by the Commissioner.

This override of the Privacy Act does not authorise a provider to use a unique identifier assigned by the Commissioner, except for the purpose of carrying out specified KiwiSaver functions, duties or powers.

**Example one**  
The Commissioner allocates a person to be a member of TT Ltd, a default KiwiSaver scheme. TT Ltd can use the person's tax file number (as provided by the Commissioner) as that person's unique identifier.

#### Information held by the Commissioner for someone who has opted out or who should not have been a KiwiSaver member

Under section 208 the Commissioner must not use personal information collected on certain people for purposes other than the administration of KiwiSaver if the personal information was provided as required by, and for the purposes of, the Act and has not been provided to the Commissioner for purposes related to any other Inland Revenue Act.

The Commissioner cannot use personal information relating to:

*   an employee who has given an opt-out notice to the Commissioner or to an employer after:

*   the date the opt-out notice is accepted by the Commissioner if the opt-out notice is given to the Commissioner and does not result in a requirement for contributions that are in the possession of the Commissioner to be repaid;
*   the date that the Commissioner receives a copy of the notice from the employer if the opt-out notice is received by an employer and does not result in a requirement for contributions that are in the possession of the Commissioner to be repaid; or
*   the date of the final refund of those contributions if the opt-out notice results in a requirement for contributions that are in the possession of the Commissioner to be repaid; or

*   a person who is allocated to a KiwiSaver scheme in circumstances in which the Act does not require the person to be allocated to a KiwiSaver scheme and the person does not opt into any KiwiSaver scheme or choose to remain in the KiwiSaver scheme to which they are allocated.

#### Interface with securities law

Where a member's security in a KiwiSaver scheme cannot be allotted (for example, if the scheme's prospectus is cancelled), the Act seeks to place the member back to their previous position as far as possible by transferring that member back to their previous KiwiSaver scheme, or if this is not possible, into a default KiwiSaver scheme.

The Act also clarifies that if a person is allocated to either a default scheme or an employer-chosen scheme, the member is considered to have received an investment statement. This is to ensure that a security may not be made voidable at a later date simply because the provider does not have proof that the member had in fact received the investment statement.

#### Disputes

If a matter under Parts 2 and 3 of the Act is left to the discretion, judgement, opinion, approval, consent or determination of the Commissioner, under section 212 a person affected by the Commissioner's decision has 20 working days (from the date on which the notice of the decision was given to the person) to:

*   request that the Commissioner reconsider the decision; and
*   give the Commissioner any information in support of that request.

The Commissioner may require a person to make that request by notice. On receiving a request, the Commissioner may:

*   accept the person's request;
*   seek further information from the person;
*   decline the person's request; or
*   accept or decline the person's request in part and decline or accept the other part.

Section 213 provides that Part 8A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 applies to every notice of a disputable decision given by the Commissioner under the Act.

#### Penalties

Sections 214 to 216 set out penalties that are to apply for KiwiSaver purposes. If there is a failure to provide information or withhold contributions under Part 2 or 3 of the Act, specific KiwiSaver penalties will apply in addition to the provisions of the Tax Administration Act. However, if the specific KiwiSaver penalties outlined below apply, the following provisions in the Tax Administration Act will not apply:

*   Part 7 (which relates to interest);
*   Section 139B (which relates to late payment penalties); and
*   Sections 141 to 141L (which relate to tax shortfalls).

Penalty for employers who fail to provide information Employers who fail to give information required by Part 2 or 3 of the Act will be subject to the following penalty:

*   nil, if the Commissioner has not given notice to the employer within the preceding 12 months that a penalty may be imposed; and
*   in any other case:

*   $50, if the employer is a small employer; and
*   $250, if the employer is not a small employer.

A "small employer" is defined as:

*   an employer whose gross tax deductions payable and specified superannuation contribution withholding tax payable in the preceding tax year were less than $100,000 in total; or
*   not being an employer in the preceding year, until gross tax deductions payable and specified superannuation contribution withholding tax payable in the current tax year exceed $100,000 in total.

The penalty is due and payable on the day the next tax deduction required under the PAYE rules is due to be paid to the Commissioner after the end of the PAYE period in which the failure occurred.

#### Penalty for employers who fail to make a deduction or incorrectly make deductions

Every employer who fails to deduct a contribution from a payment of salary or wages as required by this Act or who deducts an incorrect amount under the Act is liable for the following penalties:

*   nil, if the Commissioner has not given notice to the employer, within the preceding 12 months, that a penalty may be imposed; and
*   in any other case:

*   $50, if the employer is a small employer (as defined above); and
*   $250, if the employer is not a small employer.

An employer is not liable, however, for more than one penalty per month to which any employer monthly schedule relates. The penalty is due and payable on the day the next tax deduction required under the PAYE rules is due to be paid to the Commissioner after the end of the PAYE period in which the failure or incorrect deduction occurred.

#### Giving of notices

Section 14 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 applies when the Act requires the Commissioner to give a notice to a person. Section 14B of the Tax Administration Act applies when the Act requires a person to give a notice to the Commissioner.

When the Act requires a person to give a notice to someone other than the Commissioner:

*   the notice must be in writing;
*   the notice may be given by:

*   personal delivery to an addressee who is not a corporate body;
*   personal delivery to an addressee that is a corporate body, if the personal delivery is made to the addressee's office during working hours;
*   an electronic means of communication to the addresses, if the person complies with the Electronic Transactions Act 2002; or
*   posting it to:
*   the street address of the addressee's usual or last known place of residence;
*   the street address of any of the addressee's usual or last known place of business; or
*   to any other address, if the addressee has notified the person that he or she accepts notices at the address.

A notice given by post is treated as having been given at the same time it would have been delivered in the ordinary course of postal delivery.

Get ready for payday filing
===========================

**27 March 2019**

Payday filing is less than a week away from becoming mandatory so Inland Revenue is making sure all New Zealand employers are set up and ready to go from April 1.

This is when employers will be required to send their payroll information to Inland Revenue whenever they pay their staff.

Inland Revenue Customer Segment Leader Richard Owen says the focus is firmly on helping employers get that first filing under their belt.

“Around 51,000 employers have already started and the rest have been set up with a payroll account in myIR so they can payday file for the first time in April.

“The payroll account sits within the ‘My Business’ section in myIR and has been available to all employers for the past couple of weeks to allow them time to familiarise themselves with the new system in advance.”

Guides on the Inland Revenue [website](https://www.ird.govt.nz/campaigns/2018/campaign-payday-filing.html "Check out the payday filing guides")
 (search “payday filing”) show employers exactly what they need to do.

”I would encourage employers to examine those guides on our website and have a good look around the payroll account in myIR before their first April payday,” says Mr Owen. “Also, it’s a good idea to take some time to make sure whoever does the payroll has the correct access and permissions.”

Some employers will have one more filing cycle to complete next month under the old method, but payday filing still starts from the first April payday.

Final Employer Monthly Schedule and Employer Deductions forms for March can be submitted in the payroll returns account.

Richard Owen says Inland Revenue recognises that businesses are busy and that’s why some employers have left the payday filing requirement right up until the deadline.

“We have been gearing up for this by communicating directly to employers about exactly what they need to do and having extra staff on hand to deal with their queries.

“Fortunately, we know that awareness of payday filing is very high so this shouldn’t be news to the country’s employers – our focus now is to help get them started.”

There are multiple ways to payday file and employers are tending to choose the option that best suits their business.

Payroll software is proving popular as it is linked to Inland Revenue’s systems to allow the information to flow directly. In addition, a number of employers are choosing to file using myIR, where they can upload files from their software or enter the information themselves.

“The main thing we want employers to know is that we’re here to help them be ready for mandatory payday filing from April 1,” Richard Owen says.

.

When you have RWT exempt status you do not have to pay this tax. This means your payer stops deducting the tax from payments made to you.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

You can get the independent earner tax credit (IETC) during the year. This means you'll pay less tax each payday. 

You can also get it after the end of the tax year.

After the end of the tax year we'll send you an income tax assessment. If you did not receive the right amount of independent earner tax credit, you might get a refund or have tax to pay. 

If you earn more than $24,000 from your main job
------------------------------------------------

If you have 1 job and you earn between $24,000 and $70,000, or if you have more than 1 job and you earn more than $24,000 in your main job and your total income is between $24,000 and $70,000:

*   fill in the Tax code declaration - IR330. Choose tax code ME or, if you have a student loan, ME SL for your main job.
*   give the IR330 to your employer before your next payday.  

If you earn less than $24,000 from your main job
------------------------------------------------

If you earn less than $24,000 in your main job but your total income is between $24,000 and $70,000, you have 2 options.

*   Receive your IETC at the end of the year.

*   Apply for a tailored tax code during the tax year.

Tailored tax codes help you pay the right amount of tax if your circumstances mean you often have a large tax bill or refund.

[Apply for a tailored tax code](https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/tax-codes-and-tax-rates-for-individuals/tax-codes-for-individuals/apply-for-a-tailored-tax-code)

2025 tax year
-------------

The income thresholds for IETC changed on 31 July 2024. You may not get the full credit in this tax year if your income was between $48,000 and $70,000 as the threshold only increased part way through the year.

If you start a new job
----------------------

Fill out a Tax code declaration - IR330 every time you start a new job.

If you’re still eligible for the independent earner tax credit, choose tax code ME or ME SL for your main job. Give the IR330 to your employer before your next payday.

If your new salary means you’re no longer eligible, choose tax code M or M SL for your main job.

The independent earner tax credit is worked out on whole months. Starting a new job might mean you get too little or too much independent earner tax credit. You can apply for a tailored tax code to help make sure you get the right amount of independent earner tax credit.

Get the independent earner tax credit at the end of the tax year
----------------------------------------------------------------

If you're entitled to get the independent earner tax credit but did not get it during the year, you'll get it at the end of the year, after your income tax assessment has been processed.

Gift duty abolition
===================

New legislation abolishes gift duty for dispositions of property made on/after 1 Oct 2011 as compliance costs far outweigh the revenue collected.

**_Sections 2(2) and 61 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968_**

The new legislation abolishes gift duty for dispositions of property made on or after 1 October 2011. The change follows a review of gift duty, which revealed that the compliance costs far outweigh both the revenue it collects and the limited protections it has offered to prevent tax avoidance, social assistance targeting and defeat of creditors.

The definition of a "gift" in section 2 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (EGDA) is amended so that the term refers only to dispositions of property before 1 October 2011. The Bill also amends section 61 of the EGDA to ensure that gift duty is payable only for gifts made from the Act's commencement until 1 October 2011.

#### Background

Gift duty has existed in New Zealand since 1885. Its original purpose was to protect the estate duty base (by discouraging the gifting of assets before death) and to raise revenue. When estate duty was abolished in 1992, the government of the day decided to retain gift duty to protect against income tax avoidance and social assistance targeting until alternative protection measures could be introduced.

Ministers and officials have received frequent requests for exemptions from gift duty and for a review of the gift duty thresholds over the past few years. The thresholds of $27,000 for non-dutiable gifts and $12,000 for the filing of gift statements were set in 1984 and have not been revised since. In addition, administration of gift duty has become antiquated, with no provision for the electronic filing of gift statements or any form of payment other than by cheque. Further, the valuation of annuities for the purposes of gifts under the EGDA is set according to life expectancy data that is more than 25 years out of date.

With this background, a review of gift duty was initiated. Options considered included:

*   narrowing the scope of gift duty to apply only to gifts between individuals, trusts and closely held companies;
*   raising the thresholds at which gift duty applies;
*   removing the requirement to file gift statements for non-liable gifts;
*   introducing electronic systems for the filing of gift statements and payment of gift duty; and
*   updating life-expectancy tables for valuing annuities under the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968.

As the review progressed, a strong case for outright abolition emerged. Some of the concerns which existed in 1992 have been addressed or reduced by the strengthening of existing legislative provisions. Remaining areas of concern were scrutinised in consultation with the Treasury, the Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Health, New Zealand Police, the Ministry of Social Development, and Housing New Zealand Corporation. None of these agencies opposed gift duty abolition and several have said they will make administrative changes to support its abolition.

The review concluded that gift duty no longer raises any significant revenue and imposes a high level of compliance costs on the private sector. The protections offered by gift duty in the areas of income tax, creditors and social assistance have been incidental rather than intended policy goals. The analysis undertaken across government revealed that the protection gift duty offers is inefficient, limited and outweighed by the significant compliance costs that it imposes on the private sector. Therefore Ministers decided to abolish gift duty and an effective date of 1 October 2011 was chosen to provide certainty for the private sector.

The government agencies mentioned above will monitor the effects of gift duty abolition on their respective areas of responsibility. Inland Revenue will also co-ordinate, in due course, a post-implementation review to ensure there are no unintended consequences arising from the abolition of gift duty.

#### Key features

*   Gift duty will not be payable for dispositions of property made on or after 1 October 2011.
*   Gift statements will not need to be filed for dispositions of property made on or after 1 October 2011.
*   Gift duty and gift statements will remain due for dispositions of property made prior to 1 October 2011.

#### Application date

The new legislation abolishes gift duty for dispositions of property made on or after 1 October 2011. The EGDA remains effective with respect to dispositions of property before this date.

#### Detailed analysis

#### _Record keeping requirements_

Gift statements will not be required for dispositions of property made on or after 1 October 2011. However, requirements to ensure the legal certainty of gifts, such as deeds of gift for trusts, are unchanged. Taxpayers may, therefore, still need to consult a lawyer when making a gift.

#### _Income tax implications_

The abolition of gift duty does not have any impact on income tax anti-avoidance rules. As has always been the case, a gift may be deemed to be part of a wider arrangement of tax avoidance under section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

There is a range of provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 designed to directly ensure integrity around arrangements involving gifts, in addition to the general anti-avoidance provisions. These include:

*   section HC 35, the minor beneficiary income rule;
*   section EW 38, which provides for the disposal of financial arrangements for less than fully adequate consideration; [1](#1)
    
*   section HD 15, which creates joint and several liability of company directors and controlling or interested shareholders where a company enters into an arrangement that results in an inability to meet its tax liability;
*   sections CD 6, which deems there to be a dividend for transfers of value from a company to an individual;
*   subpart CX, which treats certain gifts to employees as a fringe benefit;
*   sections FC 1 and FC 2, which provides for the treatment of distributions from companies and trusts, gifts, and transfers of assets and liabilities upon death as disposals and acquisitions at market value; and
*   section GC 1, which provides rules for disposal of trading stock for less than fully adequate consideration.

Additionally, the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 provides rules for dealing with transactions when goods and services are supplied to final consumers at non-arm's length terms, refer section 10(3).

* * *

1 Section EW 44 provides an exception to this rule where the creditor forgives the debtor's debt because of the natural love and affection the creditor has for the debtor.

*   Base price adjustment
    ---------------------
    
    A base price adjustment is a "wash-up" calculation a taxpayer does when they stop being part of a financial arrangement.
    
    The taxpayer has to compare total cashflow (received and paid) under the terms of the arrangement against the income and deductions from that arrangement.
    
*   Best Start
    ----------
    
    Best Start is a weekly payment for families supporting a new-born baby. Families who qualify for Best Start can receive the payment until their baby turns 1, no matter how much they earn.
    
    After the first year, you can continue to receive Best Start payments until your child turns three, depending on your family income.
    
    Best Start begins when paid parental leave finishes – you cannot receive both at the same time.
    
*   Blockchain technology
    ---------------------
    
    Enables secure information sharing online, which makes cryptocurrencies possible. Blockchain creates a shared database – but one that’s duplicated thousands (or even millions) of times across a network of computers.
    
    Most blockchain transactions are publically viewable and transparent. Every time an update is made to a blockchain database, it’s visible to everyone who has access. Transactions are also secure. Since a blockchain database isn’t stored in a single, centralised location the information it holds is easy to verify and hard for a hacker to corrupt.
    
*   Bright-line losses carried forward
    ----------------------------------
    
    If you sell a residential property at a loss, your total costs are more than the sale price of the property.
    
    If the bright-line property rule applies to the sale, you can only offset the loss against net income from another property sale.
    
    Any remaining bright-line loss is carried forward to the next year until the loss can be used.
    
*   Bright-line test
    ----------------
    
    The bright-line test means you'll pay tax on the profit made on the sale of residential property when it is sold within a certain timeframe, unless an exclusion or rollover relief applies.

*   Business industry classification (BIC) code
    -------------------------------------------
    
    Your business industry classification (BIC) code should match your business industry description, based on the main activity you’re involved in.

    *   applying for an IRD number
    *   registering for GST
    *   registering as an employer
    *   filing tax returns
    *   applying to go on the Companies Register.
    
    ACC also uses your BIC code to work out the correct classification unit and levy rate your business pays to cover workplace accidents.
    
    You can find the right BIC with the Business Industry Classification Code website.

Individuals who are associated persons can count as 1 individual.
    
*   Close family associates
    -----------------------
    
    2 people are close family associates if:
    
    *   they are within 4 degrees of blood relationship
    *   they are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship or 1 person is within 4 degrees of blood relationship to the other person’s spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner.

The first step of this process is an investigation by us into the parent's income, earning capacity, property and financial resources.
    
*   Commonly owned group
    --------------------
    
    A commonly owned group (group) of businesses is one where each business has the same owners. It does not matter whether those owners have the same proportion of ownership in each business. 
    
    A business may also be treated as being in the group if it is part of a larger group of businesses if they are centrally controlled or otherwise operate together. For example, the group:
    
    *   has a dominating shareholder or group of shareholders, and the businesses operate together as if they were one
    *   of businesses involves a complex ownership structure where the overall control is centralised and businesses are in substance one enterprise. 
    
*   Comparator period or comparison period
    --------------------------------------
    
    The comparator period falls during (either) the period beginning on either 5 January:  
    
    *   2022 and ending at the close of 15 February 2022
    *   2021 and ending at the close of 15 February 2021. 
    
    Businesses or organisations with highly seasonal revenue must meet the drop in revenue test set out above. However, they may select a 7-day comparison period which is before 5 January 2022 and which may be from a past year, which reflects their typical revenue. 
    
*   Competent authorities
    ---------------------
    
    Competent authorities are the people in tax jurisdictions responsible for implementing a double tax agreement.
    
*   Conditions or protections that defer the share scheme taxing date
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    
    For example, the taxing date will be deferred if:
    
    *   the employee is required to sell their shares back to the employer (other than for market value) if they leave the company, or
    *   the employee has the benefit of a limited recourse loan.
    
*   Connected persons
    -----------------

    *   people who have a power to appoint or dismiss a trustee, amend the trust deed, or to add or remove a beneficiary - that is, appointors
    *   people with the power to control the exercise of a power to appoint or dismiss a trustee, amend the trust deed, or to add or remove a beneficiary and persons who have the power to control a trustee in the administration of the trust - that is, protectors
    *   trustees

*   Control interest
    ----------------
    
    Control interests are used to work out if a foreign company is a controlled foreign company (CFC).
    
    Someone has a direct control interest (sometimes called 'a controlling interest') in a foreign company if they:
    
    *   hold any shares
    *   have any shareholder decision making rights
    *   have the right to get income from the company, or have the company's income dealt with on their behalf
    *   have the right to get value from the distribution of any of the company's assets.
    
*   Controlled foreign company (CFC)
    --------------------------------
    
    Controlled foreign companies are based overseas but controlled by a small number of New Zealand residents. The company itself must not be a tax resident in New Zealand or must be treated as foreign under a double tax agreement.
    
    Most commonly, 'control' means total ownership of the non resident company by a New Zealand resident.
    
    However, control can also exist where:
    
    *   5 or fewer New Zealand residents have a controlling interest of more than 50%
    *   5 or fewer New Zealand residents control the shareholder decision rights
    *   a single New Zealand resident has a controlling interest of 40% or more, and no non-associated non resident owns a larger controlling interest.

    The CVC requirements are set out in the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Protection Framework) Order 2021 which came into force at 11.59 pm on 2 December 2021.
    
    In brief, a regulated business or organisation must choose whether to operate under the CVC rules or non-CVC rules (as in, require the use of the My Vaccine Pass or not).  The conditions of operation that apply to the regulated business or organisation will depend upon the choice made. Operating in compliance with the CVC requirements means the business or organisation complies with the applicable conditions of operation.

    *   gather information about a customer's identity
    *   verify a customer's identity to make sure the customer is who they say they are.
    
    This process aids the detection, management and mitigation of the risk of money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
    
    You must already be, or become, a customer of a New Zealand reporting entity so that CDD can be carried out by them. If you aren't a customer of a New Zealand reporting entity, you can become one by choosing to use the service(s) provided by them.

    So, if rent for your property is usually $100 per night, and your friends rent it for $50, that's a mates rate. It's a mates rate because you're charging them 50% of your property's market value rent.

Your accountant may be able to provide this advice. 
    
    You must keep any evidence of the business or organisation's ongoing viability at the time of requesting the CSP, as we may audit your application in the future. 
    
    This evidence could include, for example:

    Most blockchain transactions are publically viewable and transparent. Every time an update is made to a blockchain database, it’s visible to everyone who has access. Transactions are also secure. Since a blockchain database isn’t stored in a single, centralised location the information it holds is easy to verify and hard for a hacker to corrupt.
    
*   Blocks
    ------
    
    Blocks contain transactional information such as the time, value and participants in a trade. Each block contains many transactions.
    
*   Bright-line losses carried forward

    *   The legislative public health measures taken in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the New Zealand community.
    *   Any business circumstances that are, or are reasonably likely to be, a consequence of the circumstances described above.

    The CVC requirements are set out in the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Protection Framework) Order 2021 which came into force at 11.59 pm on 2 December 2021.
    
    In brief, a regulated business or organisation must choose whether to operate under the CVC rules or non-CVC rules (as in, require the use of the My Vaccine Pass or not).  The conditions of operation that apply to the regulated business or organisation will depend upon the choice made. Operating in compliance with the CVC requirements means the business or organisation complies with the applicable conditions of operation.
    
*   Cryptoasset disposal
    --------------------
    
    A disposal includes:
    
    *   selling cryptoassets for money
    *   exchanging one cryptoasset for another type of cryptoasset
    *   using cryptoassets to pay for goods or services
    *   giving away cryptoassets to another person.
    
    A disposal does not include moving cryptoassets between wallets, addresses or accounts that all belong to you.
    
*   Cryptoassets
    ------------
    
    Cryptoassets are property. For us ‘cryptoassets’ are digital assets that use cryptography and blockchain technology. We see them as: 
    
    *   cryptocurrencies 
    *   crypto coins 
    *   digital tokens 
    *   cryptographic assets  
    *   digital financial assets 
    *   virtual currencies
    *   representing property or financial assets for securities like shares or debt. For example security or asset tokens like Dai and tZERO.   
    
    We do not see cryptoassets as currency or money. But they are used as payment or exchanged as a payment. So for us we’ll also see cryptocurrencies as: 
    
    *   tokens, for example Bitcoin and Litecoin (also called payment tokens, exchange tokens, intrinsic tokens or simply cryptocurrencies) 
    *   traditional payment vouchers, for example Siacoin and Dentacoin (also called ‘utility’ tokens).

*   Customer due diligence
    ----------------------
    
    Customer due diligence (CDD) is a process that is completed with a New Zealand reporting entity. As part of this process the reporting entity will need to:
    
    *   gather information about a customer's identity
    *   verify a customer's identity to make sure the customer is who they say they are.
    
    This process aids the detection, management and mitigation of the risk of money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
    
    You must already be, or become, a customer of a New Zealand reporting entity so that CDD can be carried out by them. If you aren't a customer of a New Zealand reporting entity, you can become one by choosing to use the service(s) provided by them.

*   Deduction notice
    ----------------
    
    When a taxpayer has unpaid taxes, we can send a deduction notice to a third party that owes money to the taxpayer. The deduction notice requires the third party (often an employer or a bank) to pay the money to Inland Revenue instead.

*   Main home
    ---------
    
    Your main home is the property where you live for most of the time. If you have more than 1 property, it is the one you have the greatest connection to. You cannot have more than 1 main home.
    
    Which property is your main home depends on:
    
    *   the amount of time you spend living in each house
    *   where your immediate family lives
    *   where your personal property is kept
    *   where your social ties are strongest

    *   what other ties you have with the surrounding community - for example, your job, business or finances.
    
*   Major change
    ------------
    
    Within the context of the business continuity test, a major change depends on the extent to which new assets, activities and operations are used in generating business income.
    
    For example, using existing assets to start producing products or services related to those you already produce generally wouldn't be considered a major change. Acquiring new assets to start producing an unrelated and new product or service would generally be considered a major change.

*   Mates rates
    -----------
    
    This is when you rent out your property to family or friends under your property's market value rent. The mates rate is anything under 80% of the market value.
    
    So, if rent for your property is usually $100 per night, and your friends rent it for $50, that's a mates rate. It's a mates rate because you're charging them 50% of your property's market value rent. 
    
*   Mining pool
    -----------
    
    In a mining pool miners combine (pool) their processing power to earn rewards. They split the rewards proportionally to their individual contributions.

*   New provisional taxpayer
    ------------------------
    
    Generally you will not have to pay provisional tax if your residual income tax (RIT) for the previous year was $5,000 or less. However, there are certain situations when you'll have to pay provisional tax for the current year, even if you have not paid it before. This is called a new provisional tax liability.
    
    You're a new provisional taxpayer if:
    
    You're an individual (not including a trustee of a trust) and your residual income tax was less than $5,000 for the last 4 years; and your residual income tax for the current year is $60,000 or more; and during the current year you've stopped earning income from employment and have started to earn untaxed income from a taxable activity instead.

    Resident withholding tax (RWT) is a tax that is deducted from investment income before the investor receives it.
    
    It helps people who receive investment income to pay their tax throughout the year, and makes sure that people who do not declare their investment income still have tax deducted from it. (Inland Revenue still follows up on undeclared investment income and takes action against people who do not declare it.)

    *   provide financial assistance to a trust (or for the benefit of the trust) with an obligation to pay you back on demand
    *   you do not ask the trust to pay you back or you defer making the request for repayment.
    
    We can identify attempts to artificially increase the number of settlors by having friends or family become settlors of the trust. The initial settlor will be treated as the sole settlor of the trust and shortfall penalties may apply.
    
*   Shadow payroll
    --------------
    
    Your regular payroll pays your employee’s salary and manages their tax obligations to your country.

*   Shared rental expenses
    ----------------------

*   Shareholder continuity
    ----------------------
    
    Shareholder continuity refers to changes that have occurred to the number of shareholders and the nature of their shareholdings during the year. Continuity affects both tax losses brought forward from previous tax years and imputation credits.
    
    For a company to be able to carry its losses forward, at least 49% of shares should be held by the same shareholders through the continuity period (the year the loss was incurred through to the year it's offset). This is the shareholder continuity test.
    
    From the 2020/2021 income year, a company may also be able to carry a loss forward if they meet the requirements for the business continuity test.

*   Short-term international business travellers
    --------------------------------------------
    
    An employee whose work in the host country will typically be within a 12-month period.    
      
    People who visit New Zealand on short-term business trips may be exempt from tax, depending on how long they are here. If the trip is longer than 92 days allowed under 'Amounts derived during short-term visits' (CW19) section in the Income Tax Act or 183 days in some double tax agreements, New Zealand tax needs to be paid.

    Where trading stock is disposed of at below market value then it is deemed to have been sold by the disposer (and subsequently purchased by the recipient) at market value.
    
*   Viable and ongoing
    ------------------
    
    A viable business is a business with a plan in place to make sure it can keep trading. This generally means the owner has good reason to believe it's more likely than not that the business or organisation will be able to pay its debts as they fall due within the next 18 months and its current overdue debts. Your accountant may be able to provide this advice. 
    
    You must keep any evidence of the business or organisation's ongoing viability at the time of requesting the CSP, as we may audit your application in the future. 
    
    This evidence could include, for example: 
    
    *   a cash-flow forecast for the business or organisation for the short term
    *   a plan for where the revenue will come from in future market conditions and a forecast of those revenues
    *   financial statements showing the business or organisation has enough resources to sustain itself when including the CSP
    *   details of approved funding
    *   your accountant's assessment that the business or organisation is viable and ongoing. 
    
*   Visa travel date
    ----------------
    
    This is the date by which you must arrive in New Zealand. You can find this date on your visa from Immigration New Zealand.
    
*   Voluntary agreement
    -------------------
    
    An agreement to pay child support or domestic maintenance where both parties agree on the amount to be paid. It's registered with us and we collect and pay out the child support or domestic maintenance.
    

*   Web logon activity report
    -------------------------
    
    Lets owners monitor staff myIR logon activity. You can access from the Intermediary centre under ‘My business’ and select agency reports.
    
*   Wholly or mainly
    ----------------
    
    For the donee organisations test, "wholly or mainly" means at least 75% of the organisation's funds are used for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes within New Zealand.
    
    For more information, see our Interpretation statement IS 18/05: Income tax – donee organisations – meaning of wholly or mainly applying funds to specified purposes in New Zealand.
    
    [Interpretation statement IS 18/05](~/link.aspx?_id=C1D079D6E581416AB9DC8444EFCB4894&_z=z)
    
*   Wholly owned
    ------------
    
    Wholly owned groups of companies are 100% owned by the same shareholders.
    
*   Withholder
    ----------
    
    A withholder is the person required to deduct and pay an amount of RLWT on behalf of the seller.
    
    The withholder will be the seller's conveyancer (unless the seller is associated to the buyer). Otherwise the withholder will be the buyers' conveyancer (if the seller doesn't have a conveyancer), or the buyer if:
    
    *   neither the seller or buyer have a conveyancer
    *   the seller and buyer are associated persons.
    
*   Working days (GST)
    ------------------
    
    As per the GST Act (1985) a 'working day' is defined as "any day of the week other than—  
    (a) Saturday, Sunday, Good Friday, Easter Monday, Anzac Day, Labour Day, the Sovereign’s birthday, and Waitangi Day; and  
    (ab) if Waitangi Day or Anzac Day falls on a Saturday or a Sunday, the following Monday; and  
    (b) a day in the period commencing with 25 December in any year and ending with 15 January in the following year.
    
*   Worldwide income
    ----------------
    
    New Zealand tax residents generally pay tax on their worldwide income, that is, what they earn from sources in New Zealand and overseas.
    
    This is called residency-based taxation.
    
*   Zero
    ----
    
    When the property sale is a loss, then use for calculation 2 & 3, for example, Brenda purchases property for $500,000 and sells it for $450,000. In this case, since Brenda incurred a loss, under calculation 2 & 3, the amount will be zero.
    
*   Zero-rated
    ----------
    
    When the charge for GST is at 0%. GST is a tax on the supply of goods and services by a registered person on any taxable activity they do. Some supplies are zero-rated.

#### Account holder

The person (individual or entity) listed or identified as holding an account with a financial institution.

There are look-through rules that can apply where a person (other than a financial institution) holds an account for the benefit or account of someone else. The other person is treated as the account holder. Find out more in section 1.8 of the Inland Revenue Guidance on the CRS.

Guidance on the CRS for AEOI - IR1048:

[Guidance on the Common Reporting Standard for Automatic Exchange of Information IR1048 2019 (PDF 1MB) Download guide](/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/forms-and-guides/ir1000---ir1099/ir1048/ir1048-2019.pdf?modified=20240204231833&modified=20240204231833)

#### Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI)

A global standard for the automatic exchange of financial account information in tax matters.

AEOI will be implemented using the OECD's Common Reporting Standard (CRS) which sets out the international rules for collection and reporting of financial account information (identity and financial information) for exchange.

#### Controlling person

The controlling person of a passive non-financial entity (NFE) is a natural person(s) who exercises control over that passive NFE. Where no natural person is identified as exercising control, the controlling person of the passive NFE is the natural person(s) who holds the position of senior managing official.

For a passive NFE trust, this means any settlor, trustee, protector, beneficiary or class of beneficiaries and any other natural person exercising ultimate effective control over the trust. These people must always be treated as controlling persons of a trust, regardless of who exercises actual control over the trust. Find out more in section 1.9 of the Inland Revenue Guidance on the CRS.

Guidance on the CRS for AEOI - Refer to IR1048 under glossary term 'account holder'.

#### Common Reporting Standard (CRS)

The CRS sets out the OECD's international rules for collection and reporting of financial account information.

#### Custodial institution

#### Depository institution

An entity that accepts deposits in the ordinary course of banking or similar business. Find out more in section 3.1.2 of the Inland Revenue Guidance on the CRS.

Guidance on the CRS for AEOI - Refer to IR1048 under glossary term 'account holder'.

#### Financial institution

A custodial institution, depository institution, investment entity, or specified insurance company. Find out more in section 3.1 of the Inland Revenue Guidance on the CRS.

#### Foreign jurisdiction

A jurisdiction other than New Zealand.

#### Global forum

An international monitoring organisation commissioned by the OECD to conduct peer reviews and generally to evaluate and confirm the level of compliance by each jurisdiction.

#### Investment entity

An investment entity would include certain collective investment vehicles, mutual funds, exchange traded funds, private equity funds, hedge funds, venture capital funds, leveraged buy-out funds or any similar investment vehicle established with an investment strategy of investing, reinvesting or trading in financial assets. This would generally capture unit trusts and managed investment schemes. This list is not exhaustive.

Entities such as family trusts may be investment entities, particularly if the trust's financial assets are managed by another financial institution. Fund managers, investment managers, and investment advisers will also often be investment entities. Brokers can also sometimes be investment entities. Find out more in sections 3.1.3 and 3.1.4 of the Inland Revenue Guidance on the CRS.

Guidance on the CRS for AEOI - Refer to IR1048 under glossary term 'account holder'.

[Important AEOI and CRS documents](/international-tax/exchange-of-information/crs/important-documents)

#### New account

A financial account that is maintained by a Reporting New Zealand financial institution and that is opened on or after 1 July 2017. There is sometimes scope for a Reporting NZFI to treat such accounts opened by an existing customer as being pre-existing accounts.

#### New Zealand financial institution (NZFI)

An entity will be an NZFI if either of the following apply.

*   The entity is a financial institution resident in New Zealand for CRS purposes (excluding any branches located outside New Zealand).
*   The entity is a financial institution not resident in New Zealand, that has a branch located in New Zealand (that is, the New Zealand branch will be an NZFI).

Find out more in section 3.2 of the Inland Revenue Guidance on the CRS.

Guidance on the CRS for AEOI - Refer to IR1048 under glossary term 'account holder'.

#### Non-reporting New Zealand financial institution

An NZFI excluded from needing to carry out CRS due diligence and reporting. Find out more in section 3.4 of the Inland Revenue Guidance on the CRS.

Guidance on the CRS for AEOI - Refer to IR1048 under glossary term 'account holder'.

#### Participating jurisdictions

An overseas jurisdiction that has an agreement with New Zealand under which they will provide us with CRS information. New Zealand's participating jurisdictions will be identified in a list we publish. You can see this list on the 'Automatic Exchange of Information and the Common Reporting Standard' page:

[Automatic Exchange of Information and the Common Reporting Standard](/international-tax/exchange-of-information/crs/aeoi-and-crs)

#### Pre-existing account

Financial account that is maintained by a Reporting New Zealand financial institution as at 30 June 2017.

#### Reportable account

A financial account that is held or (in the case of a passive NFE account holder) controlled by any foreign tax resident that is a reportable person.

This reporting would extend to also cover accounts held or (in the case of passive NFEs) controlled by any relevant foreign tax residents if the reporting New Zealand financial institution chooses to adopt the 'wider' approach to CRS reporting.

Reporting NZFIs are also required to report certain accounts referred to in the CRS as 'undocumented accounts'.

Find out more in sections 5-7 of the Inland Revenue Guidance on the CRS.

Guidance on the CRS for AEOI - Refer to IR1048 under glossary term 'account holder'.

#### Reportable jurisdiction

An overseas jurisdiction that New Zealand has an agreement to provide CRS information to. The jurisdiction is identified in a list we publish.

#### Reportable person

An account holder or (in the case of passive NFEs) controlling person of an account that a Reporting NZFI has identified as being a foreign tax resident from a Reportable jurisdiction. However, some exclusions apply.

#### Reporting New Zealand financial institution (NZFI)

A New Zealand financial institution that must carry out CRS due diligence and report to us on all reportable accounts on an annual basis. This also covers reporting undocumented account information in the circumstances set out in the CRS.

Find out more in section 3 of the Inland Revenue Guidance on the CRS.

Guidance on the CRS for AEOI - Refer to IR1048 under glossary term 'account holder'.

#### Specified insurance company

A specified insurance company for CRS purposes is an insurance company (including its holding company) if it either:

*   issues investment products that are classified as cash value insurance contracts or annuity contracts
*   makes payments under the terms and conditions of these contracts.

These types of insurance and annuity contracts usually include an investment component. Find out more in section 3.1.4 of the Inland Revenue Guidance on the CRS.

Guidance on the CRS for AEOI - Refer to IR1048 under glossary term 'account holder'.

#### Wider approach to reporting

Reporting NZFIs are able to choose to adopt what is known as the "wider approach" to reporting. This would involve the Reporting NZFI choosing to report all of the accounts that they have identified as being held (and/or, in certain circumstances controlled) by relevant foreign tax residents, irrespective of whether those persons are from jurisdictions (Reportable Jurisdictions) that New Zealand has entered into an AEOI exchange relationship to provide CRS information to. Find out more in sections 1.5 and 1.6 of the Inland Revenue Guidance on the CRS.

Transferring land in excess of 4,500m2 - (Nov 98) (WITHDRAWN)
=============================================================

Withdrawn statement GNL-150 Transferring land in excess of 4,500m2. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction
------------

This standard practice statement sets out the practices of the Christchurch Duties Unit when land being transferred is in excess of 4,500 m2 and has a house on it, or a house will be built on the land.

Effective date
--------------

This standard practice statement takes effect immediately.

Legislation
-----------

Section 24(2)(b) of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 gives the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the authority to exempt from duty land that is in excess of 4,500m2, in certain circumstances.

The exemption from duty is for so much of the area of land as is reasonably appropriate for residential purposes, having regard to the size and character of the dwelling house. Dwelling house is defined in Section 2 as

> ... a building, or part of a building, that is a house, flat, townhouse, home unit, or similar dwelling erected primarily and principally as a residence, and includes any land improvements, or appurtenances, belonging to the dwelling house or usually enjoyed with it ...

The legislation will be applied using the following procedure.

Procedures
----------

To claim an exemption you should:

1.  Make application on an IR 673 form "Residential home purchase exemption". This form is a prescribed form.
2.  Provide a valuation of the "dwelling house", signed by a registered valuer, the licensee of a real estate firm, or two arm's length parties when they contractually agree. This is to establish the value of the exempt area.
3.  Provide a reasoned argument if a total exemption is being sought. Evidence is required to support this argument.
4.  Your request will be considered and if accepted the documents will be noted accordingly.
5.  If the request is not accepted the disputes resolution process will be initiated.

Example 1
---------

'A' purchased a bare block of land in Kamo. The area of land was 2 hectares. The land is relatively flat in character and has been purchased as a "lifestyle" block. ' A ' intends to erect a kitset dwelling within the next six months. " A " may run a few sheep to keep the grass down.

An application has been received to exempt the total area.

The Commissioner would not exempt the total area in this case. There is no evidence to suggest that the extended area should form part of the "dwelling house" A "lifestyle" block does not meet. the definition of "dwelling house". However, a 2ha property with extensive gardens, swimming pool, or steep hill boundaries, could meet the requirements. Plans, maps and photographs can also be used.

Example 2
---------

' B ' purchased a steep property in the Marlborough Sounds. The lower boundary is a vertical drop into Queen Charlotte Sound. There is also a covenant noted on the title restricting the clearing of native bush. The area of land is 1 hectare. An abstract has been received with a transfer and agreement, but without an IR 673.

The documents will be returned asking for an IR 673. The IR 673 is a prescribed form, which is required to be completed before consideration can be given to an application.

Example 3
---------

Same as Example 2, but an IR 673 was received.

Using the above example the application would be approved. The character of the land, the convenant and the steep drop would render most of the land unsuitable for any other land use.

Withdrawn statement SPS GNL-170 Release of information. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction
------------

This standard practice statement provides guidelines for responding to requests for information made under the Official Information Act 1982 (Official Information Act) and the Privacy Act 1993 (Privacy Act). This statement also explains the relationship of these Acts with the Tax Administration Act 1994 (Tax Administration Act) and how the secrecy provisions in the Tax Administration Act and Child Support Act 1991 (Child Support Act) will be applied.

Application
-----------

This Standard Practice Statement applies from 11 September 2001

Summary
-------

Requests for information can be made orally or in writing.

Inland Revenue is required to make a decision on a request as soon as reasonably practicable and in any case no later than 20 working days after the receipt of the request. Where Inland Revenue is unable to do so, it will write to the requester extending the timeframe. Charging for the provision of information is permissible under the Official Information Act where considerable departmental resources will be required to satisfy the request.

All information held by Inland Revenue is "official information". Requests by natural persons for information about themselves are governed by the Privacy Act. Under that Act, individuals have a right of access to information about themselves, subject only to the reasons for refusing access stipulated in the Act.

All other requests for information are required to be determined under the Official Information Act.

Part II of the Official Information Act covers requests for information, including personal information by natural persons about natural persons other than themselves.

Part III of the Official Information Act covers requests for internal rules (section 22) or reasons for decisions (section 23).

Part IV of the Official Information Act relates to requests by bodies corporate for information about themselves (section 24).

Under the Official Information Act, there are different reasons for refusing information requests depending on whether Part II, Part III or Part IV applies.

Neither the Privacy Act nor the Official Information Act restricts the effect of the secrecy obligations imposed on Inland Revenue staff by the Tax Administration Act. When a request is to be considered under the Tax Administration Act, Inland Revenue will consider the intent of the Official Information Act and/or the Privacy Act.

For example, there are times when personal information about a requester would not be given to the requester:

*   once Inland Revenue has advised that a tax investigation is to commence and disclosure would prejudice the effective conduct of the investigation;
*   when the information requested would disclose the identity of a person who has supplied information to Inland Revenue thereby breaching an obligation of confidentiality;
*   when the information requested would disclose particular targeting or investigation techniques and selection criteria which, if disclosed, would prejudice Inland Revenue's ability to investigate in the future.

In these cases a request may be refused as the release of this information would be likely to prejudice the maintenance of the law.

Legislation
-----------

#### Official Information Act 1982

The purpose of the Official Information Act is to increase the availability of official information.

Section 5 provides that information shall be made available unless there is good reason for withholding it.

The reasons for refusal to supply official information are contained in sections 6, 7, 9, and 18 of the Official Information Act. For Inland Revenue, the following reasons to withhold information are particularly relevant.

_Section 6_  
Disclosure of the information requested would:

*   prejudice the security or defence of New Zealand or the international relations of the Government of New Zealand;
*   prejudice the entrusting of information to the Government of New Zealand on a basis of confidence by an international organisation or another government or any agency of such Government;
*   prejudice the maintenance of the law including the prevention, investigation and detection of offences;
*   endanger the safety of any person;
*   damage seriously the economy of New Zealand by disclosing prematurely decisions to change or continue Government economic or financial policies relating to, inter alia, taxation.

_Section 9_  
Withholding of the information requested is necessary to:

*   protect the privacy of natural persons;
*   avoid unreasonable prejudice to the commercial position of the person who supplied or is the subject of the information;
*   protect information which is subject to an obligation of confidence, where disclosure would be likely to prejudice the supply of similar information, which supply is in the public interest;
*   avoid prejudice to the substantial economic interests of New Zealand;
*   maintain the constitutional conventions which protect, for example, collective and individual ministerial responsibility, the political neutrality of officials and the confidentiality of advice tendered by Ministers and officials;
*   maintain the effective conduct of public affairs through the free and frank expression of opinions by or between or to Ministers, or employees of any department in the course of their duty;
*   maintain legal professional privilege;
*   enable a Minister or any department to carry on, without prejudice or disadvantage, negotiation.

The reasons for refusal contained in section 9 are subject to the public interest. They will not provide good reason to withhold information, where the withholding of that information is outweighed by other considerations which render it desirable, in the public interest, to make that information available.

_Section 18_  
The information requested may be withheld if:

*   the making available of the information requested would be contrary to the provisions of a specified enactment;
*   the information requested is or will soon be publicly available;
*   the information requested cannot be made available without substantial collection or research;
*   the information requested is not held by the department;
*   the request is frivolous or vexatious or that the information requested is trivial;

_Section 27_  
(Reasons for refusal of requests for personal information by bodies corporate)

*   disclosure would prejudice the interests protected by section 6(a) to (d), section 7 or section 9(2)(b);
*   disclosure would involve the unwarranted disclosure of the affairs of another person or of a deceased person;
*   disclosure would breach legal professional privilege;
*   the request is frivolous or vexatious or the information requested is trivial.

Section 52 of the Official Information Act states that the Official Information Act does not override a provision in another Act that imposes a prohibition or restriction in relation to the availability of information.

#### Privacy Act 1993

The purpose of the Privacy Act 1993 is to promote and protect individual privacy.

The Information Privacy Principles contained in section 6 set out the rules for the collection, use, access to and disclosure of information relating to individuals by public and private sector agencies.

Inland Revenue is subject to those Information Privacy Principles. Principle 6 provides that where an agency holds personal information in a form that is readily retrievable, individuals are entitled to have access to information relating to them.

An agency may refuse to disclose information requested in certain circumstances. Reasons for refusal to supply information are contained in sections 27, 28 and 29. The following reasons to withhold information are particularly relevant to Inland Revenue.

_Section 27_

*   disclosure would prejudice the maintenance of the law, including the prevention, investigation, and detection of offences, and the right to a fair trial;
*   disclosure would endanger the safety of any individual;

_Section 29_

*   disclosure would involve the unwarranted disclosure of the affairs of another individual or a deceased individual;
*   disclosure would breach legal professional privilege;
*   the request is frivolous or vexatious, or the information requested is trivial;
*   the information requested is not readily retrievable;
*   the information requested is not held by the department and the person responding to the request has no grounds for believing that the information is either held by another agency or connected more closely with the functions or activities of another agency.

Section 7 of the Privacy Act states that Information Privacy Principles 6 and 11 do not override a provision in another Act that imposes a prohibition of restriction in relation to the availability of information.

#### Tax Administration Act 1994

Section 81(1) requires all officers of Inland Revenue to maintain secrecy in respect of all matters relating to the Inland Revenue Acts. It also provides that officers of Inland Revenue shall not communicate any such matters to any person during or after their employment except _"for the purpose of carrying into effect"_ the Inland Revenue Acts or the other Acts listed in this subsection. This exception is referred to as the general exception.

Section 81(4) lists a number of specific instances where the Commissioner may disclose information.

Under section 81(4)_(l)_ the Commissioner may provide information to a person from whom or in relation to whom such information is held or was obtained. The information must be readily available and the Commissioner must consider it reasonable and practicable to release the information.

#### Child Support Act 1991

Section 240 of the Child Support Act deals with secrecy of child support and other revenue matters. The Child Support Act is an Inland Revenue Act and as such section 240 needs to be read in conjunction with the secrecy provisions in the Tax Administration Act.

Section 240(2) contains communications, which are deemed to be communications of matters made for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the Child Support Act. Under certain circumstances communication of information is allowed to the police, the qualifying custodian, the recipient of spousal maintenance, the chief executive of the department for the time being responsible for the administration of the Social Security Act 1964 and the chief executive of the Department for Courts.

Discussion
----------

Information held by Inland Revenue may be requested orally or in writing by any of the following:

*   a New Zealand citizen;
*   a permanent resident in New Zealand;
*   a person who is in New Zealand;
*   a body corporate incorporated in New Zealand;
*   a body corporate incorporated outside New Zealand which has a place of business in New Zealand.

The nature of the information being requested and the identity of the requester will determine the Act under which the request is to be considered. The request need not refer to the Act.

If the request is made by or on behalf of a natural person for information about that person it will be considered under the Privacy Act. All other requests, including requests for information relating to another person or requests from bodies corporate for information about themselves, will be considered under the Official Information Act.

The provisions in the Official Information Act and Privacy Act do not derogate from the secrecy provisions contained in the Tax Administration Act. If the Tax Administration Act precludes the disclosure, the reason for the refusal must be one of the reasons stipulated in sections 6, 7, 9, 18 or 27 of the Official Information Act or sections 27, 28 or 29 of the Privacy Act.

The Tax Administration Act contains exceptions to the obligation of secrecy. In particular sections 81(1) and 81(4).

_Section 81(1)_  
This exception provides for disclosure where this is considered necessary to carry into effect the Acts referred to in this section This exception will apply whether it is officers of the department or third parties carrying into effect the Acts. The Court of Appeal in _Knight v CIR_ \[1991\] 2 NZLR 30 has held that the carrying into effect of the Inland Revenue Acts must include their proper implementation or administration. It is not confined to the collection of revenue and therefore careful consideration, on a case by case basis, must be given to all duties and responsibilities of officers under the Inland Revenue Acts.

Section 81 requires a restrictive approach by the Commissioner to releasing taxpayer information to other persons. In practice this will mean the stringent application of the secrecy provision when a request is made for information about another taxpayer's affairs. Section 6 of the Tax Administration Act reinforces the right of taxpayers to have their individual affairs kept confidential.

_Section 81(4)_  
This subsection lists a number of instances where the Commissioner may release information. Most importantly, under paragraph _(l)_ the Commissioner is permitted to provide information in the Commissioner's possession to a person from or on behalf of or in relation to whom that information is held or was obtained, provided that the person making the request is either the person concerned, their legal representative, or their agent authorised in writing (or authorised in such other manner as the Commissioner prescribes).

Section 81(4)_(l)_ also stipulates that the information must be readily available and that the Commissioner must consider it reasonable and practicable to release the information.

If, in order to comply with the request, a substantial amount of work would be involved in locating, extracting and collating the requested information, it may be that the information is not readily available and can be refused in terms of s18(c)(i)of the Official Information Act or s27(1)(c) of the Privacy Act.

Pursuant to s81(4)_(l)_, information about a person will be released upon request to that person unless there are good reasons to withhold that information under either the Official Information Act (for bodies corporate) or the Privacy Act (for individuals). The facts and the surrounding circumstances of each case must be carefully considered.

There are times when personal information would not be given to a taxpayer or an agent. These include the following examples:

*   once Inland Revenue has advised that a tax investigation is to commence and disclosure would prejudice the effective conduct of the investigation;
*   when the information requested would disclose the identity of a person who has supplied information to Inland Revenue on the basis of confidentiality;
*   when the information requested would disclose particular targeting or investigation techniques and selection criteria which, if disclosed, would prejudice Inland Revenue's ability to investigate in the future.

In these cases a request may be refused in terms of section 27(1)(c) of the Privacy Act (for individuals) or section 27(1)(a) of the Official Information Act (for bodies corporate).

#### Providing reasons for decisions and access to internal rules affecting decisions

Sections 22 and 23 of the Official Information Act provide a right of access to internal rules affecting decisions and to reasons for decisions affecting a person in their personal capacity. Together these sections identify that where persons are affected in their personal capacity by a decision or recommendation of Inland Revenue, they are entitled to know about the applicable rules and policies. They are also entitled to receive adequate information about why the decision or recommendation came to be made.

Compliance with these sections will promote the accountability of Inland Revenue by enabling decision-making processes to be more transparent and understandable to the people they affect.

Where section 81 of the Tax Administration Act applies and secrecy is required, access to information can be refused under section 6(c) of the Official Information Act because disclosure would prejudice the maintenance of the law, namely the proper operation of section 81 of the Tax Administration Act.

Standard Practice
-----------------

#### Receiving a request

Requests can be received orally or in writing. However, it may be appropriate for Inland Revenue to ask the requester to submit their request in writing to reduce any opportunity for misunderstandings.

Requests for official information are required to be "specified with due particularity". This means that Inland Revenue must be able to identify the information being sought. If a request is so general in nature that it is impossible to identify the nature of the information sought, it is reasonable for Inland Revenue to ask the requester to be more specific.

The fact that a request is for a large amount of information does not in itself mean that the request lacks due particularity.

In respect of requests for all personal information held about the requester, it is reasonable for Inland Revenue to seek clarification as to whether the requester wishes to be supplied with copies of material that has already passed between the requester and Inland Revenue.

Inland Revenue is required to provide reasonable assistance to persons requesting information. Where the requested information is not held by Inland Revenue but believed to be held by another Government agency or Minister, Inland Revenue is required to transfer the request within 10 working days.

#### Responding to the request

In all cases information will be released upon request unless there are good reasons to withhold that information under either the Official Information Act or the Privacy Act.

##### Timeframe

Both the Official Information Act and the Privacy Act place an obligation on Inland Revenue to make a decision as to whether the information requested will be released as soon as practicable, and in any case within 20 working days after the day on which the request is received. Therefore, any request for the release of information will be dealt with as a matter of urgency.

##### Extension of time

Inland Revenue will write to the requester extending the timeframe if the request involves a large quantity of information and meeting the original time limit would unreasonably interfere with the operations of Inland Revenue or where consultation is necessary in order to make a decision on the request. If the requester is dissatisfied with the extension of time, they can seek a review by the Ombudsman or Privacy Commissioner.

A response to a request made under the Official Information Act or Privacy Act will include:

*   a repeat of the original request;
*   a reference to the Act the request has been considered under;
*   Inland Revenue's decision on the request;
*   the reason for refusal where Inland Revenue has refused the request in whole or in part;
*   the requester's right to seek an investigation and review by the Ombudsmen, or Privacy Commissioner of the decision, or have the decision reviewed by a review officer who reports directly to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in case of a refusal.

##### Charging

The Official Information Act permits charging for the supply of official information. Inland Revenue will consider charging when considerable departmental resources will be required to satisfy the request.

If Inland Revenue intends to charge for providing the information, an interim letter will be issued detailing the proposed charge and whether whole or part payment is required before the information will be released.

In line with State Services Commission guidelines and practice by other government departments, Inland Revenue's policy is not to impose charges on Members of Parliament and parliamentary research units.

Inland Revenue will not charge a natural person for the supply of personal information about that person.

##### Deletion of information from documents

Where the information requested is contained in a document and there is good reason for withholding some of the information contained in that document, the other information in that document will be made available by making a copy of the document with the necessary deletions clearly identified in the document.

Retrospective Adjustments To Salaries Paid To Shareholder-Employees (WITHDRAWN)
===============================================================================

Withdrawn statement SPS GNL-410 Retrospective Adjustments To Salaries Paid To Shareholder-Employees. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction
------------

1.  This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) sets out the criteria for considering whether the circumstances are appropriate for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to permit retrospective adjustments to salaries paid to shareholder-employees where an error has been made in the preparation of a company's accounts.

Application
-----------

2.  This SPS replaces the QWBA item entitled _Retrospective adjustment to salaries paid to shareholder-employees_ published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 9, No 4 (April 1997) at page 9.  It addresses the question of when a correction to a shareholder-employee's salary may be made and should not be taken as being applicable to situations where other mistakes have been made in a company's accounts and the company is seeking to rectify them.  
      
    
3.  This SPS will apply from 1 July 2003.

Background
----------

4.  In _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 9, No 4 (April 1997) at page 9 we published a QWBA item entitled _Retrospective adjustment to salaries paid to shareholder-employees_.  Its effect is that where an error has been made in the preparation of the accounts of a company, Inland Revenue will amend the company's assessment to take account of the additional expenses that should have been included in the original return.  However, it will not agree to consequential adjustments that the company and the shareholder-employee may wish to make in relation to any salary that was originally agreed to be paid.  So neither the company's nor the individual's assessments would be amended to reflect the fact that a reduced salary would be paid.  
      
    
5.  Subsequently _Case U27_  (1999) 19 NZTC 9,261 considered this same issue and the Taxation Review Authority, his Honour Willy DJ, arrived at a different conclusion, holding that decisions as to the amounts of a shareholder-employee's salary for two income years that were made mistakenly could be reversed or amended.  The facts in that case were that the accountant was not fully informed of the company's financial affairs (there was, unknown to him, a tax dispute with Inland Revenue) and this led him to prepare end of year accounts that did not accurately reflect the company's true position.  
      
    
6.  The company had over several years fallen behind in accounting for PAYE, GST, ACC premiums and FBT to the Commissioner.  The omitted taxes and penalties not accounted for in error resulted in a substantial overstatement of the resulting profit.  This was important because these salaries in this company were only ever paid out of profits.  So the level of salaries was based on incorrect profit figures.  Although the resolutions authorizing the salaries were prepared these were never signed.  When he discovered his mistake new resolutions were prepared to authorize the distribution of reduced salaries.   
      
    
7.  The Taxation Review Authority held that section 75 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (now section EB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994), which deems a person to have derived income when it has been dealt with in the person's interest or on his or her behalf in any of various ways, including being “credited in account”, took effect accordingly, i.e. it operated on the circumstances brought about by the company resolutions correcting the error.  His Honour decided that the company was entitled to and did rectify the error when it came to its notice and the shareholder-employee was obliged to pay tax only on the reduced amounts of income for the relevant income years.  
      
    
8.  In the light of _Case U27_ it has been decided that the 1997 QWBA should now be withdrawn and replaced by this item.  
    

Legislation
-----------

**Income Tax Act 1994**

> **EB 1     Income credited in account or otherwise dealt with—**
> 
> 1.  For the purposes of this Act an amount shall be deemed to have been derived by a person although it has not been actually paid to or received by the person, or already become due or receivable, but has been credited in account, or reinvested, or accumulated, or capitalised, or carried to any reserve, sinking, or insurance fund, or otherwise dealt with in the person's interest or on the person's behalf.   
>     
> 2.  ....  
>     
> 3.  Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1), where a deduction is allowed to a company for an income year in respect of expenditure incurred by way of monetary remuneration paid or payable to a person who in relation to the company is a shareholder-employee, the shareholder-employee shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to have derived the monetary remuneration—  
>       
>     1.  As to an amount equal to—  
>           
>         1.  The amount of the deduction allowable to the company under this Act in respect of that income year and that expenditure; less   
>             
>         2.  Such amount (if any) of that expenditure as is treated as the unexpired portion of accrual expenditure by virtue of section EF 1(5)(c),—   
>               
>              in the same income year as that in which the deduction was allowed to the company; and   
>             
>     2.  As to the balance of the monetary remuneration, in such income year, or income years, as the expenditure of the company in respect of the monetary remuneration ceases to be treated by virtue of section EF 1(5)(c) as the unexpired portion of accrual expenditure of the company.  
>         
> 4.  For the purposes of subsection (3),—  
>       
>     1.  Where a company referred to in that subsection is a person with a non-standard accounting year, the “same income year” means the income year to which the accounting year in which the deduction was allowed corresponds:  
>         
>     2.  Where the shareholder-employee referred to in that subsection is a person with a non-standard accounting year, the "same income year" means the accounting year of the shareholder-employee that corresponds to the income year—  
>           
>         1.  In which the deduction was allowed to the company; or   
>             
>         2.  To which the accounting year of the company in which the deduction was allowed corresponds (where the company is of the kind referred to in paragraph (a).  
>             

Standard Practice
-----------------

9.  Provided full disclosure is made, and the relevant financial statements are amended and lodged, then generally Inland Revenue, where  
      
    
    *   a genuine error has been made in the accounts as a result of which a deduction has not been claimed for legitimate expenditure incurred, or a receipt has been incorrectly categorized,  
        
    *   the company has passed a resolution reflecting the change in light of the relationship between the company and the shareholder-employee, and  
        a request for correction has been filed with a copy of the resolution,  
        
    *   a request for correction has been filed with a copy of the resolution
    *     
        
    
    will consider the request in accordance with Standard Practice Statement INV-510 entitled _Requests to amend assessments_ published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 14, No 8 (August 2002) and the principles set out therein.  
      
    
10.  It is expected that requests of this nature will be made in a timely fashion.  What is timely involves an exercise of judgment.  There are two aspects of timeliness here:  
      
    *   Once a mistake has been discovered then the parties should set about attending to it promptly.  In the majority of cases a month should be a sufficient period of time to discuss, prepare amending resolutions, hold a formal meeting and then to file fresh accounts with the Department.  
        
    *   As to how long a mistake may go undetected, the answer is less certain.  Timeliness requires that a mistake is discovered when in the course of events and in the circumstances of the taxpayer company one would have expected it to have been discovered.  It could be that many months may go by before the error is detected.  The Commissioner will not adopt “the normal course of events” criterion for some cases will be unusual.  For example, Case U27 was unusual in that there was a lack of communication between the accountant and principal shareholder and director.  The latter kept certain information about the arrears of taxes to himself.   
          
        
11.  Where Inland Revenue agrees to approve such a retrospective adjustment, section EB 1 will deem the shareholder-employee's salary to be the amount as determined by the amending resolution and under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Inland Revenue will adjust the company's and employee's assessments accordingly. 

**_Examples_**

12.  The following situations may give some guidance as to when Inland Revenue will permit adjustments to be made.  
      
    1.  _Incorrect treatment of receipt_  
        Where there is an error in the categorization of a loan receipt as revenue and this results in an overstatement of income, an adjustment may be made.   
        
    2.  _Omission of expenditure_  
        Where an error arises from the omission of expenditure incurred in the current year an adjustment may be made.  However, for a loss to trigger an adjustment it should be a real loss.  
          
    3.  _Company still in profit even though error made_  
        Although an error has been made in the accounts that error is not sufficient to produce an overall loss and the company still has sufficient profit after the accounts have been corrected to cover the salary originally agreed to be paid.  In this situation Inland Revenue will consider each application for an adjustment on its merits.  The Commissioner will need to consider the nature of the contract between the parties and past practice.  While in this circumstance there would not be the same pressing need to amend or rescind the salary declaration, nevertheless the company could find the situation inconvenient and desire that the amount credited to the shareholder-employee at least be reduced to some extent.  
        
    4.  _Accrual expenditure_  
        A company has committed itself to certain expenditure in one year although it has not had to discharge or bear that expense until a following year.  If such an item has been overlooked and the accounts need revision then it would be less likely for the amounts credited to the shareholder-employee as salary to be revised as well.  There may still be funds available to pay them.  Once again this is a matter where circumstances will vary.  Where there is accrual expenditure the answer will depend on the amount of the unexpired portion of that expenditure relating to future income years.  The Commissioner will consider each application for an adjustment on its merits.

Retention of business records by electronic means (Dec 03) (WITHDRAWN)
======================================================================

Withdrawn GNL-430 Retention of business records by electronic means (Dec 03). Statement \[provided for historical purposes only.\
\
Withdrawn\
---------\
\
This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.\
\
Introduction\
------------\
\
1.  This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) provides guidelines on the retention of business records where those records are stored in electronic form, on microfiche or on microfilm. The SPS also provides guidelines on the information and assistance required when Inland Revenue requests information and requires access to business records and supporting background materials.\
\
Application\
-----------\
\
2.  This SPS applies from 21 November 2003 which is the date the Electronic Transactions Act 2002 (ETA) and the Electronic Transactions Regulations 2003 (No. 288) generally came into force.  \
      \
    \
3.  The SPS replaces the previous Inland Revenue publications issued on record retention in Tax Information Bulletins Volume 1 No. 6 (issued December 1989), Volume 3 No. 1 (issued July 1991) and Volume 3 No. 9 (issued July 1992).\
\
Summary\
-------\
\
4.  Business records may be kept in either paper-based or electronic form. Where records are held in electronic form, it is important they are kept in a manner that allows Inland Revenue to readily ascertain the amount of tax payable.  \
      \
    \
5.  If information is transferred from source-paper and other non-electronic records into electronic form or microfilm for record retention purposes, the electronic or microfilm record, when reproduced in printed form must be identical in format and in all other respects to the original record. The addition of information such as index referencing is acceptable. The additional information must not obscure the image of the original record and must be distinguishable as additions to the original record.  \
      \
    \
6.  If business records are originally in electronic form, persons should be able to demonstrate that their electronic records systems are secure from both unauthorised access and data alterations. Electronic copies must be readily accessible and capable of being retrieved and produced as a legible hard copy or supplied to Inland Revenue in electronic form upon request.\
\
Background\
----------\
\
7.  The Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) requires persons who carry on business or other income earning activities to keep in New Zealand sufficient records in English to enable the Commissioner to readily ascertain the amounts of tax payable by that person.  \
      \
    \
8.  Previously, the majority of business records were kept in paper form and the Commissioner allowed such records to be transferred to microfiche or microfilm in limited circumstances.  \
      \
    \
9.  Technological advances have seen records now being transferred to electronic form or in some cases originating in electronic form. The ETA provides a framework to support those persons who want to conduct their businesses electronically. These persons will also have the option to use technology to store information from source-paper documents or other non-electronic records. The ETA also removes the requirement to retain the source-paper or non-electronic records where persons who use technology to store business records can ensure the integrity of the information transferred from source-paper or other non-electronic records.  \
      \
    \
10.  It is an offence against the TAA if a person does not keep books or records required to be kept by a tax law or does not provide information when requested by an authorised Inland Revenue officer.\
\
Legislation\

\
### Electronic Transactions Act 2002\
\
25.  **LEGAL REQUIREMENT TO RETAIN DOCUMENT OR INFORMATION THAT IS IN PAPER OR OTHER NON-ELECTRONIC FORM -  \
    **\
    1.  A legal requirement to retain information that is in paper or other non-electronic form is met by retaining an electronic form of the information if:  \
        1.  the electronic form provides a reliable means of assuring the maintenance of the integrity of the information; and\
        2.  the information is readily accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference.\
    2.  Subsection (1) applies to information that is a public record within the meaning of the Archives Act 1957 only if the Chief Archivist has approved the retention of that information in electronic form.\
    3.  To avoid doubt, if information is retained in electronic form in accordance with subsection (1), the paper or other non-electronic form of that information need not be retained.  \
        \
26.  **LEGAL REQUIREMENT TO RETAIN INFORMATION THAT IS IN ELECTRONIC FORM -**  \
      \
    Subject to section 27, a legal requirement to retain information that is in electronic form is met by retaining the information:-  \
    1.  in paper or other non-electronic form if the form provides a reliable means of assuring the maintenance of the integrity of the information; or\
    2.  in electronic form if -\
        1.  the electronic form provides a reliable means of assuring the maintenance of the integrity of the information; and\
        2.  the information is readily accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference.\
27.  **EXTRA CONDITIONS FOR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS -**  \
      \
    In addition to the conditions specified in section 26, if a person is required to retain information that is contained in an electronic communication,  \
    1.  the person must also retain such information obtained by that person as enables the identification of\
        1.  the origin of the electronic communication; and\
        2.  the destination of the electronic communication; and\
        3.  the time when the electronic communication was sent and the time when it was received; and  \
            \
    2.  the information referred to in paragraph (a) must be readily accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference.\

        \
    3.  Where that business involves dealing in goods:  \
        1.  A record of all goods purchased, and of all goods sold in the carrying on of that business (except those sold in the course of cash retail trading customarily conducted in a business of the kind of which that business is one) showing the goods, and the sellers and buyers or, as the case may be, the agents of the sellers and buyers in sufficient detail to enable the goods, and the sellers and buyers, and those agents, to be readily identified by the Commissioner; and all invoices relating to the goods; and...  \
            \
    4.  Where that business involves the provision of services, records of the services provided and all invoices relating to them; and  \
        \
    5.  The charts and codes of accounts, the accounting instruction manuals, and the system and programme documentation which describes the accounting system used in each income year in the carrying on of that business.  \
        \
    \
    6.  ... shall keep in New Zealand sufficient records in the English language to enable the ascertainment readily by the Commissioner, or any officer authorised by the Commissioner in that behalf, ...  \
        \
    7.  ... shall retain in New Zealand all such records for a period of at least 7 years after the end of the income year to which they relate...\
\
5.  The Commissioner may, by notice in writing given before the expiry of the 7-year retention period specified in subsection (2), require a taxpayer to retain all or any of the records specified in that subsection for a further period not exceeding 3 years following the expiry of the 7-year period...\

\
> SCHEDULE 1, CLAUSE 4\
> \
> Conditions for legal requirements to retain records under Inland Revenue Acts\
> \
> 1.  A legal requirement under the Inland Revenue Acts to retain a record that is initially in paper or other non-electronic form may be met by retaining an electronic form of the record, only if -  \
>     1.  the record is readily able to be produced in paper form; and  \
>         \
>     2.  that paper form is a duplicate image of the original paper or other non-electronic form.  \
>         \
> 2.  For the purposes of subclause (1) , it does not matter that annotations, indexing references, or other additional information are included in the record retained in electronic form, provided that they:  \
>     1.  do not obscure any of the original information contained in the record; and  \
>         \
>     2.  are distinguishable as additions to the original record.  \
>         \
> 3.  A legal requirement under the Inland Revenue Acts to retain a record that is generated in electronic form and is provided to another person in paper or other non-electronic form (for example, an invoice generated electronically and printed for sending to a customer) may be met by retaining the record in its electronic form only.  \
>     \
> 4.  Despite subclause (1) , if a record is received from a person in both paper or other non-electronic form and in electronic form (for example, a bank statement sent by a bank in paper form, and also provided in electronic form), a legal requirement to retain the record may be met by retaining the record in its electronic form only.  \
>     \
> 5.  In this clause, Inland Revenue Acts has the same meaning as in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.\
\
Standard Practice\
-----------------\
\
11.  Regardless of how business records are retained there must be sufficient detail to ensure a complete audit trail that allows tracing the retained records to and from accounting records and to tax returns.  \
      \
    \
12.  Section 25 of the ETA provides the option of using technology to store source paper documents by electronic means. Section 26 of the ETA sets the standard for retaining information in electronic form. The Commissioner considers that the information will be readily ascertainable and meet the requirements of the ETA if the following practice is followed:\
\
### Retention of records on microfilm/microfiche\
\
13.  Paper records microfilmed must be copied completely and accurately.  \
      \
    \
14.  The microfilmed records, when reproduced in printed form, must be identical in format and in all other respects to the original records. The addition of information such as indexing references is acceptable. The additional information must not obscure the view of the original record information and must be distinguishable as additions to the original record.  \
      \
    \
15.  The quality of the microfilmed records must be sufficient to ensure they are readily accessible and capable of being retrieved on legible hard copies (printouts) if required.  \
      \
    \
16.  Paper records microfilmed in accordance with the requirements detailed below may be destroyed after transfer to microfilm.\
\
### Retention of records in electronic form - originally in paper form.\
\
17.  Paper records transferred to electronic form must be copied completely and accurately - for example: the use of imaging to provide information in a format identical in all respects to the source-paper document. The addition of information such as index referencing is acceptable. The additional information must not obscure the view of the original record information and must be distinguishable as additions to the original record.  \
      \
    \
18.  The electronic copy must be readily accessible and capable of being retrieved on legible hard copy (printouts) or supplied in electronic form (on electronic media and unencrypted in a form able to be read by Inland Revenue staff) if required.  \
      \
    \
19.  Source-paper documents or other non-electronic records from which the complete information is transferred and stored in electronic form, in accordance with the requirements of the ETA and the Electronic Transactions Regulations 2003 (No. 288), may be destroyed after transfer to the electronic form.\
\
### Retention of records in electronic form - originally in electronic form.\
\
20.  Internal controls must be adequate to ensure that all business transactions executed electronically, including those executed through the Internet, are completely and accurately captured.  \
      \
    \
21.  Persons should be able to demonstrate that their electronic records systems are secure from both unauthorised access and data alterations. This usually involves developing and documenting a security program that establishes:  \
    \
    *   controls to ensure that only authorised personnel have access to electronic records;  \
        \
    *   provide for backup and recovery of records;  \
        \
    *   ensure that personnel are trained to safeguard sensitive or classified electronic records; and  \
        \
    *   minimise the risk of unauthorised alteration, addition or erasure.\
    \
      \
    \
22.  The charts and codes of accounts, the accounting instruction manuals, and the system and programme documentation which describes the accounting system used must be retained and produced if required, to an Inland Revenue officer.  \
      \
    \
23.  _Encryption_  \
    The electronic copy must be readily accessible and capable of being retrieved and produced as legible hard copy (printouts) or supplied in electronic form (on electronic media and unencrypted in a form able to be read by Inland Revenue officers) if required.  \
      \
    \
24.  The Commissioner may approve the use of symbols and abbreviations to facilitate the electronic transfer of tax invoices, credit notes or debit notes. Requests for approval should be made in writing to Inland Revenue.  \
      \
    \
25.  Those who engage in the electronic transfer of tax invoices, credit notes or debit notes must retain electronic records that in combination with any other records, e.g. the underlying contracts, price lists, price changes, product code descriptions, have an adequate level of detail to meet the requirements of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act). For example, if a hard copy invoice is requested, the printout must contain all information as required under section 24 of the GST Act.  \
      \
    \
26.  _Internet_  \
    Persons who do business via the Internet are required to keep business records of all internet transactions for tax purposes.  \
      \
    \
27.  _E-mails_  \
    Some e-mails may be classified as business records required to be kept for tax purposes. Where e-mails are business records, section 27 of the ETA requires the origin, destination and time of electronic communications to be retained and accessible so as to be usable for subsequent references.\
\
**Additional Requirements**\
\
28.  The following additional requirements are also necessary where business records are retained in electronic form.  \
      \
    \
29.  _Backup_  \
    Backup and recovery procedures must be sufficient to guarantee the availability of electronic records for the required record retention period.  \
      \
    \
30.  _Hardware/Software Changes_  \
    In the event of hardware/software changes:  \
      \
    \
    *   facilities for retrieving electronic records that have been stored on the former system must be retained or;  \
          \
        \
    *   the electronic records must be converted to a compatible system and both sets of files retained complete with documentation showing the method of transfer and controls in place to ensure the transfer was complete and accurate.\
    \
      \
    \
31.  _Storage Offshore_  \
    The Commissioner may approve the storage of records offshore. Approval is subject to the records being readily available in New Zealand on request, in English, and at no cost to Inland Revenue in obtaining the information. Each case will be considered on individual merit, having regard to the person's compliance history and whether storage overseas is likely to impede Inland Revenue compliance activities.  \
      \
    \
32.  _Providing accounting information in electronic format to Inland Revenue_  \
    Inland Revenue's Computer Tax Audit Unit and Electronic Data Coordinators specialise in downloading electronically stored information. The preferred media for receiving electronic information is on CD, DVD or floppy disk. However, other media may be accepted such as 8mm tape cartridge, Zip drives, 4mm DAT tapes. An alternative method is transfer of data between personal computers. Other mutually agreeable transfer methods may be negotiated as required.  \
      \
    \
33.  When possible, electronic information supplied to Inland Revenue should be in a fixed record length format, in EBCDIC or ASCII or delimited. Tapes should be created without software compression. The electronic information should be copied to media, not a proprietary back up. Documentation should be supplied with the media showing the record layout, record length, (block size if supplied on tape) and number of records.  \
      \
    \
34.  _Assistance to Inland Revenue officers_  \
    Adequate viewing and printing facilities should be made available free of charge to Inland Revenue officers. If requested, persons must locate selected records that have been stored and print any items selected, free of charge to Inland Revenue officers.  \
      \
    \
35.  Persons must be available to explain the operation of their computer system to Inland Revenue officers. This is the case whether the system is owned and operated by the person or out-sourced to a third party.  \
      \
    \
36.  There must be sufficient detail to ensure a complete audit trail that allows tracing the retained records to and from accounting records through to tax returns.  \
      \
    \
37.  _Retention period_  \
    The electronic or microfilmed records must be retained for the full retention period required by the TAA and the GST Act, currently 7 years unless extended to 10 years by Inland Revenue for specific case situations.\

Section 17 notices (Aug 04) (WITHDRAWN)
=======================================

Withdrawn statement SPS GNL-440 Section 17 notices (requisitions for information). Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction
------------

1.  This Standard Practice Statement outlines the procedures Inland Revenue will follow when issuing notices, including third party requests, under section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Section 17, which relates to requisitions for information, is one of Inland Revenue's information-gathering powers. Other powers (such as section 16) which relate to the gathering of information can be, and are, used by the Commissioner in conjunction with section 17 but they are not discussed in this Standard Practice Statement.

Application
-----------

2.  This Standard Practice Statement applies from 15 August 2004 and replaces INV-321 _Section 17 Notices_ published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 11, No 9 (October 1999).

Background
----------

3.  Before Inland Revenue can verify or make an assessment of a person's taxation liability, information is needed. The Tax Administration Act 1994 gives the necessary powers to collect information including section 17 which empowers the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to require any person to furnish in writing any information and produce books and documents for inspection where it is considered necessary or relevant for the Commissioner to exercise his statutory functions.  
      
    
4.  Section 17 has been amended by section 85 of the Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 and again by section 105 of the Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003. The relevant changes are:  
      
    
    *   A new subsection (1B) provides that information or a book or document that is in the knowledge, possession or control of a non-resident who is controlled, directly or indirectly, by a New Zealand resident, is to be treated as being in the knowledge, possession or control of the New Zealand resident. Accordingly that New Zealand resident may be required to furnish information held by the non-resident that it controls.  
          
        
    *   Subsection (1C) sets out rules for determining when a person is controlled by a New Zealand resident and provides that foreign secrecy laws are to be ignored.  
          
        
    *   Subsection (1D) provides that Inland Revenue may require that the information requested is to be delivered to a particular office of the Department. Where this is required it will be stipulated, with the street or postal address, in the section 17 notice. Because this amendment may cause extra compliance costs to taxpayers by way of delivery charges, Inland Revenue may instead agree to the information being delivered to the office nearest the taxpayer or nearest to where the information is held. See paragraph 11 of this SPS.
    
      
      
    These changes took effect on 26 March 2003. Further background to and explanation of these changes can be found in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) at pages 53-56.  
      
    
5.  Inland Revenue will usually request information, books or documents without expressly relying on section 17. This practice fosters a spirit of reasonableness and mutual cooperation.  
      
    
6.  However, where information is not provided voluntarily or in a timely manner Inland Revenue will use the statutory authority in section 17 to demand the information. In this case Inland Revenue issues a section 17 notice. If not complied with, a section 17 notice will result in Inland Revenue invoking the statutory remedies. However, Inland Revenue reserves the right i n some cases to commence the information gathering process with a section 17 notice, e.g. in cases where it knows of prior instances of non-cooperation from the taxpayer and/or their advisers.

Legislation
-----------

### Tax Administration Act 1994

**3 Interpretation**

1.  In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,- ..  
      
    **"Book and document"** , and **"book or document"** , include all books, accounts, rolls, records, registers, papers, and other documents and all photographic plates, microfilms, photostatic negatives, prints, tapes, discs, computer reels, perforated rolls, or any other type of record whatever: ...

**17 Information to be furnished on request of Commissioner**

1\. Every person (including any officer employed in or in connection with any Department of the Government or by any public authority, and any other public officer) shall, when required by the Commissioner, furnish in writing any information and produce for inspection any books and documents which the Commissioner considers necessary or relevant for any purpose relating to the administration or enforcement of any of the Inland Revenue Acts or for any purpose relating to the administration or enforcement of any matter arising from or connected with any other function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner.

1B. For the purpose of subsection (1), information or a book or document is treated as being in the knowledge, possession or control of a New Zealand resident if:

1.  the New Zealand resident controls, directly or indirectly, a non-resident; and  
    
2.  the information or book or document is in the knowledge, possession or control of the non-resident.  
    

1C. For the purpose of subsection (1B) and sections 143(2) and 143A(2) -

1.  in determining whether a non-resident is controlled by a New Zealand resident
    1.  anything in the knowledge, possession or control of [\[1\]](#01)
         a person who is resident in New Zealand, or is a controlled foreign company, and is associated with the New Zealand resident is treated as being in the knowledge, possession or control of the New Zealand resident; and
    2.  a person is treated as being associated with the New Zealand resident if the person and the New Zealand resident are associated under section OD 7, interpreted as if "relative" had the meaning set out in paragraph (b) of the definition in section OB 1, or OD 8(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994; and
2.  a law of a foreign country that relates to the secrecy of information must be ignored.

1D. If information in writing is required, or books and documents must be produced, the Commissioner may require that the information be furnished, or the books and documents be produced, to a particular office of the Department.

2\. Without limiting subsection (1), the information in writing which may be required under this section shall include lists of shareholders of companies, with the amount of capital contributed by and dividends paid to each shareholder, copies of balance sheets and of profit and loss accounts and other accounts, and statements of assets and liabilities.

3\. The Commissioner may, if the Commissioner considers it reasonable to do so, remove and retain any books or documents produced for inspection under this section for so long as is necessary for a full and complete inspection of those books and documents.

4\. Any person producing any books or documents which are retained by the Commissioner under subsection (3) shall, at all reasonable times and subject to such reasonable conditions as may be determined by the Commissioner, be entitled to inspect the retained books or documents and to obtain copies of them at the person's own expense.

5\. The Commissioner may require that any written information or particulars furnished under this section shall be verified by statutory declaration or otherwise.

6\. The Commissioner may, without fee or reward, make extracts from or copies of any books or documents produced for inspection in accordance with this section.

Standard Practice
-----------------

### Section 17 Notice

7.  Section 17 gives the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the power to require persons to produce for inspection books and documents which the Commissioner considers necessary or relevant for any purpose relating to the administration or enforcement of the Inland Revenue Acts. Included within the expression "book and document" are all books, accounts, rolls, records, registers, papers, and all photographic plates, microfilms, photostatic negatives, prints, tapes, discs, computer reels and perforated rolls. It is considered that "discs" would include any kind of recordable disc, i.e. compact and floppy discs, and DVDs, etc.  
      
    
8.  Where information is to be demanded under section 17 a notice will be issued (refer to Notice "A" in the attached Appendix). Prior to issuing a section 17 notice Inland Revenue will consider the following points.  
      
    1.  _The reason for requiring the information_  
        Inland Revenue will only request information considered necessary or relevant and that is reasonably required in the circumstances of the case.  
          
        
    2.  _The impact of the demand on the suppliers of information_  
        Inland Revenue will be reasonable in relation to the quantity of information sought and the timeframe for providing that information. Inland Revenue will reconsider parts of the demand where there is genuine difficulty in obtaining and/or providing that information.  
          
        
    3.  _Previous requests for information or attempts to resolve disputes_  
        Generally, a section 17 notice will only be issued following a failure to provide information previously requested, or where specific issues have been identified and an attempt to resolve those issues has failed. There will be occasions where a section 17 notice may be issued without a prior request, e.g. where there have been prior instances of non-cooperation from the taxpayer and/or their advisers, or where the Commissioner otherwise considers that delay, or a less formal approach, may unreasonably increase the risk of non-compliance. (Depending on the circumstances, a refusal or failure to comply with an informal request for information would be non-cooperation and a refusal or failure to comply with a more formal request for information, i.e. one mentioning section 17, would be non-compliance as well.) Where the taxpayer's adviser has in the past been uncooperative (including in respect of matters unrelated to the taxpayer) this may be a factor to be taken into account in considering whether a section 17 notice may be issued without a prior request.  
          
        An example of a case where a notice might be issued without a prior request is where an audit has been in progress for some time without a request under section 17 having been made. It would then be appropriate, because the matter may proceed to adjudication, that a notice be issued to ensure that all relevant information has been gathered.  
          
        
    4.  _Whether the information is available publicly_  
        Inland Revenue will generally not use section 17 where information is available publicly and will meet the usual charges, for example where the information is held by the Land Transfer Office, the Companies Office and Quotable Value New Zealand. Public availability of information does not, however, prevent Inland Revenue from requiring information to be provided under section 17.  
          
        
    5.  _The effect upon the disputes resolution process_  
        The disputes resolution process relies on full and prompt disclosure by both the Commissioner and the disputant. Where previous requests have not been met with full and prompt disclosure Inland Revenue will use section 17 notices to obtain information. The use of section 17 prior to the commencement of the disputes resolution process may mean that the number of matters entering that process will be reduced.  
          
        Under proposed legislation the disputes process may be truncated where a taxpayer has failed to comply with an information request. However there may be instances where, with a statute bar approaching, it is considered necessary that the disputes resolution proceedings (including adjudication) be completed and a final decision whether to issue an assessment or not be made within time. Section 17 may also be used in such cases to ensure that all relevant information is gathered.  
          
        
    6.  _Inland Revenue's intention to ensure compliance with the notice_  
        Generally, Inland Revenue will use section 17 only where it is prepared to invoke the statutory remedies in the event of non-compliance.  
          
        
    7.  _The use of section 16 powers_  
        In some cases Inland Revenue will not request information but will access the books and documents under section 16 which gives the Commissioner the power to enter all places for the purpose of inspecting any books and documents.

9.  Nothing in section 17 precludes Inland Revenue from seeking information from multiple sources and from sources other than the affected taxpayer.  
      
    
10.  Separate section 17 notices may be issued for different information and books or documents. If the Commissioner requires the information to be delivered to Inland Revenue, the notice will state that the information be furnished, or the books and documents be produced, to a particular office of the Department.  
      
    _Requests for significant amounts of documentation_  
      
    
11.  If a significant amount of documentation is requested, the person providing the information will be permitted to send the documents to the nearest Inland Revenue office, which will arrange for them to be forwarded to the office conducting the investigation. Where the delivery costs would be reduced by $20 or more by sending to the nearest Inland Revenue office then it is considered that the amount of documentation is significant. In this circumstance we would generally accept the request to send the information to the nearest office.[\[2\]](#02)
      
      
    
12.  The decision whether or not to issue a section 17 notice will generally be the responsibility of a team leader and approval to issue the notice should be given by an officer at or above that level.  
      
    _Legal professional privilege_  
      
    
13.  A taxpayer is entitled, and should have sufficient time, to seek legal advice in respect of whether particular books or documents are subject to legal professional privilege. Section 20 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 covers the topic of solicitor-client privilege, i.e. privilege of confidential communications between legal practitioners and their clients. Briefly, it provides that information is privileged from disclosure if it is a confidential communication between a legal practitioner and another legal practitioner (acting in their professional capacities) or a legal practitioner in the practitioner's professional capacity and the practitioner's client and it is made or brought into existence for the purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice or assistance. However financial information and investment records kept in connection with solicitors' trust accounts are not privileged. The other kind of privilege, litigation privilege which relates to pending or contemplated litigation, is not covered by section 20.  
      
    _Advice and other work papers prepared by accountants_  
      
    
14.  The Commissioner has also adopted certain administrative rules concerning the use of section 17 to gain access to advice and other work papers of accountants for their clients.  
      
    _Correction of information_  
      
    
15.  Where a taxpayer has complied with an information requisition then, in accordance with section 6 of the Privacy Act 1993 (Information Privacy Principle No. 3), the taxpayer will be allowed to seek access to and correction of that information where Inland Revenue has incorrectly recorded the information.

**Changes to Section 17 Notice**

16.  In following the above process every attempt will be made to maintain contact with the taxpayer so as to provide an opportunity for concerns to be raised. Inland Revenue expects holders of information to contact Inland Revenue where there is genuine difficulty in complying with the demand.  
      
    
17.  Any change to the date for compliance must be agreed before the expiration of the original date. Beyond this, the offence for non-compliance has already occurred and an extension of time will not be given.  
      
    
18.  Where modification of the notice is agreed it will be recorded in writing (refer to specimen Notice "B" in the attached Appendix).

**Requests to persons other than the taxpayer**

19.  Some holders of information, such as banks, are willing to provide information but require Inland Revenue to state its legal authority before they will release the information. Generally, where information is required from persons other than the taxpayer and cooperation is likely, Inland Revenue will initially seek the information by a letter (refer to specimen Letter "C1" and the slightly more formal Notice "C2" in the Appendix). The letter may follow a discussion. Letter "C1" i s provided by way of example and may be varied according to the circumstances, and it may or may not contain a reference to section 17.  
      
    
20.  The letter is not a formal section 17 demand. However, generally where the letter is not complied with, a section 17 notice based on specimen Notice "A" will be issued so the third party recipient is informed of the consequences of their non-compliance before further action is initiated.  
      
    _Controlled non-residents_  
      
    
21.  Under section 17(1), Inland Revenue may require a New Zealand resident to provide information in circumstances where the resident's non-resident employees or agents hold the information for the resident. Section 17(1B) now gives Inland Revenue the further power to require a New Zealand resident to provide information held by a non-resident entity controlled, directly or indirectly, by that New Zealand resident.[\[3\]](#03)
     For example, a husband and wife have 51% of the shares in a foreign company. Inland Revenue can issue a section 17 notice to them requiring that they furnish information held by the foreign company. Subsection (1C) sets out further rules for determining whether a non-resident is controlled, in particular it provides that foreign secrecy laws are to be ignored.  
      
    
22.  If obtaining the information would be a costly or difficult exercise then generally it would not be required where the tax at stake is immaterial, or when Inland Revenue has access to this information through other sources.  
      
    _Medical information_  
      
    
23.  In rare instances Inland Revenue may seek access to an individual's medical records. For example, it may be necessary to inquire into the genuineness of a medical certificate. Such requests need careful consideration.

**Non-compliance with Section 17 Notice**

24.  It is an offence not to comply with a section 17 notice. Sections 143 and 143A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 state that an offence has occurred where a person does not provide, or knowingly does not provide, information to the Commissioner when required to do so by a tax law. Furthermore section 143B provides that it is an offence for a person knowingly not to provide information to the Commissioner or any other person when required to do so under section 17, where that person or any other person does so intending to evade the assessment or payment of tax. However, sections 143 and 143A of the Act state that no person may be convicted of an offence for not providing information, or knowingly not providing information (other than tax returns and tax forms) to the Commissioner if that person proves they did not, as and when required to provide the information, have that information in their knowledge, possession or control. Control here is used in its wider sense and includes material held by others on one's behalf.  
      
    
25.  Where non-compliance occurs, Inland Revenue will not reissue a section 17 notice in a different format. An offence is committed if a section 17 notice is not complied with. However those receiving section 17 notices have the ability to request a new due date for compliance with the notice before expiration of the original due date as mentioned above (paragraph 17).  
      
    
26.  Where non-compliance occurs, a follow-up notice will generally be issued before further action is taken. The follow up notice will state that the section 17 notice has not been complied with, court orders are being sought and/or prosecution action is being considered (refer Notice "D" attached). A follow-up notice or letter will not be issued in all cases, e.g. one situation would be where there have been delays in supplying information previously.  
      
    
27.  Where Inland Revenue has issued a follow-up notice, an application for a court order for compliance with the section 17 notice may be made and/or prosecution action may be taken. There are different time limits for laying informations to begin prosecution action:  
      
    
    *   for the offence of knowingly not providing information when required to do so the time limit is 6 months,
    *   for the absolute liability offence of not providing information when required to do so the time limit is 10 years, and
    *   for the offence of knowingly not providing information when required and the offender does so, for example, intending to evade the assessment or payment of tax, there is no time limit.
    
      
      
    
28.  Once the offence is committed prosecution action should be commenced within a reasonable time of the date of non-compliance unless there are special circumstances, e.g. the offence not being discovered until a later time.  
      
    
29.  In general where a person complies with the requirement to provide information after the stipulated time but prior to the issue of a summons by the Court commencing the prosecution action foreshadowed in Notice "D", the prosecution would not be commenced.

### Cancellation of Registration 1.4.88 to 30.9.88

An amendment to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Section 5(3A) has created conditions that are more favourable for some non-profit bodies and voluntary registered persons who may wish to leave the GST System.

Current law provides that;

1.  Cancellation of registration is available to:
    1.  persons who cease all taxable activities and who have reasonable grounds for believing that they will not conduct any taxable activity within the following 12 months.
    2.  persons who satisfy the Inland Revenue that in the following 12 month period they will not make taxable supplies exceeding $24,000.
2.  Immediately prior to cessation, a registered person retaining assets of the taxable activity, needs to account for GST on those assets, regardless of whether they were acquired or produced before or after 1 October 1986. GST is calculated as one eleventh of the lessor of;
3.  1.  the cost of those assets
    2.  the open market value of those assets

This will show as a Box 5 adjustment in the final return.

So long as the above conditions are met then the amending provisions may be further considered. These apply to:

1.  Those persons who registered on a voluntary basis and who at no time during their period of registration made taxable supplies exceeding $24,000 in any 12 month period.
2.  Non-Profit Bodies

who apply in writing to the Inland Revenue Department between 1 April 1988 and 30 September 1988 for cancellation of registration. Such persons may claim an imputed credit (1/11th) on assets retained which were acquired or produced prior to 1 October 1986.

This claim may be made in the final return as a Box 8 adjustment and will be the lesser of:

1.  the costs of goods and services to the supplier as at 30 September 1986
2.  the open market value of those goods and services as at the date of the deemed supply.

The Department is issuing letters to all registered persons who voluntarily registered and has prepared an explanatory pamphlet on these new provisions which is available from any Inland Revenue Office.

1 Goods and services tax on listed services GST information for drivers, deliverers, and accommodation owners operating in the sharing economy AD277 Online marketplaces (also known as digital platforms) must collect GST on all listed services provided through their online marketplace. Find out what you need to do. The listed services rules Since 1 April 2024, GST registered online marketplaces that facilitate the sale of listed services by sellers must collect and pay GST of 15% when the service is performed, provided, or received in New Zealand. These GST rules do not apply to services that do not use an online marketplace. For example, services you sell through your own website, over the phone, by email or in person. Websites or apps supplying their own services directly to customers, are not online marketplaces. These rules do not affect them. For example, a platform that provides delivery services directly to customers. If you are hired by one of these websites or apps, either as an employee or an independent contractor, these rules will not apply to you. If you are unsure whether you are using an online marketplace, please check with them. What listed services are Listed services are: • ride-sharing and ride-hailing • food and beverage delivery • short-stay and visitor accommodation. Listed services do not include supplies of residential rental accommodation that are exempt from GST. This will generally be the case if the accommodation is used by the tenant as their home and there is a residential tenancy agreement. Online marketplaces must also collect GST on closely connected services provided by the same seller if they are available through their marketplace. For example, holiday rental cleaning fees charged on top of the accommodation costs. How you are affected If you perform or provide listed services in New Zealand using an online marketplace, how these rules apply to you depend on whether you are GST registered or not. You must tell your online marketplace if you are GST registered or not. If you are registered for another activity, you still need to tell them. Provide your marketplace operator with your: • name • IRD number • GST registration status. What you should do now If you are non-GST-registered, a new flat-rate credit scheme applies. Under this scheme your online marketplace will collect GST at the standard 15% rate. Of this amount, they will pass on 8.5% to you as the flat-rate credit, and pay the remaining 6.5% to us. This flat-rate credit is for you to keep and recognises costs you incur when supplying these services. Jared is not GST registered. He provides driving services in Wellington on a ride-hailing platform. The platform charges a customer a fare of $30 for Jared’s services. The platform adds 15% GST to this fare, charging the customer a total of $34.50. As Jared is not GST registered, the GST amount of $4.50 is accounted for in the following way: • $2.55 (8.5%) is passed on to Jared • $1.95 (6.5%) is paid to Inland Revenue. Jared receives a monthly statement from the platform confirming the flat-rate credits passed on to him. Example – Non-GST-registered seller If you are GST-registered, you must still file GST returns. Treat listed services sold through online marketplaces as zero-rated supplies in your GST returns. To do this, see how to complete your GST returns below. If you also supply goods or services outside of an online marketplace, for example services sold over the phone, by email or in person (even if the booking is recorded on an online marketplace), or as part of a separate activity, you must continue to pay GST on those supplies in your returns. 2 There are opt-out rules for large GST-registered sellers, discussed below. If you meet the criteria, you can carry on being responsible for the GST obligations including providing taxable supply information to customers, for example an invoice. When to register for GST If you are not registered for GST, you will need to register if you have earned, or will earn more than $60,000 from all your taxable activities in any 12-month period. This includes sales provided directly to customers, for example through your own website, and supplies made through an online marketplace. You may also register voluntarily if you earn less than this. It is important to tell your online marketplace if your GST registration status changes. How to complete your GST returns To complete your GST returns using myIR, choose the total sales and purchases filing option. Include the value of listed services before GST in both total sales and income and zero-rated supplies. If you are filing using a paper return, include the value of listed services before GST in box 5 and 6. Include the full amount before GST, not the net amount you receive after deducting any marketplace fees or commission. You can continue to claim GST on your costs to make these supplies. For example, some online marketplaces include GST on their fees or commission. If they do, you can claim the GST on these. Amy is GST-registered. She rents out a property on an online marketplace for $100 per night. The property is in New Zealand and is available for short-stay holiday accommodation. The online marketplace adds 15% GST to the nightly rate, charging guests $115. They include $115 as sales and income in their GST return. In Amy’s GST return, she includes: • $100 as total sales and income (box 5) • $100 as zero-rated supplies (box 6). The zero-rated supplies are subtracted from sales and income resulting in $0 total GST collected (box 7). Amy can also claim back GST on any purchases and expenses incurred to rent out her property as short-stay accommodation (in box 11 of the paper return). Example – GST-registered seller What to do if you incorrectly receive flat-rate credits The flat-rate credit scheme cannot apply to you if you are GST registered. If you receive flat-rate credits when you are GST registered, you will need to pay them to us by making a debit adjustment in your GST return. You must also tell your online marketplace you are GST registered. If you continue to receive flat-rate credits incorrectly, penalties may apply to you. Taxable supply information You do not need to provide your customers with taxable supply information, for example an invoice. Online marketplaces must do this. You also do not need to provide taxable supply information to your online marketplace for supplies of listed services through their marketplace. When you must collect and pay GST on your sales If you’re GST-registered and providing services that are not facilitated through an online marketplace, the ordinary GST rules apply and you will have to collect and pay GST. Opt-out rules There are opt-out rules for large GST-registered sellers. Sellers who opt-out remain responsible for the GST obligations including providing taxable supply information to customers. The online marketplace does not need to collect and pay the G ST. 3 You can opt-out if 1 of the following applies. • You’re a non-individual and make more than NZ$500,000 of supplies in a 12-month period. You need to tell your online marketplace in writing, for example by email, you are opting out. Online marketplaces will have different methods for doing this. • You list, or can reasonably expect to list, more than 2,000 nights of accommodation on an online marketplace in a 12-month period. You can enter into an agreement with the online marketplace to opt out. • You make more than $60,000 of supplies of accommodation in a hostel or motel in a 12-month period. You can enter into an agreement with the online marketplace to opt out. To qualify, you must have been registered for GST before 1 April 2024 and provide accommodation through both an online marketplace and directly to your guests. The 2,000-night threshold can be satisfied by a group of related companies. But it is not possible to combine accommodation nights across multiple online marketplaces. Note: For an opt-out agreement to be valid, there must be a written agreement the seller will be responsible for the tax obligations under the GST Act for the supplies of listed services. This includes: • providing customers with taxable supply information, if required • identifying the seller as the supplier • filing GST returns • collecting and paying GST to us. Keep all information relating to opt-outs in your records. Selling a house or vehicle used for listed services If you are GST-registered, the sale of your house or vehicle used to supply listed services will generally be subject to GST. You will also have to pay GST if you stop using your house or vehicle for this purpose. However, you can choose to treat the sale of your house or vehicle as not being subject to GST if: • you have not previously claimed a GST deduction for the house or vehicle • the house or vehicle was not acquired or used for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies • the house or vehicle was not acquired as a zero-rated supply. An exception to this applies if before you sell the asset, you make a debit adjustment for the GST you would have been charged if the sale to you was not zero-rated. If you are non-GST-registered, the sale of your house or vehicle used to supply listed services will generally not be subject to GST, except in situations where you intend to make supplies of more than $60,000 in the next 12-months other than from the sale of the asset.

The infringement fees received by a local authority are paid into the Crown bank account or retained under s 141(3)–(5) of the Land Transport Act 1998. The infringement fees retained under s 141 of the Land Transport Act 1998 are a debt owing to a local authority when imposed; and  A local authority acquires goods and services, on which tax is charged under s 8, that are applied in its traffic law enforcement activities under the Land Transport Act 1998. The Arrangement does not include any activities that involve making an “exempt supply” as defined in s 14(1). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows:  All the activities that a local authority undertakes in enforcing traffic laws in its area are part of its “taxable activity” under s 6(1)(b).  GST under s 8(1) is not charged on any amounts of infringement fees retained by a local authority under s 141(3)–(5) of the Land Transport Act 1998.  GST charged under s 8(1) on goods and services that the local authority acquires for use in its traffic law enforcement activities is “input tax” as defined in s 3A(1).

This Ruling and Commentary explains the GST treatment of local authorities’ traffic law enforcement activities under the Land Transport Act 1998 (LTA). 2. Local authorities undertake a broad range of activities for the benefit of their communities. These activities, including traffic law enforcement, are deemed to be part of a local authority’s taxable activity under s 6(1)(b). 3. The Ruling confirms that GST under s 8(1) is not charged on any amounts of infringement fees received or retained by a local authority under s 141(3)–(5) of the LTA. This conclusion is based on the infringement fee being a debt due to the local authority on imposition and not a debt due to the Crown. 4. Broadly, GST output tax is not payable on infringement fees because infringement fees are a penalty for an offence imposed under a statute. Consequently, infringement fees received as part of a local authority’s traffic law enforcement activities are not consideration paid by the offender for any supply provided by the local authority. 5. The Ruling also confirms that GST charged on goods and services that a local authority acquires to use for its traffic law enforcement activities is input tax. A local authority may deduct the input tax when calculating its output tax. 6. The issuing of infringement notices and the retention of infringement fees under the LTA is a necessary and incidental part of providing traffic law enforcement services. These activities do not represent a separate use of the goods and services. There is no separate supply and no apportionment or adjustment (in terms of ss 20(3C) and 21–21G) is required when calculating input tax. Background 7. There has been some uncertainty as to the correct GST treatment of parking infringement fees and the Commissioner has decided to issue a Public Ruling to provide on-going clarification. 8. The Ruling applies to local authorities as defined by s 2(1). This definition has two parts: it includes local authorities within the meaning of s 5(1) of the Local Government Act 2002, and it lists other entities considered to be local authorities under the Goods and Services Tax Act. 9. For the purposes of this Ruling, a local authority is also required to be a “registered person” as defined in s 2(1). 10. The Ruling addresses the GST treatment of infringement fees arising from the issuing of infringement notices under the LTA. The LTA empowers local authorities to issue infringement notices for infringement offences. In each case, an Act, regulation or bylaw prescribes the infringement fee or penalty. 11. The Ruling also considers input tax charged on goods and services acquired by a local authority that are used or applied to its traffic law enforcement activities under the LTA. The Commissioner understands such traffic law enforcement activities include:  preventing the obstruction of roadways by double-parked vehicles; 3 UNCLASSIFIED  preventing the obstruction of drivers’ vision at intersections;  enforcing loading and clearway zones;  enforcing the restriction on parking at bus stops;  enforcing non-parking on mobility parks; and  enforcing the restriction on parking over access-ways. 12. These activities are “stationary vehicle offences” under the LTA. This term is defined widely by s 2(1) of the LTA and essentially includes parking in breach of any Act, regulation or bylaw. Summary of the legislation 13. This part of the commentary summarises the relevant provisions of the LTA and the GST Act. 14. The LTA is the principal Act in the area of transport and addresses a wide variety of issues. Relevantly, for the purposes of this Ruling and commentary, the LTA allows local authority parking wardens to issue infringement notices (which give rise to infringement fees) for certain infringement offences. The LTA also specifies when infringement fees received by the local authority can be retained and when the infringement fees must be paid to the Crown. Scheme of the Land Transport Act 1998 15. The issuing of infringement notices and retention of infringement fees under the LTA are relevant to understanding the nature of the transaction. Section 138 of the LTA sets out how a person who is alleged to have committed an “infringement offence” may be proceeded against in court or be issued with an infringement notice. 16. An “infringement offence” is defined in s 2(1) of the LTA as being: infringement offence means— (a) a moving vehicle offence: (ab) a stationary vehicle offence: (b) an overloading offence: (ba) an offence against this Act concerning logbooks that is committed by a transport service driver: (c) an infringement offence specified in regulations made under this Act: (ca) a toll offence: (d) any other offence against this Act or any other enactment that is specified as an infringement offence against this Act (other than an offence that carries a penalty of imprisonment or mandatory disqualification from holding or obtaining a driver licence) 17. Section 139 of the LTA prescribes when and how infringement notices can be issued, and s 140 of the LTA sets out the content requirements. 18. Section 141 of the LTA deals with infringement fees and, in particular, when they can be retained. Relevant to this commentary are subss (1) and (3)–(5):  Section 141(1) of the LTA provides that the infringement fee payable for an infringement offence is the appropriate fee prescribed for the offence under the LTA. 4 UNCLASSIFIED  Section 141(3) of the LTA provides (subject to subs (4) and (5)) that all infringement fees must be paid into a Crown bank account. An exception allows the retention of a portion of fees (that the Minister of Finance from time to time approves) being the expenses incidental to their collection.  Section 141(4) of the LTA allows the Minister of Finance to approve a retention (by an enforcement authority) of a portion of the infringement fees received from infringement offences in relation to the use of special vehicle lanes.  Section 141(5) of the LTA provides for the retention of infringement fees received in respect of certain offences that involve parking in breach of a local authority bylaw. This subsection also allows for the retention of towage fees received and a portion of all other infringement fees received by an enforcement authority that the Minister of Finance from time to time approves. 19. Section 141 of the LTA is largely drafted in terms of an “enforcement authority” rather than a “local authority”. However, the definition of an “enforcement authority” in s 2(1) of the LTA includes a “local authority” which is in turn defined by reference to a regional council or territorial authority under the Local Government Act 2002. The term “road controlling authority” is also used in the relevant sections of the LTA and, ultimately, includes local authorities. Imposition of GST under the Act 20. Section 8(1) imposes GST on the supply of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person. GST is charged on the value of that supply. The value of a supply is the “consideration” paid for the supply (ss 2(1) (definition of “consideration”) and 10). 21. The term “supply” is defined very broadly in s 5(1) as including “all forms of supply”. In Databank Systems Ltd v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,213 this was interpreted as meaning “to furnish with or provide”. 22. The approach of the courts is that a supply of a service requires that some kind of benefit is provided to a recipient (per Blanchard J’s majority judgment in Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075 and see Case S65 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,408). 23. For GST to apply to a payment, it must be more than just a payment to a registered person in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity. For GST to apply, the payment must also be consideration for a supply. To determine whether a payment satisfies this test, a relevant supply must be identified. Then it must be determined whether a payment is made for that identified supply (see CIR v Databank Systems Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,093 (CA)). 24. When analysing transactions for GST purposes, the focus is on the legal rights and obligations created by the parties. The important question is whether a sufficient nexus or reciprocity exists between the supply of the goods or services and the consideration (see CIR v NZ Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 (CA), Chatham Islands and Rotorua Regional Airport v CIR (2010) 24 NZTC 23,979). 5 UNCLASSIFIED Analysis 25. Against this background, four main areas need to be considered in answering the issues addressed in the Ruling. These areas are:  the scope of a local authority’s taxable activity;  whether GST output tax is payable on infringement fees;  whether GST input tax deductions are available; and  the extent to which GST input tax deductions have to be apportioned or adjusted if output tax is not payable on infringement fees. Scope of a local authority’s taxable activity Services provided by local authorities and taxable activity generally 26. Local authorities provide a wide variety of services to their ratepayers and community. Undertaking services to benefit the community is consistent with the purposes of local government generally and s 10 of the Local Government Act 2002. This section specifies the purposes of a local authority include promoting the social, economic, environmental, and cultural well-being of communities. 27. In return for the local authority providing services, households and businesses are required to pay rates. Rates are generally levied to pay for many of the services that local authorities provide. 28. One service local authorities might provide is traffic law enforcement. Traffic law enforcement activities likely represent a small part of the overall services local authorities provide to benefit their communities. The broad purpose of traffic law enforcement services is to provide safe and efficient roads for ratepayers and the community. This purpose is consistent with promoting the social, economic, environmental, and cultural well-being of communities. 29. Local authorities make, administer and enforce traffic laws. Section 22AB of the LTA allows a local authority (as a road controlling authority) to make a wide variety of bylaws in relation to the roads under its control. For parking bylaws the local authority must designate the area of road affected and determine how the restrictions in the bylaw will apply. This also involves the local authority providing appropriate signage, road markings and meters as required. 30. Local authorities also undertake various administration activities such as publishing bylaws, tracing and recording payments from offenders, dealing with complaints, and responding to offenders disputing infringement notices. Under s 128D of the LTA, a local authority can also appoint parking wardens to monitor compliance and enforce traffic laws on the local authority’s roads. Specific provisions 31. Section 6(1) defines “taxable activity” as: (1) For the purposes of this Act, the term taxable activity means— (a) any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuniary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration; and includes any 6 UNCLASSIFIED such activity carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association, or club: (b) without limiting the generality of paragraph (a), the activities of any public authority or any local authority. 32. Section 6(1)(b) deems all of a local authority’s activities (except exempt activities) to be part of its taxable activity. Local authorities are deemed to have a taxable activity without reference to any of the requirements in s 6(1)(a) such as a “supply of goods and services” and “consideration”. 33. For the sake of completeness, s 6(3)(d) provides an exception to s 6(1)(b) for any activity to the extent to which it involves making exempt supplies. It is difficult to identify any “exempt supplies” in the context of the Arrangement and this Ruling. However, for the avoidance of doubt, any activities involving making exempt supplies are excluded from the Arrangement. 34. Section 5(7)(a) also applies specifically to local authorities. This section provides: (7) For the purposes of this Act— (a) every local authority is deemed to supply goods and services to any person where any amount of rates is payable by that person to that local authority: 35. The effect of s 5(7)(a) is to bring local authority rates within the GST regime. 36. Sections 6(1)(b) and 5(7)(a) are recognition by Parliament that local authorities are in a unique position of undertaking an array of activities for the benefit of their communities. In return, the ratepayers of the community are required to pay rates. The broad deeming provisions indicate that local authorities’ activities and the rates paid are subject to GST. 37. In summary, all of a local authority’s activities that are not exempt supplies, including traffic law enforcement, are taxable activities under the Act. Is GST output tax payable on infringement fees? 38. Infringement fees arise out of the broad traffic law enforcement activities a local authority undertakes. To understand the GST treatment of infringement fees it is necessary to appreciate how they are imposed and treated under the LTA. Imposition of infringement fees 39. Infringement fees are imposed under statute. Section 138 of the LTA provides that if a person commits an infringement offence they may be proceeded against under the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 or be served with an infringement notice as provided in s 139 of the LTA. 40. As “enforcement authorities” under the LTA, local authorities can appoint parking wardens to issue infringement notices (ss 128D, 128E and 139 of the LTA) for certain infringement offences. 41. The term “infringement offence” is defined in s 2(1) of the LTA by reference to broad categories of offences (see \[16\]). In each case, further specific offences are defined by reference to other provisions. Many of the specific infringement offences are listed in the schedules to the Land Transport (Offences and Penalties) Regulations 1999 (the 7 UNCLASSIFIED Schedules). Schedule 1 identifies the offence, the provision under which it arises, and the amount of the infringement fee payable in each case. 42. The Ruling applies to infringement fees imposed for stationary vehicle and special lane infringement offences. 43. Parking on a road where parking is governed by parking meters and not paying the required fee is an example of where an infringement notice might be issued by a parking warden. If the person did not pay the stipulated fee for the metered parking space, they would be committing an infringement offence under s 2(1) of the LTA, being a “stationary vehicle offence”. This is further defined under the LTA to include parking in breach of a bylaw made under s 22AB(1)(m) of the LTA. 44. If a parking warden issues an infringement notice, the infringement fee payable under the Schedules depends on the length of time the car has been parked in breach of the bylaw. The Schedules provide a scale of $12 for offences less than 30 minutes to $57 for offences over 6 hours. In each case, the Schedules allow the local authority to fix a lesser amount. 45. In determining whether GST output tax is payable on infringement fees, it is necessary to determine whether infringement fees are consideration for a supply. An infringement fee can be analysed in three main ways:  It might be regarded as consideration paid by the offender in return for a supply of services from the local authority.  It might be regarded as consideration for a supply of services by the local authority to the community.  It might be regarded as consideration received by the local authority for a supply of services to the Crown. Whether an infringement fee is consideration for a supply to the offender 46. Infringement offences and infringement fees are prescribed under specific statutory provisions. An infringement offence involves a breach of the LTA or another Act, regulation or bylaw. Likewise, an infringement fee is also specifically imposed by legislation, in most cases, the Schedules. Infringement fees are a penalty arising under statute for an unlawful act; they are not consideration for a supply of services. 47. The imposition of the infringement is not a supply of a service. A supply of a service to a person for the purposes of GST must be something that benefits another person in some way. Judge Willy in Case S65 considered that a supply of a service must be for (rather than against) a person. The imposition of a fine by way of an infringement fee punishes rather than benefits the offender, so cannot be the supply of a service. Consequently, the imposition of infringement fee on the offender cannot be a service to the offender (for which the infringement fees paid to the local authority is consideration). 48. Neither can the infringement fee (nor any part of it) be consideration paid by the offender for the provision of a car-parking space. This situation might arise, for example, when a person parks their car in a metered space but does not pay the stipulated fee for the space. The person then receives an infringement notice and is required to pay an infringement fee. 8 UNCLASSIFIED 49. In this situation, the Commissioner considers that no part of the infringement fee is being imposed or paid for the provision of a parking space. The infringement fee does not have the legal character of being imposed or paid for the provision of a car-parking space. Rather, the payment is a penalty imposed by the local authority under the LTA. 50. The conclusion that penalties are not consideration for a supply is consistent with the Commissioner’s previously published material (“GST Treatment of Court Awards and Out of Court Settlements”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14, No 10 (October 2002): 21 (QB 14/06), “QB 14/06: GST – hire firm security bonds”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26 No 7 (August 2014): 131, and “QB 14/14: GST – late return charges (including library fines and parking overstay charges)”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 1 (February 2015): 40). Whether an infringement fee is consideration for a supply to the community 51. As noted above, infringement fees are imposed under statute. The requirement to pay an infringement fee is a consequence of committing an infringement offence. The infringement fee is separate and distinct from the supply of traffic enforcement services by a local authority to its community. 52. The infringement fee is not consideration paid by the offender for the provision of traffic law enforcement services to the community by a local authority. For GST to arise there must be an element of reciprocity in the transactions between the parties (Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR). In CIR v NZ Refining, the court held that a direct link between a supply and the consideration was required and that to be consideration for a supply a payment must be made for that supply. 53. The payment of an infringement fee is a consequence of committing an offence. It is the offender’s actions in committing the offence that brings about the requirement to make payment. The payment is not made by the offender in exchange for the provision of services from the local authority; nor can the offender’s payment be said to be in response to and for the inducement of the supply of a services provided by the local authority (Turakina Maori Girls College Board of Trustees v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,032). 54. Accordingly, an insufficient connection exists between the supply of traffic enforcement services by the local authority and the consideration paid by the offender. 55. In conclusion, the local authority cannot be said to provide services, to either the offender or community, for consideration paid by the offender (in the form of the infringement fees). This is consistent with the approach taken on similar facts in the UK case of Bristol City Council v C&E Commissioners (VAT and Duties Tribunal, Decision No 17665, 15 May 2002). Assuming the infringement fee is not consideration for a supply to the Crown, GST under s 8(1) is not charged on any amounts of “infringement fees” retained by a local authority under s 141(3)–(5) of the LTA. Whether an infringement fee is consideration for a supply to the Crown 56. An infringement fee could still be subject to GST, if it were consideration from the Crown for a supply of services from the local authority. The 9 UNCLASSIFIED central issue is whether the infringement fee is a debt owing to the Crown or local authority. If the infringement fee is a debt due to the Crown, then by allowing the local authority to retain the fee there is, arguably, a payment from the Crown to the local authority. This payment could be characterised as consideration for a supply of services. However, if the infringement fee already belongs to the local authority, it cannot also be payment from the Crown to the local authority. 57. The infringement fee is paid by the offender to the local authority. Infringement fees will usually be paid on to the Crown but in some cases the local authority may retain them. Section 141 of the LTA sets out the arrangements between the local authority and Crown for infringement fees: 141 Provisions relating to infringement fees (1) The infringement fee payable in respect of an infringement offence is the appropriate infringement fee prescribed in respect of the relevant offence by or under this Act. (2) If an infringement fee is paid to an enforcement authority other than the Police, the enforcement authority must give the Commissioner the particulars of the infringement and of the payment that the Commissioner requires. (3) Subject to subsections (4) and (5), all infringement fees received under this Act by an enforcement authority or recovered under the Summary Proceedings Act 1957 must be paid into a Crown Bank Account, except that the enforcement authority may retain any portion of the fees so received that the Minister of Finance from time to time approves as being the expenses incidental to their collection. (4) An enforcement authority that is the Agency or a local authority may retain the portion of the infringement fees received by it under this Act— (a) that the Minister of Finance from time to time approves; and (b) that is received in respect of an infringement offence in relation to the use of a special vehicle lane. (5) An enforcement authority that is a road controlling authority may retain— (a) all infringement fees that it receives in respect of offences that involve— (i) parking in breach of a bylaw of the road controlling authority on any portion of a road where parking is for the time being governed by the location of parking meters placed pursuant to a bylaw of the road controlling authority; or (ii) parking on any other portion of a road in breach of a bylaw of the road controlling authority that prohibits parking for a period in excess of the period fixed by the bylaw where the infringement notice in respect of the offence was issued by an officer or other person appointed by the road controlling authority; and (b) all towage fees received by it; and (c) the portion of all other infringement fees received by it that the Minister of Finance from time to time approves. (6) The Commissioner must from time to time, out of money appropriated by Parliament for the purpose, pay to a road controlling authority the portions of the infringement fees (other than towage fees) that the Minister of Finance from time to time approves and that the Commissioner receives in respect of other offences that involve breaches of the road controlling authority’s bylaws (not being offences that are also offences against an Act or a regulation). (7) For the purposes of subsections (4) and (5), the Minister of Finance may approve the retention of different portions for road controlling authorities or enforcement authorities and different categories of infringement offences. 58. Under s 141(3) of the LTA, the default position is that all infringement fees received are paid into the Crown bank account except for amounts retained to cover collection costs. If all infringement fees are a debt 10 UNCLASSIFIED owing to the Crown, this raises the possibility that fees retained by the local authority are consideration from the Crown for the supply of services. 59. In this case, the retention of infringement fees under s 141 of the LTA is not consideration received from the Crown. Instead, where infringement fees are “retained” under s 141(3)–(5), they are a debt owing to the local authority on imposition. As the infringement fees are due directly to the local authority, they cannot also be a “payment” from the Crown to the local authority. 60. The word “retain” is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th ed, Oxford University Press, 2011) as: Retain v. 1 continue to have; keep possession of ... 61. The word “retain” is used several times in the LTA (ss 19(3), 30ZH(1)(a) and 96(2)(e)). In each case, the use is consistent with receiving or holding something and continuing to have or keep possession of that thing. The use of the word “retain” on its own could still support the view that the local authority is merely collecting the infringement fees that it then remits to the Crown. 62. However, reading the word “retain” in the context of the scheme of the LTA supports the conclusion that the infringement fees (under s 141(3)– (5)) are derived by the local authority. Section 141 of the LTA is structured so that the starting point is the general rule in s 141(3), requiring infringement fees to be paid into the Crown bank account. However, this is subject to specific exceptions in s 141(3)–(5). 63. Under these exceptions, an enforcement authority (which includes a local authority) is entitled to retain certain payments. Section 141(3) of the LTA requires only a proportion of infringement fees received to be paid into the Crown bank account. The enforcement authority may retain such portion of the fees as the Minister of Finance from time to time approves as being expenses incidental to their collection. 64. Section 141(4) of the LTA provides the Minister of Finance can approve the retention of a portion of infringement fees arising from an offence in relation to a special vehicle lane. Section 141(5) of the LTA provides that an enforcement authority is entitled to retain all infringement fees received by it for certain stationary vehicle offences. These offences generally involve parking in breach of a bylaw of the local authority. Section 141(5)(c) also allows the Minister of Finance to approve the retention of a portion of “other” infringement fees. 65. In summary, infringement fees under s 141(3)–(5) are derived by a local authority in its own right carrying out its traffic law enforcement activities. All infringement fees that the local authority is entitled to retain under s 141 of the LTA are a debt due to the local authority when imposed. Because these infringement fees belong to the local authority in the first place, they cannot be a payment from the Crown to the local authority. Therefore, the Crown cannot be providing consideration for the supply of traffic law enforcement services from the local authority. 66. This conclusion is broadly consistent with other legislation. For instance, s 73 of the Public Finance Act 1989 provides that where a local authority prosecutes a person in court, the fine is paid to the local authority. This is subject to an amount equal to 10% being deducted and credited to the Crown bank account. 11 UNCLASSIFIED Are GST input tax deductions available? 67. Input tax is defined in s 3A. For the purposes of this Ruling and commentary, input tax means the GST local authorities pay on the goods and services they acquire for their traffic law enforcement activities. 68. A deduction is allowed for input tax paid, under s 20(3C), only to the extent that the goods or services are used for or are available for use in making taxable supplies. “Taxable supply” is defined in s 2(1) as “a supply of goods and services in New Zealand that is charged with tax under section 8”. 69. The following elements need to be satisfied for there to be a “taxable supply”:  There must be a supply of a good or service.  The good or service must be supplied in New Zealand.  The good or service must be charged with tax under s 8. Supply of a good or service 70. As discussed above, the Commissioner considers traffic law enforcement activities to be a part of the broad services supplied by the local authority to ratepayers and the community. 71. There is a “supply” under s 5(1) or s 5(7)(a). Section 5(7)(a) is the broad deeming provision that deems a “supply” of goods and services where a person pays rates to a local authority. 72. Even in the absence of s 5(7)(a), there is still a supply under s 5(1) as the local authority is supplying a service that benefits ratepayers and the community. Without the service, transportation in the community would be negatively affected. The enforcement of traffic laws brings about both direct and voluntary compliance with such laws. Other benefits include the efficient transportation of people and goods, the efficient operation of public transport, and the protection of people’s property rights. Good or service is supplied in New Zealand 73. A local authority carries out its traffic law enforcement activities in its respective area, and the supply of the traffic enforcement activities is performed (supplied) in New Zealand. Good or service is charged with tax under s 8 74. Section 8(1) provides that GST is charged on the supply (but not an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person. 75. Therefore, four elements must be met:  Supply of services: As discussed above, a supply of traffic law enforcement services under either s 5(7)(a) or s 5(1).  Supply is not an exempt supply: It is difficult to imagine any supply of traffic law enforcement services being an exempt supply under s 14(1). In any event, exempt supplies are excluded from the Arrangement in the Ruling. 12 UNCLASSIFIED  Supply by a registered person: Local authorities are registered persons for GST purposes and this is a requirement of the Arrangement.  Supply in the furtherance of a taxable activity: All of a local authorities’ activities are deemed to be a “taxable activity” under s 6(1)(b). 76. As each element is met, the goods and services used (or available for use) by a local authority for the enforcement of traffic laws qualify as goods and services used in “making taxable supplies”. The requirements under the definition of “taxable supply” are met, and an input tax deduction is available under s 20(3C). Is any apportionment or adjustment required? 77. Under s 20(3C), an input tax deduction is available only to the extent that the good or service is used or is available for use in making taxable supplies. If the good or service is to be used in making exempt or non- taxable supplies, then an apportionment of input tax will be required on acquisition to reflect that intended use. Adjustments are made subsequently, if the actual use is different to the intended use. 78. As discussed above, infringement fees retained under s 141(3)–(5) are not subject to GST. An apportionment or adjustment is not required, because the issuing of infringement notices and the consequential retention of infringement fees are merely one part of the broad traffic law enforcement services supplied and are not a supply in themselves. Infringement fees are a necessary and incidental part of the taxable supplies a local authority makes in providing traffic law enforcement services to its ratepayers and community. 79. Infringement fees are necessary because traffic law enforcement would be ineffective without the ability to impose penalties. The infringement fee is incidental to the local authority’s purpose of providing safe and efficient roads, parking spaces, public transport and so on. Local authorities want motorists to comply with the law not to breach it so they can penalise them. As such, the issuing of infringement notices and the retention of infringement fees are not a separate supply from traffic law enforcement. 80. By way of an example, if a local authority receives a submission from the community requesting a residents parking area, they may choose to pass a bylaw, designate the area affected, decide on the hours of operation, and provide road markings and signage. They may also set up a system of permits or coupons for residents. It is necessary to be able to issue infringement notices to prevent non-residents parking contrary to the bylaw. The infringement fees that arise are incidental to the provision of parking spaces for residents and those with resident permits. 81. Therefore, when goods and services are acquired for traffic law enforcement activities and applied to the issuing of infringement notices (and the consequential retention of infringement fees), there will be no separate use and no requirement to apportion input tax or make any adjustments post-acquisition. 13 UNCLASSIFIED Examples 82. The following examples help to explain how the law applies to particular situations. The GST consequences of each example are a result of the particular facts. Any additions or variations to the facts may give rise to different GST consequences. Example 1: GST on infringement fees 83. Ray parks his car on a street in a council-metered parking bay. Parking costs $2 an hour, and Ray puts $4 in the meter for 2 hours of parking. Ray is 20 minutes late returning to his car. A council parking warden has issued an infringement notice and left it under the car’s windscreen wiper. The infringement notice is for a $12 infringement fee for parking in a metered parking bay in breach of a bylaw. The council will retain the amount under s 141(5) of the LTA. 84. No GST is required to be charged on the infringement fee. It is a penalty arising under the LTA. The payment of the $12 penalty is a consequence of Ray’s acting contrary to local bylaws and the penalty is prescribed under the Schedules. The $12 is not consideration for a supply of services. Example 2: Availability of input tax deductions 85. Brambleton Council purchases 20 new handheld ticketing machines. The ticketing machines are purchased at a cost of $460 each (inclusive of GST). The local authority uses the ticketing machines when enforcing traffic laws in its area. Each council parking warden receives a ticketing machine that they use for issuing on-the-spot infringement notices. 86. Brambleton Council, as a registered person, is able to claim an input tax deduction of $60 per machine when calculating its output tax. The ticketing machines have been acquired for use (and are subsequently used) in traffic law enforcement activities. 87. No apportionment or adjustment to the input tax deduction is required. There is no separate supply. Infringement fees are the result of an offender breaching the terms of an Act, regulation or bylaw. The penalty itself arises under (and is prescribed in) statute and is not part of a service provided to the public. The act of issuing the infringement fee is a necessary and incidental part of the traffic law enforcement activities. The ability to enforce the traffic laws facilitates the effective provision of the council’s traffic law enforcement services. Therefore, the ticketing machines are used in making taxable supplies being the provision of the council services. 14 UNCLASSIFIED References Subject references GST, infringement fee, infringement offence, local authority, penalties, Legislative references Criminal Procedure Act 2011 Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 – ss 2(1) (definitions of “local authority”, “registered person”, “taxable activity”, “taxable supply”, “consideration”), 3A, 5(1) and (7)(a), 6(1)(b), 8, 10, 14(1), 20(3) and (3C), 21– 21G Land Transport Act 1998 – ss 2(1) (definitions of “enforcement authority”, “infringement offence”, “stationary vehicle offence”, “road controlling authority”), 19(3), 22AB, 30ZH(1)(a), 96(2)(e), 128D, 128E, 138–141 Land Transport (Offences and Penalties) Regulations 1999 – schedules 1, 1A, 1B Local Government Act 2002 – ss 5(1) (definition of “local authority”), 10 Public Finance Act 1989 – s 73 Case references Case S65 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,408 Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075 CIR v Databank Systems Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,093 (CA) CIR v NZ Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 (CA) Databank Systems Ltd v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,213 Rotorua Regional Airport v CIR (2010) 24 NZTC 23,979 Turakina Maori Girls College Board of Trustees v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,032 Other references Concise Oxford Dictionary (12th ed, Oxford University Press, 2011) “GST Treatment of Court Awards and Out of Court Settlements”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14, No 10 (October 2002): 21 (QB 14/06) “QB 14/06: GST – hire firm security bonds” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26 No 7 (August 2014): 131 “QB 14/14: GST – late return charges (including library fines and parking overstay charges)”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 1 (February 2015): 40 APPENDIX 1 GST Act relevant provisions 1.1 Section 5 relevantly provides: SECT 5 MEANING OF THE TERM SUPPLY (1) For the purposes of this Act, the term supply includes all forms of supply. ...

(5) An enforcement authority that is a road controlling authority may retain— (a) all infringement fees that it receives in respect of offences that involve— (i) parking in breach of a bylaw of the road controlling authority on any portion of a road where parking is for the time being governed by the location of parking meters placed pursuant to a bylaw of the road controlling authority; or (ii) parking on any other portion of a road in breach of a bylaw of the road controlling authority that prohibits parking for a period in excess of the period fixed by the bylaw where the infringement notice in respect of the offence was issued by an officer or other person appointed by the road controlling authority; and (b) all towage fees received by it; and (c) the portion of all other infringement fees received by it that the Minister of Finance from time to time approves. (6) The Commissioner must from time to time, out of money appropriated by Parliament for the purpose, pay to a road controlling authority the portions of the infringement fees (other than towage fees) that the Minister of Finance from time to time approves and that the Commissioner receives in respect of other offences that involve breaches of the road controlling authority's bylaws (not being offences that are also offences against an Act or a regulation). (7) For the purposes of subsections (4) and (5), the Minister of Finance may approve the retention of different portions for road controlling authorities or enforcement authorities and different categories of infringement offences. (8) For the purposes of this section, road controlling authority includes an airport authority.

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985
===============================

Archived legislative commentary on the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 from PIB vol 143 Feb 1986.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 143, February 1986

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_](/about/about-our-publications)
.

The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 was passed into law on 3 December 1985.

In September 1985 a Public Information Bulletin (No 139) was issued to assist people to make representations to a Parliamentary Select Committee and to assist those people with an interest in the detail of the proposed application of the tax.

As noted at that time, the Bill before Parliament was subject to change as a result of the consideration given by the Select Committee.

This Bulletin is issued as a commentary on the GST Act 1985 as it was finally passed by Parliament.

The Bulletin is intended to fill the information gap until other information becomes available during the implementation phase of GST.

Section I - Background
----------------------

### Introduction

The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 was originally introduced to Parliament on 22 August 1985. This Act gives effect to the Government's proposal to implement a Goods and Services Tax (GST) from 1 October 1986. This commentary outlines the main features of GST and explains the manner in which GST will operate. The Bill had no legal effect and changes were made during the Parliamentary process. The Department must apply the law in the form that it is ultimately enacted so the earlier commentary on the Bill contained in Public Information Bulletin No 139 (September 1985) **should no longer be used as a reference**.

This commentary is in six sections:

*   This Section outlines the background and broad principles of GST.
*   **Section II** outlines the detailed operation of the GST.
*   **Section III** deals with registration.
*   **Section IV** deals with the furnishing of returns and the accounting for and calculation of the GST payable.
*   **Section V** deals with the administration of GST and outlines the assessment and objection, recovery and penalty, and offence provisions contained in the Bill. Certain transitional provisions are also covered.
*   **Section VI** deals with a number of special topics.

### Background to the Goods and Services Tax Act

In the 1984 Budget, presented on 8 November 1984, the Government announced that a Goods and Services Tax would be introduced on 1 April 1986. In March 1985 a White Paper on GST was published and submissions were invited on the proposals outlined. In response to that invitation, a total of 1459 submissions were received, reflecting widespread public interest in the proposals.

The submissions were reviewed by a 3 member GST Advisory Panel headed by Dr Don Brash. The Panel's comments and recommendations were submitted to the Minister of Finance and the majority of their recommendations were accepted.

After receiving the Panel's report, the Government amended the proposed date for implementing GST from 1 April 1986 to 1 October 1986. This deferral gave interested persons an opportunity to make submissions on the Bill to the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee of Parliament. Submissions to this Committee had to be lodged by 27 September so that the Committee could conduct hearings during the months of September and October 1985. As planned, the legislation was passed before Christmas; thus allowing registration to commence early in 1986 as planned.

### Broad Principles of GST

GST is a broadly based consumption tax. Its objective is to levy a tax on total consumption expenditure in New Zealand. To keep the administration of the tax as simple as possible it will be charged at a single rate - 10% - and will apply, with very few exceptions to all goods and services supplied in New Zealand. Exported goods and services will be taxable but at a rate of zero percent. GST will also be imposed at a rate of 10 percent on goods imported into New Zealand.

Only persons who conduct a "taxable activity" and are required to (or who opt to) register for GST purposes will be liable to charge and account for GST. The term "taxable activity" is defined in section 6 of the Act and is explained in Section II of this commentary. Registration is covered in Part VIII of the Act and is explained in Section III of this commentary.

It is not intended, nor is it the effect, that GST be a tax on business profits or turnover. GST is ultimately a tax on consumption and in reality is paid by the end-user. The tax is, however, "collected" along the way by "registered persons" and "returned" at regular intervals either to the Inland Revenue Department or the Customs Department.

The GST is charged at each stage of the production and distribution chain but each registered person in that chain who is charged GST by a "supplier" can deduct that GST (**"input"** tax) from the tax that they themselves collect from their customers. This method of returning only a net figure to the Department after deduction of **"inputs"** is called a "Credit Offset" system and has been referred to often in earlier publicity material.

Other main features of the operation of the GST are:

*   Any person who makes supplies of goods or services (in the course of taxable activity) that exceed $24,000 per annum is required to register, and charge and account for GST; Any person who makes such supplies less than $24,000 has the OPTION to register. Once they register, they too must charge and account for GST.
*   A "return" accounting for GST charged or collected, together with cheque for the net amount of GST payable must be forwarded to the Inland Revenue Department at regular intervals. The length of the return period will depend on the nature of the taxable activity carried on by the person. There are three return period lengths:
    1.  One month;
    2.  Two months; or
    3.  Six months for certain categories of registered person.
*   Registered persons whose total supplies of goods or services (in the course of a taxable activity) are not in excess of $250,000 per annum (excluding GST) may account for tax on a "payments" (cash) basis rather than an "invoice" (accruals) basis. The difference between these two methods will be explained in more detail in Section IV.

### Public Education Programme

This Bulletin explains the Department's interpretation of the Act in technical terms. However, the Department will conduct a comprehensive public education programmes up to and following the introduction of the tax on 1 October 1986.

At present, apart from this Bulletin, these plans include:

*   Departmental involvement in seminar programmes organised by the Society of Accountants, Retailers Federation and similar bodies between March and August.
*   an intensive programme of registration of taxpayers commencing in March. Information on eligibility to register will be sent to all prospective registered persons.
*   a guide to GST will be sent to all registered persons explaining the important procedures (especially how to complete a GST return) in everyday language.
*   radio, TV and print media advertising.
*   specialised information packages aimed at, for instance, non-profit bodies and persons making partial exempt supplies.
*   visits by District GST Officers to registered persons who require some more detailed advice on the tax.

Persons requiring further advice on GST, or assistance in organising GST training, should contact their nearest Inland Revenue District Office.

Section II - Operation of GST
-----------------------------

### Definitions

Sections 2 to 6 of the GST Act cover "definitions":

*   **Section 2** is the general interpretation section and defines the majority of the terms used throughout the Act.
*   **Section 3** defines the term "financial services".
*   **Section 4** defines the term "open market value".
*   **Section 5** defines the term "supply".
*   **Section 6** defines the term "taxable activity".

### Section 2: General Definitions

The more significant defined terms are -

### "Registered Person"

This is the term which denotes who must charge and collect tax, make returns and pay tax to the Department. It is equivalent to "taxpayer" in the Income Tax Act 1976. It means any person who is registered or is liable to be registered under the Act.

### "Taxable Supply"

This is any supply of goods or services made by a "registered person" in the course of a "taxable activity". It does not include an **exempt** supply. The term includes **zero-rated** supplies. GST is charged **ONLY** on taxable supplies.

### "Goods"

The term "goods" includes all types of personal and real property. It is much broader in scope than the normal meaning of "goods". It does not however, include "choses in action" (such as copyrights, debts and insurance policies) which are included within the definition of SERVICES, nor does it include money. (See "Services" below)

### "Services"

This term covers almost everything which is not "GOODS". It does not however include money within its scope. Together with "goods", the term embraces all things capable of being supplied for a consideration with the exception of money itself.

**NOTE:** The Act uses the term "currency" in Section 3 instead of "money" to avoid confusion with the term "money" used in Section 2 (which has a different purpose).

### "Consideration"

This has been defined widely to include all amounts paid, or any act or forbearance, in respect of supplies of goods and services, whether made voluntarily or not. The term includes all Government charges, rates, and all contractual payments. The term is intentionally wider than its strict contractual meaning.

"Consideration" also covers many Government grants and subsidies which are provided for the supply of goods and services, or where the supply is induced by the grant or subsidy. It also covers "payment in kind", barter, "trade-off" of debts and similar arrangements.

### "Input Tax"

This means,

*   Any tax charged on those goods and services that a registered person purchases or acquires for the principal purpose of carrying out a taxable activity.
*   Any tax paid on goods imported by that registered person.
*   An amount of tax calculated by applying the "tax fraction" to a non-taxable supply of secondhand goods made to a registered person (ie a supply made by a non-registered person).

In all cases the goods or services must be acquired by the purchaser for THE PRINCIPAL PURPOSE of making taxable supplies. Adjustments will be required where the Goods and Services are to be used for both taxable and other uses. These are explained on pages 61, 65 and 87.

### "Output Tax"

This is the tax charged by a registered person on any supply of goods and services made by that person (ie a supply made in the course of carrying on a taxable activity). When the periodic return is completed the total input tax for the period is deducted from the Output Tax for that period and the difference is the tax due to be paid to the Department.

### "Tax Fraction"

Is a method of calculating the total GST charged over a period of time. The calculation is applied to the total "consideration" (for taxable supplies) and works as follows:

Applied to the tax-inclusive price of most goods or services, this fraction will give the amount of tax included in that price. It should be noted, however, that there are a number of situations where the tax fraction **CANNOT** be applied to the total "consideration" because the tax content is not 1/11th of the total amount received for the supply. For example:

*   Hire Purchase: Because the amount received will include interest etc
*   Accommodation in a Hotel after 4 Weeks: Because of the special reduced value for long-term accommodation.
*   Goods or Services which include some Exempt Services: Because only the taxable goods or services are liable to the tax.
*   Supplies to which the transitional provisions apply: Because only some part of the supply. especially where continuous services are performed. is subject to the tax.

Also, when calculating "Input" tax it will not always be possible to take 1/11th of the price paid - for example:

*   Goods Imported: Because the tax is 10% of the CIF value
*   Supplies to Associates: Because the tax is 10% of the Open Market Value as defined in the Act, unless the associate is himself registered.

### "Taxable Period"

This is the period of time covered by a return. This will be either one, two or six months.

### "Tax Payable"

This is the net amount of GST payable by a registered person and is calculated by deducting input tax, and other deductions for adjustments such as GST on importation, bad debts, etc, from output tax. (It will of course, be necessary to add tax adjustments in order to calculate the output tax total.) This amount must be paid to the Inland Revenue Department. The "tax payable" figure is the basis for all assessments, objections, additional tax, penal tax and all recoveries action.

### "Invoice"

This includes any document notifying an obligation to pay. It **may** also be a **"tax invoice"**, but not necessarily.

### "Tax Invoice"

The tax invoice is the documentation required to substantiate claims for a deduction of input tax. It is a central compliance element of the tax. It is explained in more detail in Section IV of this commentary. (Refer also to Section 24 of the Act.) A "tax invoice" **may** be an **"invoice"**, but not necessarily.

### "Non-profit Body"

This term includes charities and most clubs, etc, that operate for a purpose other than that of profit or gain to the members. Goods donated to such a body are exempt from GST when sold by that body. Also certain concessions relating to registration are available. (Refer to Section VI of this commentary.)

### Specific Definitions:

### Section 3: Meaning of Term "Financial Services"

Financial Services are exempt from GST under Section 14 of the Act ("Exempt Supplies"). Exported financial services are, however, zero-rated if they satisfy the criteria detailed in Section 11(2). The concepts of exemption and zero-rating are explained later in Section II of this commentary.

The definition of financial services is very detailed and requires an understanding of terms which have not previously been of direct relevance for income tax purposes. It is not proposed to provide a detailed analysis of all these terms in this commentary because they are of direct relevance to a specialised sector of the community rather than the community at large.

In general, financial services include -

*   the exchange of any currency, eg New Zealand currency for foreign currency, and the changing of notes to coins or vice versa;
*   the payment or collection of a cheque ("cheque" here includes money orders, postal notes and travellers cheques). The "payment" and "collection" are activities undertaken by the organisations who issue those items;
*   the issue of travellers cheques, bank cheques, postal notes, and money orders
*   the issue and transfer of debt, equity, and participatory securities: these include shares in companies, special partnerships and partnerships, debentures, and bills of exchange;
*   underwriting the issue of securities;
*   provision of credit under a credit contract - this includes the credit element in loans, mortgages, overdrafts, hire purchase, credit cards and financial leases;
*   the provision of life insurance, life reinsurance, and superannuation schemes;
*   the provision or assignment of a futures contract;
*   arranging any of the above - this will include lawyers' activities in arranging loans.

### Section 4: Meaning of Term "Open Market Value"

An "Open Market Value" is required primarily to determine the value of certain supplies made for no consideration whatsoever, or for a consideration other than money, or as a result of a special arrangement between associated persons. In general, the open market value of a supply will be the price (excluding GST) which similar goods or services would generally fetch in **similar circumstances**. If this cannot be ascertained, the open market value is the price (excluding GST) which similar goods or services would fetch **regardless of "purchases"**. If an "OMV" is not ascertainable in this way, then the legislation allows the Commissioner to determine the value in a fair and objective manner.

### Section 5: Meaning of Term "Supply"

The broad base of the GST is dependent on very wide definitions of "taxable activity" and, of course, the variety of methods of "supply" in relation to those activities. For this reason, section 5(1) of the Act states that "supply" includes all forms of supply.

A taxable supply is any supply of goods and services made by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. It does not include supplies that are exempt under Section 14. It includes all forms of sale, leasing, bailment and other forms of transfer.

"Supply" has been deemed, for the purpose of GST, to specifically include:

*   the forced sale of goods to satisfy a debt owing by the registered person (Section 5(2));
*   any goods or services held at the time the person ceases to be a registered person AND for which input tax has been claimed (Section 5(3)). The provision does not apply where a liquidator or executor etc takes over the taxable activity;
*   a sale under the Door to Door Sales Act 1967, but only after the "cancellation period" has expired (Section 5(4));
*   a layby sale under the Layby Sales Act 1971, where the goods have been delivered and property has passed. NOTE: A SERVICE will be deemed to have occurred if the layby sale is cancelled and the seller keeps some of the payment to meet selling costs, or recovers selling costs from the buyer (Section 5(5));
*   a payment by the Government to a public authority, for example a Government Department, (Section 5(6)) (ie Expenditure Vote appropriation);
*   the provision of goods and services represented by the payment of rates (Section 5(7));
*   the placing of a bet (Section 5(8));
*   the purchase of a lottery ticket (Section 5(10));
*   the sale of a taxable activity as a going concern (Section 5(12));
*   an insurance payout received relating to a loss incurred in the course of making taxable supplies (Section 5(13)).
*   certain supplies to employees; section 21 ensures the imposition of GST in circumstances where goods and services are taken for private use or are supplied to employees free of cost, of at a greatly reduced price. Further details about the application of section 21 are given in Sections IV and VI of this commentary.

### Section 6: Meaning of Term "Taxable activity"

The scope of the term "taxable activity" is intended to be very wide. Whether or not an activity is conducted for profit is irrelevant in determining whether it will constitute a "taxable activity". Of course practical considerations make it impossible and inappropriate to apply tax to all activities (eg one-off transactions, and those made in the course of an activity of a minor nature) and the requirements of the Act reflect this.

The liability to register for GST purposes depends upon whether a person conducts a "taxable activity" or not. This term embraces a wider range of activities than those usually covered by the use of the term "business". This was done to ensure that organisations such as non-profit and governmental bodies would be included in the scope of the tax.

Certain things are **deemed** to be done in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, (eg anything done in connection with the commencement or termination of a taxable activity. and any employment accepted in the course of a taxable activity).

The relevant characteristics of a "taxable activity" are:

*   there must be some form of "activity" - economic or commercial;
*   that activity should be carried on continuously or regularly;
*   the activity should involve (or be intended to involve) the supply, for a consideration, of goods and services to another person.

A "taxable activity" explicitly EXCLUDES:

*   private recreational pursuits or hobbies, since activities carried on for pleasure represent final consumption. The establishment of guidelines in this area may in some cases present difficulties, but the test may be based on the commercial character of the activity - eg whether or not it is for the private pleasure of the person. as opposed to being for the making of supplies for a consideration.
*   occupation as an employee, under a master/servant relationship. While salaried or waged employees will not be conducting taxable activities in respect of their employment. a special provision relates to professionals who accept office with an employer AS PART OF their professional activities. Any remuneration from such an office will be subject to tax.
*   the making of exempt supplies. For instance a business that undertakes both financial services and operates a travel agency is only a taxable activity (and can only claim a deduction for input tax) to the extent of the travel business.
*   the directorship of a company. Directors will be treated as employees, and need not register UNLESS the Directorship is carried on as part of a wider taxable activity.
*   the Governor-General and others on the Civil List, Judges, Ombudsmen, the Solicitor-General, the Auditor-General, or the Chairman or members of local authorities, statutory boards or other bodies.

### Imposition of GST (Section 8(1))

GST will be levied at the rate of 10 percent on the value of goods and services supplied in New Zealand on or after the 1st of October 1986 by a registered person in the course of conducting a taxable activity. It will also be levied on goods imported into New Zealand on or after that date by any person. The GST on imports will be collected by the Customs Department at importation, but otherwise GST will be paid to the Inland Revenue Department.

In order to be subject to GST, all the following conditions must be satisfied in relation to any one supply:

*   there must be a **good or service** involved;
*   that good or service must be **supplied**;
*   it must not be an **exempt supply**;
*   the **place of supply** must be in New Zealand;
*   the **time of supply** must be on or after 1 October 1986;
*   the supplier must be a **registered person**;
*   the supply must be made in the course or furtherance of a **taxable activity** carried on by the supplier.

If the above criteria are satisfied, the tax imposed on that supply will be 10 percent of the value determined under Section 10 of the Act. Tax will, however, be imposed at "zero" percent if the supplies are covered by the provisions of Section 11 of the Act which in the main deal with exported goods and services.

The imposition of GST on imported goods or services is dealt with separately and is covered by Sections 12 and 13 of the Act (See page 16 of this commentary).

### Place of Supply (Section 8(2))

For goods and services to be subject to GST, their supply has to take place, or be deemed to take place in New Zealand.

The GST Act determines the place of supply of both goods and services primarily by reference to whether or not the supplier is resident in New Zealand. In addition, certain goods and services are deemed to be supplied in New Zealand even though the supplier is not resident in New Zealand. Under section 8(2). a supply is deemed to take place in New Zealand: -

*   If the supplier is **resident** in New Zealand, regardless of where the goods are situated or the services performed (if this is outside New Zealand the supply is zero-rated under section 11); or
*   If the supplier is **non-resident** in New Zealand, but the goods are in New Zealand at the time of supply.
*   If the supplier is **resident** in New Zealand, but the services are physically performed in New Zealand.

**NOTE:**

1.  In the case of a supply between to a registered person by a supplier who is a non-resident, the supply is deemed to take place OUTSIDE New Zealand unless both parties agree otherwise.
2.  See Section 2 of the Act for the definition of "resident". The definition in section 241 of the Income Tax Act has been extended to all persons who carry on any taxable or non-taxable activity from a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand.

### Time of Supply (Section 9)

The time of supply rules contained in Section 9 are used to determine the return period in which the supply should be brought to account (although this may vary for persons on the payments basis). These rules apply in all circumstances except where the "transitional" provisions of Section 85 also apply (See pages 77 of this commentary):

**The general rule** is that the time of supply will be determined as being the earlier of:

*   the time an invoice is issued; or
*   the time any payment is received by the supplier.

### (Section 9(1))

The application of the general rule and following special rules are dealt with in more detail in the context of completing returns, from page 30 below.

**Special rules** apply in a number of circumstances. These circumstances are as follows:

### Associated persons - (as defined in section 67 of the Income Tax Act 1976) (Section 9(2)(a))

*   where the **goods are to be removed**, the time of supply will be the **time of removal**;
*   where the **goods are not being removed**, it will be the **time they are made available**;
*   in respect of **services**, the time of supply will be the **time services are performed**.

*   It is important to note that if payment is made or an invoice issued for a supply to an "associated person" BEFORE a return is due for that period to which the payment of invoice relates, then the time of supply is determined under the "general" rule as above rather than the "special" rule.

### Door to Door Sales (Section 9(2)(b))

*   the time of supply will be the **first day after** the recipient's **right to cancel** the agreement has expired. (This cancellation period can vary, but is usually 7 days);

### Layby Sales (Section 9(2)(c))

*   The time of supply will be the **time at which property in the goods passes to the recipient** (ie when the goods are eventually delivered or uplifted).
*   Where a layby sale is cancelled, and the seller retains or recovers any money, that money is deemed to be a supply of "services" (section 5(5) proviso). The time of supply of that "service" is **the date of cancellation of the sale**;

### Placing of a bet (Section 9(2)(d))

*   The time of supply will be **the time the bet is dealt with in terms of the Racing Act 1971** (which is the time the bets are totalled and deductions made);

### Lotteries and other Prize Competitions (Section 9(2)(e))

*   the time of supply will be **the date on which the first drawing of the lottery or prize is made**

### Amusement parlour machines meters, etc - (Section 9(2)(f))

*   the time of supply for coin or token operated machines, meters or other devices will be **the date that the coins are emptied from the machine by, or on behalf of the supplier**

### Hire Agreements - (Section 9(3)(a) & (c))

*   for goods supplied under a hire agreement (including leases and rental but **other than** a hire purchase agreement) or for services which are supplied under any agreement providing for periodic payments, there is **deemed to be a separate supply when each periodic payment is due**, and the **time of supply is te earlier of that due date or the actual date of receipt of payments**;

### Hire purchase - (Section 9(3)(b)).

*   the time of supply is **when the hire purchase agreement is entered into**.

### Retention Payments - (Section 9(4))

*   for contracts providing for the retention of part of the contract price pending satisfactory performance of the contract, the **time of supply for the retained sum is the date upon which payment of that sum is made**;

### Contracts providing for Variation of Work (Section 9(5))

for those contracts for building of civil engineering work which provide for a variation in the contracted work (ie "new" work) **the time of supply of the new work is whenever and only to the extent that payment is made for that new work.**

**NOTE:** This provision recognises a situation that occurs frequently in the building and civil engineering sectors.

### Consideration not determined at time of removal - (Section 9(6))

for goods supplied where part or all of the consideration (eg selling price) is not determined at the time the goods are taken, **the supply occurs only to the extent of, and at the time that, payment is due or is received or an invoice is issued, whichever is the earlier**. This provision will apply to "pool marketing schemes", such as those operated by the New Zealand Meat Producers Board and New Zealand Milk Board.

### Goods or Services put to a "Non Taxable" Use (Section 21(2))

Under Section 21(1) of the Act, a supply is deemed to be made where certain goods or services are applied for private of exempt use. The time of that deemed supply is **the time that the goods or services are put to the non-taxable use.**

### Value of Supply (Section 10)

The "value" of taxable supplies is the amount paid for the supply, **exclusive of GST**. Likewise the "open market value" is **tax exclusive**.

The "consideration" for a supply is **tax inclusive**.

For most supplies, the "consideration" will be represented by the **amount of money passing**in the transaction (eg, an item purchased for $10 from a retailer). There are, however, special rules to determine the "value" or "consideration" for certain categories of supplies, for example:

Where goods and services are deemed to be **supplied (under section 21(3)) to employees**, the "consideration" will be the same as the value for "Fringe Benefit Tax" purposes (Section 10(7)).

Where goods and services have been **taken for the private or exempt use** of the registered person, the "value" of the supply is deemed to be the lesser of:

1.  the cost to the supplier, exclusive of GST; or
2.  the open market value of that supply (also excludes GST)

### (section 10(8)).

Where a **"service"** is deemed to take place as a result of the **cancellation of layby sale** (See "Time of Supply" rules above), the "consideration" is deemed to be the full amount retained or recovered (section 10(9));

*   For credit contracts (eg a hire purchase agreement) - the "consideration" for the supply will be the **cash price** disclosed in the credit contract (section 10(5)); (ie, exclusive of interest and other charges);
*   The value of the supply of accommodation in hotels, rest homes, hospitals, etc, **for stays exceeding four weeks**, will be the amount of the room charge that relates to goods and services **other** than domestic goods and services (as defined in section 2 of the Act). In all cases, however, this amount will be deemed to be AT LEAST 20% of the price of the accommodation. This provision recognises that long-stay occupants should not be disadvantaged compared to other people who rent or lease their domestic accommodation;
*   For stays of **no more than** four weeks and for the first four weeks of **any** longer stay, the "value" of the supply will be the full price paid for the accommodation; (Section 10(6).)
*   For lottery tickets, etc, the "consideration" for the supply will be deemed to be the **total ticket proceeds less the amount paid out or payable as cash prizes** (section 10(14));
*   For vouchers, stamps, etc, where a monetary value **is stated** on the voucher
    *   the amount of any premium **over and above** the stated monetary value is taxed **as a tax inclusive charge** when the voucher is purchased;
    *   the balance is regarded as **tax inclusive price** when the voucher is **redeemed** (Section 10(16)).
*   Where monetary value **is not stated** on the voucher (eg milk tokens), the purchase price will be subject to tax only when the voucher, token, etc, is **purchased**. This treatment will also apply to postage stamps. The value of **the supply** when these tokens, postage stamps etc are **used** is deemed to be nil. (Section 10(17));
*   If one consideration (payment) relates to both a taxable supply and something else (eg an exempt supply), the consideration must be apportioned between the two elements to arrive at the output tax on the taxable part of the supply (Section 10(18)). An arbitrary, pro rata apportionment will generally be the only basis available.

### Zero Rating (Section 11)

Where a supply of goods is liable to GST but at a rate of zero percent (ie zero-rated) the supplier pays no output tax but is able to deduct all input tax relating to the making of such supplies.

The Act explicitly zero-rates both exported goods and certain "exported services" to ensure that no GST will enter into the costs of either to the overseas purchaser. Because all goods supplied by a supplier who is resident in New Zealand are deemed to be supplied in New Zealand (and hence subject to GST) it has been necessary to zero-rate exported goods and services, and also goods that are not situated in New Zealand at the time of supply. Zero-rating now covers almost all identifiable exported services or goods.

### Goods

In relation to a supply of GOODS, zero-rating applies to the following:

*   goods exported under the Customs Act 1966 - section 11(1)(a);
*   goods not in New Zealand at the time of supply - section 11(1)(b);
*   the supply of a taxable activity as a going concern - section 11(1)(e).

Zero-rating will not apply to exported second-hand goods for which an input tax credit has been allowed ("Proviso" to section 11(1)).

### Services

In relation to a supply of SERVICES, zero-rating applies to the following:

*   the transporting, and the arranging of that transport, of passengers or goods into or out of New Zealand - section 11(2)(a);
*   services physically performed outside New Zealand - section 11(2)(d);
*   services directly connected with moveable property outside New Zealand
*   services directly connected with goods referred to in s 47(2) or s 181 of the Customs Act 1966 - For example:
    1.  repairs performed in New Zealand to international aircraft that are temporarily imported into New Zealand;
    2.  Livestock and Bloodstock temporarily imported into New Zealand (Section 11(2)(c)).
*   services performed in connection with land situated outside New Zealand - (section 11(2)(b));
*   services supplied for and to a person not resident in New Zealand and who is outside New Zealand when the services are performed - (section 11(2)(e));
*   the filing, granting, assignment transfer etc of intellectual property rights (eg copyrights or the like), for use outside New Zealand - (section 11(2)(f));
*   services that are an agreement to refrain from conducting a taxable activity outside New Zealand - (section 11(2)(g)).

### Exemptions (Section 14)

No tax is charged on exempt supplies and no credit is allowed for input tax in respect of the making of those supplies. This is because the definition "input tax" in section 2 requires that goods or services are acquired for the principal purpose of **making taxable supplied**.

The following supplies are exempt from tax under Section 14

*   **Financial services** (other than those which are zero-rated); (Section 14(a)). The definition of financial services is contained on page 17.
*   **Donated** goods supplied **by** any non-profit body. Since tax has most likely been incurred when the goods were purchased by the donor, it inappropriate to tax the donated or gifted goods again when sold by the non-profit body in the course of a **non-profit** taxable activity. (eg cake stalls, opportunity shops etc). (Section 14(b).)
*   **Rental accomodation**: The supply of rental accommodation (ie domestic accommodation) is exempt. and the landlords of such dwellings may not claim any "input tax" back in respect of any costs. eg, maintenance, rates, capital costs etc. The rental of buildings which are not dwellings, ie shops, factories etc are NOT exempt. Short stay accommodation in hotels, motels and hospitals etc will be taxed in full (see special valuation rules in section 10 of the Act - see also notes on "Value of Supply" in Section II of this commentary and page 47 below).
*   **The sale of certain rental dwellings**. Dwellings used for residential rental for five or more years and used solely for that purpose in that time will be exempt if sold by a registered person. For example the Housing Corporation may **regularly** sell off excess rental stock and thus, in terms of the Act, be carrying on the a taxable activity of supplying dwellings. Section 14 of the Act exempts such transactions, thus removing any inequity that might otherwise occur where rental property sales are subjected to output tax but no input tax deduction has been allowed (Section 14(d));

Provision is made for apportionment of output tax on supplies which are partly taxable and partly exempt. (section 10(18)).

### "Imported Goods" and Goods Sold "In Bond" (Clauses 12 and 13)

The general scheme of the GST contemplates the tax applying to all supplies of goods and services made in **New Zealand** by registered persons. It is also necessary to apply the tax to all goods imported to New Zealand as well as to all goods (mainly alcoholic beverages) supplied at "in bond" prices, ie supplied prior to excise duty being paid.

Both the tax on imported goods and the tax on the duty payable on goods cleared from bond will be collected by the Customs Department. This tax, levied under Sections 12 and 13 of the Act, will be levied, collected and paid as if it: were Customs Duty so the relevant provisions of the Customs Act 1966 will apply to the recovery of GST on imported foods. For this reason, any concessions applicable to "passengers baggage" and "personal effects" will likewise apply to GST.

### Imported Goods

The GST will be imposed at the time that the goods are "entered or delivered" for home consumption ie cleared from Customs Control. The term "home consumption" is peculiar to the Customs Act and bears no relation to the actual USE of the goods.

The person importing the goods will be liable to pay the GST to Customs following similar procedures as used to pay customs duty.

The tax will be levied at 10 percent on the value of the imported goods as specified in section 12(2) of the Act. That value will be equal to **the sum of**:

1.  the value for **duty** purposes (whether or not Customs duty is payable) as determined under the Customs Act 1966; AND
2.  the amounts of customs duty and sales taxes, etc payable and levied under any of the Customs Acts; AND
3.  insurance and freight costs in bringing the foods to New Zealand not already included under (i) above); AND
4.  any fees or levies payable at the time of importation.

### Goods sold "in bond":

Importers, manufacturers and other traders operate a network of bonded warehouses in which foods subject to customs duty and sales taxes may be held, **under customs control**, without the imposition of the duty and/or taxes. On customs clearance from these controlled areas, the owner of the foods is required to pay any Customs duties and taxes applicable. These warehouses hold both imported goods and goods manufactured in New Zealand. The advantage of the Bonded Warehouse is that payment of substantial amounts of revenue is usually deferred until such time as the importer sells the goods. For example, bulk importation or production of alcoholic spirit in drums or barrels and the subsequent bottling of those spirits for sale and distribution.

The ownership of foods manufactured in New Zealand may pass while the goods are still held under bond (such supplies being subject to GST). The supply being charged with tax will NOT include the excise duty because that duty is **not levied until the time of clearance from cusotms control** (ie entered or delivered for home consumption).

Section 13 of the Act provides that the "new" owner pays the GST on the "excise duty" content of the goods when they are removed from bond.

Any questions on the detailed Customs provisions and procedures that relate to the imposition of GST on imported foods or goods sold in bond should be referred to the Customs Department.

Section III - Registration
--------------------------

### General Criteria (Section 51)

The GST Act provides that while anyone who carries on a taxable activity may register, the only persons who MUST register are those -

*   who have made sales in any period of 12 months of a tax-exclusive value in excess of $24,000;
*   who can reasonably estimate that they will make supplies in excess of $24,000 in the next 12 months.

A person is NOT required to be registered if it can be shown that the value of supplies in the **following 12 months** will not exceed $24,000.

Where that turnover figure is exceeded for certain exceptional reasons, the person can be relieved from the requirement to register. Those circumstances are:

*   where a scaling down, or cessation of business has resulted in extra sales of stock or plant;
*   where a capital item has been sold and replaced. (Section 51(1).)

The Governor General may, by Order-in-Council, **increase** the $24,000 threshold.

Any person becoming liable to be registered must notify the Department within 21 days of that event. A person may apply for registration in ANTICIPATION of commencing a taxable activity. (Sections 51(2) and (3).)

The Commissioner will determine whether the person is eligible to register, and registration will normally be effective from the date the person FIRST BECAME LIABLE to register. (section 51(4).)

### Non-Profit Bodies (Section 51(5))

Section 51(5) allows non-profit bodies (as defined in section 2) to treat each branch of division of the body **separately** when applying the registration criteria. Thus, a branch or division need not register if it makes a total supply (in terms of section 51(1)) below the $24,000 threshold.

**NOTE:**

1.  This concession is limited to non-profit bodies only and does NOT apply to branches and divisions of other organisations.
2.  The specific circumstances of the concession are dealt with in Section VI of this commentary under the heading **non-profit bodies**.

### Cancellation of Registration (Section 52)

Registration may be cancelled where the Commissioner is satisfied that the level of taxable supplies in the next 12 month period will fall below the registration "threshold" amount. The person must also have been registered for at least **the previous** 2 years. (Section 52(1).)

If a person ceases to carry on ALL taxable activities, the Commissioner must be notified of that fact within 21 days and their registration will be cancelled. If, however, there are reasonable grounds for believing that ANY activity will be carried on within the following 12 months, the registration will not be cancelled. (Section 52(3).)

**NOTE:** A registered person may have more than one taxable activity but they are treated for GST purposes as the one activity.

### Change in Status (Section 53)

Registered persons must notify the Department of any significant change in their status, eg changes in:

*   name, address, principal taxable activity;
*   principal address from which the taxable activity is carried on;
*   changes affecting eligibility to use the 6 month "return" period;
*   eligibility to be a member of a group of companies.
*   changes affecting accounting basis for GST (ie, payment or invoice basis).

### Special Cases (Sections 55-58 - Part IX of the Act)

There are a number of specific rules in relation to:

*   Groups of companies;
*   Branches and divisions of companies;
*   Partnerships, joint ventures and co-trustees.

### Groups of companies (Section 55)

Where a number of companies constitute a "group" in terms of section 191 of the Income Tax Act 1976, that group can elect to group for GST purposes.

One member of the group will be the "representative member" and will be responsible for accounting for GST for ALL the members of the group. ALL members of the group MUST adopt the same "return period" and the same basis for accounting for GST. (Sections 55(7)(b)).

The individual members are thus not liable to make returns and account for the tax, but they must still issue tax invoices (when requested by recipients outside the group), keep records and register. Taxable supplies made **between members of the group** have the option of being charged with tax or disregarded for GST purposes. (Section 55(7)(c).)

Persons other than companies may "group" under the provisions of section 55 provided that some form of common control exists. (Section 55(8).)

### Branches and divisions (Section 56)

Any registered person carrying on a taxable activity through branches which -

*   maintain their own accounting systems; and
*   are located in different places or carry out different activities,

can register one or more of those branches independently. Each branch, when registered, is to be regarded as no longer being part of the parent body for GST purposes (ie, it is a separate registered person), but:

*   it must retain the same taxable period;
*   it must retain the same accounting basis;
*   it must remain registered so long as the parent body is registered.

The separate registration can be cancelled on application by the registered person, but the parent body remains ultimately liable for tax if the branch or division defaults on its obligations.

This provision cannot be used by a business to "split" its activities in an attempt to qualify for any concessions relative to the "registration" or "return period" thresholds.

### Partnerships, joint ventures, and trustees of a trust (Section 57)

The individual members of such "unincorporated bodies" are NOT liable to be individually registered; also, their taxable supplies are deemed to be made by the body itself, not by individual members.

The members of the body do, however, remain individually liable for the tax in the case of a default that occurs while they are a member. They are also individually liable to do all things required to be done under the Act. The term "body" is used in section 57 to cover all types of unincorporated bodies. Registration must be in the name of the body, and changes in membership generally have no effect on the body's registration (even though in law a new partnership comes into existence every time there is a change in membership).

In respect of UNINCORPORATED associations (other than partnerships, joint ventures or trusts) it is the responsibility of the president, chairman, treasurer or committee members to carry out any duties imposed under the Act. (See also the commentary on section 63 regarding the obligations of Officers and Employees of Corporate Bodies, on page 76. )

### Personal representative liquidator, receiver, etc (Section 58)

In the situation of bankruptcy, incapacitation, or the death of a registered person, the Commissioner may deem any person who is, in the meantime, carrying on that taxable activity to be a registered person. Furthermore, a mortgagee who subsequently takes possession of a mortgagors property is deemed to be a registered person in any case where that mortgagee carries on the taxable activity of the mortgagor.

**SECTIONS 59 AND 60 OF THE ACT** (agents) are dealt with in Section VI of this commentary on page 80.

Form GST 1 - Goods and Services Tax Application for Registration has not been reproduced.

### Section IV - Returns, Accounting Basis, Tax Invoice Calculation and Payment of Tax

### Introduction

In this Section, the requirements of the Act in respect of the furnishing of GST returns, the ways in which the tax is accounted for and the calculation of tax payable will be outlined.

### GST Tax Returns (Section 15)

The return periods of one, two and six months are specified in section 15 of the Act. On the registration of any person, a return "category" will be allocated to that person in order that the inflow of returns to the Department will be evenly spread, thus reducing bottlenecks, etc, in the processing procedures.

### Two Month Return Period (Section 15(1))

The two categories for the two month return period are Category A and Category B. Registered persons included in Category A will account for GST over return periods of two months that end on the last day of the months of January, March, May, July, September and November. For Category B, the taxable periods will span the two months ending with the last day of the months of February, April, June, August, October and December.

Provision has been made in section 15(1)(d) of the Act for persons in Category A or Category B to apply to the Commissioner to change the end of their return period from the last day of the month to a last day of up to 7 days either side of the last day of the month. This will enable most businesses to adopt taxable periods ending with the same date as their internal accounting close-off dates.

### Alternative Return Periods

Smaller businesses and those who expect to regularly receive refunds of tax may find a two month return period unsuitable. For this reason return periods of one month or six months can be adopted (in certain circumstances).

### Month Return Period (Section 15(2))

Registered persons whose total of taxable supplies (excluding GST) in the previous 12 months has not exceeded $250,000 or whose total of taxable supplies for the succeeding 12 months is not likely to exceed $250,000, may apply to the Commissioner for a six-monthly return period. These persons will be in Category C. The Commissioner will nominate periods of six months in respect of which returns are to be furnished so that the flow of returns from persons in this Category is likewise spread evenly over the full year.

### One Month Return Period (Section 15(3))

Many taxpayers are likely to be in a continuing, or at least regular, "refund" situation (eg, exporters). Even a two-month return period could create a cash-flow disadvantage for such people. For this reason any registered person may apply to the Department to be allocated a one-month return period (Category D).

### Change of Categories (Section 15(4))

Registered persons who are allocated Category C may change that Category to Category A, B or D upon written application to the Department. If the qualifying criteria cannot be met for any twelve month period in respect of Category C then that person also must notify the Department of the change and a two month return Category (or one month if requested) will be allocated. Any change in category will apply with effect from the end of the taxable period during which the change is approved.

### Lodgement of GST Returns (Section 16)

Returns for each taxable period are to be furnished to the Inland Revenue Department no later than the first day of the second month following the last day of the taxable period. For example, for a person in Category A, the last date for furnishing a return for the taxable period 1 December 1986 to 31 January 1987 will be 1 March 1987.

The last date for furnishing a return for any taxable period ending on a day up to 7 days either side of the end of the month (under section 15(1)(d)) will be the first day of the second month following the last day of the base taxable period.

Section 17 provides for special returns to be lodged where a supply takes place as a result of a forced sale in satisfaction of a debt. Section 18 allows the Commissioner to request a non-registered person to submit a return for the purposes of administering the GST.

### Accounting Basis for GST (Section 19)

The GST Act provides for two bases of accounting for GST - the **invoice basis** and the PAYMENTS BASIS (section 19). **THE CHOICE BETWEEN THESE BASES DETERMINES IN WHICH TAXABLE PERIOD "OUTPUT" TAX AND "INPUT" TAX IS BROUGHT TO ACCOUNT**. The **general** rule (set out in section 19(1) of the Act) is that all persons should account for tax payable on an "invoice" basis. A registered person may, however, apply to adopt a "payments" basis in some circumstances. These situations are discussed below.

### Selection of Accounting Basis (Section 19(2))

The "general" rule is that all persons shall account for tax payable on an invoice basis. A payments basis can only be adopted with the approval of the Commissioner. The payments basis is available to:

1.  Public Authorities, Local Authorities and non-profit bodies; and
2.  Registered persons whose taxable supplies over the past 12 months have not exceeded $250,000 or whose supplies for the succeeding 12 months are not likely to exceed $250,000 (both amounts exclude GST); and
3.  Any registered person where the Commissioner is satisfied that, due to the nature. volume, or value of taxable supplies made by that registered person and the nature of the accounting system employed by that person, it would be appropriate for that person to adopt a payments basis.

Any such person MAY adopt a payments basis from registration or from the first taxable period after which the approval to adopt a payments basis is given.

Where a person qualified for a "payments" basis on the above criteria then later ceases to meet the criteria, that person must notify the Department of that fact; the person must then adopt an invoice basis from the next taxable period (section 19(3)).

### Taxable period for "Invoice" basis

As outlined earlier, (see commentary on page 11), a supply is generally considered to take place at the EARLIER of the date upon which an invoice is issued of the date on which any payment is received. For a person who is required to account for tax payable on an "invoice basis", both "input" tax and "output" tax are accounted for in the taxable period during which THE SUPPLIES OCCURRED. (Section 20(4)(a)(i) for output tax and section 20(3)(a) for input tax.)

In the case of tax paid to the Customs Department (on imports or goods removed from bond) the tax is deducted in the taxable period during which the PAYMENT IS MADE TO THE CUSTOMS DEPARTMENT (section 20(3)(a)(ii)).

### Taxable Period for "Payments" basis

For registered persons entitled to use the "payments basis", if the supply is one that is deemed to occur at the earlier of invoicing or payment, the person only accounts for the output or input tax on that supply TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH PAYMENT HAS BEEN RECEIVED OR MADE in respect of that supply in that taxable period (section 20(3)(b)(i) and 20(4)(b)(ii)). Where that supply is given a specific time of supply rule under section 9, the person accounts for all the output tax or input tax on that supply in the period in which **the supply has been deemed to occur**. (Section 20(3)(b)(ii) and section 20(4)(b)(ii).)

### Change in Accounting Basis (Section 19(4) to 19(10))

A person may, on application in writing, change the method of accounting for GST from a "payments" basis to an "invoice" basis and vice versa. To ensure that the correct amount of GST is collected, appropriate adjustments will need to be made at the time of change.

Section 19(4) requires that any person who changes the basis of accounting for GST must furnish a schedule of certain particulars (which will allow the calculation of the amount of tax payable/refundable as a result of the change). This schedule is to be furnished to the Department on of before the due date for furnishing the last return under the "old" basis of accounting (section 19(5)). ie the first day of the second month following the last day of the taxable period in which approval for the change was given. Any tax payable/refundable as a result of the change will be included as an adjustment in your last return on the old accounting basis (explained on page 67 of this commentary).

### Tax Invoices (Section 24)

Section 24 of the Act sets out the requirements relating to "tax invoices". It must be remembered that a **"tax invoice" is** not necessarily the same as an invoice referred to in the previous parts of this Section. An "invoice" (for the purposes of attributing a time of supply) is a document notifying an obligation to make payment for a supply. A "tax invoice" is a document that contains **certain particulars** of a supply as required by section 24 and, in essence, constitutes the evidence required for a credit of input tax. Although a document may be both an "invoice" and a "tax invoice" it is not necessary for each invoice issued by a firm to be a tax invoice.

A tax invoice MUST be held in relation to a supply before the tax on that supply can be deducted as "input" tax.

Each registered person who supplies goods or services to another registered person must issue a "tax invoice" if requested to do so by that other registered person. The supplier has 28 days from the date of the request to provide the recipient with a tax invoice. Failure to do so within that time is an offence (sections 24(1) and 62(1)(1)).

The Act requires that for most supplies the following particulars be shown on a tax invoice: (Section 24(3)).

1.  The words "tax invoice" in a prominent place;
2.  The name, address, and registration number of the supplier;
3.  The name and address of the recipient;
4.  An individual serialised number and the date upon which the tax invoice is issued;
5.  A description of the goods and services supplied;
6.  The quantity or volume of the goods and services supplied;
7.  Either
    1.  The consideration, excluding tax, for the supply, The total amount of tax charged, and The tax inclusive consideration for the supply; or
    2.  Where the amount of tax charged is the tax fraction of the consideration. that consideration and a statement that it includes GST must be shown.

Only one "tax invoice" can be issued in respect of each supply and that each such invoice has to be clearly identified as a "tax invoice" by displaying the term "TAX INVOICE" in a prominent place.

### Supplies up to $20 (Section 24(5))

Very small purchases such as parking meter charges, newspapers and bus fares are situations where the issue of a tax invoice is, for all practical purposes, not possible. For this reason no tax invoice is required if the consideration for the supply is up to $20. Registered persons may still deduct the "input" tax that is included in such purchases up to $20 even though a tax invoice is not held. Such a deduction can only be made, of course, if the supplier is a registered person. It is. therefore, the responsibility of the person making the deduction to ensure that tax is charged on the supply for which the deduction is claimed. To substantiate a claim for this input tax some record of the nature of supply, the date of the supply and the consideration for the supply should be retained by the person making the deduction; eg a cash book, petty cash book, etc.

### Supplies up to $100 (Section 24(4))

Supplies for a consideration of up to $100 need not be supported by a full tax invoice and a simplified tax invoice is acceptable.

Accordingly, this simplified tax invoice need only show the following particulars:

1.  The words "tax invoice" in a prominent place:
2.  The name and registration number of the supplier:
3.  The date upon which the tax invoice is issued:
4.  A description of the goods and services supplied:
5.  The consideration for the supply and a statement that it includes a charge in respect of tax.

### Multiple Supplies

It is intended that a tax invoice may contain details of more than one supply. This provision, together with the authority (under section 60) of a selling agent to issue tax invoices in his own name as if the supply was made by him, will enable agents and auctioneers to provide tax invoices that cover multiple supplies made by different principals to one recipient.

### Special Cases where Tax Invoices Not Necessary (Section 24(6))

Many transactions take place in circumstances where no invoice is normally issued. The automatic bank deduction of rental payments is one example where there is an alternative way of establishing that a transaction took place, a tax invoice MAY not be required.

Section 24(6) gives the Commissioner the discretion to determine that some particulars need not be shown on a tax invoice or that a tax invoice not be required at all. The Commissioner will exercise this discretion where there are, or will be, alternative records available to establish the particulars of the supply of class of supplies.

### Buyer-Created Invoices (Self-Billing) (Section 24(2))

In a number of industries, it is common for the **buyer** to create a document evidencing the circumstances of the sale. An example is where freezing companies or dairy co-operatives produce a sales document for purchases that is regarded as an invoice. Provision is made for these documents to be treated as tax invoices even though they were **not issued by the supplier**.

The Commissioner can grant approval for **a recipient of supply**to issue the tax invoice for that supply. The approval may be made in respect of a recipient or class or classes of recipient or a supply or class of classes of supplies. The approval must be obtained **prior** to such tax invoices being issued. The following further conditions must also be met:

1.  The supplier and the recipient **must agree** that the supplier shall not also issue a tax invoice for the supply; and
2.  Two copies of that tax invoice must be produced, one to be retained by each party.

### Tax Invoice Received After Taxable Period

Section 20(2) provides that no deduction may be made for input tax on a supply if a tax invoice required under section 24 is not held by the recipient.

Section 20(3)(f) provides that a deduction which has been denied, due to the absence of a tax invoice, may be made in a later pe riod if the tax invoice is subsequently obtained.

Refer to page 53 of this commentary for further details.

### Credit and Debit Notes (Section 25)

Section 25 of the Act specifies how credit and debit adjustments are to be made to amounts of GST brought to account in a prior period and are later incorrect as a result of the return of goods sold, discounts or other changes in previously agreed consideration.

A precondition for the application of such adjustments is that a supplier has either:

*   provided a **tax invoice** in relation to a supply and the GST shown thereon is now **incorrect**; or
*   furnished a **return** accounting for an **incorrect** amount of output tax.

The incorrect GST or the incorrect output tax as above is most likely due to:

*   the previously invoiced supply of goods and services not being made; or
*   the previously agreed consideration for the supply of goods and services bein altered, whether due to the offer of a discount or otherwise; or
*   the goods and services or part of those goods and services supplied being returned to the supplier.

### Incorrect Output Tax Accounted For on a Return

Where a supplier has accounted for an incorrect amount of output tax, an adjustment must be made in the return for **the taxable period during which the erro became apparent**. (Section 25(2) see explanation of adjustment on page 51 of this commentary.)

### Incorrect Tax Invoice

Where the amount of GST shown on a tax invoice is found to be incorrect, a credit note or debit note MUST BE issued to the purchaser by the supplier.

### Credit Note (Section 25(3)(a))

Where the GST shown on the tax invoice is **too high** a credit note must be issued to the purchaser. This credit note is similar to a tax invoice and must show the following particulars:

*   the word "credit note" in a prominent place;
*   the name, address, and registration number of the supplier;
*   the name and address of the purchaser;
*   the date on which the credit note was issued;
*   the amount by which the tax charged shown on the tax invoice exceeds the actual tax charged on that supply;
*   the number of the tax invoice and the date on which it was issued;
*   a brief explanation of the circumstances giving rise to the issuing of the credit note.

Section 25(3)(c)(d) and (e) to provide that:

*   only one credit note is issued;
*   any copies issued are marked "copy only";
*   a credit note is **not** required where a recipient takes up a "prompt payment" discount. (This provision applies **not** to prompt payment not to any other form of discount.)

### Discounts for Prompt Payment

If a supply is made on terms which offer a discount for prompt payment, and a tax invoice is **issued prior to the deadline** for taking up the discount, the tax invoice will show the **full sale price** and charge GST accordingly. Where the discount is subsequently taken up, a credit will be given to the purchaser for the amount of the discount, but a credit note for GST purposes will not be required. The adjustment for GST will be made on the appropriate return (refer to commentary on page 51).

Where the tax invoice is **issued after the deadline** for taking up the discount, no adjustment is needed as the tax invoice will show the correct consideration.

The purchaser will still need to make an adjustment in his return for the discount received.

### Debit Note (Section 25(3)(b))

Where the GST shown on the tax invoice is **too low** a debit note must be issued to the purchaser. This debit note must show the following particulars:

*   the word "debit note" in a prominent place;
*   the name, address, and registration number of the supplier;
*   the name and address of the recipient;
*   the date on which the debit note was issued;
*   the amount by which the actual tax charged exceeds the tax shown on the tax invoice on that supply;
*   the number of the tax invoice and the date on which it was issued;
*   a brief explanation of the circumstances giving rise to the issuing of the debit note.

Where a purchaser receives such a debit note of credit note the purchaser will need to account for the adjustment. See explanation of adjustment on page 51 of this commentary.

### Time and Value of Supply (Sections 9 and 10)

### Introduction

This part expands on the earlier discussion of the time (section 9) and value (section 10) of a taxable supply of goods and services. It will enable a registered person to determine, in respect of a taxable supply:

*   in which return period to account for the supply or deduct the tax included in a purchase
*   the amount which must be accounted for in the return
*   the panel of the return in which that amount is to be included.

Note that this discussion only applies to taxable supplies (including zero-rated supplies) made or purchased by registered persons. An explanation of exempt supplies is made on page 16 (section 14) and the place of supply on page 10 (section 8).

In reading this discussion regard should also be had as to whether the registered person will be accounting for the GST on a payments or an invoice basis.

A summary of the time and value of different types of supplies is contained in the tables starting on the next page. These tables should be used as a rough guide only. The tables should be read in conjunction with the appropriate paragraph of the discussion which contains the full explanation. [View table here](http://www.brookersonline.co.nz/databases/modus/taxsvc/tchist/GEN-PIB!143?si=1610670095&tid=11636327&p=3 "This link will open in a new window")

### Value of Supplies (Section 10)

The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 provides that GST will be charged at the rate of 10 percent on the value of goods and services supplied. (Section 8(1)).

Therefore value is the price paid for a supply excluding GST. Consideration is the tax-inclusive price paid. (Section 10(2)).

For simplicity, the return will be based on the tax inclusive consideration for most supplies. Output tax and input tax will then be calculated by using the tax fraction.

### REMEMBER

|     |
| --- |
| VALUE = tax-exclusive amount paid (or consideration less tax) |
| CONSIDERATION = tax-inclusive amount paid, including tax (or value plus tax) |

**For Example:**

The value and consideration for an item on sale for $110 is:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tax-exclusive price | 100 | This is the value |
| Tax | 10  |     |
| Total Price | $110 | This is the consideration |

To calculate input and output tax generally divide the consideration by 1/11.

### Time of Supply (Section 9)

If the "time of supply" for a supply falls within a taxable period, then, if the registered person adopts an invoice basis the whole of the GST on the supply is included in the GST return for that taxable period (or claimed as a deduction in that return in the case of a purchase). For example, a sale is made and a 10% payment received - the full sale price must be accounted for in the period in which that payment is received.

In most cases the time of supply will be the date of the invoice or the date of payment if payment is made before an invoice is issued.

**(Section 9(1)).**

A registered person who adopts the payments basis will generally take account of supplies only to the extent of payments made or received. Exceptions to this rule apply in respect of hire purchase agreements, layby sales and certain other supplies. (See explanation below of special time of supply rules relating to particular types of supply.)

### General Rules Applying to Most Supplies

The following outlines the rules applying to most supplies. However, there are a number of special types of supply to which the following general rules do not apply. These are discussed below.

Supplies made by the registered person:

A. If a registered person accounts on an invoice basis, a supply will generally be accounted for in the return which covers the earliest taxable period in which he either issues an invoice or receives any payment for that supply.

*   For example, a registered person makes a sale on 25 April and receives part payment immediately. An invoice is not issued until 3 May. The return period ends on 30 April. The whole supply must be included in that return.

The amount to be included in box 3 of the return will be the full tax inclusive consideration for the supply. (See page 73 for copy of Return form).

B. If the registered person accounts on a payments basis, a supply will generally be accounted for in the return which covers the date that any payment is received. (Section 20(3)(b)).

*   For example, a registered person makes a sale on 25 April and receives payment in four equal instalments in April, June, August, and October. The supply is only accounted for to the extent that payment is received in each return period. If each payment is received in a different return period, each return will include only one quarter of the full tax-inclusive consideration for the supply.

The amount to be included in box 3 of the return will generally be the full amount that has been received as payment during the return period.

### Supplies received by a registered person:

A registered person may ONLY claim a deduction for the GST included in any purchase if:

*   the PRINCIPAL purpose of the purchase is for the taxable activity, AND
*   a tax invoice is held (where the purchase cost is more than $20).

If the purchase cost up to $20, then a deduction can be claimed without a tax invoice provided that it was bought for the principal purpose of the taxable activity. (Section 24(5)).

For any business purchase that is NOT made for the principal purpose of the taxable activity, NO DEDUCTION can be claimed at the time of purchase. An adjustment will be made, however, if that purchase is actually used in the taxable activity (refer to section 21(5)).

These rules for claiming a deduction apply for all purchases, even those covered by the special time and value rules outlined in the rest of this chapter.

A. If a registered person accounts on an invoice basis, he will generally be able to claim a deduction for tax included in business purchases in the return which covers the earliest period in which he is issued with an invoice or in which he makes any payment for that supply.

*   In order to claim this deduction he must hold a TAX INVOICE for the supply at the end of that period. If a tax invoice is not received until later, the claim can only be made in the period in which it was eventually received.
*   For example, on 25 April a registered person purchases goods and makes a part payment immediately. He receives an invoice (which is also a "tax invoice") on 3 July. Although the "time of supply" is technically on 25 April, the deduction may not be claimed until the return period in which the tax invoice is received (ie, the one that covers 3 July).
*   The amount to be included in box 7 of the return will be the full tax inclusive purchase price of the supply.

B. If a registered person accounts on a payments basis, he will generally be able to claim a deduction for tax included in business purchases as and when he makes payment for that supply. As is the case for the person accounting on the invoice basis, however, no deduction can be claimed unless a TAX INVOICE is held at the end of the return period in which any payment is made.

*   For example, on 25 April a registered person purchases goods and pays for them in four equal instalments in April, June, August, and October. He receives a tax invoice in June covering the full amount of the supply. If each of these payments are made in different return periods each is only deductible as and when made. However, note that as no tax invoice is held by the end of the return period in which the first payment is made, that deduction must be postponed until the tax invoice is received, ie, in the next period.
*   The amount to be included in box 7 of the return is the total amount paid in the period covered by the return.

### Periodic Payments and Hire Agreements

A special rule applies to supplies made under agreements for

*   the hire of goods (not including hire purchase)
*   the supply of services for periodic payments

These agreements are treated as a series of separate supplies for each period of the agreement. (Section 9(2)(a)).

### Supplies made by a registered person:

The following amounts should be included in box 3 of the GST return.

If a registered person is accounting for tax on:

1.  An Invoice Basis Include the amount due under the agreement if
    *   the amount became due during the taxable period; or
    *   payment was made to the registered person before it was due, during the period.
2.  A Payments Basis

Include the total amounts received during the taxable period, irrespective of when payment was due.

**Example**

A car is leased for $110 per month (including GST) and payments are due and paid on the 20th of each month. If the supplier has a 2 month return period, he will have to account for 2 supplies of $110 each during each taxable period.

Supplies received by a registered person:

If a registered person is accounting for tax on an invoice basis he may claim a deduction for tax in respect of each payment in full as it becomes due, or as he pays it, if earlier.

If he is accounting for tax on a payments basis, he may claim a deduction for tax in respect of each payment as and when made by him.

In both cases note that a Tax Invoice must be held before any deduction can be made.

### Door To Door Sales (Section 9(2)(b))

Supplies made by a registered person:

When purchases are made from door to door salesmen, the purchaser has seven days from the date of sale to cancel it. Accordingly, the supplier cannot account for tax on the supply until that seven day period has expired.

The tax on the supply must be accounted for in full in the taxable period in which the eighth day following the date of purchase falls.

Accounting for tax in full at this point is required regardless of whether the supplier is on an invoice or payments basis.

Supplies received by a registered person:

Recipients may only claim a deduction for the tax included in such purchases in the return period in which the eighth day falls (provided that a tax invoice is held). This is the case even if payment is made or an invoice received prior to that date.

_Example_

A door-to-door sales company sells an item on 31 January, which also happens to be the last day of the company's taxable period. The purchaser has seven days from the date of the sale to cancel the agreement to purchase the item. This makes the eighth day 8 February. The supplier must include the full value of supply in the taxable period that covers 8 February.

### Layby Sales (Section 9(2)(c))

Supplies made by a registered person:

A registered person should include in his return the total value of all layby sales where layby goods have been taken by or delivered to the purchaser during the taxable period. In practice this will mean that full payment has been received by then. There will, therefore, be no difference between registered persons accounting on an invoice or a payments basis.

Note that the tax is not accounted for as the various layby payments are received - even if a registered person is on a payments basis.

The amount to be included in box 3 of the return will be the full amount received by the supplier for the layby goods.

_Example_

A person pays a deposit of $500 on an item with a purchase price of $1,100 in October and pays the balance on layby in monthly instalments until December. This item is delivered by the registered person to the purchaser at the beginning of January. The registered person accounts for the supply in the taxable period that covers January.

In the case where a layby sale is cancelled and part of the consideration already paid by the purchaser is retained by the vendor (or some further amount is recovered) this amount must be accounted for during the taxable period in which the cancellation was made.

The amount to be included in box 3 of the return will be the full amount retained or recovered.

_Example_

A registered person enters into a layby agreement in March. The purchaser pays $100 of the total $1,100 purchase price. In June the purchaser cancels the agreement and forfeits the $100 already paid. The supplier accounts for $100 in the taxable period that covers June.

Supplies received by a registered person:

In the case of both invoice- and payments-based persons, no deduction may be claimed until the layby goods are fully paid for, uplifted, and a tax invoice obtained.

Where a registered person cancels layby sale, he will be entitled to a deduction of the tax fraction (1/11 of any cancellation charge made by the supplier, provided a tax invoice is obtained, in the period in which he cancels the layby agreement.

### Hire Purchase Agreements (Section 9(3)(b))

Supplies made by a registered person:

If a registered person accounts for tax on EITHER an invoice or a payments basis, he is required to account for all hire purchase supplies made by him in the return covering the period in which the agreement was entered into.

For example, a supplier sells goods on HP on 7 June, with payments monthly for 36 months. The supply must be accounted for in full in the return covering the period in which the agreement was entered into.

The amount which is entered in box 3 of the return is the "cash price" of the goods, as determined under the Hire Purchase Act 1971.

Supplies received by a registered person:

A registered person may claim a deduction of tax in the period in which he enters into the HP agreement, provided that he holds a tax invoice for the supply.

This applies whether he accounts for tax on an invoice basis or a payments basis.

The amount to be included in box 7 of the return will be the "cash price" of the goods, as determined under the Hire Purchase Act 1971.

### Retention Payments (Section 9(4))

Supplies made by a registered person:

If a registered person supplies goods and services under a contract (or under an Act of Parliament) which enables the recipient to retain part of the consideration temporarily, he need not return the retained part until it is actually paid to him. This is so whether he accounts for the tax on an invoice or a payments basis.

The amount to be included in box 3 of the return will be the full amount of any retention payment received by him.

Supplies received by a registered person:

If a registered person has retained any money under a contract (or under any Act) for any goods and services received by him, he is entitled to a deduction only when he makes payment to his supplier of the retained money.

The registered person is not entitled to any deduction for the retention prior to that time - even if he is on the invoice basis.

The amount to be included in box 7 is the full amount of the money paid by him.

_Example_

January, March and May. All payments are made on time.

A builder enters into a contract to build a house for $100,000 in November 1986. $40,000 is invoiced and paid in November and the balance is to be paid in $20,000 lots each 2 months ie $20,000 in

The builder accounts for $40,000 in the taxable period that covers November and $20,000 in each taxable period that covers January, March and May.

### Contract Variations (Section 9(5))

Supplies made by a registered person:

If a registered person is the supplier of buildings or civil engineering works, and the recipient requests a variation in the contract, any extra tax (as a result of that variation) need only be accounted for in the return covering the period in which he receives that payment for the work.

This will be so whether he accounts for tax on an invoice basis or a payments basis.

For example, a builder on an invoice basis contracts to erect a house for $100,000. The recipient later asks for the addition of a room, for an extra $10,000. Although the builder has accounted for most of the work at the time of invoicing, he need not account for the extra $10,000 until he receives payment.

The amount to be included in box 3 of the return will be the full amount of the payment received in respect of the variation.

Supplies received by a registered person:

Where a registered person is the purchaser of a building or civil engineering work, and he requests a variation in the contract, any extra tax (as a result of that variation) may only be deducted in the return covering the date on which he makes payment for the extra work (provided a tax invoice is held).

This will be so whether he accounts for tax on an invoice basis or a payments basis.

The amount to be included in box 7 of the return will be the full amount paid by a registered person.

### Full Consideration Not Known When Supply Occurs (Section 9(6))

Supplies made by a registered person:

If a registered person supplies goods other than by hire, but does not settle the final price until after the supply has physically taken place, the Act contains rules to allow him to account for tax as and when the final consideration is settled.

If he accounts on an invoice basis, he should include the tax on the supply in the period that he issues an invoice for any part of the supply, or payment is due or is received, whichever is the earlier.

For example, a farmer sells his produce to an exporter for a down-payment plus an end-of-season catch-up based on export prices. The farmer should account for tax immediately on the down-payment, but need not account for the tax on the later payment until it is due, or is received, or he sends an invoice for it.

The amount to be shown in box 3 of the return is initially the full amount of the down-payment and, in a later period, the full amount of the later payment.

If a registered person accounts on a payments basis, he need only account for payments as and when received, and not when due or invoiced. The full amount of each payment should be shown in box 3 of the return.

Supplies received by a registered person:

When a registered person purchases goods but does not agree on the consideration before uplifting them, he may not claim a deduction until the consideration is settled (ie until his supplier can issue a tax invoice). The supplier can issue an invoice that relates to only part for the consideration in order that he can claim a deduction of tax relating to that portion.

If he accounts on an invoice basis, the amount to be included in box 7 of the return will be the total amount invoiced to him or paid by him, whichever is earlier, in the period in which either occurs.

If he accounts on a payments basis he may deduct the amount of any payments made by him to the supplier, in the period in which the payment is made.

_Example_

A farmer delivers sheep to the freezing works in April. The price the sheep will fetch when the carcases are sold is unknown. The carcases are sold in July and an invoice and cheque for $1,100, being the final sale price, are sent to the farmer in August. The farmer accounts for the $1,100 in the taxable period that covers August. $100 of this is GST.

### Lotteries and Other Games of Chance (Section 10(14) & (15))

If a registered person runs a raffle, lottery, or other game of chance, he must include in box 3 of his return the proceeds of the lottery (ie, total sales of tickets/cards etc) LESS the total amount of prizes that are paid or are to be paid in cash.

This amount will be included in his return for the period during which the first drawing, or first determination of a result, occurred. For example, if one raffle has a number of draws over a period of weeks, the return in which the above amount should be shown will be the one which covers the date of the first draw.

The above applies whether or not the registered person is on the invoice or payments basis.

| Example |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Total Sales |     | Prizes |     |
| 565 tickets at $2 each = $1,130 |     | 1st | $500 |
|     |     | 2nd | $200 |
|     |     | 3rd | $100 |
| Total Proceeds $1,130 | Total prizes |     | $800 |
| Difference $330 |     |     |     |

Amount to be included in taxable period which covers the date the raffle was drawn $330 ($30 of tax).

GST paid on non-cash prizes purchased by a registered person will be deductible in the normal way: -

*   if the registered person is on the invoice basis, by including the full purchase price in box 7 of his return for the earliest period in which an invoice is received or payment made;
*   if he is on the payments basis, by including the amount of each payment as and when it is made by him.

In the event that the purchase of a raffle/lottery ticket will be deductible to a registered person, the organiser of the raffle/lottery will have to be approached after the drawing commences in order to obtain a tax invoice which will show the amount of the original purchase price that has been subject to the GST and the amount of the GST itself. Once that has been obtained, he may include the total of those amounts in box 7 of his return.

### Supplies to Associated Persons (Section 9(2)(a)) (Section 10(3))

Special valuation and timing rules apply for some supplies made to persons associated with a registered person, such as relatives, or closely connected associated companies.

Supplies made by a registered person:

When a registered person supplies goods or services to an associated person, and that person is not able to claim a deduction for that supply (eg because not registered) he must check to see whether the amount charged was less than the open market value (including GST) of the supply. If so, it is the open market value, including GST, which must be included in box 3 of the return. He does not include the amount actually charged.

Note that the legislation treats "open market value" as a **tax exclusive** concept. For the purposes of this bulletin, however, the further step of adding the tax onto that value has been taken, in order to permit effective comparison with actual consideration received.

Unless he receives a payment or issues the person an invoice prior to the last day for furnishing a return (one month after the end of the period) he must include the open market value of the supply in the return which covers the period in which he physically supplied the goods or services to his associate. If he received payment or issued an invoice before that time, that date of invoice or payment determines the period in which the supply must be returned.

For example, X gives his wife some goods from his store on 25 April, and does not receive any payment until June 16. Since the supply physically occurred on April 25, X will return it in the period in which that date falls.

If X's period ended on 30 April, and some payment had been received before 1 June, then the date of payment would be used.

These rules apply whether he accounts on an invoice or payments basis.

Supplies received by a registered person:

If a registered person receives goods or services in the course of his taxable activity from an associated person, there are no special valuation rules.

If he accounts for tax on an invoice basis, he may claim a deduction for the tax in the return which covers the period in which he was physically supplied the goods or services by his associate. If however he made payment or received an invoice before the time when a return was due from the supplier for that period, that date of invoice or payment determines the period in which the deduction may be claimed.

The full amount payable by a registered person should be included in box 7 of the return.

If a registered person accounts on a payments basis, he may only claim a deduction to the extent of any payment made by him for the supply. That amount should be included in box 7 of the return.

### Accommodation (Section 10(6))

While the supply of accommodation in a dwelling is exempt, the supply of accommodation in a hotel, motel, or other "commercial dwelling" is taxable, but at a reduced rate after 4 weeks.

Supplies made by a registered person:

If a registered person's taxable activity is that of a hotel motel or other "commercial dwelling" he will be required to calculate the amount of GST in a slightly different manner so far as it relates only to accommodation ("domestic goods and services") .

All other supplies made by him will be accounted for in the normal way. Where a joint charge is made for these along with the accommodation (eg for bed and breakfast) that charge will need to be separated.

GST on accommodation up to 4 weeks is charged in full. The amount shown in box 3 of the return in respect of these short-term guests is the total amount payable for the supply.

For accommodation over 4 weeks, you must include in box 3 of the return a minimum of 20% of the actual tax exclusive amount charged for the room, plus the tax on that portion. That reduced amount must also be taken into account when issuing tax invoices to guests. In this case, the tax must be shown separately. Remember that other goods and services provided (such as meals and laundry) are still taxed in full.

The percentage of the amount charged which should be included in box 3 of the return is that portion of the value of the room charge (excluding GST) that is paid for -

*   the right to occupy the premises
*   any of the following if they are provided as part of the right to occupy the premises
    *   cleaning and maintenance
    *   electricity, gas, air conditioning
    *   telephone (but not tolls), television, radio or similar chattels

Note that this portion cannot be less than 20% of the accommodation charge (excluding GST).

If a registered person accounts on an invoice basis the supply is accounted for in the earliest period in which he issues an invoice or receives payment for the accommodation.

If he accounts on a payments basis he must include the supply in the period in which he receives payment. However, the reduced value after 4 weeks is still the value on which tax is charged, not the total amount of money paid to him.

Supplies received by a registered person:

The normal rules apply for determining when a registered person makes a deduction of tax included in accommodation purchased by him.

It should be noted that for accommodation purchased in excess of four weeks only the reduced amount of the charge (ie the minimum of 20 % and the tax on that) should be included in box 7 of the return.

**Example**

A person stays in a hotel for 5 weeks.

The weekly room charge of $200 covers use of telephone (not tolls), television, radio, cleaning charges, and power.

The account for the 5 weeks is as follows:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weeks 1-4 - $200 per week | \=  | $800 |
| GST on weeks 1-4 10% | \=  | $80 |
| Week 5 |     | $200 |
| GST - minimum charge 20% of 200 | \=  | 40  |
| tax at 10% on $40 | \=  | $4  |
|     | Total | $1,084 |
|     | GST content = | $84 |

Amount to be included in box 3 (or box 7 if accommodation purchased by you) is the **taxable** room rates ($800 and $40) plus the tax charged ($80 + $4).

### Tokens, Stamps and Vouchers (Section 10(16) & (17))

Special rules relate to the reporting of sales of gift vouchers, postage stamps, milk tokens etc, as these are merely mediums of exchange in their own right.

**A. Sales of vouchers etc which state a monetary amount**

This does not apply to sales of postage stamps.

If a registered person sells such a voucher he must not include the sale price in box 3. If he sells the voucher for **more** than the face value, he must include the amount of the excess in box 3 of his return in the period in which he supplied the voucher.

When such a voucher is redeemed by him, the value of the supply for which the voucher is given in exchange or part exchange will be entered in his return in the normal way.

If a registered person purchases such a voucher, he may not obtain a tax invoice in respect of it, or a deduction. He will however be able to obtain a tax invoice and claim a deduction when he eventually redeems (cashes in) his voucher, and the amount to be included in box 7 of the return will be the full amount which he pays for the goods or services in question.

**B. Sales of vouchers which DO NOT state a monetary amount, and Postage Stamps**

If a registered person supplies such a voucher, etc (such as a milk token) he must include the full amount charged for the voucher in box 3 of his return for the period in which the supply was made (ie earlier of invoice or payment on the invoice basis, time of payment on the payments basis). Note that when these vouchers are redeemed however he will not be required to account for their value again - the receipt of such vouchers is ignored for GST purposes.

For example a florist sells a voucher entitling the bearer to a bunch of red roses, but stating no monetary value. The florist includes in his return the total paid for the voucher. When the bearer of the voucher returns to the shop and uses the voucher, the florist is not required to account for the transaction represented by the exchanging of the voucher for the roses.

If a registered person purchases a voucher with no monetary value, or postage stamps, he is entitled to a tax invoice (provided the purchase exceeds $20), and to claim a deduction in the period in which the supply was made to him. The amount to be included in box 7 of the return will be the full amount paid for the voucher (or invoiced to him if he accounts on an invoice basis and has received the invoice prior to making payment).

### Coin Operated Amusement and Vending Machines, etc (Section 9(2)(f) (Section 10(14) & (15))

A special rule deals with the time at which supplies made through coin operated machines must be included in any return. This rule applies whether one accounts for tax on an invoice or payments basis.

If a registered person supplies goods or services through any coin-operated device or machine (for example a video game, a cigarette machine, or a parking meter) he is required to include the total value of the coins which he removes from the machines in box 3 of his return for the period **in which he removed the coins from the machine.**

Where a supply is made through a **token-operated** device or machine, the token is accounted for as described in the previous section relating to tokens, stamps and vouchers. Where the token does not have a monetary value stated on it, the removal of such a token from the machine or device is ignored for the purposes of box 3 of the return - its value having been included in that box at the time it was sold.

In the rare cases where a registered person receives business goods or services through any coin-operated device or machine he may simply claim a deduction in the period in which the money was paid. The amount paid should be included in box 7 in the normal way.

### Local Body Rates

Supplies made by a registered person:

Clearly, the only registered persons who will be charging rates are the local bodies themselves. Those local bodies accounting on a payments basis will enter the amount of each rates payment (and penalties) in box 3 of the return as and when they are received. Bodies accounting on an invoice basis will enter in box 3 of the return the full rate charged at the earliest time payment is received.

Many local authorities collect rates on an instalment basis, with the total rate being collected over the period of one year. While a local body accounting on a payments basis still accounts for each payment as and when received, the bodies accounting on an invoice basis will only enter in box 3 of the return the total of each instalment at the time it is due or received, whichever occurs first.

Supplies received by a registered person:

When a registered person pays rates (and penalties for late payment), it is paying for services supplied by the local body who levied those rates.

If a registered person accounts on a paints basis, he will enter in box 7 of the return the total amount of each payment of rates (or penalty) that he makes as and when he pays (provided, of course, he holds a tax invoice in respect of those payments). This is the case whether or not the rates are required to be paid in one lump sum or in instalments.

If a registered person is accounting for GST on the invoice basis and the rates are due to be paid in instalments, he will enter in box 7 of the return the amount of each instalment at the time they are due to be paid (or at the time they are actually paid, if earlier). This is the case even where an invoice or a tax invoice has been issued before the due date of payment.

Also, if he is on the invoice basis and the rates are to be paid in one instalment (or if a penalty is to be paid), he may enter the full amount of rates (or penalty) in box 7 of the return when he makes any payment or receives an invoice, whichever is earlier.

### Racing

If a registered person is a racing club, the TAB or the NZ Racing Authority, it is required to make certain deductions from bets on races before the dividend pool is established.

It will enter the total of those deductions in box 3 of the return which covers the period in which the deductions are made by it.

### Grants and Subsidies

These payments will normally be consideration for taxable supplies and if a registered person receives one he must account for it in the normal way, ie depending on the accounting basis he has adopted.

When he receives a grant or subsidy from a Government Department he will not normally need to issue a tax invoice in response.

However if he receives a grant or subsidy from another registered person (eg a research grant) they are likely to require a tax invoice from him.

If he pays a grant or subsidy that is consideration for taxable supplies, he may request a tax invoice and claim the total amount paid in box 7 in the same manner as any other purchases of taxable supplies.

### Credit and Debit Notes (Section 25)

Credit notes are often issued by a supplier when for any reason (eg faulty goods returned to a shop) the consideration for a supply is reduced. Debit notes are also issued by the supplier when the consideration is subsequently increased.

The issue of a debit note or credit note is generally required by the GST Act when a tax invoice has previously been issued. The credit or debit note will show the increase or reduction in tax (as the case may be) on the supply and certain other information detailed in page 28. This must be done whether or not the supplier accounts for tax on an invoice or payments basis. The issue of a credit note is not required in the case where a prompt payment discount is the reason for the reduction in the consideration.

The Act requires registered persons (usually only those on an invoice basis) to adjust their return for such changes in consideration even if credit and debit notes are not required to be issued (eg where a simple cash discount is given). This adjustment occurs in boxes 3 and 7 of the return.

If a registered person accounts on a payments basis, the following adjustments should ONLY be done in respect of credit and debit notes received or issued that relate to the following types of supplies/purchases:

*   hire purchase,
*   supplies to associated persons,
*   door to door sales, and
*   layby sales,

for which tax invoices have previously been issued/received. In these cases, when eventually payment is made or refund received after the issue of the debit or credit note, no further adjustment may be included in box 3 or box 7 of the return.

**A. Reduction of the agreed price**

If a registered person is the supplier of goods and services and **after** issuing an invoice or receiving payment the price of that supply is reduced, he must include in box 7 of his return, for the period in which that reduction occurred (normally this will also be the period in which a credit note or other advice is issued by him) the amount of the reduction.

If he has issued a **tax invoice** for the above supply, he must issue a credit note showing that reduction in price.

If he is the recipient of that supply, he must include in box 3 of his return, for the period in which the reduction was made (normally this will also be the period in which the credit note or other advice is received by him) the amount of the reduction as shown on the credit note.

In the case where a prompt payment discount is taken up, the resulting reduction in the price of the supply does not need to be shown on a credit note, however both the supplier and the recipient must make the appropriate adjustments as detailed above.

**B. Increase of the agreed price**

If a registered person is the supplier of goods and services and **after** issuing an invoice or receiving payment the price of that supply is increased, he must include in box 3 of his return, for the period in which that increase occurred (normally this will also be the period in which a debit note or other advice is issued by his) the amount of the increase.

If he has issued a **tax invoice** for the above supply, he must issue a debit note showing that increase in price.

If he is the recipient of that supply, he must include in box 7 of his return, for the period in which the increase was made (normally this will also be the period in which the debit note or other advice is received by him) the amount of the increase as shown on the debit note.

### Secondhand Goods

If a registered person supplies secondhand goods such as antiques, he will account for those supplies in the normal way.

If he purchases secondhand goods from

*   a non-registered person, or
*   a registered person who sells them to him in his private capacity

he may claim a deduction in box 7 of the return in the normal manner. This claim may be made even though he will not have a tax invoice for the purchase, however he will be required to retain certain information relating to the purchase.

If he purchases secondhand goods from another registered person who supplies them in the course of his taxable activity, he must obtain a tax invoice in order to claim a deduction.

**In all cases** he must hold a tax invoice in order to claim any deduction.

### Receiving a Tax Invoice Too Late to Claim a Deduction (Section 20(3)(f))

There will be times where a registered person will be unable to claim a deduction for a purchase because a tax invoice is not held at the time the claim would normally be made.

If he never receives a tax invoice, he may never claim the amount as a deduction.

If a tax invoice is obtained in a later return period, he may then claim the amount or amounts which he would previously have entered in box 7 of his return.

For example, a person on an invoice basis may receive an invoice at the time the goods were delivered, but because that invoice did not happen to be a tax invoice, no claim for a deduction could be made at that time. If the supplier issues a tax invoice 2 months later, the purchaser may claim his deduction in that later period, ie the full amount on the tax invoice will be included in box 7 of the return covering the period in which the tax invoice was received.

As a further example, a person on the payments basis received an invoice at the time goods are delivered and made a payment of one half of the full price of the goods at that time. Because the invoice received did not happen to be a tax invoice, the person was not able to include the amount paid in box 7 of the return covering the period in which that payment was made. The receipt of a tax invoice in a later period would enable that first payment to be included in box 7 of the return covering that later period. The balance of the purchase price will be able to be claimed when paid.

### Insurance Claims Paid (Section 20(3)(d))

If a registered person is an insurance company or any other insurer and it provides insurance for which the premium is subject to the GST (eg fire and general, medical insurances), any **cash** claim payments that it makes **to the insured** in respect of such policies will be included in box 7 of the return as and when the payments are made.

For all other payments that it makes in respect of claims on such policies, eg a payment to a panelbeater for repairs to an insured vehicle, a tax invoice will be required in order for it to claim a deduction in the normal way.

These rules apply whether it accounts on the invoice or payments basis.

If a registered person receives a cash payment from his insurer in respect of a policy (eg a policy on the business motor car) he will be required to include 1/11 of the payment received as an adjustment in the first tax adjustments panel in his return, as long as the loss insured against related to his taxable activity.

### Tax Adjustments

### Introduction

The previous part dealt with the time and value of the bulk of taxable supplies. These will be shown in the return at their tax inclusive consideration and the GST will be calculated by taking 1/11th of the total.

This part of the commentary deals with the transactions that will be shown as tax adjustments on the return. These tax adjustments are:

A. Output Tax Side

*   Private use of business goods and services (section 21(1))
*   Goods and services used for other exempt purposes (section 21(1))
*   Fringe benefits for employees
*   Insurance receipts
*   Bad debts recovered
*   Barter transactions (supplies where payment is not in money) (section 10(2))
*   Exported secondhand goods (sections 11(1) and 10(4))
*   Assets held when registration ceases (section 5(3))

B. Input Tax Side

*   GST paid to the Customs Department (sections 12 and 13)
*   Use of private goods and services in a taxable activity (section 21(5))
*   Bad debts written-off (section 26)
*   Wholesale sales tax credit (section 83)

C. Both Input and Output Tax Sides

*   Adjustment on a change of accounting basis (section 19(7) and (8))

A summary of the time and value rules for these adjustments is contained in the tables starting on the next page. These tables are a rough guide only and should be read in conjunction with the appropriate paragraph of the following commentary.

[View table here.](http://www.brookersonline.co.nz/databases/modus/taxsvc/tchist/GEN-PIB!143?si=1610670095&tid=11636327&p=4 "This link will open in a new window")

### A. TAX ADJUSTMENTS ON OUTPUT TAX SIDE

### Private Use of Business Goods and Services (Section 21(1))

Goods or services taken from a taxable activity for private purposes require an adjustment for the tax on the goods or services in the return which covers the period during which the registered person uses those goods or services for private purposes.

The person is required to include in box 6 of the return ONE-ELEVENTH (ie, the tax fraction) of the cost of the goods (or the open market value of the goods, if lower). Both the cost and open market value include GST.

The Department will publish detailed rules on establishing the cost and openmarket value of goods and services in particular cases. Apportionment rules are being developed to cover the case where goods are used partly for private purposes and partly for business purposes in any period. Registered persons in that position will effectively be required to add back part of the original GST deduction that they received for the goods.

These rules apply whether a person accounts on an invoice or a payments basis.

### Goods and Services Used for Other Exempt Purposes (Section 21(1))

In the same way as for private use, if goods or services are taken from a taxable activity for the purposes of any EXEMPT activity (eg providing residential accommodation or banking) carried on the registered person is required to account for the tax on the goods or services in the return which covers the period during which the goods or services are used for exempt purposes.

The person is required to include in box 6 of the return ONE-ELEVENTH (ie, the tax fraction) of the cost of the goods (or the open market value of the goods if lower). Both the cost and open market value include GST.

Again, the Department will publish detailed rules on establishing the cost and open-market value of goods and services in particular cases. Apportionment rules are being developed to cover the case where goods are used partly for exempt purposes and partly for business purposes in any period. Registered persons in that position will effectively be required to add back part of the original GST deduction that they received for the goods.

These rules apply whether the person accounts on an invoice or a payments basis.

**De minimis rule** (section (21)): A registered person will not be required to account for goods and services used for exempt purposes if exempt activities fall below a certain annual level. This level is set at the lesser of -

*   $48,000, or
*   5% of total turnover

received from all activities in any 12 month period following the date at which any particular goods and services are applied for exempt purposes.

For instance a shop with annual sales of $1,000,000 provides some HP financing to its customers, with credit worth $40,000 pa. Since the credit provided falls below the $48,000 level AND is less than 5% of total turnover, the shop need not take into account any goods and services it uses in the exempt activity of providing credit.

### Fringe Benefits for Employees (Section 21(3) and (4))

If a registered person is liable to pay Fringe Benefit Tax to the Inland Revenue Department, he may be also liable to account for GST on the value of those fringe benefits.

The only type of fringe benefit on which GST is not payable is employment related loans.

If a registered person provides fringe benefits other than employment-related loans, he must include in his return, in the tax adjustments box 6, **one-eleventh** (ie, the tax fraction) of the "taxable value" (for FBT purposes) of those fringe benefits, (ensuring that the "taxable value" figure relating to the value of any employment-related loans has been excluded).

This amount is included in the return which covers the period during which registered persons are obliged to pay any FBT (normally payable quarterly) to the Inland Revenue Department.

### Insurance Receipts (Section 5(13))

The Act deems a supply to occur whenever a payment under an insurance policy for a loss incurred in a taxable activity is received. The full amount of any such payment must be included in the return which covers the date on which the payment was received.

The amount to be included in the tax adjustments box 6 will be **one-eleventh** (ie, the tax fraction) of the full amount of the indemnity payment received.

This applies whether tax is accounted for on an invoice or payments basis.

### Bad Debts Recovered

If a registered person has had a GST deduction in the past for any bad debt written-off and recovers part of that debt, he must make an adjustment for the amount of the bad debt written-off.

The amount to be included in box 6 of the return is **one-eleventh** (ie, the tax fraction) of the amount recovered.

For example, a person accounting for GST on an invoice basis has a bad debt of $45,000 (this arose from a fully taxable supply) and recovers, some time later, the sum of $4400. At the time of recovery, he will include in box 6 of the relevant return one-eleventh of the recovered amount, or $400. This adjustment will be made at the time of recovery whether this person is still on the invoice basis or has since changed to the payments basis.

### Barter (Supplies Where Payment is Not in Money) (Section 10(2))

Where taxable supplies are provided in exchange for other goods or services, the registered person must enter in tax adjustments box 6 of the return **one eleventh** (ie, the tax fraction) of the OPEN MARKET VALUE (including GST) of the goods and/or services that have been received in exchange for those supplies. It does not matter what the value is of the goods and services that have been supplied.

Where a taxable supply is made and in exchange money AND goods or services are received -

*   the tax fraction of the open market value of those goods and services received in exchange is entered in box 6 of the return, and
*   the amount of money received must be entered in box 3 of the return.

The above applies whether the registered person accounts on an invoice or payments basis.

Where goods and/or services are received in full or part exchange for taxable supplies that have been made, and the supplier and recipient have established a value in dollars for the exchange, the only amount included in the return is that value. It will be included in box 3 of the return. In those circumstances, the consideration is simply consideration in money, and subject to the normal rules.

### Exported Secondhand Goods

Where a registered person exports secondhand goods (for which an imputed credit has previously been claimed) in the course of a taxable activity he must -

1.  include the sale/invoiced amount of the sale in box 3 of his return; and
2.  include the same amount in box 4 of his return if evidence is held that those goods have been exported; and
3.  include **one-eleventh** of the cost price (including GST) of the exported second-hand goods in box 6 of the return.

**Note:** this only applies in respect of exported **second-hand goods** (previously used goods purchased from a non registered person) the purchase price of which is included in box 7 of a previous return. In respect of all other exported goods, only steps (i) and (ii) above need be completed.

The above must be done whether the registered person accounts on an invoice or payments basis.

**Assets Held When Registration Ceases**

If, at the time when a registered person ceases to be registered, he still holds assets forming part of a taxable activity and included the purchase price of those assets in box 7 of a previous return, that person must include in his last GST return, a tax adjustment in box 6.

The amount to be included will be **one-eleventh** (ie, the tax fraction) of the **open market value** (or the cost price if lower) of those assets. Note: that both the open market value and the purchase price should include GST.

Whether or not those goods are sold or disposed of after registration has ceased, no further adjustment other than the above need be made.

This adjustment must be made whether the person accounted on an invoice or payments basis.

### B. TAX ADJUSTMENTS ON INPUT TAX SIDE

### Bad Debts Written-off (Section 26)

This adjustment may only be made if the registered person accounts on an invoice basis.

If a registered person makes a taxable supply (which he has properly accounted for in a previous return) and part or all of the consideration for that supply has been written-off as a bad debt, he may make an adjustment in box 8 of his return for the period when the bad debt is written-off-

The amount that is to be included in box 8 of his return is **one-eleventh** (ie, the tax fraction) of the full amount written-off.

For example, a registered person sells goods for a tax-inclusive price of $16.50, receives a cheque for that amount and includes the sale in box 3 of his return. The cheque later bounces and, after taking all reasonable steps, the $16.50 is written-off six months later as a bad debt. At the time that that amount is written-off, the registered person will include $1.50 (ie, the tax fraction of $16.50) in box 8 of his return covering that period.

If the supply that gave rise to the bad debt was one where the GST was not payable on the full price, (eg a charge for the fifth week of hotel accommodation, or sale under a hire purchase agreement) the amount to be included in box 8 of the return must be the amount written-off as a proportion of the full sale price (incl GST), multiplied by the GST included in that sale price.

For example, a registered person makes a sale under a hire purchase agreement where the "cash price" of the goods supplied was $1,100 ($1,000 and $100 GST) and the full amount paid under the hire purchase was $1,650 (includes finance charges etc). The purchaser defaults in respect of one-half of the total payable (ie, $825) and this amount is considered irrecoverable. At the time that it is written-off as a bad debt, a registered person will include in box 8 of his return one-half (ie, $825/$1,650) of $100, ie, $50.

If, in any of the cases above, part or all of the bad debt written-off is later recovered, a registered person must make the adjustment explained on page 62.

### GST Paid To Customs Department (Sections 12, 13)

The Customs Department collects GST in two circumstances:

*   on the importation of goods into New Zealand - the tax is charged on the landed value (including insurance and duties) of the goods, as assessed by Customs.
*   when New Zealand manufactured goods are removed by a purchaser from a bonded warehouse at "in bond" prices - for example, liquor - the tax is charged on the amount of the excise duty.

If a registered person is charged GST by the Customs Department in either circumstance (the first is by far the most common) he may claim a deduction of the tax by including it in tax adjustment box 8 of his return for the period in which that GST was paid by him to Customs. The amount of tax will appear on the documents provided by Customs.

This applies whether a registered person accounts on an invoice or payments basis.

### Use of Private Goods and Services in a Taxable Activity (Section 21(5))

If a registered person brings into his taxable activity goods and services for which he received no deduction at the time of purchase (ie, they were purchased mainly for private or exempt purposes), he is able to make an adjustment for the tax on the goods or services in the return which covers the period during which he used the goods or services in his taxable activity.

The registered person will include in box 8 of the return **one-eleventh** (ie, the tax fraction) of the cost of the goods (or the current open market value of the goods if lower). Both the cost and open market value should include GST.

The Inland Revenue Department will publish detailed rules on establishing the cost and open-market value of goods and services in particular cases. Apportionment rules are being developed to cover the case where goods are used partly for business and partly for private purposes in any period. Registered persons in that position will effectively be able to deduct only some portion of the original GST deduction that they received for the goods.

Note that this adjustment is only available in cases where the goods and services brought into the taxable activity were purchased or acquired on or after 1 October 1986.

These rules apply whether a registered person accounts on an invoice or a payments basis.

### Wholesale Sales Tax Credit (Section 83)

If a registered person has paid Wholesale Sales Tax to a wholesaler at any time in the past, under the Sales Tax Act 1974, on any trading stock or stationery held by him on 30 September 1986, he is entitled to a special deduction of that WST, as a credit against his GST liability.

Note that it does not apply to:

*   any capital assets
*   goods held for hire (for example, the rental stock of a TV hire firm)
*   goods (if any) which remain subject to WST after the introduction of GST
*   secondhand goods

The trading stock or stationery must be for use in a taxable activity (not an exempt activity).

The registered person will need to hold records to justify the amount representing WST as claimed by him.

The credit may only be claimed in any GST return made by the registered person in any period up to 31 March 1987, by entering the amount in box 9 of the return.

### C. TAX ADJUSTMENTS ON BOTH INPUT AND OUTPUT TAX SIDE

### Adjustment Upon a Change of Accounting Basis

Where a registered person has previously been furnishing GST returns on one accounting basis (invoice or payments) and later chooses (or is required) to adopt the other basis, an adjustment must be undertaken in the last return which a registered person files on the old basis. This adjustment merely recognises the different ways in which each basis brings supplies and purchases to account for GST purposes.

This adjustment is not made where a registered person simply changes his return period (ie, from monthly to two-monthly returns, or from category A to category B)

If a registered person changes from one basis to the other he is required to make the following calculation: -

1.  Identify all of his creditors (ie, persons who have invoiced him for taxable supplies for which he has not paid) as at the last day that he will be accounting for tax on the old basis.
2.  Identify all of his debtors (ie, persons to whom he has issued invoices for taxable supplies but who have not yet paid him) as at the last day that he will be accounting for tax on the old basis.
3.  For all of the above creditors and debtors record the amounts outstanding which relate ONLY to supplies referred to in page 38 (supplies covered by the general rules), page 39 (periodic payments and hire agreements), and page 44 (consideration not known at time of supply). (For all other supplies, the special rules ensure that there is no difference between the accounting bases as to when they are brought to account.)
4.  For both creditors and debtors, calculate the amount of tax that is included in each. As long as none of the creditors and debtors arise from zero-rated supplies, accommodation in excess of four weeks, or hire purchase sales, this amount may be calculated simply by dividing creditors and debtors by 11. Where such supplies are included, the actual tax component of the creditors and debtors will have to be established from the invoices.
5.  Calculate the difference between the tax on creditors and the tax on debtors.

### A: Adjustment on Change from Payments to Invoice Basis (Section 19(8))

If tax on creditors **exceeds** tax on debtors, the difference must be included in **Box 8** of the return.

If tax on creditors **is less than** tax on debtors, the difference must be included in **Box 6** of the return.

If tax on creditors **is equal to** tax on debtors, no entry in the return is required.

### B: Adjustment on Change from Invoice to Payments Basis (Section 19(7)).

If tax on creditors **exceeds** tax on debtors, the difference must be included in **Box 6** of the return.

If tax on creditors **is less than** tax on debtors, the difference must be included in **Box 8** of the return.

If tax on creditors **is equal to** tax on debtors, no entry in the return is required.

### Return Calculations

### Introduction

This shows how the Goods and Services Tax Return Form (GST 101) will be completed to show the taxable supplies made during the period and the tax adjustments for the period. A return will be sent to each "registered person" in the final working week of each taxable period. The form when completed is to be sent to the Inland Revenue office at the address preprinted on it.

The returns and any payment are due to be received by the Inland Revenue Department no later than one month and one day after the last day of a registered person's taxable period (section 16).

This part summarises how each block on the return will be completed. Reference should be made to the immediately preceding two parts of this commentary ("Time and Value of Supply" and "Tax Adjustments") for an explanation of how to calculate the figures to be entered.

**Block 1: Preprinted Details**

This portion of the form has not been reproduced

This portion of the Form will be preprinted before being mailed to each registered person, showing:

*   GST number
*   name of the "registered person"
*   business address
*   taxable period covered by the return
*   due date for furnishing the return and making any required payment
*   the address of the Inland Revenue district office where the return and payment is to be sent to.

**Block 2: Goods and Services Supplied**

This portion of the form has not been reproduced.

In this panel the registered person will show:

1.  the total value of taxable supplies (including zero-rated supplies) made during the taxable period. Refer to the preceding part of this commentary ("Time and Value of Supply"), to determine which supplies must be included in box 3.
2.  the total value of zero-rated supplies which formed part of return box 3.
3.  the total relevant Tax Adjustments for supplies of goods and services made by the registered person for the taxable period. The tax adjustments box in this panel should be used to show the tax on:
    *   goods and services taken for private use (to be shown separately)
    *   goods and services used for other exempt purposes
    *   barter transactions
    *   fringe benefits provided to employees
    *   bad debts recovered
    *   exported secondhand goods
    *   insurance payments received
    *   assets retained at the time of ceasing to be registered.
    *   This tax adjustments box should also be used where a change in accounting basis results in further tax becoming payable. Refer to the preceding part of this commentary: "Tax Adjustments".
        
4.  total output tax.

**Block 3: Deductions of Goods and Services Tax Paid by You**

This portion of the form has not been reproduced

In this panel the registered person will show:

1.  the total value of supplies received by him for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies for which tax invoices are held. NOTE: items under $20 value will not require a tax invoice, but a record of:
    *   what was purchased
    *   when it was purchased
    *   how much it cost,

*   will be needed. See the preceding part of this commentary ("Time and Value of Taxable Supply") to determine when deductions can be made.

2.  the total of tax adjustments for supplies of goods and services received by the registered person for the taxable period. The tax adjustments box in this panel should be used to show:
    *   GST paid to the Customs Department
    *   tax on private/exempt goods and services used in the taxable activity
    *   tax on bad debts written-off.

1.  This tax adjustments box should also be used where a change in accounting basis results in tax to be refunded. See the preceding part of this commentary ("Tax Adjustments").
2.  Any adjustment for wholesale sales tax. Full credit will be given for sales tax paid on trading stock and stationery held at 30 September 1986. No credit will be given for any sales tax incurred in the purchase of goods which form part of the depreciable capital of the business. The claim for credit on sales tax can be made on any return furnished before 31 March 1987. See the part of this commentary dealing with "Tax Adjustments".

**Block 4: Calculation of Tax Payable and Declaration**

This portion of the form has not been reproduced

The registered person will use this block:

1.  to subtract the total GST tax paid (Panel B) from the total GST tax received (Panel A). The balance is what is required to be paid to the Inland Revenue Department, or if Panel B is greater than Panel A a refund is claimed.
2.  to print his Name, position of authority, the date, and telephone number
3.  to sign the return's declaration panel.

This declaration must be completed by a responsible person:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| for a one-person business | the sole proprietor |
| for a partnership | a partner |
| for a trust | a trustee |
| for a company | a director or secretary |
| for a statutory corporation | authorised person |
| local bodies | an office holder |

### Furnishing the Return and Payment of Tax

When the GST return is posted to the Department, the top two copies of the form should be sent to the Inland Revenue district office nominated on the top of the form with a cheque for payment of any amount due. The third copy should be retained for the registered person's records. If a refund is due it will be sent within 15 working days or interest will be paid - subject to certain criteria.

The tax calculated (on the return) for each taxable period is due and payable to the Inland Revenue Department on the same day on which the return is required to be furnished (ie, one month and one day after the end of the taxable period). This is the "due date".

Draft Return Form (GST 101) has not been reproduced.

### Section V - Administration

### Assessments and Objections (Sections 27 to 40)

### Assessments

The tax is essentially "self-assessed", that is registered persons will normally calculate and pay tax without any notice of assessment being issued by the Department.

However, the Commissioner has the power (under section 27) to issue an assessment where -

1.  DEFAULT is made in furnishing any return; or
2.  THE COMMISSIONER IS NOT SATISFIED with any return; or
3.  the REGISTERED PERSON IS NOT SATISFIED with any return made; or
4.  any NON-REGISTERED PERSON UNLAWFULLY CHARGES TAX on supplies.
    *   the tax so assessed is payable unless the person establishes that the assessment is excessive or that the assessment is not valid because tax is not payable (section 27(1)).
    *   Where such assessment is made after the otherwise "due date" for payment, the Commissioner will establish a new "due date" (section 27(4)).
    *   Where a non-registered person purports to charge tax on supplies made, ANY TAX SO CHARGED (whether or not COLLECTED) is payable to the Inland Revenue Department (section 27(6)).

### Objections to Assessments

If an assessment is made, it may be objected to in the same manner as is available for income tax assessments, and may be referred to the Taxation Review Authority or the High Court. Interest will be charged on tax dispute in the same way as for income tax (sections 33-40).

### Other Objections

Objections may also be made in respect of the exercise of certain discretions by the Commissioner (section 32). These discretions relate to:

1.  the taxable period (category A, B, C or D) allocated to a registered person; or
2.  the accounting basis to be used by a registered person; or
3.  certain concessions relating to the issue of tax invoices by registered persons (eg eligibility for "buyer-created" invoices);
4.  whether or not a person is liable to register under the Act;
5.  the cancellation of registration;
6.  eligibility for grouping of companies;
7.  eligibility for registration of branches or divisions.

These rights of objection against determinations of the Commissioner have been introduced into the Act to ensure that the affected party has a right to be heard before an independent body.

### Recoveries, Refunds and Reliefs (Sections 41 to 50)

These provisions are modelled very closely on those in the Income Tax Act 1976. The main points to note are -

*   Additional tax will be charged at the rate of 10% for the first month and a further cumulative 2% for each extra month the tax remains unpaid (section 41);
*   Outstanding tax will rank the same as PAYE, ie as a debt above all secured debts. but after claims for unpaid wages (section 42);
*   A procedure similar to that in s 400 of the Income Tax Act 1976 will be available to recover the outstanding GST debt (section 43);
*   Refunds may be claimed within eight years of the return period (section 45(1));
*   The Commissioner is required to pay interest on any refunds that are not made within 15 working days of the receipt of a return - provided that the return is completed satisfactorily and there is no other tax outstanding (section 46)
*   Any GST refund may be set off against any unpaid GST, income tax or other tax (section 48(2));
*   The Commissioner may refrain from either collecting or refunding small amounts of tax (of $5 or under) calculated on the return. Such amounts will be refunded if the person so requests (section 48).

### Penalties (Sections 62 to 74)

### Offences (Section 62)

Certain offences relate specifically to GST; others are similar to those in the Income Tax Act 1976. Those relating specifically to GST include:

*   failure to register as required;
*   failure to keep proper records;
*   issuing a false or erroneous tax invoice;
*   failure to issue a tax invoice when requested by the recipient of goods and services;
*   tax being unlawfully charged by a person who is NOT registered.

A variable scale of maximum fines has been adopted and the penalties increase for second and subsequent offences.

For Example:

*   Failure to notify the Commissioner of any matter as required
*   Failure to keep proper records

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| first offence | $2,000 |
| second offence | $4,000 |
| subsequent | $6,000 |

*   Refuses or fails to furnish any return or information
*   Fails to provide a tax invoice

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| first offence | $ 500 PER MONTH OF DEFAULT |
| second offence | $ 750 PER MONTH OF DEFAULT |
| subsequent | $1,000 PER MONTH OF DEFAULT |

Fails to register, makes false statements, knowingly issues incorrect tax invoices, etc,

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| first offence | $15,000 |
| second offence | $25,000. |

### Employees of Corporate Bodies (Section 63)

This provision makes it an offence for certain officers and employees of a Corporate body to fail to lodge returns, provide information, etc. Without this provision it would be more difficult to establish liability of corporate entities for such failure.

### Penal Tax (Sections 67 to 74)

The provisions for imposing penal tax are the same as those applying to income tax.

### General (Sections 75 to 81)

### Record-Keeping (Section 75)

The requirements are similar to those in the Income Tax Act 1976, but in addition require the retention of tax invoices, credit notes and debit notes.

The retention period is 10 years from the end of the taxable period to which they relate.

### Avoidance (section 76)

This general anti-avoidance provision serves a similar role to section 99 of the Income Tax Act 1976. In addition, it will prevent companies of other persons from artificially splitting their activity into branches in an attempt to take advantage of the registration threshold of $24,000, the payments basis, or the longer return period option.

### The effect of the imposition of the tax (Section 78)

The imposition of the tax does have an effect on certain fixed contracts and statutory charges. The tax can be added to the contract price UNLESS the contract EXPRESSLY PROVIDES that the price will not be affected by the imposition of the tax or any change to the rate of tax. There is also provision for the supplier to recover the tax from the recipient of goods and services.

### Disclosure of Information (Section 79)

This section provides for the Customs Department and the Inland Revenue Department to exchange information relevant to their respective revenue gathering functions.

### Transitional Provisions (Sections 82 to 85)

The transitional provisions cover four major aspects of, the change over to a GST regime. These are:

*   Registration of taxpayers
*   Deduction for sales tax already paid
*   Certain supplies made PRIOR to 1 October 1986
*   Certain contracts entered into ON OR BEFORE 20 August 1985.

### Registration (Section 82)

The Act contains criteria for EARLY REGISTRATION of persons prior to the introduction of the GST in October 1986. Essentially, persons must register if they expect to make supplies of more than $24,000 IN THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 1986 (or can reasonably expect to have such a turnover in the 12 months following 30 September 1986). The Department's aim is to register these persons by 31 AUGUST 1986. FAILURE of a person to register by 31 August 1986 is an offence.

### Credit for Sales Tax (Section 83)

A FULL CREDIT will be given to registered persons for Sales Tax paid on TRADING STOCK AND STATIONERY held at 30 September 1986. Such stock and stationery will need to have been acquired or used for a "taxable activity". If it was acquired or used to make EXEMPT supplies NO credit will be given. Neither will credit be given for any Sales Tax incurred in the purchase of goods which form part of the depreciable capital of a business. Refer also to page 66 of this commentary.

### Supplies made prior to 1 October 1986 (Section 84)

Where the "time of supply" rules (section 9) determine the time of supply to be:

*   PRIOR to 1 October 1986 but the delivery/performance of the supply does not occur until ON OR AFTER that date; or
*   ON OR AFTER 1 October 1986 and the delivery/performance of the supply occurs PRIOR to that date,

the time of supply is deemed to be the time WHEN THE GOODS ARE DELIVERED OF MADE AVAILABLE OR THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED.

**Example:** A one year subscription to a magazine covering July 1986 to June 1987 issues will be taxable to the extent of those magazines supplied ON AND AFTER the 1st of October 1986 - IRRESPECTIVE of when the subscription is paid or invoiced. If 3 magazines are supplied prior to 1 October 1986 and the remaining 9 are supplied AFTER that date, only 9/12ths of the subscription value is subject to GST. (For the following year's subscription (July - June 1988) the time of supply is determined solely by reference to the rules in section 9.)

As a result of these provisions some suppliers may need to increase charges when setting subscriptions covering the period after 1 October 1986.

Where goods are supplied under an "AGREEMENT TO HIRE" such supply is deemed to be a supply of SERVICES (section 84(2)). This measure is necessary to prevent goods hired or leased just prior to 1 October 1986 from avoiding the tax because of the "time of performance" rules relating to goods (section 84(1)(a)).

**Example:** If a car is leased and taken PRIOR to 1 October 1986 and payment is not due until AFTER 1 October 1986 then the supply would, under the usual time of supply rules of section 9(3)(a), be deemed to take place when PAYMENT becomes due. By deeming the supply of the leased goods to be a "service", the liability to tax is governed by the time the service is PERFORMED, ie, it remains taxable as to the period AFTER 1 October 1986.

Where any goods or services are deemed to be supplied ON OR AFTER 1 October 1986 in accordance with section 84, and invoicing or payment has occurred PRIOR to 1 October 1986, the GST will have to be brought to account AS IF the invoicing or payment occurred on 1 October 1986 (section 84(3)(b)).

Where a supply of goods, being a building or civil engineering work is deemed to take place on or after 1 October 1986, the value for GST purposes will EXCLUDE all work and materials PERMANENTLY INCORPORATED IN OR FIXED ON THE SITE AS AT THE USE OF THE 30TH DAY OF SEPTEMBER 1986 (section 84(4)).

### Certain Contracts entered into on or before 20 August 1985 (Section 85)

For contracts entered into on or before 20 August 1985 the supplies made will be zero-rated if that contract is "NON-REVIEWABLE", ie, the terms of the contract will not allow the agreed price to be altered by the imposition of GST. (This provision applies regardless of whether or not delivery, invoicing or payment occur on or after 1 October 1986.) Deductions for "input" tax can, however, be claimed in the usual way.

For all "REVIEWABLE" contracts entered into on or before 20 August 1985 the supply will be taxable at 10% only if it is made AFTER the contract price has been reviewed and only if the review takes place AFTER 1 October 1986. (Any review which takes place after 20 August 1985 but before 1 October 1986 will mean GST is payable on any supplies made ON AND AFTER 1 October 1986.)

### Contracts entered into after 20 August 1985

For such contracts the time of invoicing of or payment for the supply will determine whether or not tax is chargeable. It will, however, be necessary to apply the "transitional" provisions (section 84) to any supply made which spans the introduction date.

### Section VI - Special Topics

### Second-hand Goods

Paragraph (c) of the definition of "input tax" (in section 2 of the Act) refers to an amount calculated by applying the tax fraction (one-eleventh) to the price of SECOND-HAND "non-taxable" goods bought by a registered person. The goods would be, in effect, non-taxable only if the SUPPLIER was not a registered person (or the goods were PRIVATE assets of a registered person, eg, goods NOT associated with that registered person's taxable activity).

The effect of this measure is that one-eleventh of the price paid for the purchase of the second-hand goods can be claimed as "input tax" and offset against output tax in the registered person's return. The second-hand goods will, probably, have been subject to GST when they were purchased "new". When the goods are sold again by the registered person the gross margin ("added value") is all that is subject to GST.

**Example:** A book shop owner purchases used books from a university student for $55. The shop owner may deduct one-eleventh of the purchase (ie $5) as input tax.

### Agents (Section 60)

It is recognised that in agency arrangements the supply is made by or to the principal and not the agent.

The agent may nevertheless issue a tax invoice on behalf of his principal (where the principal is a registered person), and may request a tax invoice when purchasing on behalf of his principal. The agent is required to maintain sufficient records, in respect of such tax invoices, to enable the Inland Revenue Department to trace the principal on whose behalf the transaction was entered into.

Where the agent is registered, he will be required to charge and account for tax on his commission.

### Auctioneers (Sections 60(4) and (5))

In an auction, bidders who are registered persons will need to know whether the purchases they make are taxable supplies (ie whether they can get a tax invoice). In order for all the sales at the auction to be treated in the same way, the Act therefore allows the auctioneer to treat ALL sales as taxable IF THE PRINCIPALS AGREE. If the principal IS UNREGISTERED, the tax collected is paid to the Department by the auctioneer. Where the principal is REGISTERED, the GST is passed to the principal and is accounted for by the principal in the normal way. It must be emphasised that this is an OPTIONAL approach. If either the principal or auctioneer choose not to adopt this approach, then the only sale upon which tax MUST be charged is a sale on behalf of a registered person in the course of that person's taxable activity.

The BIDDING at auction may be done on either a tax-inclusive or tax-exclusive basis - the latter will involve the tax being added onto the successful bid, probably when payment is made. It is expected that each auctioneer will decide on the approach that suits him best. The commission charged by the auctioneer is, of course, subject to GST if the auctioneer is registered.

### Non-profit Bodies (Sections 14(B) 19(2) and 52(5))

Three specific concessions are available to these bodies. The concessions are

1.  Where goods or services are DONATED TO the non-profit body, their subsequent sale BY THE NON-PROFIT BODY will be EXEMPT (section 14). The sale will, of course, have to be in the course of a NON-PROFIT taxable activity. The body will be unable to claim any tax credit relating directly to the sale, but note that the de minimis rule in section 21(1) will apply in some cases.
2.  To prevent the need for registration non-profit bodies may, in certain circumstances, treat each local branch separately and thus take advantage of the $24,000 turnover threshold. Each branch must maintain an independent accounting system, and be identifiable by its activities or its location (section 51(5)). The "splitting" of business activities to get under the $24,000 threshold is NOT available to any other organisation or person. The anti-avoidance provisions (section 76) will prevent any such splitting.
3.  They are automatically entitled to adopt the payments basis of accounting for GST.

### Hire Purchase

Section 9(3)(b) provides that, where goods are supplied under a hire purchase agreement. the time of supply is the date upon which THE AGREEMENT IS ENTERED INTO.

The value of the supply under a hire purchase agreement is deemed to be the "CASH price" (section 10(5)). As with all other credit contracts, the cash price of the contract (ie the price charged EXCLUDING finance charges) is deemed to be the "consideration in money" for the supply. The "cash price" is treated as a tax-INCLUSIVE selling price and the GST content is arrived at by applying the tax fraction (one-eleventh) to that cash price.

The GST on hire purchase transactions must be brought to account in the return for the taxable period during which the agreement was entered into irrespective of the accounting basis being used.

There are three different situations in which hire purchase agreements are made:

1.  A retailer sells a good under a hire purchase agreement under which only the retailer and the purchaser are parties. The purchaser makes payments to the retailer until "title" in the goods passes to the purchaser on the making of the last payment. In this case the RETAILER must account for GST on the supply AT THE TIME THE AGREEMENT IS ENTERED INTO.  
    **Examples**
    1.  Retailer sells good by hire purchase to purchaser who is not registered.
        *   Cash price (tax-inclusive) = $2,750 (GST = one-eleventh = $250) Retailer to account for $250 GST ("output tax") ("Input tax" credit is NOT available to the purchaser)
    2.  Retailer sells good by hire purchase to purchaser who is registered
        *   Cash price (tax-inclusive) $2,750 (GST = one-eleventh = $250) Retailer to account for $250 GST (= "Output tax") ("Input tax" credit of $250 IS available to the purchaser)
2.  A retailer, having negotiated a sale to a consumer, sells the good to a finance company who then sells that good to the consumer under a hire purchase agreement. The consumer makes the periodic payments to the finance company until such time (on the making of the last payment) that title in the goods passes to the consumer. In these circumstances there are two taxable supplies of the good in question:
    1.  One from the retailer to the finance company, charged and accounted for by the retailer. The time of supply and accounting basis are covered by the normal rules. NOTE:The retailer in this case is not a party to the hire purchase agreement so the "general" time of supply rules will apply.
    2.  Another supply, by way of hire purchase, from the finance company to the consumer. The finance company must account for GST on the supply in the return for the taxable period during which the agreement was entered into.
3.  **NOTE:** The finance company is entitled to an "input tax" credit for the GST charged to it in (a) above, on the assumption that it will register in respect of its taxable activity of supplying goods.
4.  **Example:** RETAILER SELLS good to finance company
    *   Price (tax-inclusive) = $2,750 (GST = one-eleventh = $250)
    *   Retailer to account for $250 GST (= "Output tax") ("Input tax" credit of $250 Is available to the finance company)
5.  FINANCE COMPANY SELLS good by hire purchase to purchaser who is NOT registered. Finance company to account for $250 GST (= "Output tax") ("Input tax" credit is not available to the purchaser) NOTE:Where finance company sells to a purchaser who is registered then that registered person may claim the "input tax" credit, if the purchase relates to his business.
6.  A retailer sells a good to a purchaser under a hire purchase agreement to which the retailer and purchaser are parties. THE RETAILER THEN ASSIGNS HIS RIGHT, TITLE AND INTEREST IN THE HIRE PURCHASE AGREEMENT TO A FINANCE COMPANY for a consideration equal to the amount UNPAID by the consumer. The purchaser then makes the periodic payments under the hire purchase agreement TO THE FINANCE COMPANY until such time (on the making of the last payment) that title in the goods passes to the consumer. In this case there are again TWO supplies but only ONE is taxable:
    1.  The sale of the good under a have purchase agreement BY THE RETAILER is a taxable supply and THE RETAILER MUST ACCOUNT FOR GST (in the return for the taxable period during which the agreement was entered into). (See examples (a) and (b) under paragraph (1) above.)
    2.  The "ASSIGNMENT" OF the hire purchase agreement is an exempt supply (refer section 3(1)(c)). Retailer assigns hire purchase agreement for $2,750 (less any deposit that may have been paid) to finance company
        *   exempt from GST.

### Repossession

Under a hire purchase agreement the person who holds the agreement (ie retailer or finance company) and also has title to the goods, has the right to repossess those goods if the consumer defaults in payment. When this action is taken the goods are usually resold by the person holding title and the proceeds are taken by the "repossessor" in satisfaction of the whole or part of the debt outstanding.

This RESALE by the person holding title to the goods will be a taxable supply upon which that person will again have to account for GST.

1.  Purchaser is a registered person
2.  The passing of possession (NOT title) from the original purchaser to the "repossessor" is a SUPPLY of a good. The value of that supply is arrived at by the application of the rules in section 10 the Act. Since the basis of the repossession is that a part of the debt outstanding will be "satisfied" by the proceeds of the "resale". the "repossession" by the finance company or retailer will be treated as a supply by the original purchaser for a consideration in money. The amount of the consideration will be the amount eventually recovered by the resale. As this amount is not determined AT THE TIME OF REPOSSESSION, the provisions of section 9(6) apply. The supply (repossession) is deemed to take place to the extent that, and at the time payment for that second sale is due or is received. The result is that the defaulting purchaser (a registered person) has to pay GST (as "output tax") on the "deemed" supply (the repossession) to take account of the forgiveness of his debt. The finance company or retailer will be credited with having paid the GST as "input tax" on this deemed supply (note they have already accounted for this portion of the output GST on the first sale). If the repossession and resale do NOT satisfy all of the original debt and the retailer finance or company is left with a "bad debt", then provision exists under section 26 to adjust a future return to recover the GST already paid. The actual "resale" of the repossessed goods constitutes another supply of course, so the retailer or finance company has to account for and return one-eleventh of the selling price as "output tax".
3.  Purchaser is not a registered person Where the purchaser is not a registered person THE REPOSSESSION constitutes "the supply of second-hand goods" for which the repossessor will be entitled to deduct (as "input tax") one-eleventh of that amount of debt subsequently "satisfied" by the resale. (See page 80 re Second-Hand Goods). As in (5) above, the actual "resale" of the repossessed goods constitutes another supply so the retailer or finance company has to account for and return one-eleventh of the selling price as "output tax".

### "Pre-incorporation" Contracts

In setting up a company, expenses are likely to be incurred which will include GST. For a company which is "up and running" such GST content would be offset as "input tax".

Legally, there is no entity in existence before a company is incorporated and this situation creates a problem when the newly incorporated company wishes to claim back expenses incurred "before it existed".

It is also clear that a company cannot be registered for GST before its incorporation because no "company" as such exists, and something which does not exist cannot trade. The promoter (person setting up the company) is personally liable under any contract entered into prior to incorporation.

Section 22 of the Act allows a company to claim any input tax on goods and services acquired before the company's incorporation by any person (usually a promoter) who subsequently becomes a member of the company where the goods and services were acquired in connection with the incorporation and for the taxable activity the company would be carrying on once incorporated. The newly incorporated company is DEEMED to be the recipient of the goods or services originally supplied to the promotor and likewise is deemed to have paid the tax. This provision is subject to a number of conditions listed in the proviso to section 22 but in any case, the promotor must have been reimbursed by the company in respect of those pre-incorporation costs.

### Racing

Only a certain proportion of any bet placed RELATES TO SERVICES RECEIVED by the person placing the bet. The remainder of the bet RELATES TO PRIZES PAID OUT. If there is a $1 bet placed, and 80c is paid out in prizes, ONLY THE 20 CENTS RETAINED BY THE ORGANISER will be charged with GST.

For this reason there is a special provision in the GST Act (section 5(8)) whereby the supply is deemed to be made in part by the Racing Club, TAB and the New Zealand Racing Authority respectively.

The TIME of supply (section 9(2)(d)) is set by reference to the Racing Act 1971. The SUPPLY OF SERVICES does not take place when the bet is made, but only takes place when the deductions are made as provided in the Racing Act 1971 (levies etc).

The consideration for the supply (ie the total deductions) is split between the three organisations mentioned above. (This is done because of the structuring of the racing system pursuant to the Racing Act 1971).

### Lotteries and Raffles

As mentioned above prize money is not subject to GST. Only the "services" portion of the payment for raffle tickets and lottery tickets will be subject to GST; the proportion that is to be paid back in prizes will NOT be subject to tax.

Section 5(10) of the GST Act deems a supply of services to occur where a person pays any amount of money to participate in a New Zealand lottery, New Zealand prize competition, lottery, prize competition, or game of chance. The person or body who organises it, pursuant to the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977, is deemed to have supplied the services.

The Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977 covers the following:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| New Zealand lotteries | \- Golden and Mammoth Kiwis only; |
| New Zealand prize competitions. |     |
| Games of chance | \- includes Roulette, Crown and Anchor, Unders and Overs, Pontoon and Rodeo Raceway.  <br>\- also includes Housie which is governed by the Housie Regulations 1975.  <br>\- also includes games of chance played by means of an amusement device such as video machines, pinball machines, flipball; |
| Prize competitions | \- includes Spot the Ball, similar newspaper competitions, duplicate bridge, snooker. |

The TIME of any supply in respect of lotteries, games of change, etc, is when the first drawing occurs (section 9(2)(e)). If there is more than one drawing of prizes for any lottery or other competition, the liability to pay GST arises on the date of the first drawing. The time of supply for games of chance played BY MEANS OF A GAMING MACHINE OR AN AMUSEMENT DEVICE OR SIMILAR COIN OPERATED MACHINE is when the machine IS EMPTIED OF ITS COINS OR TOKENS (section 9(2)(f)).

The CONSIDERATION for a supply is the total proceeds of the sale of tickets, LESS all prizes payable in CASH in respect of that lottery or other competition (section 10(14)). The person or body who conducts the lottery or any other competition must account for GST on the sum that is left. Tax on purchases of non-money prizes will be deductible as input tax in the normal manner.

NOTE: Where any SELLING agent is paid commission, he must charge GST on this amount, and give a tax invoice to the person who pays the commission to him (for example the New Zealand Lottery Board). The Lottery Board can then claim an "input" credit for the GST paid on the commission, and the selling agent accounts for the GST charged on the Commission.

### Provision of Credit

Financial services are exempt from GST under section 14. Included in the definition of financial services (in section 3) is "the provision of credit under a "credit contract", ("credit contract" is defined in the Credit Contracts Act 1981). That term essentially encompasses all agreements that provide for the supply of goods or services where payment will occur at a later stage and at a price in excess of the "cash price" (ie the price if payment were made without credit being supplied).

In general, however, transactions involving a penalty for late payment (such as ordinary business credit) do not constitute credit contracts even though the total amount paid may exceed the cash price. In such cases where the excess is charged on a default by the purchaser, the full amount charged, including any penalty, is taxable.

### Inputs Used for Private or Exempt Purposes

#### Deduction of Tax on Purchases

In order for a deduction to be made of the GST included in the purchase, the goods or services must be acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies.

If this test is satisfied, the tax component of the purchase is deductible IN FULL (subject only to the accounting basis rules) as input tax. This is the case even where those goods and services are, at the time of purchase, intended for partial use in some private of exempt activity, or where they are subsequently used only for such an activity.

Where goods and services are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies and are used ONLY for such purposes, the full deduction for input tax is made and no subsequent adjustment is necessary.

#### Adjustment for Ongoing Private/Exempt Use

Where goods and services are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies but are used partly for private or other exempt purposes on an on-going basis, the full deduction for input tax is made and an adjustment is required to be made in each return period in which such private/exempt use occurs.

Section 21(1) of the Act requires that where such goods and services are used for private/exempt purposes a supply occurs TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE SO USED and that supply is valued at the lesser of cost or open market value.

In practice, this means that for each return period some portion of the cost (or open market value if lower) of the good of service supplied must be included as an adjustment on the output tax side. For example, where a motorcar purchased for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies is also used on an on-going basis for making exempt supplies the adjustment to be made in a return period might be calculated as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Full purchase price (incl GST) | $33,000 |
| Cost attributable to each year of effective life of vehicle (5 years,on a straight-line basis) on a straight-line basis) | $6,600 |
| Cost attributable to any two-month return period (1/6th of annual "cost") | $1,100 |
| Proportion of exempt use in period | 30% |
| "Cost" of section 21(1) supply (incl GST) | $330 |
| One-eleventh to be included in return box 6 | $30 |

The above example indicates one way in which the adjustment may be made in a situation where the extent of private/exempt use may be fairly readily ascertained. For purchases such as general office overheads where the extent of private/exempt use may not be so apparent, an adjustment based on some indirect method (such as turnover) may be acceptable.

A more comprehensive series of guidelines will be available shortly, however it can be assumed that the Department will accept alternative methods of calculating the required adjustments provided that they yeild an acceptable result.

#### Adjustment for Full Private/Exempt use after Purchase

Where goods and services are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies and are subsequently used ONLY for private/exempt purposes, the full deduction for input tax is made at the time of purchase and an adjustment is required at the time of transfer to the private/exempt use.

As is the situation with ongoing partial private/exempt use, the supply that is deemed to occur when the goods and services are applied wholly for private/exempt purposes are valued at the lesser of cost or open market value in relation to that application.

For the purposes of valuing this type of supply, the cost is likely to be determined on the basis of the original cost price, less some proportion based on the unexpired portion of the economic life of the asset (ie, the book value under straight-line depreciation). Open market value will be as at the time of the application for private/exempt purposes.

#### Adjustment not Required

The adjustments outlined above are NOT required to be undertaken in respect of goods and services used for exempt purposes where it is expected that in the next 12 months the total value of exempt supplies will be less than $48,000 AND will be less than 5 percent of the value of all supplies made.

Further details of the determination of the required adjustments will be released shortly. Refer also to page 61 of this commentary.

### Private/Exempt Inputs Used in the Taxable Activity

As explained above, in order for a deduction to be made of the GST included in a purchase, the goods or services must be acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Where the purchase fails this test, no deduction is allowed at the time of purchase.

Recognising that some credit for input tax should be allowed if goods and services purchased principally for purposes OTHER than making taxable supplies are subsequently applied for that use, section 21(5) allows a deduction from output tax of one-eleventh (the tax fraction) of the lesser of the cost or open market value of the supply made to the taxable activity.

As with inputs used for private or exempt purposes, an adjustment will be made both where there is ongoing business use of a private/exempt purchase and where the good or service is fully applied for taxable activity purposes subsequent to the purchase. Accordingly, the determination of the amount of the adjustment to be made will be done in a similar manner.

The Department will shortly be releasing guidelines on the methods of determining the amount of adjustment that should be included in each return. Refer also to page 65 of this commentary.

### GST and Income Tax

The following discussion outlines the options for the treatment of GST for income tax purposes. As such, this will mainly be of direct interest to Chartered Accountants in public Practice. It is understood that the NZ Society of Accountants is currently examining this issue with a view to promulgating an Accounting Standard discussing in more detail accounting for GST for income tax purposes.

#### Non Registered Persons

Non-registered persons will account for income tax purposes for GST on a tax inclusive basis. This means

*   All taxable income will be tax inclusive.
*   All deductible expenditure will be tax inclusive.
*   Depreciation will be calculated on the tax inclusive cost of the assets.

#### Registered Persons

Registered persons will have two approaches available for dealing with GST for income tax purposes. These are:

1.  Tax exclusive approach.
2.  Tax inclusive approach.

Under the tax exclusive approach GST would be totally eliminated from all items for income tax purposes.

All taxable income would be tax exclusive.

*   All deductible expenditure would be tax exclusive.
*   Depreciation would be calculated on the tax exclusive cost of the assets.
*   Payments of GST to the Inland Revenue Department would not be deductible and refunds of GST from the Inland Revenue Department would not be assessable.

Under the tax inclusive approach GST would be eliminated from the cost of assets and therefore depreciation calculations.

*   All taxable income would be tax inclusive.
*   All deductible expenditure would be tax inclusive.
*   Depreciation would be calculated on the tax exclusive cost of the assets.
*   Payments of GST to the Inland Revenue Department would be deductible and refunds of GST from the Inland Revenue Department would be assessable after the netting off of GST on transactions involving capital assets.

Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1986
=========================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1986 from PIB vol 147 Jul 1986.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 147, July 1986

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)

This Bulletin is a commentary on the GST Amendment Act 1986 which became law on 8th of August 1986.

The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 became law on 3 December 1985. Since that time a number of drafting errors have been detected and further work has been done on identifying areas where the existing legislation does not accurately reflect the underlying policy. The GST amendment Act 1986 remedies these areas which have been identified since the Goods and Services Tax Act was passed.

This bulletin is intended as a basic technical explanation of the provisions of the Amendment Act. It follows the order of the provisions of the Amendment Act with cross-references to the corresponding section of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 in each heading and where appropriate in the text.

Please note that any inquiries should be directed to the District Office which holds the record of the registered person to which the query relates. They should not be directed to Head Office. District Office staff will be happy to assist with any problems or questions you may have.

### Significant Changes

Many of the amendments contained in the GST Amendment Act 1986 are of a minor nature to correct drafting errors, or to ensure that the legislation more accurately reflects the intention of Government. Significant changes have been made in the following areas:

*   amendments to the definition of "commercial dwelling" and changes to the method of valuing stays of longer than 4 weeks.
*   standardising open market value as the GST inclusive value.
*   zero-rating of exported goods where no entry for export is made.
*   zero-rating of the domestic element of the international transportation of goods and passengers.
*   the zero-rating of the supply of fine metal by a refiner to a dealer in fine metal. Those supplies that are not zero-rated are exempt supplies under section 14 of the GST Act.
*   restricting the application of section 11(2)(e) of the GST Act to services where the benefit of those services is enjoyed overseas.
*   Road User Charges paid on or after 1 December 1986 will be fully taxable.
*   modification to the exemption of rental of domestic housing to cover cases where a ground rent is paid to a landlord for the land on which a dwelling is erected.
*   ensuring that registered persons with one or six-monthly return periods have the same rights as registered persons with two-monthly return periods.
*   clarification of the provision which allows the Commissioner to extend the time for the filing of GST returns by non-profit bodies, where special circumstances apply.
*   increasing the threshold for use of the payments basis of accounting to $500,000.
*   a secondhand goods credit will not be allowed upon the supply of any fine metal.
*   allowing registered persons to make a one-off adjustment for private or exempt use of capital assets with a value of less than $10,000.
*   removal of the need for the address of the supplier to be shown on a tax invoice.
*   various amendments to apply the same conditions to debit and credit notes as are applied to tax invoices allowing companies to group with persons other than companies.
*   allowing a registered agent to claim input tax on behalf of a non-resident, non-registered principal in relation to the exportation or importation of goods.
*   deeming the supply of services over a period to be continuously and uniformly performed over that period (for the purposes of the transitional provisions)
*   redrafting the transitional provision relating to the supply of buildings and civil engineering works to ensure that it only applies to the supply of goods in the form of construction, major reconstruction, manufacture, or extension of a building or a civil engineering work after 1 October 1986 under a written contract entered into prior to 1 October 1986.
*   redefining reviewable and non-reviewable contracts.
*   allowing an alternative method of accounting for transitional supplies to registered persons who use the payments basis.

### Section 1 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Short Title and Commencement

#### Comment

This section simply ensures that the Act is known as the GST Amendment Act 1986 and has the same application date as the GST Act itself (ie, December 1985).

### Section 2 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Interpretation Section 2 of the GST Act 1985

### Section 2(1) Associated Persons

#### Amendment

This amends the definition of associated persons to include a company and a shareholder with more than a 10% interest in that company.

#### Comment

The GST Act provided a special valuation rule for supplies made to "associated persons". That term was defined in the GST Act through section 67 of the Income Tax Act 1976 to include any person holding a 25% or greater interest (in terms of shareholding or paid-up capital) in a company.

The Act also provided a special valuation rule in respect of supplies made to employees, where those supplies were fringe benefits and were subject to FBT. However, FBT does not apply to shareholder employees with 10% or more of the shareholding or control of that company.

No special valuation rule, therefore, was provided for persons with shareholdings between 10% and 25% in any company.

Those persons would, in the absence of this amendment, have been able to receive supplies from the company at less than cost, or free, and would have paid less (or no) GST than they should on that consumption. They would also have escaped GST on the value of any fringe benefit.

### Section 2(2) and 2(3) Commercial Dwellings

#### Amendment

Section 2(2) and 2(3) of the Amendment Act amend the definition of "commercial dwelling" to exclude hospitals.

#### Comment

These amendments mean that long term accommodation in a hospital will not be subject to the valuation provision contained in section 10(6) of the GST Act except to the extent that the hospital is a "residential establishment". This will mean that long term accommodation in a geriatric ward, for example, will be subject to the special valuation provision.

Hospitals were included as "commercial dwellings" in order to recognise the element of accommodation supplied to patients. This treatment has been reviewed, given that the accommodation is incidental to medical treatment, and that there could be compliance difficulties for hospitals in separately charging for:

1.  accommodation ("domestic goods and services") and
2.  other services such as medical, meals, etc.

In recognising these compliance difficulties, hospitals are now excluded from the commercial dwelling definition, except to the extent that the hospital is a "residential establishment". A definition of "hospital" is contained in section 2(8) of the Amendment Act.

### Section 2(4) Consideration

#### Amendment

This specifically excludes from the definition of "consideration" unconditional gifts made to non-profit bodies.

#### Comment

As far as possible donations received should not form part of the amount on which registered persons should calculate and pay GST. To do otherwise might seriously affect the fund-raising capacity of churches and other non-profit bodies.

In drafting the Act it was therefore necessary to give effect to that policy, while at the same time giving a broad meaning to the word "consideration", which is a key concept in the tax.

This concept must be wide enough to include payments made under a statute (eg local authority rates), or voluntarily, as well as payments under contractual obligations. It is the aspect of voluntary payments which gives the most difficulty. While the tax must not be subject to avoidance through the device of turning fees for services into "donations", there is a conceptual line between that and the case of pure gifts which involve no direct or indirect flow of a benefit to the donor. Thus, while the tax ought to apply to school activity fees, or Lottery Board grants, which are direct payments for the consumption of goods and services, it ought not to apply to donations given in a street appeal, or to bequests made to non-profit bodies.

The amendment gives effect to this policy by excluding unfettered gifts made otherwise than in the course of carrying on a taxable activity, and where no identifiable valuable benefit flows back to the donor or any associated person.

### Section 2(5) Input Tax

#### Amendment

This amends the definition of "input tax" in Section 2 of the GST Act to limit the consideration for the purchase of secondhand goods from associated persons to the lesser of purchase price or open market value.

#### Comment

This amendment was necessary as it became apparent that a registered person could have acquired secondhand goods from an associated person at a price that was deliberately inflated and have obtained an increased input tax credit.

The addition of the proviso to the definition of input tax that deems the consideration in money to be equal to the lesser of the purchase price or the open market value has removed this anomaly.

### Section 2(6) Resident

#### Amendment

This amends the definition of "resident" to include an unincorporated body of persons which has its centre of administrative management in Hew Zealand.

#### Comment

The residency rules were based on those in the Income Tax Act, which itself contains no rule relating to unincorporated bodies, partnerships or trusts. This amendment closes that gap by deeming such bodies to be resident in New Zealand if any taxable activity is carried on here or if the centre of administrative management is in New Zealand.

### Section 2(7) Secondhand Goods

#### Amendment

This amends the term "secondhand goods" to exclude any "fine metal" from this definition. It also excludes any goods manufactured or made from gold, silver or platinum, or any other substance which, if they were of the required fineness, would be "fine metal".

#### Comment

This amendment denies an imputed credit for the purchase of gold, silver and platinum by excluding "fine metal" from the definition of secondhand goods. This is a consequential amendment due to changes made by subsections 9(3) and 12(3) of the Amendment Act.

### Section 2(8) Tax Payable

#### Amendment

This extends the definition of "tax payable" to specifically include tax refundable pursuant to sections 19 and 20 of the GST Act.

#### Comment

Section 27 of the GST Act allowed the Commissioner to issue an assessment in respect of "tax payable" but it was not clear whether this allowed an assessment to be issued in any case where a refund occurred. The amendment clarifies this and ensures that the Department can issue assessments for refund returns.

### Section 2(9) Definitions of "Dealer in Fine Metal", "Fine Metal", "New Fine Metal", "Refiner of Fine Metal"

#### Amendment

This provides definitions of "Dealer in Fine Metal", "Fine Metal", "New Fine Metal", "Refiner of Fine Metal". These are necessary due to changes made in the following sections of the Amendment Act:

*   Section 2(7) The definition of "secondhand goods" excludes "Fine metal" from being a secondhand good, therefore an imputed tax credit cannot be claimed upon its purchase by a registered person from a non-registered person.
*   Section 9(3) Zero-rates the first supply after the refining of "New fine metal" by the refiner to a "Dealer in fine metal", where that "Fine metal" is an investment item.
*   Section 12(3) Amends section 14 of the GST Act to exempt any supply of "Fine metal" which is not zero-rated.

#### Comment

The definition of "Dealer in fine metal" is intended to cover persons whose principal business activity is to purchase and supply "Fine metal" as an investment item. Basically these are the gold, silver and platinum traders who sell "fine metals" to the public.

The definition of "Fine metal" includes gold, in any form which is of a fineness not less than 99.5 percent and silver and platinum which are of a fineness not less than 99.9 percent and 99.0 percent respectively. This definition also provides that the Governor-General can declare any other substance to be a "Fine metal".

The definition of "New fine metal" covers any "Fine metal" which has been refined into that state.

The definition of "Refiner of fine metal" is designed to cover persons whose business it is to convert or refine any "Fine metal".

### Section 2(9) Definition of "Hospital" and "Residential Establishment"

#### Amendment

This provides definitions of "Hospital" and "Residential establishment".

#### Comment

1.  The definition of "Hospital" is required for the purposes of excluding hospitals from the definition of "commercial dwelling" (refer section 2(3)).
2.  The definition of "Residential establishment" is intended to include as commercial dwellings those which specialise in long-term stays; for example school and university hostels, boarding houses, hospices and rest homes. This also includes any part of a hospital so used, eg a geriatric ward. This definition is used in a new proviso to section 10(6) of the GST Act which is inserted by section 8(6) of the Amendment Act. Further comments are contained in the commentary on section 8(6).

**Section 2(9) Definition of "Unconditional Gift"**

#### Amendment

This provides a definition of "Unconditional gift".

#### Comment

The definition of "Unconditional gift" is necessary in the light of the amendment to the definition of "consideration" contained in section 2(4) of the Amendment Act.

The definition of "unconditional gift" is designed to cover genuine donations to non-profit bodies.

Note that "no identifiable direct valuable benefit" may be received by either the person making the payment or an associated person. Thus club membership subscriptions described as donations are not "unconditional gifts".

Donations in church collection plates, donations made in door-to-door appeals; voluntary contributions made to museums etc will all qualify as unconditional gifts.

**Note** that in this context "valuable" means capable of being valued.

### Section 3 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Financial Services Section 3 the GST Act 1985

### Section 3(1) Payment or Collection of Interest Dividends and Principal

#### Amendment

This inserts a further paragraph, (ka), in section 3(1) of the GST Act, to specifically include the payment or collection of interest, dividends and principal in the definition of "financial services".

#### Comment

It was previously unclear whether the act of paying or collecting interest, dividends, and principal was an exempt activity. This amendment remedies this, and also extends the meaning of exempt activities to activities such as the handling of investment funds, thereby ensuring that charges made for such activities are exempt.

### Section 3(2) Consequential Amendment

#### Amendment

This amendment is consequential to the amendment contained in section 3(1) and provides that AGREEING TO DO, or ARRANGING the payment or collection of interest, dividends and principal will be exempt.

#### Comment

This change brings the arranging of activities covered by the new paragraph (ka) within the scope of the financial services exemption.

### Section 4 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Open Market Value Section 4 of the GST Act 1985

#### Amendment

This changes the definition of "Open market value" from being exclusive of GST to being inclusive of GST.

#### Comment

This amendment brings open market value into line with the normal valuation rules contained in the GST Act, in that open market value is tax inclusive. This change is only of technical importance.

Consequential amendments have been made as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Section of Amendment Act** | **Section of GST Act** |
| 8(1) | 10(2)(b) |
| 8(2) | 10(3) |
| 8(7) | 10(8) |

### Section 5 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Meaning of "Supply" Section 5 of the GST Act 1985

### Section 5(1) Transport Licensing Fees

#### Amendment

This inserts a new section 5(6A) in the GST Act. This section deems any registration fee or annual licence fee paid pursuant to sections 7(3) or 10(2) of the Transport (Vehicle and Driver Registration and Licensing) Act 1986 to be consideration for a supply of services by the Post Office in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity (and hence subject to GST).

#### Comment

This new subsection explicitly makes the Motor Vehicle Registration and Licence fees chargeable with GST to eliminate any doubt or confusion which may have surrounded them. The Post Office will account for the GST on the fee except for that part of the fee which relates to the Accident Compensation Levy (accounted for by the ACC).

### Section 5(1) Road User Charges

#### Amendment

This inserts a new section 5(6B) in the GST Act. This section deems any Road User Charge paid on or after 1 December 1986 pursuant to section 9 of the Road User Charges Act 1977 to be a consideration for a supply of services by the National Roads Fund in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity.

#### Comment

This new subsection makes the Road User Charge liable for GST if it is paid on or after 1 December 1986. The time of that supply is when the charge is paid to the National Roads Fund pursuant to section 22(1) of the Road User Charges Act 1977. Until the 1st of December 1986, the Road User Charge is not subject to tax and is zero-rated when received by the National Roads Fund (refer to the commentaries on section 9(8) and 9(9) of the Amendment Act).

### Section 5(2) Rates

#### Amendment

This repeals the old subsection 5(7) of the GST Act and substitutes a new subsection. The new subsection ensures that while rates remain taxable, repayments of advances in the form of rates are not taxable unless they are paid in respect of goods and services supplied by the Local Authority itself.

#### Comment

A Local Authority may advance funds to a ratepayer to enable goods and services to be acquired from a third party or to pay for the supply of the goods and services by the Local Authority. Repayments of these advances are deemed to be rates. Where a Local Authority itself supplies the goods and services, the deemed rate is not a repayment of an advance but a payment for the supply of goods and services and this should be subject to GST. However, where the advance is to enable goods and services to be acquired from a third party, the deemed rate is simply a repayment of an advance and is not subject to GST.

### Section 5(3) Postage Stamps used as Consideration

#### Amendment

This inserts a new subsection (11A) in Section 5 of the GST Act, which provides that where postage stamps are used in conjunction with postal notes by a registered person as consideration for a taxable supply of goods and services, that registered person is deemed to make a taxable supply for a consideration equal to the purchase price of those stamps. The supply is deemed to take place at the time the stamps are used.

#### Comment

Potentially, registered persons who purchase stamps from the Post Office (and obtain a one-eleventh input tax credit) may then use those stamps to purchase goods and services by attaching them to standard denomination postal notes to make the note up to the purchase price of the goods. In this way, the registered person could obtain a second deduction in respect of the stamps. The amendment, which deems a supply to occur equal to the value of the postage stamps, will effectively remove this potential avenue of avoidance.

### Section 5(4) Indemnity Payments

#### Amendment

This deems the time of supply in relation to supplies deemed to be made under section 5(13) of the GST Act.

#### Comment

Section 5(13) of the GST Act deemed a supply to occur where a registered person received an indemnity payment from an insurer. No "time of supply" (for the purposes of accounting for the tax) was specified in respect of such receipts. Consistent with the time when the insurer may claim a deduction in respect of such payments, such supplies are deemed to occur at the time any payment is received by the insured.

### Section 5(5) Indemnity Payments

#### Amendment

This further amends section 5(13) of the GST Act by providing that insurance proceeds received by a registered person shall not be consideration for a supply, where the proceeds relate to a contract of insurance that is not a supply charged with tax pursuant to section 8(1) of the GST Act.

#### Comment

The legislation required registered persons to treat an insurance receipt as a tax-inclusive consideration for a supply. This was to balance the effect of giving insurers a deduction of the tax fraction of indemnity payments made. However, where a payment is made under a contract of insurance that is not a supply charged with tax under section 8(1) of the GST Act (ie, zero-rated, exempt, or not taxable) there is no need to recover tax from the insured.

The amendment therefore removes the requirement for registered persons to account for GST on indemnity or insurance payments made to them when such payments are received under an insurance contract that is not chargeable with tax under section 8(1) of the Act. This amendment covers indemnity payments received under contracts of insurance for travel, marine cargo and life insurance and also those where the insurer is not a registered person.

### Section 5(6) Refunds of Excise Duty

#### Amendment

This inserts a new subsection 5(13A) which provides that a refund of excise duty received by a registered person from the National Roads Fund shall be deemed to be consideration received for a supply of services by that registered person in the course of a taxable activity.

#### Comment

Road users licenced under the Road User Charges Act may claim a refund of the National Road Fund portion of excises paid on the purchase of motor spirits, CNG and LPG. As GST will be paid when these fuels are purchased, the National Roads Fund will need to pay a tax-inclusive refund to the road user. The amendment in section 17(11) of the Amendment Act will allow the fund to claim a one-eleventh credit of any refund paid out. This amendment merely ensures that where the recipient of that refund is registered, GST will be paid on any refund received.

### Section 6 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Taxable Activity Section 6 of the GST Act 1985

#### Amendment

This clarifies the meaning of the term "taxable activity" to ensure that the general definition has precedence over certain specialised subsidiary provisions.

#### Comment

It was suggested that supplies made through public authorities as agents would escape the terms of section 6 in certain cases since they would not be supplied by the public authority itself. This was because section 6(1)(b) appeared to have the same status as the general definition in paragraph (a).

The amendment makes it clear that paragraph (a) has precedence and that supplies made, for example by Ministers of the Crown in their official capacity, such as the issue of statutory licences, are still taxable if the general test is met.

### Section 7 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Time of Supply Section 9 of the GST Act 1985

### Section 7(1) Racing Bets

#### Amendment

The amendment to section 9(2)(d) ensures that there is consistency with sections 5(8) and 10(12) of the GST Act in respect of the time that racing clubs, the Racing Authority, and the TAB should account for tax on their activities.

#### Comment

Some doubt existed as to the extent of application of the time of supply provision for amounts dealt with under the Racing Act. The amendment is designed to clarify this and to be worded consistently with provisions of sections 5(8) and 10(12) of the GST Act.

### Section 7(2) Periodic supplies

#### Amendment

The amendment to section 9(3)(a) ensures that statutory charges for services payable on a periodic or instalment basis, are accounted for in the same manner as similar charges made pursuant to a contract.

#### Comment

Section 9(3)(a), which dealt with periodic supplies of services, previously referred only to services supplied pursuant to "agreements". This amendment ensures that statutory charges for services (such as royalties) payable in instalments will be accounted for on the same basis as similar contractual charges, ie when payment is due or received, whichever is earlier.

### Section 7(3) Successive Supplies of Goods

#### Amendment

Section 7(3) of the Amendment Act inserts a new paragraph (aa) to 9(3) of the GST Act in place of subsections 9(4) and 9(5). (Refer also to section 7(5) of the Amendment Act).

The new paragraph provides that the time of supply shall be the earlier of the date when any payment is due, is received, or in respect of which any invoice is issued for:

1.  goods which are supplied progressively or periodically and the consideration for that supply is paid in instalments relative to that progressive or periodic supply: or
2.  goods and services supplied in the construction, major reconstruction, extension or manufacture of a building or any civil engineering work and payments for that supply become due periodically as a result of the construction, major reconstruction, extension or manufacture of those goods and are in relation to the progressive nature of that work.

#### Comment

The Act contains both general and specific rules for determining when the tax on any supply of goods or services is to be accounted for by a supplier and when the recipient may claim a deduction of input tax. The general rule is that a supply is deemed to take place at the earlier of the issuing of an invoice or the receipt of any payment, regardless of whether the supply has been physically completed, eg, goods have been delivered.

Section 2 of the GST Act defines the term "invoice" widely as "a document notifying an obligation to make payment". In terms of the legislation, a written contract is usually an invoice and is sufficient to trigger the time of supply rules.

There were a number of areas in which the time of supply rules were operating to some extent at variance with normal commercial practice. More importantly, there were cases in which it would have been difficult for registered persons to comply, since the ultimate value of supply was unlikely to be known at the time of supply. Chief among these were:

1.  the building industry, which normally operates on the basis of periodic progress claims;
2.  other progressive supplies such as the supply of raw materials;
3.  in a more general context, all supplies involving delayed performance.

In each case, where a deposit was paid or an invoice was issued the whole of the GST on the supply would have been brought to account at once.

There are a number of exceptions to the general rule to deal with situations such as layby sales, hire purchase agreements and certain building contract variations.

The amending legislation now also deems a separate supply to occur in respect of contracts which provide for the periodic or progressive supply of goods and which also provide for progress payments related directly to the degree of performance of the contract.

### Section 7(4) Hire Purchase Agreements

#### Amendments to Section 9(3)(b) and 9(3)(c)(1) of the GST Act

1.  Section 7(4)(a) of the Amendment Act ensures that services supplied under a hire purchase agreement are treated in the same manner as the goods supplied under that agreement.

#### Comment

It was arguable that one time of supply rule applied to goods sold on hire purchase while other rules applied to other supplies made under an agreement, eg insurance. This meant that the tax on the goods would be accounted for at the time of the signing of the agreement, whilst services supplied under an agreement (eg insurance) would have needed to have been accounted for progressively, over the period of the agreement. This amendment ensures that all supplies are accounted for at the time of the agreement.

#### Amendment

2.  Section 7(4)(b) of the Amendment Act ensures that those agreements under which property passes or will (expressly) pass are excluded from the definition of "agreement to hire" in section 9(3)(c) of the GST Act.

#### Comment

The question had arisen as to whether section 9(3)(c)(i) only covered agreements where property definitely passed. The scheme of the Act contemplates that where property in goods passes to a purchaser, the time of supply will be at the earlier of payment or invoicing. This is achieved specifically in relation to hire purchase sales by section 9(3)(b) of the Act whereby the time of supply is deemed to be when the agreement is entered into. The purpose of section 9(3)(c)(i) is to ensure similar treatment for other types of conditional sales where property will eventually definitely pass consequent upon the performance of certain conditions by the purchaser.

Section 9(3)(c)(i) now excludes from the definition of "agreement to hire" agreements where property definitely passes to the bailee and agreements where it is expressly contemplated that property will pass to the bailee. Contracts which merely provide an option to purchase will still constitute agreements to hire.

### Section 7(5) Building Retentions

#### Amendment

Section 7(5) of the Amendment Act repeals sections 9(4) and 9(5) of the GST Act.

#### Comment

This amendment is consequential to the new section 9(3)(aa), inserted by section 7(3) of the Amendment Act, which supersedes the old subsections 9(4) and 9(5) of the GST Act.

### Section 8 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Value of Supply of Goods and Services Section 10 of the GST Act 1985

### Sections 8(1), 8(2) and 8(7) Consequential Amendments

#### Amendment

These are amendments to subsections 10(2)(b), 10(3) and 10(8) of the GST Act so as to bring the open market value into line with the new definition introduced by section 4 of the Amendment Act.

#### Comment

These amendments are consequential to the amendment of the definition of "open market value". These and other consequential amendments ensure a consistency of treatment of the term "open market value" throughout the principal Act.

### Section 8(3) Supplies to Associated Persons

#### Amendment

This amends section 10(3) of the GST Act to ensure that when a supply is made to an employee who is also an associated person of the supplier, no other liability to GST will arise if FBT is payable in respect of that supply.

#### Comment

The Act deems a supply to occur at open market value when made to a non-registered person who is an associated person of the supplier. Where that person is also an employee and the supply is one to which FBT applies, the Act potentially imposed GST twice on that supply. This amendment ensures that in such a position GST will only be imposed in relation to the FBT value of that supply and not also on the open market value.

### Section 8(4) Exported Secondhand Goods

#### Amendment

This repeals the old section 10(4) and substitutes a new subsection. The new subsection contains the following provisions:

1.  Where secondhand goods acquired from non-registered persons are exported they are not zero-rated. The value of the supply is deemed to be the purchase price of those goods to the supplier.

#### Comment

The only change from the previous provision is the substitution of the expression "purchase price" for "the cost of those goods". This change is explained in the comments on the second proviso to this subsection.

2.  The FIRST PROVISO is a consequential amendment required by the amending of the proviso to section 11(1) (refer to commentary on section 9(4) of the Amendment Act). It provides that where the secondhand goods were acquired from an associated person and that person has made a deduction for input tax in respect of those goods, the consideration in money is deemed to be the greater of the purchase price of the goods to the supplier or the purchase price to that other associated person.

#### Comment

The proviso ensures that the full input tax credit given in respect of the purchase of secondhand goods is recovered on the subsequent exportation of those goods in situations where the goods are purchased from an associated person. A full commentary is contained in the discussion on section 9(4) of the Amendment Act.

3.  The SECOND PROVISO makes it explicit that exported secondhand goods are taxed on the basis of cost INCLUDING GST.

#### Comment

When secondhand goods purchased from non-registered persons are exported, GST is levied to recover the input tax deduction allowed when those goods were purchased.

In order to ensure the desired treatment it is necessary to make explicit that the cost of these goods is not reduced by the input tax deduction received on purchase.

### Section 8(5) Credit Contracts

#### Amendment

This amends section 10(5) of the GST Act to ensure that any taxable supply made under a credit contract is taxed on the basis of the cash price whether or not the Credit Contracts Act requires explicit disclosure of that cash price.

#### Comment

Section 10(5) provided that a taxable supply of goods and services made under a credit contract was valued at the "cash price" disclosed in the contract. Although all supplies made under a credit contract have a cash price (as defined in the Credit Contract Act) disclosure is not required in all cases. The amendment ensures that this valuation is applied to all supplies made under a credit contract whether or not disclosure of the cash price is required. It includes incidental supplies, such as insurance of the goods.

### Section 8(6) Long-Term Accommodation

#### Amendment

This repeals section 10(6) of the GST Act and substitutes a new subsection.

The reworded subsection provides that where a supply of goods and services consists of the supply of domestic goods and services in a commercial dwelling, the consideration for that part of the supply of domestic goods and services in excess of 4 weeks is reduced to 60% of the tax exclusive amount which would otherwise have been attributable to that supply.

The proviso ensures that where the commercial dwelling is a residential establishment, (as defined in section 2 of the GST Act, as inserted by section 2(9) of the Amendment Act) and it has been agreed by the supplier and recipient that the supply shall be for a period of or in excess of 4 weeks, the consideration attributable to that supply of domestic goods and services shall be deemed to be 60% of the tax exclusive amount which would otherwise have been attributable to that supply FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF THAT SUPPLY.

#### Comment

The new subsection increases the proportion of the consideration attributable to domestic goods and services which must be charged with GST from a minimum of 20% to 60%. There is still a need to make an apportionment of the consideration attributable to goods and services other than domestic goods and services, eg, meals.

The word "value" is replaced with the word "consideration" to provide consistency with the rest of the Act.

The effect of this amendment is that where an individual stays longer than 4 weeks in a "commercial dwelling", GST is chargeable on only 60% of the basic tax exclusive room rate (where that room rate is for the supply of domestic goods and services). GST is still fully chargeable on other goods and services supplied, eg toll calls, laundry, meals.

The effect of the PROVISO is to allow residential establishments (ie those commercial dwellings which "specialise" in long term accommodation) to charge GST on only 60% of the tax exclusive consideration attributable to domestic goods and services from the first day of any stay, where that stay or the aggregate of those stays will exceed 4 weeks.

### Section 8(7) Consequential Amendment to Section 10(8) of the GST Act

#### Comment

For comments on section 8(7) of the Amendment Act, refer to commentary on section 8(1).

### Section 8(8) Games of Chance

#### Amendment

This removes the existing reference in section 10(14) to the "sale of tickets".

#### Comment

Section 10(14) establishes the value of the supply that occurs when a lottery or other game of chance is operated. This value is calculated by reducing the total proceeds by the amount of cash prizes.

The section referred only to proceeds from the sale of tickets. This restriction was inappropriate given that not all games of chance involved the sale of tickets.

### Section 8(9) Consequential Amendment

#### Amendment

This removes the reference to "ticket" from section 10(15).

#### Comment

This amendment is consequential to the amendment to section 10(14) of the GST Act by section 8(8) of the Amendment Act.

### Section 9 of the GST Amenmdment Act 1986 Zero-Rating Section 11 of the GST Act 1985

### Section 9(1) Exported Goods

#### Amendment

This inserts a new subparagraph, (ia), after paragraph 11(1)(a) of the GST Act giving the Commissioner a discretion to zero-rate a supply of goods that has not been entered for export where the Commissioner is otherwise satisfied that exportation has taken place.

#### Comment

Not all goods exported from New Zealand are required to be "entered for export". The Customs Act does not require goods with a value of up to $100 to be entered, therefore it would be rare for the exporter of such low value items to hold an export entry as evidence to sustain the zero-rating of that supply. Further, no export entry is granted in respect of ships stores (ie, consumable items such as vegetables).

The new subparagraph is designed to allow the zero-rating of such exports where alternative evidence of exportation is provided. This would generally be in the form of a bill of lading, air consignment note, or airway bill.

### Section 9(2) Time Limit for Exportation

#### Amendment

This amends the proviso to section 11(1)(a) of the GST Act by giving the Commissioner a discretion to extend the 28 day period in which goods must be exported to qualify for zero-rating under section 11(1)(a)(ii).

#### Comment

The Commissioner's discretion is required to cover situations where it will not be possible for the goods to be exported within 28 days of the time of supply. An example would be magazines supplied to an overseas subscriber. The exportation of all the magazines supplied under the subscription is unlikely to occur within 28 days of the time of supply. The discretion cannot be applied in a situation where the exportation occurs after 28 days by choice of the supplier or recipient.

### Section 9(3) Zero-rating of "Fine Metal"

_Amendments_

1.  This inserts a new paragraph 11(1)(ca) to the GST Act, which provides for the zero-rating of "fine metal", where it is the first supply of that "fine metal", and the supply is made by a registered person, (who is a "refiner of fine metal") to a "dealer in fine metal" for use as an investment item.

#### Comment

Refer to the comment on section 2(9) of the Amendment Act.

2.  A proviso is also inserted to cover the instance where a registered person is a REFINER AND DEALER in fine metal. In such a case, the "new fine metal" is deemed to have been supplied to a "dealer in fine metal" immediately prior to the making of an exempt supply of that "new fine metal"

#### Comment

This proviso prevents the disadvantaging of a refiner who is also a dealer. All supplies of "fine metal" are exempt, except those between a refiner and dealer. These supplies are zero-rated, thus allowing an input tax deduction. Where a refiner is also a dealer, there is a deemed supply to a dealer, thus allowing the input tax deduction.

### Section 9(4) Exported Secondhand Goods and Re-imported Goods

#### Amendments

1.  This repeals the proviso to section 11(1) of the GST Act and substitutes a new proviso paragraph (d). This proviso extends the existing provision denying zero-rating status to exported secondhand goods to cover situations where those goods have been purchased by the exporter from an associated person. This proviso will apply where the associated person had received a one-eleventh deduction on purchasing those goods secondhand from a non-registered person.

#### Comment

When a registered person purchases secondhand goods from a non-registered person, a deduction is allowed against output tax of one-eleventh of the purchase price. When such goods are subsequently exported in the course of a supply, that supply is not zero-rated. Such supplies are taxed on the basis of purchase price in order to recover the GST input credit previously allowed.

The GST Act only denied zero-rating to goods purchased secondhand by the exporter from a NON-REGISTERED person. Zero-rating was still available where the registered person purchased the goods off another REGISTERED person, even though those goods may have originally been purchased secondhand from a non-registered individual. In order to defeat the intended application of that provision, the registered person who exported the goods merely had to get an associated registered person to intercede.

Accordingly the limitation on the availability of zero-rating is extended to cover situations where the goods have been purchased by the exporter from an ASSOCIATED PERSON who had gained a deduction by purchasing secondhand goods from a non-registered person.

2.  Paragraph (e) This is an amendment consequent to the amendment in section 10(6) of the Amendment Act. It prevents the zero-rating of those goods which have been or will be exported and which also have been or will be re-imported by the supplier.

#### Comment

Full discussion is contained in the commentary to section 10(6).

### Section 9(5) International Transportation

_Amendments_ This repeals and substitutes section 11(2)(a). The new section changes the provisions in respect of the international transportation of passengers and of goods and zero-rates both Marine Cargo Insurance relating to the exportation or importation of goods, and Travel Insurance relating to travel to a place outside New Zealand.

1.  SERVICES WILL BE ZERO-RATED WHERE THEY ARE SUPPLIED DIRECTLY IN THE INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORTATION OF GOODS. This will also include any internal transport, to the extent that the transportation is provided as part of those services (or the arranging of such transportation).

#### Comment

The amendment eliminates certain problems associated with the zero-rating of services involving the transportation of exported or imported goods.

When a good is exported from New Zealand, domestic transportation costs may be incurred in getting the goods from the place of production to the port of departure. If these costs are incurred by the domestic exporter (who is registered for GST purposes), any GST that is included in such charges will be able to be claimed as a deduction of input tax by the exporter. In this case, GST will have no direct impact on the cost of those goods to the non-resident importer.

In contrast, if it is the non-resident importer of those goods that incurs the costs of the transportation within New Zealand (almost invariably through a New Zealand shipping agent), the GST component of such transportation charges will not be refunded and will, therefore, increase the cost of those goods to the non-resident importer.

A similar situation exists in respect of the importation of goods to New Zealand; if the resident importer incurs the domestic transport costs, the GST component is refundable and the cost of the imported goods is unaffected; if, however, the non-resident exporter of those goods incurs the costs of transportation, the GST component is likely to increase the cost of those goods.

The GST Act previously zero-rated only the international transportation of goods from or to New Zealand any transportation within New Zealand being liable for GST at 10%. New Zealand-based international transporters would have been required to include GST in their charges to the extent that the charges related to transportation that occurred within New Zealand. Non-resident transporters in contrast, would not have included any GST component relating to transportation that occurred in New Zealand as they generally would not have been (and would not have been required to be) registered for GST purposes.

As a consequence, a domestic exporter wanting goods transported from some place within New Zealand to the port of departure and then on to an overseas destination would have faced a totally GST-exclusive price from a non-resident transporter. In contrast that same exporter would have faced a price that includes some GST component from a resident transporter. While both of these prices would be the same to the domestic exporter in net terms (ie, the GST component currently being refundable), there would have been a cash flow cost to the exporter associated with the GST-inclusive charge made by the domestic transporter.

To help alleviate the above problems the amendment zero-rates the domestic portion of the international transportation of imported or exported goods.

It should be noted that any such domestic transportation must be provided AS PART OF the international transportation of those goods.

2.  IN RESPECT OF PASSENGERS, SERVICES WILL BE ZERO-RATED WHERE THEY ARE SUPPLIED DIRECTLY WITH INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORTATION, (or arranging thereof) including any domestic portion of international travel, to the extent that the transportation is provided as part of those services by the same supplier.

#### Comment

This amendment has the effect that the traveller who joins an international flight in Wellington and flying on to Auckland before departing overseas, has the entire trip zero-rated, including the domestic portion of the flight. The Wellington-Auckland flight is deemed to be part of the international flight.

The traveller who separately books and pays for a domestic flight to Auckland before catching an international flight will have to pay GST on the domestic flight.

3.  MARINE CARGO INSURANCE, and the arranging thereof, relating to the exportation or importation of goods and TRAVEL INSURANCE, and the arranging thereof, relating to travel to a place outside New Zealand are to be zero-rated.

#### Comment

The GST Act previously zero-rated only that portion of Marine Cargo Insurance that related to moveable personal property situated outside New Zealand during the period of cover. Travel insurance was not zero-rated.

It was decided that Marine Cargo Insurance relating to exported or imported goods and Travel Insurance relating to travel involving a destination outside New Zealand should be zero-rated in total. This treatment is consistent with the intended application of GST to consumption that occurs only in New Zealand.

### Section 9(6) Services in Connection with Moveable Personal Property

#### Amendment

This substitutes the time of performance for the time of supply as the test for when the goods must be outside New Zealand in order to qualify as a supply of services directly in connection with those goods zero-rated under section 11(2)(c)(i) of the GST Act.

#### Comment

The time when services are supplied is, for the purposes of the Act (other than for the transitional provisions), determined in accordance with the "time of supply" rules. These determine the time when a supply takes place as generally being the earlier of the issue of an invoice or the making of any payment. Special rules apply to many supplies such as services supplied under an agreement that provides for periodic payment.

While these time of supply rules are specifically designed to enable supplies to be accounted for on a practical basis, they are not appropriate in the context of zero-rating provisions which require a test based on the time of the actual physical performance of services. The amendment corrects the situation for services supplied directly in connection with goods situated outside New Zealand at the time these services are performed and brings the relevant time in line with section 11(2)(e).

### Section 9(7) Services Supplied to Non-Residents

#### Amendment

This repeals the old paragraph 11(2)(e) and substitutes a new paragraph which specifically restricts the application of zero-rating to a supply of services to a non-resident where the benefit of those services will be enjoyed overseas.

#### Comment

The GST Act previously zero-rated any services that were supplied for and to any non-resident who was not in New Zealand at the time the services were performed. This provision was intended to zero-rate services not otherwise zero-rated where the benefit of those services was going to be enjoyed overseas.

The amendment restricts the application of the provision by specifically excluding services supplied directly in connection with land or goods in New Zealand and restraint of trade agreements to the extent that that trade would have been conducted in New Zealand.

This change still enables the zero-rating of a wide range of services such as financial services, advisory services and services which are directly in connection with intellectual property rights which are for use in New Zealand. The commission charged by agents arranging the international transportation of goods, previously zero-rated under this provision, will not be zero-rated under the provision in its amended form if the goods are situated in New Zealand. However, the zero-rating of such commissions will be achieved by the amendment to section 11(2)(a) contained in section 9(5) of the Amendment Act.

### Section 9(8) National Roads Fund

#### Amendment

This adds a new subsection (3) to section 11 to zero-rate money received by the National Roads Fund from excise duty on motor spirits duty, CNG, and LPG and also road user charges.

#### Comment

The revenue from the excise duty which replaced the sales tax on motor spirits duty, CNG, LPG and Road User Charges is "tied" either wholly or partly to fund the National Roads Fund (NRF).

Although this duty will not be subject to GST when it is imposed, the GST Act requires the NRF (via the Ministry of Works) to account for GST when the revenues from these taxes are received. Assuming that there is no change in the rates of the duty, the NRF may have as the Act stood, suffered a reduction in real income. The amendment ensures that this reduction will not occur.

Because of the provisions of section 9(9) of the Amendment Act this zero-rating of National Roads Fund revenue from road user charges only applies until 1 December 1986.

### Section 9(9) National Roads Fund

#### Amendment

This repeals the new section 11(3) (as added by section 9(8) of the Amendment Act) on 1 December 1986 and provides a substituted subsection which allows for the zero-rating of any money received by the National Roads Fund from excise duty on motor spirits, CNG and LPG only, where the consideration for that supply is credited to that Fund.

**Comment**

This amendment is consequential to the taxation of Road User Charges paid on or after 1 December 1986 as specified in the new section 5(6B) of the Act (refer commentary on section 5(1) of the Amendment Act). As this component of National Roads Fund revenue will be subject to tax, there is no need to zero-rate the revenue in the hands of the Fund. Fund revenue from excise duty on motor spirits, CNG and LPG will still be zero-rated.

Section 9(10) Local Authority Petroleum Tax

#### Amendment

Inserted is a new subsection (4) to section 11 of the GST Act. This provides that a supply will be zero-rated where the supplier is a territorial authority, a regional or united council, and the consideration for that supply is proceeds from the local authorities petroleum tax paid to that supplier.

**Comment**

This change ensures a consistency of treatment between the revenues of the National Roads Fund (not including Road User Charges) and similar revenues of local authorities.

### Section 10 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 GST on Imports Section 12 of the GST Act 1985

### Section 10(1) Imported Exempt Goods

#### Amendment

This amendment excludes exempt goods from being subject to GST on importation.

#### Comment

The GST Act previously required the imposition of GST on all imported goods. With the exemption of "fine metal" (refer commentary on section 2(9) of the Amendment Act) it is necessary to ensure that such exempt goods are not subject to GST on importation.

### Section 10(2) Goods Entered into a "Licensed Manufacturing Area"

#### Amendment

This inserts a new paragraph (aa) to section 12(1) of the GST Act which provides for the imposition of GST by the Customs Department when imported goods are "entered into a licenced manufacturing area" on or after the 1st of October 1986.

#### Comment

The GST Act provided for the imposition of GST when goods were imported, ie, technically when they were "entered for home consumption". Consequent changes to the sales tax regime, (ie its replacement with a limited range of excises) the Customs Department are creating another importation point, ie, when goods are "entered into a licenced manufacturing area". This will apply to goods imported for the purpose of producing beer, spirits, tobacco, and fuels. A consequential amendment was required to the GST Act to ensure that GST is also imposed on imported goods that are "entered into a licenced manufacturing area" rather than "entered for home consumption".

### Section 10(3) Delivery to a "Licensed Manufacturing Area"

#### Amendment

This is consequential to the amendment contained in section 10(2). It amends section 12(1)(b) of the GST Act.

#### Comment

Refer to the comment on section 10(2).

### Section 10(4) Valuation of Imports

#### Amendment

This repeals paragraph (d) of section 12(2).

#### Comment

Section 12(2) of the GST Act contained the rules for valuing goods imported into New Zealand for GST purposes. The value previously included all fees or levies paid or payable at the time goods were imported into New Zealand.

Specifically, paragraph (d) ensured that the Liquid Fuels Trust Board Levy, the Alcoholic Liquor Advisory Council Levy and the Heavy Engineering Research Authority Levy were included in the value of imported goods.

However, as these levies will be subject to GST in their own right (as consideration for a supply of goods and services supplied by the respective collecting body), their specific inclusion in the GST valuation of imported goods is redundant. Accordingly the amendment repealed section 12(2)(d).

#### Section 10(5) Consequential Amendments

#### Amendment

This removes or replaces references in section 12(4)(a) of the GST Act to various sections of the Customs Act 1966. The amendments ensure that the references to the Customs Act 1966 contained in the GST Act are consistent with changes to the Customs Act arising from the introduction of the new excise regime from 1 October 1986.

#### Comment

The GST Act provides got the imposition of GST by the Customs Department on goods reported to New Zealand. The Act makes specific reference to numerous provisions of the Customs Act 1966 to ensure that the collection, payment, and enforcement of GST levied by Customs is consistent with those applying to other charges payable on importation. Due to the changes in the Customs Act made as a consequence of the new excise regime some of the references to the Customs Act have been altered accordingly.

### Section 10(6) Export and Subsequent Re-importation of Goods

#### Amendment

This inserts a new proviso to section 12(4) of the GST Act referring to section 164 of the Customs Act 1966. The proviso ensures that the section only applies for GST purposes in cases where goods are re-imported by a person (other than in the course of a taxable activity) which have been owned and used by the importer overseas. Consequential to this, an amendment has been made to section 11(1) of the GST Act by section 9(4) of the Amendment Act to restrict the zero-rating of exported goods to those which are not subsequently re-imported by the supplier.

#### Comment

Many provisions of the Customs Act 1966 have effect in relation to the imposition of GST on imported goods. One of these, section 164, would have had the effect of allowing goods to be reimported free of GST. In circumstances where this provision could have been applied by the Customs Department, the situation could have arisen where goods were sold to a New Zealand consumer, exported by the supplier, and the supply zero-rated. When those goods were then re-imported by either the supplier or purchaser, no GST would have been payable. The New Zealand consumer therefore would have achieved the purchase free of GST, merely at the cost of the transportation charge. To avoid such a situation arising, the amendment restricts the application of section 164 of the Customs Act for GST purposes to goods re-imported by a person (other than in the course of a taxable activity) where the goods have been owned and used by the importer overseas.

### Section 11 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 GST On Goods Liable to Excise Duty Section 13 of The GST Act 1985

#### Amendment

This replaces references in section 13 of the GST Act to section 134 of the Customs Act 1966 with reference to Part IV A (of the same Act).

#### Comment

This change is consequential to the new excise duty regime.

### Section 12 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Exempt Supplies Section 14 of the GST Act 1985

### Section 12(1) Exemption of Ground Rent

#### Amendment

This includes as an exempt supply ground rent for land on which a dwelling is erected and used principally for accommodation.

#### Comment

This is extending the exemption of rental of domestic housing to land which is used principally for domestic residential purposes.

### Section 12(2) Sale of Residential Rental Property

#### Amendment

This restricts the exemption in section 14(d) to the outright sale "of any dwelling" which has been used exclusively for residential rental purposes for at least five years prior to sale.

#### Comment

Section 14(d) is intended to exempt the sale of any dwelling which has been used exclusively for residential rental purposes for at least 5 years prior to sale. The section itself, however, referred to any supply of that dwelling which encompassed not only the outright sale but also other forms of supply such as a lease. Clearly, such a wide exemption was not intended and the section was amended to restrict the exemption only to supplies which are the outright sale of the dwelling.

### Section 12(3) Exemption of "Fine Metals"

#### Amendment

This provides an exemption for the supply of "fine metal" which is not zero-rated under section 11(1) of the GST Act (as amended by section 9(3) of the Amendment Act).

#### Comment

Refer to the comment on section 2(9) of the Amendment Act.

### Section 13 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Taxable Periods Section 15 of the GST Act 1985

_Amendments_ This repeals section 15 and substitutes a new section. The substantive changes are:

1.  Allowing registered persons with one or six-monthly return periods to substitute a day up to seven days either side of the last day of the month, as the date upon which the return period ends. This facility is contained in a new subsection (4) which replaces the paragraph (d) of the old subsection (1).
2.  Allowing registered persons with one or six-monthly return periods to alter their return period, eg from one-monthly to six-monthly. This facility is contained in subsection (5)(b) which replaces subsection 4(b).

#### Comment

Both of the above amendments give registered persons using one and six-monthly return periods the same rights as are given to those using a two-monthly return period.

### Section 14 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Taxable Period Returns Section 16 of the GST Act 1985

### Section 14(1) Concession for Non-Profits Bodies

#### Amendment

This amendment more explicitly allows the Commissioner to extend the time for furnishing of returns by non-profit bodies.

#### Comment

This concession will apply where there are special circumstances, such as where a non-profit body has a large number of branches and it would be extremely difficult to collect the necessary information within the required time. Instructions on the application of this discretion will be issued shortly.

### Section 14(2) Extension of Time for Furnishing Returns

#### Amendment

This allows returns for taxable periods ending on 30 November to be furnished and payments made on or before 15 January each year rather than 1 January.

#### Comment

The Act provides that GST returns are to be furnished on or before the first day of the second month after the taxable period ends. Therefore, returns for taxable periods ending on 30 November would normally be required to be furnished on or before 1 January.

Due to the Christmas/New Year holidays it will be difficult for registered persons to have this return furnished by 1 January.

The Act already recognised that similar problems would exist for the Department and accordingly grants a concession from the payment of interest on GST refunds over the Christmas/New Year holiday period, from 25 December to 15 January inclusive. The amendment to the due date for the return and payment ensures consistency.

### Section 15 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Special Returns Section 17 of the GST Act 1985

#### Amendment

This amends section 17(1)(a) to ensure that a special return should be in a prescribed form.

#### Comment

Section 17, which relates to special returns did not require the use of the prescribed form designed for such returns. As that section stood, special return could have been furnished in any form provided the required information was supplied.

### Section 16 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Accounting Basis Section 19 of the GST Act 1985

### Section 16(1) Adoption of Payments Basis

#### Amendment

The amendment to section 19(2)(b) of the GST Act increases the turnover threshold for adopting the payments basis of accounting from $250,000 to $500,000.

#### Comment

The payments basis of accounting will now be available to ALL registered persons with a turnover of up to $500,000, instead of the previous $250,000 limit.

### Section 16(2) Payments Basis for Registered Persons with a Turnover in Excess of $500,000.

#### Amendment

This changes the word "or" in section 19(2)(c) to "and".

#### Comment

Section 19(2)(c) now provides that a payments basis of accounting will be approved for certain persons with a turnover in excess of $500,000 where it is appropriate due to the nature, volume AND value of taxable supplies and nature of the accounting system. Previously this enabled a registered person to satisfy only two of these requirements before the approval for a payments basis could be given.

All four of these criteria must be considered in determining eligibility to use the payments basis.

### Section 17 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Calculation of Tax Payable Section 20 of the GST Act 1985

### Section 17(1) Time when Tax Invoices Required for Deductions

#### Amendment

The amendment to section 20(2)(a) of the GST Act explicitly provides that where a supply is made to a registered person, the deduction for input tax shall only be allowed where that registered person holds a tax invoice at the time the return in which the deduction is claimed is furnished.

#### Comment

The GST Act specifies that a registered person may claim a deduction of input tax in the taxable period during which the supply was made (for a person on the invoice basis, this is generally the earlier of invoicing or payment). The Act further provides that this deduction can only be claimed if the required tax invoice has been issued to the registered person. The Act was not explicit as to whether this invoice had to be obtained by the end of the taxable period or by the time the return is furnished. This amendment will deny the deduction where the required invoice is not held at the time the return is furnished.

**Note:**

For a registered person using the invoice basis of accounting, the time of supply is the earlier of:

1.  the time an invoice is issued by the supplier; or
2.  the time that payment is received by the supplier.

A tax invoice must show the date on which it was "issued". This means the date it was posted or personally delivered to the recipient.

For both suppliers and recipients using an invoice basis where no prior payment has been made, the issue date on the tax invoice will determine which return period the output and input tax must be accounted for. This is the case even though the tax invoice may in fact be actually received by the recipient in the first few days of the succeeding taxable period.

### Section 17(2) Consequential Amendment

#### Amendment

The amendment adds the word "or" to paragraph (b) of section 20(2).

#### Comment

This is consequential to the amendment contained in section 17(3) of the Amendment Act.

### Section 17(3) Ability to Make Deduction for Secondhand Goods

#### Amendment

This adds a new paragraph (c) to section 20(2) of the GST Act which ensures that a deduction of input tax on secondhand goods is not denied because a tax invoice is not held, but sufficient records to support such a claim are required.

#### Comment

Section 20 of the Act denies a deduction of GST in most circumstances where a tax invoice is not held in respect of the purchase. The section operated to deny a deduction where a tax invoice was not held when secondhand goods were purchased from a non-registered person. A tax invoice could not be issued by the non-registered supplier and, as such, the deduction should not have been denied because one was not held. The amendment corrects this anomaly.

### Section 17(4) Deduction of GST paid to Customs Department

#### Amendment

The amendment to section 20(3)(a)(ii) of the GST Act allows a registered person accounting on an invoice basis to claim, at the earlier of the time of invoicing or payment, a deduction of GST collected by the Customs Department on the importation of goods.

#### Comment

The GST Act previously allowed a deduction for GST collected by the Customs Department on importation only at the time when payment of that GST was made. This was consistent with the method of collection by the Customs Department of duties, etc, ie, GST payable on imports was to be payable on importation. As a result of changes to the method of collection, the duty and GST will in some circumstances be invoiced to the importer. The deduction for the GST will be allowed to a registered person accounting on the invoice basis at the earlier of invoicing or payment.

### Section 17(5), 17(7) and 17(8) Accounting for Debit Notes and Credit Notes

#### Amendment

These subsections amend subsections 20(3)(a) and 20(3)(b) of the GST Act to ensure that any amount of output tax or input tax that results from the issue of a debit note or credit note is accounted for on the same basis that the registered person accounts for GST (ie invoice or payments basis). This is done by inserting new paragraphs 3(a)(iii) and 3(b)(iv). Section 20(3)(c) of the GST Act is consequently redundant and is repealed by section 17(9)(a) of the Amendment Act.

#### Comment

The GST Act previously required that where a debit note or credit note resulted in output tax or input tax the registered person must account on an invoice basis for those adjustments even where the registered person was on the payments basis for all other purposes. The amendment was required to ensure that the output tax and input tax resulting from the issue/receipt of a debit note or credit note are accounted for consistently with the registered person's accounting basis. Consequential amendments to section 25 of the GST Act were necessary in order to specify that the amounts referred to therein are deemed to be "input tax" (refer to commentary on section 20 of the Amendment Act).

### Section 17(6) Consequential Amendment

#### Amendment

This adds a reference to the new section 9(3)(aa).

#### Comment

This is consequential to the amendment contained in section 7(3) of the Amendment Act which creates a new section 9(3)(aa).

### Section 17(9)(a) Consequential Amendment

#### Amendment

This repeals paragraph (c) of section 20(3) of the GST Act.

#### Comment

This is consequential to changes made in section 17(5) and 17(8) of the Amendment Act which effectively supersede the repealed paragraph.

### Section 17(9)(b) Input Deduction Allowed for Indemnity Payments made after 1 October 1986

#### Amendment

This amends section 20(3)(d)(i) to ensure that indemnity payments made on or after 1 October 1986 will qualify for the input tax credit provided for in section 20(3)(d) of the GST Act.

#### Comment

The GST Act previously allowed an insurer, in respect of a taxable insurance policy, to deduct from output tax a credit of one-eleventh of any amount paid in cash to any insured person under such a policy.

Over the transition, this credit was to be available only in respect of payments made on claims under a taxable policy ie any policy TO THE EXTENT that it covers a period from 1 October 1986 on.

This amendment allows a one-eleventh credit to an insurer for an indemnity payment made after 1 October 1986 which is made in respect of an insurance policy which is not a taxable supply simply by virtue of its termination prior to that date (ie the policy terminated prior to 1 October 1986).

### Section 17(10) No Input Tax Deduction for Zero-rated Insurances

#### Amendment

This amends section 20(3)(d) to ensure that no deduction of input tax is given to an insurance company for a cash indemnity payment in relation to an insurance contract that is zero-rated.

#### Comment

Where an insurance premium is taxable, a credit will be allowed to the insurer of one-eleventh of any cash indemnity payment made under that policy. This ensures that the insurer is only subject to GST in relation to the value of their services supplied (ie the value added).

The one-eleventh credit for indemnity payments will not be allowed where:

1.  the insured is not registered and non-resident and the policy is zero-rated; or
2.  the payment is made to any person in respect of a supply (not being a taxable supply) physically made to that person outside New Zealand.

Such a credit will not be allowed in respect of policies which are zero-rated (eg marine cargo and travel insurance).

### Section 17(11) Input Tax Deduction Allowed for any Refund of Excise Duty Paid out by the National Roads Fund.

#### Amendment

This inserts a new paragraph (da) in section 20(3) of the GST Act, which allows the National Roads Fund to claim an input tax credit on any refund of excise duty paid out of that Fund on or after 1 October 1986.

#### Comment

This amendment enables the National Roads Fund to claim a one.-eleventh credit for any payment of a refund of excise on motor spirits, CNG or LPG. These refunds will be paid inclusive of GST. Refer to commentary on section 5(6) Of the Amendment Act.

### Section 17(12) Restriction of an Input Tax Credit upon the Purchase of Secondhand Goods Previously Owned by a Registered Person

#### Amendment

The FIRST NEW PROVISO inserted in section 20(3) of the GST Act prevents the deduction of an input tax credit where secondhand goods are sold by registered persons between 1 July 1986 and 30 September 1986 and are re-purchased between 1 October 1986 and 30 June 1987.

However, the SECOND NEW PROVISO inserted allows the input tax credit if the supply is made in the normal course of the taxable activity carried on by the registered person and the supply is otherwise than for the purpose of enabling an input tax credit to be deducted.

#### Comment

This section is intended to prevent traders from selling their stock to a non-registered person prior to 30 September 1986 and then re-purchasing it after 1 October 1986. This practice would have enabled the registered person to claim a one-eleventh input tax credit for stock held over this transitional period.

However, this amendment allows an input tax credit where the re-purchase of a chattel is conducted in the normal course of a taxable activity and that the re-purchase is not transacted just for the purpose of enabling an input tax credit to be claimed.

This amendment ensures that registered persons who conduct bona-fide transactions involving re-purchase of chattels (eg repossessions) will be able to claim an input tax credit.

### Section 17(13) Consequential Amendment

#### Amendment

This removes the reference in section 20(4)(b)(1) to section 9(4), and inserts references to sections 9(3)(aa), 25(2)(a) and 25(4) of the GST Act.

#### Comment

The amendment is consequential to the amendments in sections 7(3) and 17(8).

### Section 18 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Adjustments Section 21 of the GST Act 1985

### Section 18(1) Principal Purpose

#### Amendment

This corrects a drafting error in section 21(1) of the GST Act, which should have referred to the "principal purpose of making taxable supplies" rather than "in the course of a taxable activity".

#### Comment

This correction ensures consistency of drafting with other parts of the Act (eg the definition of "input tax"). It results in no change to the section's intended effect.

### Section 18(2) De-minimis Rule

#### Amendment

This clarifies the proviso to section 21(1) of the GST Act, in respect of the partially exempt use of goods and services, by ensuring that it is the LESSER OF the stated criteria (ie $48,000 or 5% of turnover) which is relevant, and that they are not cumulative.

#### Comment

It could have been argued that the rule could have been read as meaning $48,000 PLUS 5 percent of turnover. The amendment makes it clear that these are alternative criteria, and that it is the LESSER OF the two which sets the de-minimis limit.

### Section 18(3) One-Off Adjustments for Non-taxable Use

#### Amendment

This adds a second proviso to section 21(1) of the GST Act which provides an option of a one-off adjustment to apportion between the non-taxable and taxable use of any asset costing under $10,000, rather than a continual adjustment on a taxable period by taxable period basis. This option may be taken up only in the first return period in which the goods were acquired or produced and is to remain binding in relation to the asset concerned.

#### Comment

Where there is partial non-taxable use of a business asset a deemed supply occurs, the deemed supply occurring in each period of non-taxable use. Where the asset cost is not large this would have resulted in a minimal adjustment to output tax occurring in each return period. In order to reduce the necessity of small, ongoing adjustments, the option is now provided to enable the adjustment to be made in one period only; where the cost of the asset to which the adjustment relates does not exceed $10,000, the cost being tax inclusive. The adjustment will be based on the estimated taxable/non-taxable use over the life of the asset. In general, estimates based on expected usage over the following twelve months will be accepted.

### Section 18(4) De-minimis Rule for Payments Based Taxpayers

#### Amendment

This adds a new subsection, (1A) to section 21(1) of the GST Act which ensures that the de-minimis rule (dealing with minor exempt supplies) applies appropriately to persons accounting on the payments basis. This is achieved by requiring registered persons who account for GST on a payments basis to estimate the value of exempt supplies in any 12 month period using the payments basis of accounting.

#### Comment

Previously the rule required a payments based registered person to estimate his next 12 months exempt supplies using the normal time of supply rules (ie generally the earlier of invoice or payment). This would have been inappropriate for persons accounting on the payments basis and the amendment allows them to make this estimate using the payments basis only, ie by estimating cash receipts. This is particularly relevant where the estimate is based on historical information.

### Section 18(5) Fringe Benefits Provided in the Course of Exempt Activities

#### Amendment

This adds a proviso to section 21(3) of the GST Act to provide that to the extent that a fringe benefit is provided in the course of making exempt supplies, that fringe benefit shall not be subject to GST.

#### Comment

Section 21(3) of the Act deems a supply to occur where fringe benefit tax is payable by a registered person. As the Act stood, that benefit would have been taxable even where it was supplied to an employee who was employed in an exempt activity. As the GST on the inputs to the fringe benefit supply would not have been deductible, taxation of the benefit to which they contributed was clearly unfair. In order to ensure the equitable treatment of such benefits, the amendment provides that fringe benefits are not subject to tax to the extent that they are made in the course of making exempt supplies.

### Section 18(6) Use of Private Assets in a Business

#### Amendment

This has two aims:

1.  to ensure that the partial (but not principal) business use of private or exempt assets will give rise to a corresponding input tax credit, by the removal of the word "principal" from section 21(5).

#### Comment

The subsection required that taxable use be the "principal" use of the goods and services, whereas it should have been sufficient if such use was partial. The amendment removes the "principal" part of the test.

2.  to ensure that section 21(5) of the GST Act permits partnerships to claim a credit of tax in respect of the use of the private assets of the individual partners, by making reference to the use of the assets of a partner by the partnership.

#### Comment

Under the Act, only the partnership itself can register, not the individual partners. Where a partner uses his own assets (eg a car) for taxable purposes (those of the partnership), the previous provisions of section 21(5) prevented the partnership obtaining input tax credits respect of the taxable use of that asset. The amendment removes anomaly.

### Section 18(7) Adjustments for Taxable Use

#### Amendment

This adds a new proviso to section 21(5) of the GST Act, which gives the same treatment for the partially taxable use of capital assets costing less than $10,000 as is afforded for the partially non-taxable use of such assets, (refer to the new proviso to section 21(1), added by section 18(3) of the Amendment Act).

#### Comment

The rationale and operation of the amendment is the same as that described in the commentary to section 18(3) of the Amendment Act.

### Section 19 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Tax Invoices Section 24 of the GST Act 1985

### Section 19(1) Reduced Requirements For Tax Invoices

#### Amendment

This removes the requirement to show an individual serialised invoice number and the address of the supplier on a tax invoice.

#### Comment

It became apparent that many businesses do not use serialised invoices. Often an alternative is used, such as a customer account number together with the date. The amendment recognises this by removing the requirement for an individual serialised number.

The removal of the requirement to show the supplier's address on a tax invoice will allow registered persons more flexibility. As registered persons are required to show their GST registration number on tax invoices and the Inland Revenue Department has the registered person's address, the requirement to show the supplier's address on a tax invoice has been dispensed with. As it is normal commercial practice for invoices to show the address of the supplier it is anticipated that the removal of formal legislative requirement to show the supplier's address will make little difference to the format of tax invoices.

### Section 19(2) Power to Impose Conditions when Waiving Tax Invoice Requirements

#### Amendment

This amendment to section 24(6) of the GST Act permits the Commissioner, when waiving or modifying the requirements for tax invoices, debit notes, or credit notes to impose conditions for any such waiver or modification.

#### Comment

It is desirable that the Department have the power to impose alternative requirements (eg certain statements to be included on an invoice) or to restrict the use of such tax invoices or debit notes or credit notes to particular circumstances or over particular periods. The amendment gives effect to this.

### Section 19(3) Purchase of Secondhand Goods

#### Amendment

Section 24(7) of the GST Act is amended to ensure that the provision dealing with record requirements for purchases of secondhand goods refers to NON-TAXABLE SUPPLIES rather than NON-REGISTERED PERSONS. This will ensure that the provision also covers secondhand goods bought from registered persons selling in their private capacity.

#### Comment

This amendment corrects a drafting error, and makes the wording of the subsection consistent with the definition of "input tax" in section 2 of the GST Act.

### Section 19(4) Purchase of Secondhand Goods Record Requirements

#### Amendment

This adds a proviso to section 24(7) of the GST Act removing the requirement for a registered person purchasing secondhand goods from a non-registered person to keep detailed records where the consideration for the supply is up to $20.

#### Comment

The new proviso brings the record keeping requirements for registered persons purchasing secondhand goods from non-registered persons into line with the requirements for tax invoices.

### Section 19(5) Tax Invoice Requirements in Respect of Part of a Cent

#### Amendment

This adds a new subsection 24(8) to the GST Act which provides that where the GST component of the price of any supply is shown separately on a tax invoice, and that GST component involves a fraction of a cent, the GST component need only be shown on the tax invoice to the nearest cent. Half-cents and below are to be rounded down.

The GST Act requires the GST component of any taxable supply to be separately identified in a tax invoice -

1.  in all cases where the tax included is not one-eleventh of the consideration for the supply, eg it is subject to the transitional provisions or is a supply of accommodation in a commercial dwelling in excess of 4 weeks.
2.  in any case where the tax included is one-eleventh of the consideration, but where there is no statement on the tax invoice otherwise indicating the inclusion of GST.

In both of these circumstances the GST component of the consideration for the supply may not be able to be exactly expressed in dollars and cents. Fractions of cents will occur in many cases.

The GST Act previously contained no instruction as to how such fractions should be shown and there was no discretion for the Commissioner to make an administrative decision. For the purposes of certainty regarding the invoice requirements, the Act has been amended to specify the rounding of such fractions to the nearest cent. Half-cents and below are to be rounded down.

### Section 20 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Credit Notes and Debit Notes Section 25 of the GST Act 1985

### Section 20(1) Fundamental Variation or Alteration of a Supply

#### Amendment

This inserts a new paragraph (aa) in section 25(1) of the GST Act. The new paragraph adds a new circumstance where the consideration for a supply may be altered which could lead to incorrect amounts of tax being accounted for. This circumstance being where the nature of the supply has been fundamentally varied or altered.

#### Comment

Where goods are hired with an option to purchase within a set period the arrangement normally falls within the terms of the Hire Purchase Act 1971. The GST is therefore payable at the commencement of the hire. However, a potential anomaly existed where the option to buy was not taken up. The agreement then would have become a mere agreement to hire and inevitably the wrong amount of output tax would have been accounted for. Section 25 as previously drafted did not provide scope for an adjustment for this.

The amendment ensures that in the above situation (and any similar circumstances), an adjustment may be made.

### Section 20(2) Deduction of Input Tax

#### Amendment

This adds the words "of input tax" to section 25(2)(b) of the GST Act.

#### Comment

The amendment ensures that any deduction made pursuant to section 25(2)(b) will be a deduction of input tax. Despite this, the adjustment may be shown on the GST return as an adjustment to output tax.

### Section 20(3) Use of Tax Fraction for Credit Notes

#### Amendment

Replaced are subparagraphs (v) and (vi) of section 25(3)(a); both to permit the tax fraction approach to be used for return calculation purposes for credit notes or debit notes and to waive the requirement to refer to the invoice number and the date of the tax invoice.

#### Comment

Previously, the tax amount of the tax adjustment was required to be shown on returns. To make the credit note and debit note requirements consistent with those applying to tax invoices, there are two methods to show the adjustment AND the tax involved:

1.  The consideration shown on the tax invoice, the correct consideration, the difference between these two amounts and the tax on the difference OR
2.  Where the tax fraction method has been used: the difference referred to in (i) above and a statement that the difference includes tax.

This approach also fits the return procedures devised by the Department, which are based on a gross amount and then divided by the tax fraction to reach the figure of output tax. The repealing of subparagraph (vi) is consequential to the removal of the requirement to show an individual serialised number on a tax invoice. The removal of the requirements to show the date of the tax invoice recognises that in many cases credit notes and debit notes will be issued when the original supply cannot be specifically identified.

### Section 20(4) Use of Tax Fraction for Debit Notes

#### Amendment

This replaces subparagraphs (v) and (vi) of section 25(3)(b) of the GST Act to give the same effect for debit notes as is given for credit notes by section 20(3) of the Amendment Act.

#### Comments

Refer to the comments on section 20(3).

### Section 20(5) Issue of More Than One Debit Note

#### Amendment

This adds the words "or debit note" after the words "credit note" in paragraphs (c) and (d) of section 25(3) of the GST Act.

#### Comment

The amendment provides a consistency of treatment between credit notes and debit notes and corrects a drafting error.

### Section 20(6) Details of Prompt Payment Discount to be Shown

#### Amendment

This amends section 25(3)(e) of the GST Act to require that the terms of a prompt payment discount be clearly stated on tax invoices in order to avoid the necessity to issue a credit note.

#### Comment

No credit note need be issued if a change in consideration is due purely to a prompt payment discount. The amendment will still enable suppliers to account for a reduced amount of tax, as long as the terms of a discount are made clear on the original invoice.

### Section 20(7) Modification of Credit Note and Debit Note Requirements

#### Amendment

This adds new sections 25(3A) and 25(3B) to the GST Act to ensure the same modification requirements are available for debit notes and credit notes as are available for tax invoices in section 24(2) and 24(6) of the GST Act (ie self-billing and waiving of requirements).

#### Comment

This amendment extends the same flexibility to the issuing of credit notes and debit notes as is available in the case of tax invoices.

### Section 20(8) Adjustment Where Consideration for a Supply Changes

#### Amendment

This substitutes a new section 25(4) in the GST Act to ensure that an adjustment must be made by a recipient when the consideration for a supply changes, whether or not the recipient has been issued a credit note or debit note.

#### Comment

Section 25 was deficient in that a recipient of a supply did not need to adjust input tax unless a credit note had been received. Any notice of a change in the consideration should be sufficient, eg where a prompt payment discount has been taken advantage of.

### Section 20(9) Deduction of Input Tax

#### Amendment

Section 20(9) of the Amendment Act ensures that section 25(5) of the GST Act refers specifically to "input tax".

#### Comment

Refer to the comments on section 20(2) above.

### Section 20(10) Fractions of a Cent

#### Amendment

This adds a new section 25(6) to the GST Act which provides that where the GST component is shown separately on any credit note or debit note, and that GST component involves a fraction of a cent, then the amount may be rounded to the nearest cent. Half-cents and below are to be rounded down.

#### Comment

This amendment is one of a number which ensures uniformity in the treatment of credit notes and debit notes with the treatment of tax invoices. Refer also to the commentary on section 19(5) of the Amendment Act.

### Section 21 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Bad Debts Section 26 of the GST Act 1985

### Section 21(1) and 21(2) Bad Debt Adjustments for Payments Basis

#### Amendment

Section 21(1) amends section 26(1) of the GST Act, while section 21(2) adds a second proviso to section 26(1). These amendments enable a registered person who accounts for tax on a payments basis to claim an adjustment for bad debts that arise in respect of supplies for which they are effectively required to account for on an invoice basis (ie door to door and hire purchase sales).

#### Comment

Section 26 of the GST Act previously allowed an adjustment for bad debts that arose in respect of taxable supplies. This adjustment was however limited to registered persons accounting for GST on an invoice basis. Two types of supply may be made by a person on the payments basis in respect of which a bad debt adjustment is appropriate door to door sales and hire purchase sales (both of which are effectively accounted for on an invoice basis). The amendment allows registered persons who account on a payment basis to take advantage of the bad debt provisions in respect of these supplies.

### Section 21(3) Bad Debts relating to Insurance Levies

#### Amendment

A new section 26(1A) is added to the GST Act to allow an insurer to claim a deduction of the tax fraction of any amount paid to the Earthquake and War Damage Commission or the Fire Services Commission. This is in respect of any taxable policy of insurance, to the extent to which the premium payable on that policy has been written-off as a bad debt.

#### Comment

The new subsection (1A) allows an insurer to claim a deduction where a policy is not cancelled as a result of non-payment of all or part of a premium and a Government levy is payable in respect of that policy. The deduction is equal to one-eleventh of the amount of levy uncollected from the insured and written-off.

### Section 22 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Rights of Objection to Certain Decisions Section 32 of the GST Act 1985

#### Amendment

This amendment to section 32(1) of the GST Act is needed as a result of the insertion of further decision-making powers of the Commissioner.

#### Comment

Section 32 of the GST Act gives a right of objection to certain administrative decisions made by the Commissioner in exercising his discretion on matters such as the liability to register and use of the payment basis of accounting. Further decision-making powers are inserted in the Act as a result of the Amendment Act and it is necessary to extend these rights of objection where appropriate. The GST Act's new rights of objection relate to:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (i) | Section 11(1)(a)(ia) | Commissioner's discretion to zero-rate goods exported from New Zealand. |
| (ii) | Section 15(5) | Commissioner's determination of category for a category C or D registered person. |
| (iii) | Section 25(3B) | Imposition by the Commissioner, of conditions for the variation of credit notes or debit notes. |
| (iv) | Section 84(4) | Approval by the Commissioner of any other competent valuer who is not independent. |
| (v) | Section 86(1) | Commissioner's discretion to allow the use of an alternative method of accounting for GST during the transitional period. |

### Section 23 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Determination of Objection Not to Affect Other Assessments or Decisions Section 39 of the GST Act 1985

#### Amendment

This repeals and substitutes a new section 39. This new section places objections to decisions (by virtue of section 32) on the same footing as objections to assessments.

#### Comment

The amendment corrects a drafting omission.

### Section 24 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Refunds of Excess Tax Section 45 of the GST Act 1985

### Section 24(1) Refunds of Overpaid Tax

#### Amendment

This repeals and substitutes a new subsection 45(1) of the GST Act to limit the effect of the provision dealing with refunds of overpaid tax, to ensure that it is not in conflict with the provisions dealing with simple refunds of GST.

### Comment

This limits the effect of the provision dealing with refunds of overpaid tax, to ensure that it is not in conflict with the provisions dealing with simple refunds of GST.

### Section 24(2) Refunds Resulting from an Assessment

#### Amendment

This repeals the existing subsection 45(2) of the GST Act and substitutes a new subsection 45(2).

#### Comment

The original subsection was the same as contained in the Income Tax Act. In the GST Act its function is restricted to cases of pure overpayments of calculated tax, eg cheques written out for an excessive amount. The amendment is intended to give effect to this, and ensure that it has no impact on the refund of GST by the Commissioner in the course of assessments and return processing.

### Section 25 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Interest on Refunds Section 46 of the GST Act 1985

### Section 25(1) Ability to Offset Interest Payable against Tax Owing to the Department

#### Amendment

This section contains a number of amendments to subsections (1) to (6) of section 46 of the GST Act.

#### Comment

These amendments correct minor drafting errors and allow the Commissioner to set off any interest payable to the registered person against any other tax owing.

### Section 25(2) Interest Ceasing to be Payable

#### Amendment

This adds a proviso to section 46(6) of the GST Act to ensure that interest ceases to become payable when the Commissioner gives the notice required by the proviso to subsection (4) of section 46 of the GST Act.

#### Comment

Section 46 contained two deficiencies in respect of the Commissioner giving notice of his intention to withhold a refund. The deficiencies were -

1.  It was arguable that, where the Commissioner failed to give notice of his intention to withhold payment within 15 working days of receipt of a return he could no longer do so. In fact, the Commissioner should be able to give notice subsequent to this, although interest will still be payable to the date of notice.
2.  If, as a result of correcting the deficiency outlined in paragraph (i), the notice was subsequently sent, interest should cease to be payable from the date of sending the notice. The legislation previously did not achieve this.

### Section 26 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Registration on a Territorial Basis Section 51 of the GST Act 1985

#### Amendment

This amendment to section 51(1) of the GST Act ensures that persons are compelled to register only if they make supplies IN NEW ZEALAND with a total value in excess of $24,000 in any relevant 12 month period.

#### Comment

The legislation previously required all persons who made supplies in the course of a taxable activity to a value in excess of $24,000 to register. Since the taxable activity concept had no territorial restriction, this meant that, potentially, all businesses, anywhere in the world, would have had to register if they made any taxable supplies in New Zealand. This amendment will restrict liability to register to only those who make supplies in New Zealand exceeding $24,000 pa.

### Section 27 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Effective Date of Cancellation of Registration Section 52 of the GST Act 1985

### Section 27(1) Effective Date

#### Amendment

This amends section 52(3) of the GST Act to provide that where a registered person ceases to carry on any taxable activity, the effective date of cancellation of registration will be the last day of the taxable period during which the taxable activity ceased or such other date as may be determined by the Commissioner.

#### Comment

Section 52(2) of the GST Act provides that registered persons who have taxable supplies under the $24,000 threshold may, after 2 years of being registered, apply for cancellation of their registration. The effective date of cancellation, being the last day of the taxable period during which the cancellation of registration is approved.

A similar provision was required where a registered person ceased to carry on ALL taxable activities and applied for cancellation of their registration. The amendment makes the effective date of cancellation the same as in section 52(2).

#### Section 27(2) Consequential Amendment

#### Amendment

Section 52(6) is repealed by this subsection.

#### Comment

This is consequential to the amendment to section 52(3) of the GST Act.

### Section 28 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Registered Persons to Notify Change of Status Section 53 of the GST Act 1985

### Section 28(a) Notification of Ability to Use 6 Month Return

#### Amendment

This removes from section 53(c) of the GST Act the reference to section 15(3) of the GST Act (which dealt with taxable periods), as this reference is now redundant.

#### Comment

Section 53(c) required a registered person to notify the Commissioner within 21 days of any change that affected the ability to use the 6 monthly or one-monthly return period and the ability to use the payments basis of accounting for GST. Now, there are no criteria that need to be satisfied in order to use the one-monthly return, the reference to section 15(3) is therefore redundant and has been omitted.

### Section 28(b) Notification of Any Change Affecting a Direction by the Commissioner

#### Amendment

This inserts the words "or direction" in section 53(c) of the GST Act.

#### Comment

This provides that the Commissioner must be informed within 21 days of any change that affects the Commissioner's determination OR DIRECTION in relation to the ability to use a 6 monthly return period and the payments basis of accounting for GST.

### Section 29 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Grouping Section 55 of the GST Act 1985

### Section 29(1) Grouping of Companies

#### Amendment

A proviso is added to section 55(1) of the GST Act to ensure that the grouping provision applies to all companies which would be able to group (under the Income Tax Act) as if the end of any taxable period were the end of an income year.

#### Comment

Section 191 of the Income Tax Act 1976, which allows grouping of companies, only operates as at the end of an income year. This presented difficulties for companies which would have become eligible to group at some point during a year. These companies should have be able to group for _GST_ purposes from the next taxable period following that time if they wished, rather than having to wait until the end of that income tax year. This would also have worked in reverse, ie if they had ceased to be eligible during the year they would also have ceased to be eligible to group (for GST purposes) at that time.

### Section 29(2) Exempt Activities Carried on by Members of a Group

#### Amendment

This amendment to section 55(7) of the GST Act provides that a taxable supply from one member of a group to another member will only be ignored to the extent that the recipient would have been able to deduct input tax in respect of that supply, if the recipient had not been part of that group.

#### Comment

As the GST Act stood such a supply would have been ignored, notwithstanding that if that supply had been made by an outside person, no input tax deduction would have been available to any member of the group. The amendment rectifies this position. Inputs to the taxable supply will be fully deductible to the supplier through the representative member. The supplier will charge GST on that portion of the consideration for the supply that relates to the exempt supplies made by the recipient that GST not being deductible to the representative member.

### Section 29(3) Supply Deemed to be Made by the Representative Member

#### Amendment

This amendment to section 55(7) of the GST Act provides that any supply, other than a taxable supply, made by a member of a group is deemed to be made by the representative member.

#### Comment

This change merely ensures that exempt supplies (as with taxable supplies), are deemed to be made by the representative member, thus ensuring the correct application of the de-minimis rule to the group situation.

### Section 29(4) Grouping of Companies with Non-Companies

#### Amendment

This amendment to section 55(8) of the GST Act allows companies (registered under the Companies Act 1955) to group for GST purposes with other registered persons who are NOT companies.

#### Comment

Companies which are registered persons may "group" for GST purposes they are a group of companies as determined under section 191 of the Income Tax Act 1976.

Registered persons who are not companies may also apply to be treated as a group for GST purposes where they satisfy the control tests specified in the GST Act.

A similar ability to group is now provided to allow companies and non-companies to be members of the same group where they satisfy the tests that:

1.  one of them controls each of the others; or
2.  one person controls all of them; or
3.  two or more individuals carrying on a taxable activity in partnership control all of them.

### Section 30 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Unincorporated Bodies Obligation of Members Section 57 of the GST Act 1985

#### Amendment

This amendment to section 57(6) of the GST Act provides that all members of bodies other than partnerships, joint ventures or trusts are jointly and severally liable for the payment of any tax.

#### Comment

Subsection 57(6) previously made only those members holding office (eg chairman, treasurer, committee members) liable for tax payable. This amendment brings subsection (6) in line with subsection (3) in that every member is jointly and severally liable.

### Section 31 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Agents and Auctioneers Section 60 of the GST Act 1985

### Section 31(1) Supplies made by Agents

#### Amendment

This repeals and substitutes a new section 60(1). The new subsection ensures that where an agent whether or not a registered person, makes supplies on behalf of a registered principal, the supply is deemed to be made by the principal and not the agent.

#### Comment

Due to the wide scope of the term "supply", the GST Act ensured that supplies made by or to registered persons acting as agents on behalf of registered persons were deemed to be made by/to the principal and not the agent. Non-registered agents are now covered by this provision.

The proviso ensures that only agents who are registered persons have the ability to issue/receive tax invoices, credit notes and debit notes on behalf of their principals. Section 60 previously enabled agents who were registered persons to issue and receive tax invoices only in respect of supplies they made/received on behalf of their principals.

### Section 31(2) Consequential Amendments

#### Amendment

This subsection contains consequential amendments to subsections 60(2) and 60(3) of the GST Act to extend those provisions to cover credit notes and debit notes as well as tax invoices.

#### Comment

This is in line with the amendments in section 31(1), and the other amendments in the Amendment Act, which give credit notes and debit notes the same treatment as tax invoices.

### Section 31(3) Deduction of Input Tax by Agents

#### Amendment

This adds a new subsection (6) to section 60. The new subsection deems the supply of goods and services by a registered person to an agent acting on behalf of a non-resident non-registered principal, to be made to that agent in certain circumstances.

#### Comment

GST is intended to be a tax on final consumption in New Zealand. While transportation services may be physically supplied in New Zealand, the embodiment of the costs of such services in the goods transported implies that the "final consumption" of the services occurs when and where the goods are eventually supplied. There should, therefore, be no GST impact on the price of goods that are exported from New Zealand and no impact on the net cost of goods imported to New Zealand by registered persons.

In order to claim a credit for input tax on the domestic transportation of exported or imported goods, the non-resident importer/exporter may register for GST purposes. This solution may be practical for a non-resident trader with significant dealings with New Zealand, however, for many whose contact may be no more than occasional, registration was not a feasible option.

This amendment enables a New Zealand agent who acts on behalf of a non-resident non-registered principal to deduct input tax incurred on the principal's behalf directly in relation to the exportation or importation of goods from or to New Zealand. This ensures that the GST component of domestic transportation charges, cargo handling fees, insurance and similar charges would not become a cost to the overseas exporter or importer who incurred those costs via a New Zealand agent.

### Section 32 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Offences Section 62 of the GST Act 1985

#### Amendment

The amendment establishes the following new offences:

1.  knowingly issuing more than one tax invoice in relation to the same supply:
2.  knowingly issuing more than one credit note in relation to the same adjustment:
3.  knowingly issuing a tax invoice where no supply will occur.

The penalties for the offences specified in paragraph (i) and (ii) are:

*   a fine not exceeding $2,000 on the first occasion:
*   a fine not exceeding $4,000 on the second occasion:
*   fines not exceeding $6,000 on every other occasion.

The penalties upon conviction in relation to the offence specified in paragraph (iii) above are:

*   a fine not exceeding $15,000 on the first occasion:
*   fines not exceeding $25,000 on every other occasion.

#### Comment

The Act provides for the imposition of penalties in relation to a range of offences. The penalties fall into three categories which reflect the nature and seriousness of each type of offence.

Prior to these amendments, a registered person could have issued more than one tax invoice and more than one credit note for a single transaction without committing an offence under the GST Act.

In order to ensure taxpayer compliance with the provisions of the GST Act these actions have been made an offence.

A potential for abuse also existed with the issuing of a tax invoice where there was no intention of a supply occurring. Such "manufacturing" of tax invoices has also been specifically made an offence.

### Section 33 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Supplies Expressed in Foreign Currency Section 77 of the GST Act 1985

#### Amendment

This amends section 77 of the GST Act to ensure that where a supply is made for a consideration expressed in currency other than New Zealand dollars, the consideration for that supply, for GST purposes, will be the $NZ equivalent at the "time of supply" as determined by section 9 of the GST Act.

#### Comment

Section 77 stated, in general terms, that for GST purposes, all amounts were to be expressed in New Zealand dollars. Some doubt existed as to how this was to be interpreted regarding taxable supplies where the consideration was expressed in foreign currency. The amendment ensures that the consideration for such a supply is to be expressed in the New Zealand dollar-equivalent as at the "time of supply" (generally the earlier of invoicing or payment). Therefore no adjustment is to be made at the time of eventual remittance of funds to New Zealand for any exchange loss/gain.

### Section 34 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Effect of imposition or Alteration of Tax Section 78 of the GST Act 1985

### Section 34(1)(a) Alteration of Contract at Any Time

#### Amendment

This amendment to section 78(2) of the GST Act ensures that a registered person may alter a contract entered into AT ANY TIME (even prior to registration) to take GST into account.

#### Comment

This amendment makes it clear that this section is applicable to contracts entered into before or after the supplier became a registered person.

### Section 34(1)(b) Alteration of Contract when GST Taken into Account

#### Amendment

This amends section 78(2) of the GST Act to ensure that this section cannot be used to alter an agreed price under a contract simply because the contract itself does not explicitly state that GST has been taken into account.

#### Comment

Section 78 enables a supplier to alter a contract to incorporate GST where this has not previously been taken into account. Previously the section may have been used in any circumstance unless "it is clear from the terms of the ... contract" that GST had already been taken into account. Many contracts may not contain a clear expression of this, even though GST has been included in the agreed price. The requirement that the contract had to specifically contain reference to GST is now removed. Section 78 will be operative unless it can be established that GST has been taken into account reference could be made to background and supporting documents to the contract.

### Section 34(2) Limitation on the Time during which a Contract may be Altered

#### Amendment

This amendment to section 78(2) limits the ability of suppliers to increase prices by the amount of GST, consequent to the introduction of the tax, to only contracts or agreements entered into prior to 1 January 1987.

#### Comment

Section 78(2) of the GST Act operates to protect suppliers who have not taken GST into account when setting prices, and subsequently find that the imposition of GST, defined as "an alteration in the law", necessitates an increase in their prices. This provision, which allows suppliers to increase prices that have been already set, has been limited to contracts or agreements entered into prior to 1 January 1987. The limitation has been necessary for consumer protection purposes.

### Section 34(3) Prescribed or Determined Amounts

#### Amendment

This ensures the application of section 78(3) of the GST Act to fees and charges prescribed or determined by statute.

#### Comment

Previously, section 78(3) only referred to fees and charges "prescribed" under an Act or regulation. Acts and regulations also "determine" fees and charges and this merely ensures these are covered also.

### Section 34(4) Statutory Minimum or Maximum Prices

#### Amendment

This amends section 78(3) of the GST Act to add two provisos:

1.  The FIRST PROVISO ensures that the automatic increase of statutory fees and charges provided for under that section will not result in the breach of any requirements under any other statute relating to maximum or minimum pricing requirements.

#### Comment

Where a statute prescribes or determines penalties for breach of maximum or minimum amounts laid down pursuant to that statute, it is not clear whether the imposition of GST on those amounts (and their subsequent increase) may activate those penalty provisions. This clarifies the position by deeming any such maximum or minimum amounts to also be increased by the addition of GST for the purposes of those statutes.

2.  The SECOND PROVISO ensures that section 78(3) does not have the effect of automatically increasing government benefits by the rate of GST.

#### Comment

Section 78(3) was intended to apply only to government fees and charges and other statutory maximum or minimum amounts imposed by Government for taxable supplies. However, the section as it was previously worded could also have been construed to apply to certain benefits paid through departments such as Social Welfare and Health. This would have occurred where benefits, the amounts of which are prescribed by Act or regulation, are payable to help beneficiaries purchase specific goods or services which will be taxable under the GST Act. An example is the General Medical Services Benefit since this is payable to help meet the cost of doctors fees (which will be taxable). Section 78(3) could have had the effect of increasing these benefits by the rate of GST from 1 October 1986, and by any subsequent changes in the GST rate. The amendment ensures that this is not the case. Although an adjustment in such payments will probably occur, the combined effect of the removal of sales taxes and reductions in the rate of income tax may mean that a 10 percent adjustment is not appropriate.

### Section 34(5) Supplier's Power to Recover Increased Prices

#### Amendment

This repeals and replaces section 78(5) which refers to the recovery of "tax charged".

#### Comment

The amendment explicitly provides that where any supply is charged with tax, the amount of any increase in consideration as a result of that charge may be recovered by the supplier from the recipient.

### Section 35 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Deductions for Sales Tax Section 83 of the GST Act 1985

### Section 35(1)(a) Goods Subject to Excise Duty on 1 October 1986

#### Amendment

This amendment to section 83(1)(c) ensures that the credit for sales tax paid on trading stock held at 30 September 1986 is not available in respect of stock of a type that is, on 1 October 1986, subject to excise duty imposed by Part IV A of the Customs Act 1966.

#### Comment

The GST Act was drafted on the assumption that certain goods would continue to be subject to sales tax after the introduction of GST. The provision allowing credit for sales tax on trading stock held at 30 September previously excluded stock of a type subject to sales tax on 1 October 1986. Rather than being subject to sales tax, a small range of goods will now be subject to excise duty. The restriction to the sales tax credit provision is amended to refer to excise duty rather than to sales tax.

### Section 35(1)(b) Sales Tax on Secondhand Goods

#### Amendment

This amendment to section 83(1)(d) ensures that a credit for sales tax paid on imported secondhand goods held as at 30 September 1986 will be allowed.

#### Comment

This is to correct a drafting error. At the time section 83 was drafted to allow a deduction for sales tax paid on trading stock the Department was not aware that sales tax was payable on any secondhand goods. When reported, secondhand car parts are subject to sales tax and, as such, a credit will be allowed where the registered person has paid the sales tax on importation.

### Section 36 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Supplies Prior to 1 October 1986 Section 84 of the GST Act 1985

### Section 36(1) Amended Time of Performance Rule for Goods

#### Amendment

This adds a new subparagraph (1a) to section 84(1)(a) to provide that where a supply of goods involves both ownership passing and the removal of those goods, the time of performance (for the purposes of the transitional provisions) is the earlier of the time of removal OR THE TIME OWNERSHIP PASSES.

#### Comment

For the purposes of determining whether a supply of goods occurs on or after 1 October 1986 (and hence whether GST is payable), the GST Act previously referred only to the time of removal and to the time the goods were made available.

The aim of section 84 is to preclude the avoidance of GST merely by bringing forward the invoicing or part-payment of the supply prior to October 1986. Where the supply of goods involved both their removal and ownership passing, the Act imposed GST in circumstances where ownership passed prior to 1 October but where removal did not occur until after that date. It is considered that extending the above test to recognise that OWNERSHIP MAY PASS prior to the physical removal of the goods does not compromise the aim of the transitional provisions.

### Section 36(2) Time when Services are Performed

#### Amendment

This inserts two new subsections;

1.  Services Performed Uniformly over Period(s) in Contract.  
      
    Inserted is a new section _84(1A)_ which provides that where a registered person supplies or agrees to supply services by virtue of any contract, agreement, or Act, and that contract, agreement, or Act provides, in respect of any period, or periods, that
    1.  any right is granted, or any thing is to be done, or omitted to be done:
    2.  any payment is due or may be made:
    3.  the contract or agreement is in force, or enforceable, or will have effect  
          
        then those services will be deemed to be performed continuously and uniformly throughout that period or periods.

#### Comment

The intended effect of the transitional provisions is that, in general, where goods are delivered or services are performed prior to 1 October 1986 no GST liability will apply to such supplies. Conversely, where the delivery or performance occurs after 1 October 1986, GST will be charged on the supply. Determining the time of supply in this manner overrides the general rule adopted in the Act based on the earlier of the time of invoicing or payment.

Further, where a charge is made prior to the introduction of GST for SERVICES that were to be supplied both before and after 1 October 1986, the portion of the charge that relates to the post-1 October supply will be subject to the tax. The most common example of this is annual membership charges and subscriptions levied by sports clubs and other organisations.

The rationale for imposing the GST in this manner to such supplies spanning 1 October is that, without such a treatment individuals would have been paying GST on goods and services supplied prior to the introduction of the tax simply by virtue of the fact that invoicing or payment first took place after that date. Similarly, individuals would have been able to avoid paying GST on supplies to be received after its introduction simply by making early payment.

The amendment clearly gives effect to the above-stated policy by deeming the time of performance of the services to be continuously and uniformly over the period or periods covered by the terms of the supply. For example, the amendment ensures that an insurance premium is considered to be payment for a supply of services performed continually and uniformly throughout the period of the insurance cover.

2.  Lifetime Licences Inserted is a new section 84(1B) which ensures that lifetime licences issued prior to 1 October 1986 are not taxable.

#### Comment

As the legislation stood, the part of a lifetime licence issued prior to 1 October 1986, that related to the period after 1 October may have been taxable. As there was no way of establishing how long such a licence would exist for after the introduction of GST, and thus the need to apportion the tax, it was decided to disregard the tax liability of lifetime licences issued prior to 1 October 1986.

### Section 36(3) Accounting for GST Payments Based Taxpayers

#### Amendment

This ensures that, in respect of supplies made by or to traders accounting on the payments basis, that trader accounts for tax to the extent that payment has been received before 1 October in the first return furnished after 1 October 1986.

#### Comment

This amendment to section 84 was required to facilitate the accounting for GST on supplies subject to the transitional provisions in a manner consistent with the way they would normally be accounted for by the supplier. Specifically, these amendments were necessary in respect of traders on the payments basis to ensure that in their first return they only account for such supplies to the extent that they have received payment prior to 1 October 1986. Subsequent payments will be taxed as and when received.

### Section 36(4) Consequential Amendment

#### Amendment

This makes subsection (3) of section 84 subject to subsection (4). Note that subsection 84(4) of the GST Act is repealed and substituted by section 36(5) of the Amendment Act.

#### Comment

The amendment ensures that subsection 84(3), which determines the time of performance of a supply of goods and services in general, is subject to subsection (4), which relates to the supply of a building or civil engineering work.

### Section 36(5) Buildings Partly Constructed at 30 September 1986

#### Amendment

This repeals and substitutes a new section 84(4). The new subsection makes it clear that the provision applies only to supplies for which written contracts have been entered into before 1 October 1986. The supplies covered are the construction, major reconstruction, manufacture, or extension of a building or civil engineering work.

The amendment also provides that the total payments in respect of the supply which are deemed by section 9(1) or section 9(3)(aa)(ii) to take place before 1 October 1986 are subtracted from the value of all work and materials permanently incorporated in or affixed on the site of the building or civil engineering work as at 30 September 1986. If the value exceeds the payments made, the excess may be carried forward and applied against the later payments. If the payments made exceed the value as at 30 September then the difference must be accounted for by the supplier as consideration for a taxable supply.

**Comment**

The previous section 84(4) was unclear in that it potentially applied to all subsequent sales of buildings which were partly (or fully) completed as at 30 September. Moreover the justification of compensating purchasers who are subject to GST does not apply to supplies which are not contracted for until after 1 October 1986.

**Examples**

1.  VALUATION OF WORK COMPLETED AS AT 30 SEPTEMBER 1986 EXCEEDING THE TOTAL VALUE OF SUPPLIES MADE under section 9(1) or 9(3)(aa)(ii), i.e., the valuation exceeds any amounts paid/invoiced, or any amounts due to be paid or invoiced. In this situation the first supply that occurs after 1 October 1986 will be reduced by the excess.  
     
    
    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | Contract price | $500,000 |
    | Valuation as at 30 September | $275,000 |
    | Supplies made pursuant to section |     |
    | 9(1) or 9(3)(aa)(ii) | $25,000 |
    | Excess | $25,000 |
    | First Supply after 1 October | $10,000 |
    | Excess | $25,000 |
    | Consideration subject to GST | NIL |
    | Next Supply | $35,000 |
    | Balance of Excess | $15,000 |
    | Consideration subject to GST | $20,000 |
    

2.  VALUE OF SUPPLIES MADE PRIOR TO 1 OCTOBER under sections 9(1) or 9(3)(aa)(ii) EXCEEDING THE VALUATION OF WORK COMPLETED as at 30 September 1986, ie, any amounts paid/invoiced or due to be paid or invoiced exceed the valuation. In this situation the excess is deemed to be consideration in money for a taxable supply occurring on 1 October 1986.  
     
    
    |     |     |     |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Contract price | $600,000 |     |
    | Invoice Issued | Amount Paid | GST |
    | (1) 14.05.86 | $100,000 | \-  |
    | (2) 14.07.86 | $100,000 | \-  |
    | (3) 14.09.86 | $100,000 | \-  |
    | (4) 01.10.86 | deemed supply | $5,000 |
    | (5) 14.11.86 | $100,000 | $10,000 |
    | (6) 14.01.87 | $100,000 | $10,000 |
    | (7) 14.03.87 | $100,000 | $10,000 |
    |     | $600,000 | $35,000 |
    | Valuation of work completed as at 30 September 1986 |     | $250,000 |
    | Progress payments made to that date |     | $300,000 |
    | Supply deemed to occur on October 1986 |     | $50,000 |
    | Total supply |     | $600,000 |
    | valuation of work |     | $250,000 |
    | Taxable portion of supply |     | $350,000 |
    

### Section 36(6) Valuation of Building Work by Qualified Persons

#### Amendment

This permits the Commissioner, in appropriate cases, to allow the valuation of work in progress on buildings as at 30 September 1986 to be made by suitably qualified persons, whether or not independent of the supplier of the building.

#### Comment

It has been suggested that in complying with the transitional rule relating to buildings under construction as at 30 September 1986, it will be expensive to obtain INDEPENDENT valuations. Many builders, however, employ "in-house" valuers and quantity surveyors who could accurately measure the work completed. It is appropriate to allow this work to be undertaken by those persons where possible, subject to the approval of the Commissioner.

### Section 37 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Contracts Entered Into on or Before 20 August 1985 Section 85 of the GST Act 1985

### Sections 37(1)(a) and (b) Statutorily Prescribed Charges and Agreements

#### Amendment

This ensures that transactions based on statutory authority and not on written contracts are subject to the same provisions as those made pursuant to written contracts.

#### Comment

Section 85 zero-rated supplies made pursuant to written contracts entered into on or before 20 August 1985. To ensure consistent treatment, the section is amended to cover supplies entered into on or before 20 August 1985 pursuant to any agreement under statutory authority or licence.

### Section 37(1)(c) Definition of "Non-Reviewable Contract"

#### Amendment

This subsection amends the definition of "non-reviewable contract" to ensure that all pre-20 August 1985 contracts which could conceivably be reviewed in such a way as to add GST will be regarded as "reviewable contracts".

#### Comment

There was confusion over the meaning of the definition of "non-reviewable contract" in the Act. This definition previously referred to a capacity to add GST to a contract price. There was a misconception that the contract must either specifically allow for GST or else contain a formula which would allow GST to be added. The amendment makes it clear that all contracts will be held to be "reviewable" unless it is impossible in some way to adjust the price for GST. For instance, a general review clause (ie one which allows for a renegotiation of the consideration) in a lease will make it a "reviewable contract". Where a contract allows for the alteration of the consideration based on a tax inclusive indicator (e.g. CPI) or a proxy (e.g. tax inclusive turnover), that contract will not be a "non-reviewable contract" as an adjustment has been made, albeit indirectly, for GST.

### Section 37(2) Definition of "Reviewable Contract"

#### Amendment

This substitutes a new definition of "reviewable contract" in section 85 of the GST Act to specify that such contracts must be IN WRITING and specify the consideration for the supply in question.

#### Comment

As the legislation stood, the transitional rules zero-rated supplies made under certain contracts entered into on or prior to 20 August 1985. "Non-reviewable contracts" are fully zero-rated and "reviewable contracts" are zero rated up to the first opportunity for review. However, "reviewable contract" was defined as any contract which is not a "non-reviewable contract". This left open a partial zero-rating to all oral and other contracts which might have satisfied none of the criteria contained in the key definition of "non reviewable contract". It is intended that only those that fail to meet paragraph (c) of that definition (which refers to the ability to review) will be granted the partial zero-rating.

### Section 38 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Alternative Method of Accounting for Transitional Supplies New Section 86 of the GST Act 1985

#### Amendment

This adds a new section 86 to the GST Act. Section 86 provides for an alternative method of accounting for transitional supplies (ie those to which section 84 applies) available at the Commissioner's discretion to registered persons who account for GST on a payments basis. The alternative method allows registered persons who account on a payments basis to simply account for the tax fraction of ALL receipts on or after 1 October 1986, while leaving their ultimate GST liability unchanged.

#### Comment

A general outline of the alternative mechanism is as follows:

The majority of traders using the payments basis of accounting for GST should be able to account for output tax on most supplies by taking the tax fraction (ie, one-eleventh) of total receipts and payments. Although this will be the situation in respect of supplies that occur on and after 1 October 1986, this simple method cannot be used in respect of amounts received for services supplied over a period spanning 1 October as the GST component will not be one-eleventh of the consideration paid.

For example, a trader who accounts on a payments basis must separately recognise receipts that relate to supplies such as service contracts for the April 1986 March 1987 year (the tax component of which is one-twenty first). At the same time, the tax component of all other receipts for supplies which are fully subject to the GST will be calculated using the tax fraction (one-eleventh).

For smaller organisations such as sports clubs, the ability to separately identify these charges in order to apply the different fractions should not prove difficult. Their receipts will generally fall into a narrow range of categories, with the only ones likely to be affected by the transitional provisions being subscriptions. As separate recording of these receipts is generally being undertaken at present no significant problems are foreseen.

It is reasonable to expect, however, that practical problems may exist for larger organisations which will use the payments basis (such as many local authorities) and for smaller organisations with a large range of receipts that may be subject to differing tax fractions.

The alternative method seeks to alleviate these problems. Any person wishing to use this alternative method must make written application to the Commissioner.

In relation to a registered person accounting for GST on the payments basis and to a specified class of supplies, the following adjustments may be made:

**STEP 1:**

(Section 86(2)(a))

Treat as output tax in the first return furnished:

1.  The actual amount of GST received prior to 1 October 1986 (irrespective of whether or not invoiced): and
2.  Any amount of GST invoiced prior to that date and still outstanding at 1 October 1986.

This adjustment merely brings to account the amount of GST that would have been included in the first return if the registered person had been accounting for GST on the invoice basis. As the following adjustments under this mechanism will, over time, be equal, the adjustment at step 1 yields the correct liability in respect of the supplies made over the transition.

**STEP 2:**

(Section 86(2)(b))

Deduct (non-refundable), in the first return furnished, ONE-ELEVENTH of the amount of invoiced debtors at the end of 30 September 1986. For practical purposes, this would be limited to only those debtors which are, at that date, less than two years old.

It should be noted that for local authorities this credit will also need to include one-eleventh of rate instalments for the year to 31 March 1987 not invoiced at 30 September 1986 and not included in debtors above.

**STEP 3:**

(Section 86(2)(d))

On an ongoing basis, the registered person will include in the calculation of output tax ONE-ELEVENTH of all amounts received from 1 October 1986 in respect of the specified class of supplies. This is irrespective of the actual amount of GST that would otherwise be accounted for when those monies are received. The registered person will not include any amounts received:

1.  In respect of bad debts that were written-off prior to 1 October 1986; Any amounts received in respect of bad debts written-off will be separately identified and the GST component (if any) accounted for.
2.  In respect of debtors that were more than two years old at the end of 30 September 1986; Such amounts will contain no GST component and will therefore play no part in the calculation of output tax.
3.  In respect of supplies other than those specified as being subject to this alternative mechanism; These supplies, e.g. supplies of a kind not subject to the transitional provisions, will be accounted for in the normal manner.

**STEP 4:**

(Section 86(2)(c))

One further adjustment may be necessary where debtors existed as at the end of 30 September 1986 but not invoiced at that date as the amount or value of the supply had not then been determined. This will arise, for example, where the charge for a supply is determined on the basis of a meter reading and the meters have not been read on 30 September.

In such a case a credit would be taken (in one return only) of one-eleventh of such debtors that were verified on or after 1 October 1986.

**STEP 5**:

Section 86(2)(e))

As and when any debtors for which a credit was allowed as per steps 2 and 4 above are written-off, a corresponding debit of ONE-ELEVENTH of the amount written-off will be included in the appropriate return.

### Section 39 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 Amendment to Rating Act 1967

#### Amendment

This amends section 65 of the Rating Act 1967 by adding a new subsection (4), which ensures that no rates assessment is invalidated by its use as a tax invoice.

#### Comment

The Rating Act specifies the form which a rates assessment must take. It is possible that the addition of the details required to allow a rates assessment to be treated as a tax invoice would invalidate the assessment for the purposes of the Rating Act. The amendment ensures that this will not be the case.

Part I
------

Section 1 - Short Title
-----------------------

This section provides for this Act to be referred to as the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1987. While the Act does not contain a general application date the provisions of this Act, except sections 2(2), 3(4), 4(1) and 6(2), are to be read as though they came into force on 22 June 1987 when the Act received the Governor-General's assent, and apply to supplies made on or after that day.

Sections 2(2), 3(4), 4(1) and 6(2) have different application dates (refer to the comment on those sections for details).

Section 2 - Interpretation
--------------------------

_**Unconditional Gift**_

This section makes an amendment to the definition of the term "unconditional gift", which is contained in section 2(1) of the principal Act.

An "unconditional gift" is a payment made by a person to a non-profit body, where that payment does not result in the supply of goods and services.

There was concern that when a non-profit body received a grant from the Government and there was no supply of goods and services to the Government, that it was an unconditional gift and not subject to GST. It is the intention that these payments by the Government be subject to GST.

To ensure that payments made by the Government to non-profit bodies are subject to GST, the legislation has been amended to provide that such payments can not constitute unconditional gifts.

This amendment applies to all payments made by the Government from the introduction of GST, ie, 1 October 1986.

**Subsection (1)**

amends the definition of the term "unconditional gift" to exclude any payments made by the Government or a public authority.

**Subsection (2)**

provides for the amendment to retrospectively apply from 3 December 1985, when the GST Act came into force.

Section 3 - Meaning of the Term Supply
--------------------------------------

This section makes 3 amendments to section 5 of the GST Act 1985. These amendments relate to

*   (a) The general liability to GST of goods sold in satisfaction of a debt.
*   (b)(i) Goods sold in satisfaction of a debt where those goods were acquired before 1 October 1986.
*   (ii) Goods and Services retained by a registered person upon ceasing to be registered where those goods were acquired before 1 October 1986.

Part A - General Liability to GST of Goods Sold in Satisfaction of a Debt
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 3(1) of the Amendment Act amends section 5(2) of the Goods and Services Act 1985.

Section 5(2) of the GST Act provides that where a good acquired or produced by a registered person in the course of a taxable activity is taken and subsequently sold by another person in satisfaction of a debt owed by that registered person, that forced sale is deemed to be a taxable supply and is subject to GST. The person who seizes and subsequently sells the good is required to furnish any required returns and account for any GST.

This type of supply commonly arises where a mortgagee or a bailiff sells a good in satisfaction of a debt. Under the previous legislation the mortgagee or bailiff was required to determine whether the debtor was a registered person and whether the good being sold formed part of the debtor's taxable activity. This caused practical difficulties for the mortgagee or bailiff in that it may not have been possible to determine the status of the good being sold (ie, whether it is subject to GST or not), particularly where the debtor was not available to be questioned or refused to supply the information. This left the mortgagee or the bailiff to guess the status of the supply.

Section 5(2) of the GST Act has been redrafted to remove any uncertainty that existed in determining the status of the good being sold. The section now provides that all such forced sales in satisfaction of a debt by a mortgagee or bailiff are subject to GST unless the person whose good is sold furnishes to the person, exercising the power of sale, a statement in writing that the supply of that good is not a taxable supply and giving the reasons why.

It is therefore possible under this amendment that a good sold in terms of section 5(2) will be taxable even if it is owned by a non-registered person or does not form part of a taxable activity, if that person has not furnished the required statement.

This amendment applies to all supplies made on or after the assent date of this Amendment Act (22 June 1987).

Section 5(2) has also been redrafted to ensure that supplies of such goods are subject to GST irrespective of whether they were acquired before or after 1 October 1986.

Part B- (i) Goods Sold in Satisfaction of a Debt Where Those Goods Were Acquired Before 1 October 1986
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\- (ii) Goods and Services Retained by a Registered Person Upon Ceasing to be Registered Where Those Goods were Acquired Before 1 October 1986

**Subsections 3(2) and 3(3)** amend respectively subsections 5(2) and 5(3) of the GST Act 1985.

Subsection 5(2) of the GST Act 1985 is concerned with the sale of goods, which form part of a registered person's taxable activity, and are sold by another person in satisfaction of a debt owed by the registered person. This forced sale is deemed to be a taxable supply and is therefore subject to GST. The person who seizes and subsequently sells the goods is required to furnish any required return and account for any GST.

Subsection 5(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is concerned with the retention of assets, forming part of a taxable activity, by a registered person upon cessation of their registration. This subsection deems a taxable supply of those assets to have occurred and output tax must be accounted for on the retained assets.

An amendment was required to ensure that the wording of these two subsections clearly reflected the intention that these subsections should apply to all goods, irrespective of when they were acquired or produced by the currently registered person. This ensures uniform application to all goods whether they were owned by the registered person prior to the introduction of GST and/or the registration of their taxable activity. It has always been the Department's interpretation that the deemed supplies which occur under 5(2) and 5(3) are taxable, irrespective of the status of the goods and the owner at the time of acquisition. The deemed supply is a completely separate transaction; consumption is now occurring and should be taxed.

**Subsection 3(2)**

removes the words "acquired or produced" in subsections 5(2) and 5(3) of the GST Act and replaces them with the phrase "applied on or after the 1st day of October 1986". Therefore, this amendment provides that where goods are sold in satisfaction of a debt, and those goods were part of the taxable activity of the debtor at the time of sale, then a deemed supply of those goods takes place.

This amendment is deemed to have come into force on the 3rd day of December 1985 (the date of assent to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985) and therefore applies to all such supplies made on or after 1 October 1986. It should be noted that this amendment only applies from 1 October 1986 to date of assent of the GST Amendment Act 1987 (22 June 1987). This is because section 3(1) of the Amendment Act repeals the original subsection and replaces it with the new subsection discussed in Part A above. This concept that section 5(2) applies to all goods irrespective of the date of acquisition or production is still applicable under the new subsection 5(2).

Subsection (3) of section 3 removes the words ", being goods or services in relation to which a deduction pursuant to section 20(3) of this Act has been made,". This removes the concept that the asset must have been acquired or produced during the course of a taxable activity. As long as the assets are part of the taxable activity at the time of cessation of that activity, there is a deemed supply, irrespective of when the asset was acquired or produced and for what purpose it was originally obtained and used.

This amendment is deemed to have come into force on the 3rd day of December 1985 (the date of assent of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985) and therefore applies to all such supplies made on or after 1 October 1986.

Section 4 - Value of Supply of Goods and Services
-------------------------------------------------

Section 4 amends section 10 of the principal Act. That section sets out the rules for valuing supplies of goods and services.

Section 10(12) provides the method for valuing the supply of services that occurs when a person places a bet on a race. The value of the supply for a bet is the sum of the deductions made under sections 42 and 97 of the Racing Act 1971. These deductions are made from the investment pool for each race before the dividend payable to the punter is determined.

The deductions fall into two classes; totalisator duty, and the various levies collected for the Racing Clubs and the New Zealand Racing Authority (NZRA). The levies are taxable charges as they are imposed by registered persons, eg, the Racing Clubs, TAB, and the NZRA. These were increased to take account of GST. In contrast, the totalisator duty (consolidated fund revenue) when deducted from the betting pool is GST exclusive. This was not automatically increased for GST.

Section 10(12) of the GST Act 1985 provides that the total GST liability in respect of the investment pool is calculated as one-eleventh of the total deductions made, including totalisator duty.

As the levies deducted had increased to take account of GST, this calculation correctly determined the GST liability in respect of these levies. Although the totalisator duty itself is not a charge for services, it should be subject to GST when built into the final price of any produce or service, ie, gambling. However, the legislation provided that a liability for GST arose as a result of the duty being treated as a GST inclusive amount, and the legislation had to be amended to recognise this fact.

The main amendment to section 10(12) gives effect to a treatment of betting on races that is consistent with the treatment of other types of gambling, such as lotteries. In those cases the Government duty forms part of the determination of the consideration for the supply.

It is expected that GST returns will be furnished on the current basis by the Racing Clubs and to a lesser extent the TAB, until 31 July 1987.

Due to section 10(12) being amended the Racing Clubs and to a lesser extent the TAB may request reassessments of their GST returns which relate to races held during the period 1 October 1986 to 31 July 1987.

The method of calculating the reassessments is fairly complex, so a separate TPC dealing with the calculation of these reassessments will be issued shortly.

The other amendments are consequential to amendments made to the Racing Act 1971.

_**Consequential Amendments**_

_**Section 4(1)**_ inserts a new subsection (12A) into section 10 of the GST Act. The new subsection ensures that totalisator duty is increased by the rate of GST for the purposes of calculating the consideration for a supply of services under section 10(12). This amendment will apply to bets placed on races held on or after 1 August 1987.

_**Section 4(2)(a)**_ amends subsection (12) as a result of the insertion of the new subsection (12A). Sections 4(2)(b) and 4(2)(c) delete the references to subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of section 42(1)(e) and (f) of the Racing Act 1971. These subparagraphs have been removed from the Racing Act, so were redundant in the GST Act. The amendments made by section 4(2) of the Amendment Act 1987 apply from the general application date of this Amendment Act.

Section 5 - Special Returns
---------------------------

Section 5 amends section 17 of the GST Act.

Section 17 provides that where a supply is made in terms of section 5(2) of the GST Act, the person selling the goods is required to furnish a special return in the prescribed form to account for the GST on the supply.

The amendments to section 17 are consequential to the amendment to section 5(2) of the principal Act as inserted by section 3(1) of the Amendment Act. The term "registered person" where it appears is no longer appropriate and has been replaced with the word "person". This is because section 5(2) no longer applies only to a registered person. Also the registration number of the person whose good is sold is only to be shown if that person is registered.

The amendments to section 17 apply to returns furnished in respect of all section 5(2) supplies made on or after the assent date of this Amendment Act.

Section 5 amends section 17(1) of the principal Act as follows:

*   (a) The word "registered" is omitted where it first appears.
*   (b) The words "if registered", are inserted before the words "registration number" in paragraph "(a)(ii)".
*   (c) The word "registered" is omitted in paragraph "(c)".
*   (d) The word "registered" is omitted where it last appears.

Section 6 - Adjustments
-----------------------

Section 6 amends section 21(1) of the Goods and Services Act 1985.

Where an asset which is used principally for making taxable supplies is used in a non-taxable activity, section 21(1) of the GST Act 1985 requires a registered person to account for output tax on the minor private or exempt use of that asset.

An amendment was required to ensure that the wording of this section clearly reflected that this section should apply to all goods, irrespective of when they were acquired or produced by the currently registered person. It ensures uniform application to all goods whether or not they were owned by the registered person prior to the introduction of GST and/or their registration. It has always been the Department's interpretation that the non-taxable use of goods is a deemed supply under section 21(1) and is taxable. It must be remembered that such a deemed supply is completely unrelated to the status of the goods and the owner as at the time of acquisition. The deemed supply is a completely separate transaction; consumption is now occurring and should be taxed.

_**Subsection (1)**_ replaces the words "acquired or produced" with the word "applied". This emphasises the concept that as long as the good is applied principally in the taxable activity then an adjustment must be made for any lesser use of that asset in a non-taxable activity. A SUPPLY IS STILL DEEMED TO OCCUR.

_**Subsection (2)**_ deems this amendment to have come into force on the 3rd day of December 1985 (the date of assent to the GST Act 1985) and therefore applies to all such supplies on or after 1 October 1986.

Section 7 - Assessment of Tax
-----------------------------

This section makes 4 amendments to section 27 of the principal Act. These amendments provide:

*   (a) For the Commissioner, in certain circumstances, to make an assessment in respect of a return furnished under section 17 of the principal Act.
*   (b) That the person whose goods were sold in terms of section 5(2) of the GST Act is liable for the tax assessed where this person furnished an incorrect statement required under section 5(2).
*   (c) That a copy of the assessment is to be issued where an assessment is made in respect of a return furnished under section 17 of the principal Act.
*   (d) That Parts III, IV, VI and X of the GST Act 1985 apply in respect of the assessments made.

### _**Part A - The Commissioner to Make an Assessment in Respect of a Section 17 Return**_

Section 27 provides for the Commissioner to make an assessment of tax in various circumstances in relation to a taxable period return. The Commissioner may make an assessment where -

*   (a) There is a default in furnishing a return; or
*   (b) The Commissioner is not satisfied with any return; or
*   (c) The registered person is not satisfied with any return made in respect of a taxable period; or
*   (d) Any non-registered person purports to charge tax on supplies.

An assessment is only made where any one of these 4 circumstances applies. Generally, an assessment is not made where a registered person furnishes a return and makes a payment. GST is basically a self-assessed tax. An objection can not be made to a return unless an assessment is made by the Commissioner.

However, where a section 17 return is furnished in respect of a section 5(2) supply (a good sold in satisfaction of a debt), this legislation did not provide for the person selling the goods to be able to request an assessment and thereby object. This is because section 27(1) of the principal Act referred to returns IN RESPECT OF A TAXABLE PERIOD. Further, it did not allow the person whose goods were sold pursuant to section 5(2) to request an assessment and then make an objection.

Therefore section 27 has been amended by inserting a new subsection (1A) to provide that the Commissioner is able to make an assessment of tax in respect of a section 17 return (form GST 121) which is required to be furnished together with the GST charged where a good is sold in satisfaction of a debt (section 5(2) supply). This amendment allowing an assessment to be made applies where -

*   (a) There is a default in furnishing a section 17 return; or
*   (b) The person who furnished the return is not satisfied with the return; or
*   (c) The person whose goods were sold in satisfaction of a debt is not satisfied with the return furnished; or
*   (d) The Commissioner is not satisfied with any section 17 return.

This amendment allows an assessment to be made by the Commissioner in respect of a section 17 return furnished or required to be furnished thereby giving the right of objection. An objection can be made either by the person who sold the goods or the person whose goods are sold. In most cases the person who sold the goods is liable to pay any tax outstanding and is entitled to any refund arising from the assessment.

A significant difference from section 27(1) is that the person whose goods were sold in terms of section 5(2) is entitled to request the Commissioner to issue an assessment in respect of the section 17 return furnished. This is because this person has a vested interest in the supply so the supply by them is deemed to be a taxable supply. Therefore, if the supply has been incorrectly charged with tax because of the statement required by section 5(2) not being furnished, this person is able to supply the correct information in respect of the supply.

### _**Part B - Person Liable to Pay Tax Assessed Where Section 5(2) Statement Incorrect**_

Under this new section 27(1A) the person who sold the goods is liable to pay any tax assessed even though this person acted on the basis of the statement furnished in terms of section 3(1) of the Amendment Act. This would happen where the person whose goods were sold furnished a written statement stating that goods were not taxable. On that basis the person selling the goods would not have charged GST and therefore would not have furnished a section 17 return. However, if at a later date the Commissioner determined that the sale was taxable, the Commissioner would be able to make an assessment of the tax payable in terms of section 27(1A) and the person who sold the goods would, other things being equal, be liable to pay.

Therefore, to protect this person section 27 is further amended by inserting a new subsection (1B). This amendment provides that the person whose goods were sold in satisfaction of a debt is liable to pay the tax assessed in respect of an assessment. This will apply in respect of a section 17 return when the Commissioner makes an assessment because of default in furnishing the return or the Commissioner is not satisfied with the return and the person required to furnish the return holds the written statement required by section 5(2) that is incorrect. The person whose goods were sold and the person who sold the goods are able to object to the Commissioner's assessment.

### _**Part C - Copies of Assessments Issued to Other Persons**_

_**Section 7(2)**_ amends section 27(3) of the GST Act 1985.

Section 27(3) provides for the Commissioner to send the notice of an assessment to the person liable to pay the tax. The amendment rewrites this provision to allow the Commissioner to send the notice of the assessment to the person liable to pay the tax and a copy to the other party where the assessment is made under either subsection (1A) or (1B). This means that when an assessment is made in terms of section 27(1A) the notice of assessment is sent to the person who sold the goods and a copy is sent to the person whose goods were sold. Alternatively, when an assessment is made in terms of section 27(1B) the notice of assessment is sent to the person whose goods were sold and a copy to the person who sold the goods. This then allows both parties to know of the existence of an assessment, thereby giving them an opportunity to object.

### _**Part D - Application to Other Parts of the Act**_

_**Subsection (3)**_ of section 7 amends section 27(6) of the GST Act 1985.

This amendment provides that subsections (1A) and (1B) apply to Parts III, IV, VI and X of the GST Act 1985. This allows a person to be deemed a registered person even though they may not be registered.

These amendments apply from the date of the Governor General's assent, being 22 June 1987.

Section 8 - Limitation of Time for Assessment or Amendment of Assessment
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 31 of the GST Act is amended by section 8 of this Act. Section 31 prescribes the limitation of time for an assessment to be made or altered by the Commissioner where a person has furnished a return in respect of a taxable period. The period to make an assessment or alter an assessment is limited to 4 years from the end of the taxable period in respect of which the return was furnished or the assessment was made. However, where the Commissioner is of the opinion that the person has knowingly or fraudulently failed to make a full disclosure of the facts necessary to determine the amount of tax payable for any taxable period, the Commissioner may make an assessment or alter an assessment at any time. As this section refers to a return in relation to taxable periods it does not apply to a return or assessment made in respect of a section 17 return.

_**Section 8(1)**_ of the Amendment Act amends section 31 by inserting a new subsection (1A). This subsection applies where a person furnishes a return pursuant to section 17 or is assessed for tax pursuant to section 27(1A) or (1B). It limits the Commissioner from making an assessment or altering an assessment after the expiration of 4 years from the end of the month in which the sale was made pursuant to section 5(2) or the assessment was made.

_**Section 8(2)**_ rewrites section 31(2) to allow the Commissioner to issue an assessment or alter an assessment at any time in respect of any taxable period return furnished or return furnished pursuant to section 17. This applies where the Commissioner is of the opinion that the person has knowingly or fraudulently failed to make a full disclosure of the facts necessary to determine the amount of tax payable.

This amendment to section 31 applies to all assessments made on or after the date of assent of this Amendment Act.

_**Section 8(2)**_ repeals subsection (2) and substitutes a new subsection to allow the Commissioner to make or alter an assessment at any time in respect of any taxable period return or return furnished pursuant to section 17. This applies where a person knowingly or fraudulently fails to disclose all the facts necessary to determine the amount of tax payable for any taxable period or return furnished pursuant to section 17.

This amendment applies from the date that the Governor General gave his assent, being 22 June 1987.

Section 9 - Cancellation of Registration
----------------------------------------

This section amends section 52 of the GST Act 1985 which sets out the rules for the cancellation of GST registrations.

Section 52(1) provided that a person must remain registered for at least two years before being allowed to apply for cancellation of their GST registration unless all of their taxable activities have ceased. The purpose of the minimum two year registration period was to prevent persons from registering for a short period of time, claiming input tax credits, and then cancelling their registration.

The amendment removes the requirement that a person must remain registered for a minimum of two years. As section 5(3) of the Act effectively deems a supply to take place of goods and services that have not been consumed upon cessation of registration, the two year limitation on the cancellation of registration is not necessary. The amended section 52 allows a person's registration to be cancelled where the Commissioner is satisfied that the level of taxable supplies in the next 12 month period will fall below the registration "threshold" of $24,000.

This amendment applies from the date this Amendment Act received the Governor-General's assent (22 June 1987).

Part II
-------

### Sections 1, 2 and 3

The Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1987 makes two amendments in respect of the treatment of indemnity payments made or received under a contract of insurance that indemnifies a person for loss of earnings.

The amendments relate to:

1.  Section 5(13) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 which provides that any indemnity payment under a contract of insurance is a taxable supply when it is received by a registered person and relates to a loss incurred in the course of making taxable supplies. Where the supply of the contract of insurance is not a taxable supply this provision does not apply (the proviso to this subsection); and
2.  Section 20(3)(d) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 which provides that in calculating the tax payable in any taxable period, a registered person is entitled to claim one-eleventh of any payment made under a contract of insurance to indemnify any other person as an input tax credit. There are a number of provisions that limit the application of section 20(3)(d).

### Background

In relation to contracts of insurance that provided indemnity cover for loss of earnings, there was a loss of revenue where the indemnity payment was paid to a third party. This arose for example when an employer paid a levy to the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) to cover employees for loss of earnings. The levy was subject to GST which meant the employer may have been entitled to an input tax credit whilst the ACC accounted for output tax. When an employee made a claim for loss of earnings, section 20(3)(d) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 allowed the ACC to claim an input credit in relation to that payment. However, as that indemnity payment was made to the employee who was not a registered person, there was no requirement for the employee to account for output tax on that payment.

Whilst this revenue loss did not occur in all cases where a person was indemnified for loss of earnings, the amendment applies to all indemnity payments made or received to indemnify a person for loss of earnings. This is because there would have been increased compliance costs if registered persons were required to distinguish between payments made to third parties and others.

### Amendments

To overcome this loss of revenue the amendment adds a further subparagraph to the proviso to section 20(3)(d) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to deny an input credit where an indemnity payment is made to indemnify a person for loss of earnings.

As a consequence of the above amendment denying an input tax credit, section 5(13) has also been amended to exclude such indemnity payments from being a taxable supply when received. The amendment to section 5(13) of the Goods and Services Tax Act adds a further subparagraph to the proviso to exclude from a taxable supply those indemnity payments received which indemnify a registered person for loss of earnings.

This amendment applies to all contracts of insurance that provide an indemnity cover for loss of earnings such as earnings related compensation payable under the Accident Compensation Act 1982 and accident policies issued by Insurance Companies that indemnify a person for loss of earnings.

For the purpose of this amendment, "earnings" has the same meaning as the Accident Compensation Act 1982. Section 52 of the Accident Compensation Act includes in the meaning of "earnings":

1.  all wages, salary, allowances, commissions, etc., paid or payable to a person in respect of employment as an employee; and
2.  in relation to a self-employed person, the assessable income of that person derived from the carrying on of a business.
3.  The above is a guideline and it is suggested that either the Accident Compensation Act 1982 or Technical Rulings Chapter 9 Part II is used as a reference as to what is included in and excluded from the meaning of "earnings". Please note that Chapter 9 Part II is based on the 1972 Act but the provisions are similar to those in the 1982 Act.
    
    It should also be noted that the supply of a contract of insurance to provide cover for loss of earnings is still a taxable supply, i.e., the levies imposed by the ACC are a taxable supply.
    
    This amendment applies to all such indemnity payments made or received on or after 23 September 1987. This is the date that the Minister of Revenue announced that there would be an amendment in respect of indemnity payments for loss of earnings.
    
    ### Section 1 - Short Title
    
    **Subsection (1)**
    
    provides for this Act to be read together and be deemed part of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.
    
    **Subsection (2)**
    
    deems this Act to have come into force on 23 September 1987 and applies to all supplies made on or after that date.
    
    ### Section 2 - Meaning of the term "Supply"
    
    **Subsection (1)**
    
    repeals the previous proviso and substitutes a new proviso to exclude the following indemnity payments from the meaning of taxable supply when received by a registered person in the course of making taxable supplies:
    
    1.  Received under a contract of insurance, where the contract of insurance is not a taxable supply (this is the same proviso that was repealed); or
    2.  Received under a contract of insurance that indemnifies that person for loss of earnings.
    
    **Subsection (2)**
    
    repeals section 5(5) of the Goods and Services Amendment Act 1986 which introduced the proviso. This is a consequential amendment.
    
    ### Section 3 - Calculation of Tax Payable
    
    Section 3 adds to the proviso subparagraph (v) that limits section 20(3)(d) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 from applying in respect of indemnity payments made to indemnify a person for loss of earnings.

Goods and Services Tax Bill 1985
================================

Archived legislative commentary on Goods and Services Tax Bill 1985 from PIB vol 149 Sep 1985.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 149, September 1985

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)

The Goods and Services Tax Bill 1985 was introduced to Parliament on 22 August 1985 and referred to the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee.

This Public Information Bulletin contains an outline of the broad principles of GST, and explains the Department's interpretation of the provisions of the Bill.

This commentary was prepared by Inland Revenue Department at the request of the Minister of Finance, with a view to assisting individuals and organisations that may be contemplating making submissions to the Select Committee, and also those persons with an interest in the detail of the proposed application of the tax.

It should be noted that the Bill has no validity until passed into law, and may be subject to change as a result of the Select Committee's consideration.

### Section I Background

### Introduction

The Goods and Services Tax Bill 1985 was introduced to Parliament on 22 August. This Bill gives effect to the Government's proposal to implement a Goods and Services Tax (GST) from 1 October 1986. This commentary outlines the main features of GST and explains the manner in which GST will operate. Until passed, the Bill has no legal effect and some changes may be made during the Parliamentary process. The Department must apply the law in the form that it is ultimately enacted. As a result the commentary contained in this document should not be regarded as binding on the Department.

This commentary is in six sections:

*   This Section outlines the background and broad principles of GST.
*   Section II outlines the detailed operation of the GST.
*   Section III deals with registration.
*   Section IV deals with the furnishing of returns and the calculation of the GST payable.
*   Section V deals with the administration of GST and outlines the assessment and objection, recovery and penalty, and offence provisions contained in the Bill. Certain transitional provisions are also covered.
*   Section VI deals with a number of special topics.

### Background to the Goods and Services Tax Bil

In the 1984 Budget, presented on 8 November 1984, the Government announced that a Goods and Services Tax would be introduced on 1 April 1986. In March 1985 a White Paper on GST was published and submissions were invited on the proposals outlined. In response to that invitation, a total of 1459 submissions were received, reflecting widespread public interest in the proposals.

The submissions were reviewed by a 3 member GST Advisory Panel headed by Dr Don Brash. The Panel's comments and recommendations were submitted by way of two reports to the Minister of Finance. The first was released on 21 June and the second was released on 22 August. The majority of the Panel's recommendations were accepted, and these are reflected in the revised Bill. The most important of the changes made from the White Paper departmental draft legislation are:

*   an optional exemption from registration where a person's turnover is below $24,000 pa;
*   provision for accounting on a "cash" basis as an alternative to the "accruals" basis;
*   alternative return periods for small businesses and exporters;
*   exemption for the sale of donated goods by non-profit bodies;
*   simplification of GST invoices;

After receiving the Panel's report, the Government amended the proposed date for implementing GST from 1 April 1986 to 1 October 1986. This deferral will give interested persons an opportunity to make submissions on the Bill to the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee of Parliament. Submissions to this Committee must be lodged by 27 September and the Committee will then conduct hearings during the months of September and October 1985. It is hoped that the legislation will be passed before Christmas, so that registration can commence early in 1986.

### Broad principle of GST

GST is a broadly based consumption tax. Its objective is to levy a tax on total consumption expenditure in New Zealand. To keep the administration of the tax as simple as possible it will be charged at a single rate - 10% - and will apply, with very few exceptions, to all goods and services supplied in New Zealand. Exported goods and services will be taxable but at a rate of zero percent. GST will also be imposed at a rate of 10 percent on goods imported into New Zealand.

Only persons who conduct a "taxable activity" and are required to register for GST purposes will be liable to charge and account for GST. The term "taxable activity" is defined in clause 6 of the Bill and is explained in Section II of this commentary. Registration is covered in Part VIII of the Bill and is explained in Section III of this commentary.

It is not intended, nor is it the effect, that GST be a tax on business profits or turnover. To arrive at the figure of tax payable to the Department, registered persons who are charged GST on purchases made for their taxable activity (ie input tax) may deduct that tax from the GST they in turn charge and collect on the supplies they make (ie output tax). It is through this mechanism (referred to as "credit offset") that GST charged at each stage of the production and distribution chain will be eventually borne by the final consumer.

The other main features of the operation of the GST are:

*   Any person whose turnover of supplies from a taxable activity is over $24,000 per annum is required to register, and charge and account for GST;
*   A GST return must be furnished periodically. The length of the return period will depend on the nature of the taxable activity carried on by the person. There are three return period lengths:
    *   One month;
    *   Two months; or
    *   Six months;
*   Financial services, sales of goods donated to non-profit bodies, the rental of dwellings and the sale of such rented dwellings will all be exempt from GST;
*   Special valuation rules ensure that where land is supplied by a registered person, tax is not charged on that part of the supply that represents the value of the land.
*   Registered persons whose total taxable supplies are up to $250,000 per annum (excluding GST) may account for tax on a payments (cash) basis rather than an invoice (accruals) basis.

### Section II Operation of GST

### Definitions

Clauses 2 to 6 of the GST Bill are definitional clauses:

*   Clause 2 is the general interpretation clause and defines the majority of the terms used throughout the Bill.
*   Clause 3 defines the term "financial services".
*   Clause 4 defines the term "open market value".
*   Clause 5 defines the term "supply".
*   Clause 6 defines the term "taxable activity".

### Clause 2: General Definition

The more significant defined terms are -

**_Registered Person_**

This is the term which denotes who must charge and collect tax, make returns and pay tax to the Department. It is equivalent to "taxpayer" in the Income Tax Act 1976. It means any person who is registered or is liable to be registered under the Bill.

**_Taxable Supply_**

This is any supply of goods or services made by a registered person in the course of a taxable activity. It does not include an **exempt** supply (page 18). GST is charged **only** on taxable supplies.

**_Goods_**

The term "goods" includes all types of personal and real property. It is much broader in scope than the normal meaning of "goods". It does not however, include choses in action (such as copyrights, debts and insurance policies) which are included within the definition of **services**, nor does it include money.

**_Services_**

This term means anything which is not "**goods**". It does not however include money within its scope. Together with "goods", the term embraces all things capable of being supplied for a consideration with the exception of money itself.

**_Consideration_**

This has been defined widely to include all amounts paid or any act, or forbearance, in respect of supplies of goods and services, whether made voluntarily or not. This will include all Government charges, rates, and all contractual payments. The term is wider than its strict contractual meaning.

It will also cover many Government grants and subsidies which are provided for the supply of goods and services, or where the supply is induced by the grant or subsidy.

**_Input Tax_**

This means -

*   tax charged on goods and services supplied to any person.
*   tax paid on goods imported by that person.
*   an amount of tax calculated by applying the tax fraction to a non-taxable supply of secondhand goods made to a registered person.

In all cases the goods or services must be acquired by the purchaser for **the principal purpose** of making taxable supplies.

No provision has been made to apportion input tax on goods acquired partly for taxable purposes. However, the section entitled "**SUPPLY**" in this Section outlines the treatment of private or exempt use of assets of a taxable activity (eg the use of a motor vehicle to collect domestic rents).

**_Output Tax_**

This is the tax charged on any taxable supply of goods and services by a registered person (ie a supply made in the course of carrying on a taxable activity). Input tax is deducted from output tax to calculate the tax payable to the Department.

**_Tax Fraction_**

This may be used to calculate the GST charged for any period, and is applied to the total consideration for taxable supplies. The formula for determining the tax fraction is:

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tax rate | ie  | 10  | \=  | 1/11th |
| 100 + tax rate | 100+10 |

Applied to the tax-inclusive price of any goods or services, this fraction will give the amount of tax included in that price.

**_Taxable Period_**

This is the period of time covered by a return. This will be either one, two or six months.

**_Tax Payable_**

This is the net amount of GST payable by a registered person and is calculated by deducting input tax, and other deductions, from output tax. This amount must be paid to the Inland Revenue Department and is the basis for all assessments, objections, additional tax, penal tax and all recoveries action.

**Invoice**

This includes any document notifying an obligation to pay. It **may** also be a **tax invoice**, but not necessarily.

**Tax Invoice**

The tax invoice is the documentation required to substantiate claims for deduction of input tax. It is a central compliance element of the tax. It is explained in more detail in Section IV of this commentary (Refer also to clause 26 of the Bill). A tax invoice may be an invoice, but not necessarily.

**Non-profit Body**

This term includes charities and most clubs, etc, that are carried on other than for the purpose of profit or gain to the members. Goods donated to the body are exempt from GST when sold and certain concessions as to registration are available. (Refer to Section VI of this commentary.)

### Clause 3: Definition of Financial Services

Financial Services are exempt from GST under clause 17(a) of the Bill. Exported financial services are, however, zero-rated if they satisfy any of the criteria detailed in clause 14(2). The concepts of exemption and zero-rating are explained later in this Section of this commentary.

The definition of financial services is very detailed and requires an understanding of terms which have not previously been of direct relevance for income tax purposes. It is not proposed to provide a detailed description of all these terms in this commentary.

In general, financial services include -

*   the exchange of money, eg changing New Zealand currency for foreign currency and the changing of notes to coins or vice versa;
*   the payment or collection of a cheque ("cheque" here includes money orders, postal notes and travellers cheques). The payment and collection are activities undertaken by the organisation who issues those items;
*   the issue of travellers cheques, bank cheques, postal notes, and money orders;
*   the issue and transfer of debt, equity, and participatory securities: these include shares in companies, special partnerships and partnerships, debentures, and bills of exchange;
*   underwriting the issue of securities;
*   provision of credit under a credit contract - this includes the credit element in loans, mortgages, overdrafts, hire purchase, credit cards and financial leases (see also page 49-51);
*   the assignment of a hire purchase agreement;
*   the provision of life insurance and reinsurance, or superannuation schemes;
*   the provision or assignment of a futures contract;
*   arranging any of the above - this will include lawyers' activities in arranging loans.

### Clause 4: Definition of Open Market Value

"Open Market Value" is principally used for the purposes of determining the value of certain supplies specified in clause 10. In general, the open market value of a supply will be the price (excluding GST) which the same goods or services would generally fetch in similar circumstances. If this cannot be ascertained, the open market value is the price (excluding GST) which similar goods or services would fetch. If this is not ascertainable the legislation allows the Commissioner to determine a method of ascertaining the value in a fair and objective manner.

### Clause 6: Taxable Activity

**_White Paper_**

The White Paper indicated that the liability to register for GST purposes would be determined by whether a person conducted a "taxable activity". This term was intended to embrace a wider range of activities than those usually envisaged by the use of the term "business". This was done to ensure that organisations such as non-profit and governmental bodies would be included in the scope of the tax. The features of a taxable activity were to include regularity and continuity and the making of supplies for consideration (ie, payment would occur in some form). Finally the total of that consideration would be above some minimum level. In relation to this latter point, the White Paper stressed that such a minimum turnover ($2,500 pa was specified) did not constitute a small trader threshold, but was merely one of a number of factors to be used in determining whether an activity was a "taxable activity". The White Paper stated that occupation as an employee would be specifically excluded from the scope of the definition of taxable activity.

Reference: White Paper (WP) paras 25-29; White Paper Draft Legislation (WPD) cl.4.

**_GST Bill 1985_**

The redrafted definition of "taxable activity" contained in clause 6 of the Bill reflects the intentions of the White Paper, but does so in a slightly different manner than the White Paper draft legislation. The clause specifies that all activities of public and local authorities fall within the term "taxable activity". The range of exclusions is specifically extended to hobbies and the making of exempt supplies. Certain things are deemed to be done in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, (eg anything done in connection with the commencement or termination of a taxable activity, and any employment accepted in the course of a taxable activity).

The explicit requirement for a minimum turnover has been omitted.

_Reference: Goods and Services Tax Bill 1985 (GSTB) cl.6._

**_Comment_**

The scope of the term "taxable activity" is intended to be very wide. In contrast with income tax, GST is a tax on consumption - not profits. Whether or not an activity is conducted for profit is irrelevant in determining whether it will constitute a "taxable activity". Of course practical considerations make it impossible and inappropriate to apply tax to all activities (eg one-off transactions, and those made in the course of an activity of a minor nature) and the requirements of the clause reflect this.

While reference is made in clause 6(1)(a) to the manner in which a taxable activity may be conducted (ie business, vocation, club etc), the term is in no way restricted to activities conducted in such a manner.

The relevant characteristics of a "taxable activity" are:

*   there must be some form of "activity" - economic or commercial;
*   that activity should be carried on continuously or regularly;
*   the activity should involve (or be intended to involve) the supply, for a consideration, of goods and services to another person.

The term is used to describe a "business" in the very broadest sense of that word.

The definition of taxable activity explicitly excludes:

*   **private recreational pursuits or hobbies**, since activities carried on for pleasure represent final consumption (clause 6(3)(a)). The establishment of guidelines in this area may in some cases present difficulties, but the test may be based on the commercial character of the activity - eg whether or not it is for the private pleasure of the person, as opposed to being for the making of supplies for a consideration.
*   **occupation as an employee**, under a master/servant relationship (clause 6(3)(b)). A further provision relates to professionals who accept office with an employer **as part of** their professional activities. Any remuneration from such an office will be subject to tax. (Note: this would not apply to directorships - see below).
*   **the making of exempt supplies** (refer page 18). For instance a business that undertakes both financial services and operates a travel agency is only a taxable activity (and can only claim a deduction for input tax) to the extent of the travel business.
*   **the directorship of a company**. Directors will be treated as employees, and may not register.
*   the Governor-General and others on the Civil List, Judges, Ombudsmen, the Solicitor-General, the Auditor-General, or the Chairman or members of local authorities, statutory boards or other bodies.

### Clause 5: Supply

**_White Paper_**

The White Paper narrative did not explicitly separate the concepts of "supply" and "taxable supply", however the draft departmental legislation did draw this distinction. Broadly a supply of goods was defined as being any supply, and a supply of services only being a supply to the extent that it was for consideration.

_Reference: WPD cl.13._

**_Goods and Services Tax Bill 1985_**

The Bill defines the term "supply" more comprehensively than previously, specifically including a broad range of transactions such as door to door and layby sales, supplies to the Crown by Government Departments, racing bets, payment of insurance premiums, and the purchase of a lottery ticket. An extensive list appears below.

_Reference: GSTB cl.5._

**_Comment_**

A taxable supply is any supply of goods and services made by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. It does not include supplies that are exempt under clause 17. It includes all forms of sale, leasing, bailment and other forms of transfer (clause 5(1)).

"Supply" has been extended in its meaning to specifically include:

*   the forced sale of goods to satisfy a debt owing by the registered person (clause 5(3));
*   any goods or services held at the time the person ceases to be a registered person and for which input tax has been claimed (clause 5(4)). The provision does not apply where a liquidator of executor etc takes over the taxable activity;
*   a credit agreement under the Door to Door Sales Act 1967, (clause 5(5));
*   a layby sale under the Layby Sales Act 1971, where the goods have been delivered and property has passed. A **service** will be deemed to have occurred if the layby sale is cancelled and the seller keeps some of the payment to meet selling costs, or recovers selling costs from the buyer (clause 5(6));
*   a payment by Government to a public authority (clause 5(7)) (ie Expenditure Vote appropriation);
*   the provision of goods and services for the payment of rates (clause 5(8));
*   the placing of a bet (clause 5(9));
*   the purchase of a lottery ticket (clause 5(11));
*   the disposal of a taxable activity as a going concern (clause 5(13));
*   an insurance payout relating to a loss incurred in the course of making the taxable supply (clause 5(14)).

A supply will also be deemed (under clause 5(2)) to include the following:

*   goods and services supplied to an employee by an employer for use other than in the employer's taxable activity;
*   goods and services supplied to a person associated with an employee of the registered person or the registered person himself. An associated person is defined in the same way as in s 67 of the Income Tax Act 1976, and also includes a person acting as trustee to another, and relatives of that person;
*   goods and services applied by a registered person for a purpose other than making a taxable supply (eg trading stock taken for private use). It is this provision (clause 5(2)(b)) that also deals with goods of services used for both taxable and exempt of private purposes (eg a motor vehicle used for both exempt and taxable activities).

The aim of these latter 3 provisions is to prevent avoidance of tax in circumstances where goods and services are taken for private use or supplied to employees or associates free of tax, or at a greatly reduced price. In addition the last provision provides for the recovery of input tax previously allowed where an asset is used for a non-taxable purpose.

### Imposition of GST

**_White Paper_**

The White Paper stated that GST would be levied on the value of goods and services supplied in New Zealand on or after the 1st of April 1986 by a registered person in the course of conducting a taxable activity. It would also be levied on goods imported into New Zealand on or after that date by any person. This GST would be collected by the Customs Department at importation.

Reference: WP paras 22-24; WPD cl 11.

**_GST Bill_**

The Bill differs from the White Paper in only two respects:

*   The rate of the GST to apply is set at 10 percent;
*   The tax will apply to supplies made, and goods imported, on or after 1 October 1986.

_Reference: GSTB cls 8(1) and 15(1)._

**_Comment_**

Clause 8 of the Bill does not deal with the imposition of GST on imports.

In order to be subject to GST, **all** the following conditions must be satisfied in relation to any one supply:

*   there must be a **good or service** involved;
*   that good or service must be **supplied**;
*   it must not be an **exempt supply**;
*   the **place of supply** must be in New Zealand;
*   the **time of supply** must be on or after 1 October 1986;
*   the supplier must be a **registered person**;
*   the supply must be made in the course or furtherance of a **taxable activity** carried on by the supplier;

If the above criteria are satisfied, the amount of tax to be imposed on that supply will be 10 percent of the value determined under clause 10 of the Bill. Tax will, however, be imposed at zero percent if the supplies are covered in the zero-rating provisions in clause 14 of the Bill.

The imposition of GST on importation is dealt with at pages 19 and 20.

### Time of supply(Clause 9)

**_White Paper_**

The White Paper stated that the time when a supply occurs would be the earlier of:

*   the time when the goods were removed or the services performed;
*   the time an invoice was issued;
*   the time of payment;

The White Paper allowed for the time of supply to be determined solely on the basis of invoicing or payment only in certain limited cases.

_Reference: WP paras 34 and 35: WPD cls 15 and 16._

**_GST Bill_**

Following recommendations made by the Advisory Panel, the Bill now allows the time of supply to be determined, generally as the earlier of payment or invoicing. The time of removal/performance test contained in the White Paper is now only relevant in the transitional period (ie to supplies occurring on or around 1 October 1986) and in relation to supplies to associated persons. The Bill does, however, contain specific time of supply rules for a number of special cases.

_Reference: GSTB c1s 9 and 85._

**_Comment_**

The time of supply rules contained in clause 9 are used to determine the return period in which the supply should be brought to account (some modifications are necessary for persons adopting a payments basis). These rules will apply in all circumstances **except** where the transitional arrangements take effect (see pages 40 and 41):

In general, the time of supply will be determined as being the earlier of:

*   the time an invoice is issued; or
*   the time any payment is received by the supplier (clause 9(1)).

**Special rules** apply in a number of circumstances. These specific time of supply rules are as follows:

*   **Associated persons** - clause 9(2)(a) (defined as in section 67 of the Income Tax Act 1976)
    *   where the goods are to be removed, the time of supply will be the time of removal. Where the goods are not being removed, it will be the time they are made available;
    *   with respect to services, the time of supply will be the time services are performed.

If payment is made or an invoice issued for a supply to an associated person before a return is due to be furnished for that taxable period, the time of supply is determined under the general rule explained above.

*   **Deemed Supply for Non-taxable use** - Clause 9(2)(b)
    *   the time of supply is the date on which any goods or service is put to a private or exempt use;
*   **Door to Door Sales** - Clause 9(2)(c)
    *   the time of supply will be the last day the recipient can exercise his right to cancel the agreement (usually 7 days after entering the contract);
*   **Layby Sales** - Clause 9(2)(d)
    *   the time of supply will be the time at which property in the goods passes to the recipient (ie when the goods are eventually delivered or uplifted).
    *   where the layby sale is cancelled, the time of supply of the retained charge is the date of cancellation;
*   **Placing of a bet** - Clause 9(2)(e)
    *   the time of supply will be the time the bet is dealt with in terms of the Racing Act 1971 (which is the time the bets are totalled and deductions made);
*   **Lottery tickets** - Clause 9(2)(f)
    *   the time of supply will be the date on which the first drawing of the lottery or prize is made;
*   **Amusement parlour machines, meters, etc** - Clause 9(2)(g)
    *   the time of supply for coin or .token operated machines, meters or other devices will be the date that the coins are emptied from the machine;
*   **Time payments** - Clause 9(3)(a)
    *   for goods supplied under a hire agreement (other than a hire purchase agreement) or for services which are supplied under an agreement providing for periodic payments, there is deemed to be a separate supply when each periodic payment is due, and the time of supply is the earlier of that due date or the actual date of payment;
*   **Hire purchase** - Clause 9(3)(b)
    *   the time of supply is when the hire purchase agreement is entered into.
*   **Retention Payments** - Clause 9(4)
    *   for contracts providing for the retention of part of the consideration pending full performance of the contract, the time of supply for the retained sum is the date upon which payment of that sum becomes due or is received;
*   **Consideration not determined at time of removal** - Clause 9(5)
    *   for goods supplied where part or all of the consideration is not determined at the time the goods are taken, the supply occurs only to the extent of, and at the time that, payment is due or is received or an invoice is issued, whichever is the earlier. This provision will apply to "pool marketing schemes", such as those operated by the New Zealand Meat Producers Board and New Zealand Milk Board.

### Place of supply (Clause 8(2))

**_White Paper_**

For goods and services to be subject to GST, their supply had to take place, or be deemed to take place, in New Zealand. The White Paper stated that the place of supply for goods was where the goods were situated at the time of supply, and for services, where the supplier of the service was based. Provision was made in the draft legislation to deem certain "exported" services to be supplied outside New Zealand. This would have had the effect of exempting those services rather than zero-rating them.

_Reference: WP paras 32 and 33; WPD c1 14._

**_GST Bill_**

The GST Bill determines the place of supply of both goods and services by reference to whether or not the supplier is resident in New Zealand. In addition, certain goods and services are deemed to be supplied in New Zealand even though the supplier is not resident in New Zealand. The full zero-rating of services is now achieved by a specific provision in the Bill rather than by reference to the place of supply rules.

_Reference: GSTB c1 8(2)._

**Comment**

Only supplies which occur in New Zealand are charged with tax. Under clause 8(2) a supply is deemed to take place in New Zealand:

*   If the supplier is **resident** in New Zealand (regardless of where the goods are situated or the services performed - if this is outside New Zealand the supply is zero-rated under clause 14); or
*   If the supplier is **not resident** in New Zealand, but the goods are in New Zealand at the time of supply or the services are physically performed in New Zealand (by a person who is in New Zealand at the time of supply).
*   The latter rule is modified (in clause 8(2)(b)) in the case of supplies between **two registered persons**. While the supply is deemed to take place outside New Zealand the parties can agree to deem the supply to take place inside New Zealand where the supplier is a non-resident.

**Residence** is defined in clause 2 to mean resident as determined in accordance with section 241 of the Income Tax Act 1976, but is extended to all persons who carry on any taxable activity from a "fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to the carrying on of the taxable activity".

### Value of supply(Clause 10 and 11)

**_White Paper_**

The value of goods and services supplied was generally to be the price paid for those goods and services excluding GST. Adding the 10 percent GST to the "value" of a supply would therefore yield the total amount actually paid by the purchaser. The White Paper stated also that, where the payment was not in money, open market value would be used. It was stated that business gifts of up to $50 would be valued at nil for GST purposes, but that gifts in excess of that amount would be taxed on their market value. Goods taken for private use were to be valued at cost.

Imported goods were to be valued at cost including insurance, freight, and customs duties and any sales taxes applicable.

_Reference: WP paras 36 - 40; WPD cls 9 and 10._

**_GST Bill_**

The Bill outlines specific rules for the determination of the value of a larger number of supplies than was indicated in the White Paper. The general rule remains that the value is the price paid excluding GST, and for supplies for a consideration not in money, the open market value of the consideration is used. Supplies for private use are, however, valued at the greater of cost or consideration paid - a change from the White Paper valuation at market value.

A separate clause is included for the valuation of a supply of land.

The valuation of imported goods is essentially unchanged.

_Reference: GSTB cls 10, 11 and 15._

**_Comment_**

The value of taxable supplies (other than a supply of land) will be the amount paid for the supply but not including GST chargeable (or the open market value where payment is not in money terms) - clause 10(2). This means that the consideration for a supply is tax inclusive. Special rules, however, apply in certain cases:

*   Where,
    *   the supply is made for no consideration or for less than the open market value; and
    *   the supplier and the recipient are associated persons, and the recipient is not acquiring the supply for the purpose of making taxable supplies,
*   the value of the supply will be deemed to be the open market value (clause 10(3));
    
    *   Where,
        *   goods and services are supplied to an employee; or
        *   goods and services are supplied to any person associated with the registered person or an employee; or
        *   goods and services have been taken for the private or exempt use of the registered person,-
    *   the consideration for the supply is deemed to be the cost of the goods or service to the supplier or the consideration paid by the recipient, whichever is the greater. If neither of these can be determined the value of the supply is its open market value (clause 10(7)). It is this provision that values private or exempt use of "business" assets and its effect is to recover input credits previously allowed. (Refer to Section VI - page 51).
        
    *   For credit contracts (eg a hire purchase agreement) - the consideration for the supply will be the cash price disclosed in the credit contract (clause 10(5));
    *   The value of accommodation in hotels, rest homes, hospitals, etc, for stays exceeding four weeks, will be the amount attributable to the supply of goods and services **other** than the accommodation itself (ie the value of the supply will include only the element relating to food taken, laundry services, telephone calls, etc). However in all cases at least of the price for the room will be taxable (clause 10(6)). For stays of no more than four weeks and for the first four weeks of any longer stay, the value of the supply will be the full price paid for the accommodation;
    *   For lottery tickets, the consideration for the supply will be deemed to be the total sale proceeds less the amount paid out or payable as cash prizes (clause 10(14);
    *   For vouchers, stamps, etc, where a monetary value is stated on the voucher
        *   the amount of any premium over and above the stated monetary value is taxed as a tax inclusive charge when the voucher is purchased;
        *   the balance is regarded as tax inclusive price when the voucher is redeemed (clause 10(16)).
    *   Where monetary value is not stated on the voucher (eg milk tokens), the purchase price will be subject to tax when the voucher, token, etc, is **purchased**. This treatment will also apply to postage stamps. The value of the supply when these tokens, postage stamps etc are used is deemed to be nil (clause 10(17));
        
    
    The consideration for the supply of **land** is equal to the value of the improvements. This value is calculated by using the following formula:
    
    | a/b x c |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | a   | value of improvements as shown on the district valuation roll |
    | b   | capital value (ie total value including improvements) |
    | c   | amount paid for the supply of land, including improvements. |
    
    The effect of this method of valuation (which is contained in clause 11) is that GST is not charged on land itself but, if land and buildings are supplied, GST is charged on that part of the price which is applicable to the buildings. Provision is also made in clauses 11 and 12 for a special valuation to be obtained by the registered person, and for objections to be made to the Land Valuation Tribunal; If a consideration relates to both a taxable supply and something else (eg an exempt supply), the consideration must be apportioned between the two elements to arrive at the output tax on the taxable part of the supply (clause 10(18)). An arbitrary, pro rata apportionment will generally be the only basis available.
    
    ### Zero-rating (Clause 14)
    
    **_White Paper_**
    
    The White Paper stated that exported goods and certain services performed in New Zealand for overseas recipients would not be subject to the tax. The draft legislation provided explicitly for the zero-rating of exported goods and deemed "exported services" to be supplied outside New Zealand effectively exempting them from tax.
    
    _Reference: WP paras 16, 32 and 33; WPD clauses 12 and 14(7)_
    
    **_GST Bill_**
    
    The Bill explicitly zero-rates both exported goods and certain "exported services" to ensure that no GST will enter into the costs of either to the overseas purchaser. Because all goods supplied by a supplier who is resident in New Zealand are deemed to be supplied in New Zealand (and hence subject to GST) it has been necessary to zero-rate such goods that are not situated in New Zealand at the time of supply. The list of specified services which are treated as "exported" has been expanded since the release of the White Paper and zero rating now covers almost all identifiable exported services.
    
    _Reference: GSTB clause 14_
    
    **_Comment_**
    
    Where a supply of goods is charged with GST but at a rate of zero percent (ie zero-rating) the supplier is able to deduct all input tax relating to the making of such supplies. This is so because a "zero-rated" supply is defined as being a "taxable supply". This is not the case for "exempt supplies" (see page 18).
    
    In relation to a supply of goods, zero-rating applies to the following:
    
    *   goods exported under the Customs Act 1966 - clause 14(1)(a);
    *   goods not in New Zealand at the time of supply - clause 14(1)(b);
    *   the supply of a taxable activity as a going concern - clause 14(1)(c).
    
    Zero-rating will not apply to exported second-hand goods for which an input tax credit has been allowed.
    
    In relation to a supply of **services**, zero-rating applies to the following:
    
    *   the transporting of passengers or goods into or out of New Zealand clause 14(2)(a);
    *   services physically performed outside New Zealand - clause 14(2)(d);
    *   services directly connected with moveable property outside New Zealand or repairs to goods referred to in s 47(2) or s 181 of the Customs Act 1966 (eg repairs performed in New Zealand to international aircraft that are temporarily imported into New Zealand) - clause 14(2)(c);
    *   services performed in connection with land situated outside New Zealand - clause 14(2)(b);
    *   services supplied for and to a person not resident in New Zealand and who is outside New Zealand when the services are performed - clause 14(2)(e);
    *   the assignment or transfer of copyrights or the like, for use outside New Zealand - clause 14(2)(f)
    *   services that are an agreement to refrain from conducting a taxable activity outside New Zealand - clause 14(2)(g).
    
    ### Exemptions (Clause 17)
    
    **White Paper**
    
    The only exempt supplies that were contemplated at the time the White Paper was issued were:
    
    *   the rental of residential dwellings;
    *   the supply of land (excluding buildings).
    
    The draft legislation was not intended to apply to these exempt supplies as the Provisions giving effect to this treatment were to be drafted after consultation with interested parties.
    
    _Reference: WP paras 17, 114, and 115; WPD na._
    
    **_GST Bill 1985_**
    
    Following the release of the Advisory Panel's reports and two discussion documents issued by the Government, the category of exempt goods and services was extended to include:
    
    *   financial services
    *   donated goods supplied by non-profit bodies, and
    *   the sale of certain rental dwellings.
    
    The concessionary treatment of land is by way of specific valuation provisions contained in clauses 9,11 and 13 of the Bill.
    
    _Reference: GSTB cl.s 3, 9, 11, 13 and 17._
    
    **_Comment_**
    
    No tax is charged on exempt supplies, but no credit for input tax in respect of the making of those supplies is available. Input tax credits are denied by the operation of the definition of "input tax" in clause 2 which requires that goods or services are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Further clause 5(2) deems a "self supply" to occur if goods are put to an exempt use after they are acquired.
    
    Under clause 17 the following supplies are exempt from the tax:
    
    *   **financial services** (other than those which are zero-rated);
    *   **donated goods** supplied by any non-profit body. This exemption reflects the recommendations of the Advisory Panel. While unconditional gifts of **money** are not "consideration" for a supply and therefore not charged with tax, this does not apply to goods donated to a non-profit body (eg for cake stalls or opportunity shops) which are subsequently to be sold in the course of a taxable activity. Since tax has probably already been borne on the original purchase, it was considered inappropriate to tax the goods again when sold by the non-profit body. "Donated goods" are limited to those gifted to a non-profit body and intended for use by that body in its non-profit activities;
    *   **rental accommodation**. This exemption has remained unchanged from that set out in the White Paper. GST will, however, be imposed on short stay accommodation in hotels, motels and hospitals - special valuation rules are provided in clause 10. Landlords of residential dwellings may not claim any input tax relating to the dwelling (eg maintenance, capital cost, rates). The rental of buildings which are not dwellings (eg shops, factories, offices) is not exempt;
    *   **the sale of certain rental dwellings**. Dwellings used for residential rental for five or more years and used for no taxable activity in that time will be exempt if sold by a registered person. For example the Housing Corporation may regularly sell off excess rental stock, and thus be considered to be carrying on a taxable activity of supplying dwellings. Clause 17 of the Bill exempts such transactions. This exemption removes any inequity that might otherwise occur where rental property sales are subject to GST output tax and no input tax deduction has previously been given;
    
    Provision is made for apportionment of output tax on supplies which are partly taxable and partly exempt (clause 10(18)).
    
    ### Importation and excise duty (Clauses 15 and 16)
    
    **_White Paper_**
    
    While the general scheme of the GST contemplates the tax applying to all supplies of goods and services made in New Zealand by registered persons, the White Paper stated that specific provision was to be made for the application of the tax to all goods imported to New Zealand by any person, and for the imposition of GST on goods (mainly alcoholic beverages) supplied at "in bond" prices, ie before excise duty was paid.
    
    _Reference: WP paras 15, 37, 39, and 40; WPD cl 10._
    
    **_GST Bill_**
    
    The Bill contains no significant modifications to the White Paper statements, but does contain a clause which explicitly deals with the imposition of GST on the excise component of goods supplied "in bond" at prices which exclude excise. Both the tax on importation, and the tax on clearance from bond, will be collected by the Customs Department.
    
    _Reference: GSTB cls 15 and 16._
    
    **_Comment_**
    
    **A Importation**
    
    GST will be levied and collected by the Customs Department on goods imported into New Zealand (clause 15(1)). The tax will be imposed at the time that the goods are removed from Customs control (ie clearance from bond), at which point they are "entered/delivered for home consumption". The tax will be payable to Customs by the person importing the goods under the same procedures that apply to Customs duty.
    
    The tax will be levied at 10 percent on the value of the imported goods as specified in clause 15(2) of the Bill. That value will be equal to the sum of:
    
    1.  the Customs value for duty purposes (whether or not Customs duty is payable) as determined under the Customs Act 1966; and
    2.  the amounts of customs duty and sales taxes etc payable and levied under any of the Customs Acts; and
    3.  insurance and freight costs in bringing the goods to New Zealand (if not already included under (i) above); and
    4.  any fees payable at the time of importation.
    
    Any questions on the detailed Customs provisions and procedures that relate to the imposition of GST on imported goods should be referred to the Customs Department.
    
    **B Supplies made at "in bond" prices**
    
    The Customs Department operates a network of bonded warehouses in which goods subject to customs duty and sales taxes may be held, under Customs control, without the imposition of the duty and/or taxes. On release from these controlled areas, the owner of the goods is required to pay any Customs duties and taxes applicable. These warehouses are used for holding both imported goods and also certain goods which are manufactured in New Zealand. An example of the latter is the production of alcoholic spirits and the subsequent bottling of those spirits for final consumption.
    
    The ownership of goods manufactured in New Zealand may pass while they are held in bond, such supplies being subject to GST in the normal way. When the goods are removed from bond by the owner, excise duty may be payable but no supply necessarily takes place. Clause 16 of the Bill ensures that when goods are removed from bond, and excise duty is payable, the owner of the goods is liable for GST on the amount of duty payable.
    
    As with the imposition of GST on imports the Customs Department will be levying and collecting this GST in the same manner as the excise duty itself.
    
    Questions on these provisions and the detailed Customs procedures should be referred to the Customs Department.
    
    ### Section III - Registration
    
    ### General criteria (Clause 53)
    
    A number of changes to the registration criteria have resulted from the Brash Report. Under the White Paper proposals, all persons carrying on a taxable activity were required to register. In contrast, the GST Bill provides that while anyone who carries on a taxable activity may register, the only persons who **must** register are those -
    
    *   who have made sales in any period of 12 months of a value in excess of $24,000. This registration requirement is qualified to the extent that a person is not required to be registered if it can be shown that the value of supplies in the following 12 months will not exceed $24,000;
    *   who can reasonably predict that they will make supplies in excess of $24,000 in the next 12 months.
    
    Where that turnover figure is exceeded for certain exceptional reasons, the person can be relieved from the requirement to register. Those circumstances are:
    
    *   where a scaling down, or cessation of business has resulted in extra sales of stock or plant;
    *   where a capital item has been replaced;
    
    Any person becoming liable to be registered must notify the Department within 21 days of that event. A person may apply for registration in anticipation of commencing a taxable activity.
    
    The Commissioner will determine whether the person is eligible to register, and registration will be effective from the date of the Commissioner's notification.
    
    ### Non-profit bodies(Clause 53(5))
    
    Clause 53(5) allows non-profit bodies (which are defined in clause 2) to treat each branch or division of the body separately when applying the registration criteria. The specific circumstances where this may be done are dealt with in Section VI of this commentary under the heading NON-PROFIT BODIES (page 44). Thus, that branch or division need not register if its turnover is up to $24,000. Note that this concession, which reflects a recommendation of the Advisory Panel, is limited to non-profit bodies and does **not** apply to branches and divisions of other bodies.
    
    ### Cancellation of registration(Clause 54)
    
    Registration may be cancelled where the Commissioner is satisfied that the level of taxable supplies in the next 12 month period will fall below $24,000, or if all taxable activities have ceased. Except where the taxable activity has ceased, a person must remain registered for at least 2 years before the registration can be cancelled.
    
    ### Change in status (Clause 55)
    
    Registered persons must notify the Department of any significant change in their status, eg changes in:
    
    *   name, address, principal taxable activity;
    *   principal address from which the taxable activity is carried on;
    *   changes affecting eligibility to use a taxable period of other than two months or a payments basis for accounting for GST;
    *   eligibility to be a member of a group of companies.
    
    ### Special cases
    
    Part IX of the Bill provides a number of specific rules in relation to:
    
    *   Groups of companies;
    *   Branches and divisions of companies;
    *   Partnerships, joint ventures and co-trustees.
    
    **_Groups of companies (Clause 57)_**
    
    Where a number of companies are a group in terms of section 191 of the Income Tax Act 1976 that group can elect to group for GST purposes.
    
    The effect of this is that one member of the group becomes a "representative member" and will be responsible for accounting for GST in respect of the activities of **all** the members of the group. The individual members are relieved of their liabilities to make returns and account for the tax, but must still issue tax invoices (when requested by recipients outside the group), keep records and register under the Bill.
    
    The Advisory Panel recommended the extension of this principle beyond companies, and subclause (8) is designed to do this for other persons (eg partnerships) linked by common control.
    
    **_Branches and divisions (Clause 58)_**
    
    Any registered person carrying on a taxable activity through branches which -
    
    *   maintain their own accounting systems;
    *   are located in different places or carry out different activities,
    
    can register each branch separately. Each branch, when registered, is to be regarded as no longer being part of the parent body for GST purposes, but:
    
    *   it must retain the same taxable period;
    *   it must retain the same accounting basis;
    *   it must remain registered so long as the parent body is registered.
    
    The separate registration can be cancelled on application by the registered person, but the parent body remains ultimately liable for tax if the branch or division defaults on its obligations.
    
    This provision cannot be used by a business to split its activities into branches so as to utilise the concessions available to businesses with turnovers of taxable supplies below $24,000 or $250,000 (registration and six month returns).
    
    **_Partnerships, Joint ventures and co-trustees (Clause 59)_**
    
    Special rules provide for these types of unincorporated bodies to be registered in their own right. That is, taxable supplies will be made by the partnership, etc, as a whole, not by individual partners.
    
    The members of the body, however, remain ultimately liable for the tax in the case of a default, and are also liable to do all things required to be done under the Act. The term "body" is used in clause 59 to refer to all types of unincorporated bodies. Registration must be in the name of the body, and changes in membership generally have no effect on registration, although in law a new partnership comes into existence every time there is a change in membership
    
    The Bill retains the White Paper rule in respect of unincorporated associations (other than partnerships, joint ventures or trusts) that it is the responsibility of the president, chairman, treasurer or committee members to carry out any duties imposed under the Act.
    
    **_Transitional Provision_**
    
    Part XII of the Bill contains a provision allowing the Commissioner to register persons by 31 August 1986, prior to the introduction of the tax. Refer to Section V of this commentary for further comments in this regard.
    
    ### S Section IV - Tax mechanism - Returns and calculations
    
    ### Introduction
    
    In this Section, the requirements of the returns and the calculation of tax Bill in respect of the furnishing of tax payable will be outlined.
    
    ### Return periods
    
    The return periods are specified in clause 18 of the Bill. Upon registration of any person, a return category will be allocated to that person so as to achieve an even flow of returns each month.
    
    **_Two Month Return Period - clause 18(1)_**
    
    The two basic categories are Category A and Category B. Registered persons included in Category A will account for GST over return periods of two months that will end on the last day of the month of January, March, May, July, September and November. For Category B, the taxable periods will span the two months ending with the last day of the months of February, April, June, August, October and December.
    
    Provision has been made in clause 18(1)(d) of the Bill for Persons in Category A or Category B to apply to the Commissioner to change the end of their return period from the last day of the month to a last day of up to 7 days either side of the last day of the month. This change from the White Paper proposal reflects a recommendation of the Advisory Panel and will enable most businesses to use taxable periods ending with the same date as their internal accounting close-off dates.
    
    **_Alternative Return Periods_**
    
    The Advisory Panel considered that, for smaller businesses and those who expect to regularly receive refunds of tax, the requirement that the return period be two months was unduly onerous. Accordingly, the White Paper proposal that all persons furnish returns for two monthly periods has been modified to provide for return periods of six months or one month to be adopted in certain circumstances.
    
    **_Six Month Return Period - clause 18(2)_**
    
    Registered persons whose turnover of taxable supplies in the previous 12 months has not exceeded $250,000 or whose turnover of taxable supplies for the succeeding 12 months is not likely to exceed $250,000, may apply to the Commissioner for six month return periods. These persons will be allocated Category C. The Commissioner will nominate periods of six months in respect of which returns are to be furnished so that the flow of returns from persons in this Category is spread evenly over the full year.
    
    **_One Month Return Period - clause 18(3)_**
    
    Where 75% of the value of a registered person's taxable supplies made in the past 12 months has been zero-rated or 75% of the value of the taxable supplies to be made in the succeeding 12 months is likely to be zero-rated, that person may apply to the Department to be allocated Category D. Persons in this Category will be required to furnish returns for taxable periods of one month. By adopting this shortened taxable period the cash flow disadvantage to persons in a continuing refund position will be reduced.
    
    **_Change of Categories - clause 18(4)_**
    
    Registered persons who are allocated Category C or D may change that Category to Category A of B upon written application to the Department. In addition, if the circumstances change for any twelve month period so that -
    
    *   the person's turnover exceeds $250,000, or,
    *   less than 75% of the supplies are zero rated,
    
    that person must notify the Department of the change and a two month return Category will be allocated.
    
    **_Return Filing Requirements - clause 19_**
    
    Returns for each taxable period are to be furnished to the Inland Revenue Department no later than the first day of the second month following the last day of the taxable period. For example, for a person in Category A, the last date for furnishing a return for the taxable period 1 January 1987 will be 1 March 1987. December 1986 to 31 January 1987 will be 1 March 1987.
    
    The last date for furnishing a return for any taxable period ending on a day up to 7 days either side of the end of the month (under clause 18(1)(d)) will remain unaltered. That is, the return will still be required to be lodged on the first day of the second month of the last day of the base taxable period.
    
    **_Payment of Tax Payable - clause 25(1)_**
    
    The tax calculated on the return furnished for each taxable period is due and payable to the Department by the same day by which the return is required to be furnished. This is the "due date".
    
    ### Calculation tax payable
    
    Tax payable is arrived at by subtracting, from the total output tax for a taxable period, the total of:
    
    1.  the input tax for that period; and
    2.  certain other amounts such as the GST portion of bad debts written off and refunds for goods returned etc (these other deductions are discussed later).
    
    **_Accounting Basis_**
    
    In the White Paper proposals there was only one method of accounting for GST. In some ways the method resembled an "accruals" accounting system.
    
    The Advisory Panel recommended that, to make GST simpler for persons whose accounting systems are run on a "cash basis" (ie small businesses, non-profit bodies, Government agencies etc), provision should be made for an alternative method of calculation of tax payable. This method is called the "payments basis".
    
    As a result, in the GST Bill, there are two bases of accounting for GST - the INVOICE BASIS and the PAYMENTS BASIS. The choice between these bases determines in which taxable period output tax and input tax is brought to account. The general rule set out in clause 22(1) of the Bill is that all persons should account for tax payable on an "invoice" basis. A registered person may, however, apply to adopt a payments basis in some circumstances. These situations are discussed below.
    
    **(i) Invoice Basis**
    
    As outlined earlier, clause 9 of the Bill provides that a supply generally takes place at the earlier of the date upon which an invoice is issued or the date on which a payment is made. For a person who is required to account for tax payable on an "invoice basis", both input tax and output tax on supplies is accounted for in the taxable period during which the supplies have occurred as specified in clause 9 (clause 23(4)(a) and clause 23(3)(a)).
    
    A deduction for input tax on any supply may be made for that taxable period only if a tax invoice is held for that supply (clause 23(2)).
    
    In the case of tax paid to the Customs Department for imports or goods removed from bond, the input tax is deducted in the taxable period during which the payment is made to the Customs Department (clause 23(3)(a)).
    
    **(ii) Payments Basis**
    
    For registered persons entitled to use the payments basis, if the supply is one that is deemed to occur at the earlier of invoicing or payment, the person only accounts for the output or input tax on that supply in a taxable period **to the extent to which** payment has been received or made in respect of that supply in that taxable period (clauses 23(3)(b)(i) and 23(4)(b)(i)). Where that supply is given a specific time of supply rule under clause 9, the person accounts for all the output tax or input tax on that supply in the period in which the supply has been deemed to occur.
    
    As with the invoice basis, a deduction for input tax paid during the period may only be made in that period if a "tax invoice" is held for the supply.
    
    **(iii) Selection of Accounting Basis**
    
    The general rule set out in clause 22(1) of the Bill is that all persons shall account for tax payable on an invoice basis. A payments basis can only be adopted with the approval of the Commissioner. The payments basis is available to:
    
    1.  Public Authorities, Local Authorities and non-profit bodies; and
    2.  Registered persons whose taxable supplies over the past 12 months have not exceeded $250,000 or whose supplies for the succeeding 12 months are not likely to exceed $250,000 (both amounts exclude GST); and
    3.  Any registered person where the Commissioner is satisfied that, due to the nature, volume, or value of taxable supplies made by that registered person and the nature of the accounting system employed by that person, it would be appropriate for that person to adopt a payments basis. (clause 22(2))
    
    Any such person may adopt a payments basis from registration of from the first taxable period after which the approval to adopt a payments basis is made.
    
    Where a person has adopted a payments basis and ceases to qualify under the criteria set out in (a), (b) and (c) above, that person must notify the Department of that fact and that person must adopt an invoice basis from the next taxable period (clause 22(3)).
    
    **Return Calculation**
    
    On the periodic return, the figure of tax payable for that taxable period is arrived at as follows:
    
    **Step 1**
    
    The output tax on supplies to be brought to account in that taxable period is totalled. This may be done by applying the tax fraction to:
    
    1.  The total consideration for supplies made during the period (invoice basis); or
    2.  The total of the payments received during the period and the total value of supplies made during the period where there are special rules for determining time of supply (payments basis).
    
    Some organisations with more advanced accounting systems may separate the GST charge when "taking up" their sales in their own records. At the end of a period it may be possible for these organisations to total the output tax attributable to the taxable period without applying the tax fraction to the total of supplies made. This approach is also permissible.
    
    **Step 2**
    
    1.  The input tax on supplies for the period is totalled. A similar approach to that outlined in Step 1 is used depending upon whether the registered person accounts on an invoice or payments basis. As stated earlier, NO deduction for input tax incurred may be made until a tax invoice (if applicable - refer pages 29 to 31 is obtained.
    2.  The GST paid to the Customs Department during the taxable period is totalled.
    3.  The other deductions discussed on pages 31 to 36 are totalled.
    
    **Step 3**
    
    The amounts obtained in Step 2 are totalled and the sum is deducted from the figure in Step 1. The resultant figure is tax payable and must be remitted to the Department by the last date for furnishing the return for that taxable period.
    
    If the total of the amounts deducted exceed the amount arrived at under step 1 that excess will be refunded to the registered person.
    
    **_Change in Accounting Basis_**
    
    A person may, on application, change the method of accounting for GST from a payments basis to an invoice basis and vice versa. To ensure that the correct amount of GST is collected, provision has been made in clause 22 of the Bill for appropriate adjustments to be made.
    
    **Special Return**
    
    Clause 22(4) requires that any person who changes the basis of accounting for GST must furnish a special return to calculate the amount of tax payable as a result of the change in the basis of accounting. This return is to be furnished to the Department on or before the last day for furnishing the last return completed on the old basis of accounting (clause 22(5)), ie the first day of the second month following the last day of the taxable period during which the direction to adopt the new basis is given. Any tax payable on the return is payable by the same date.
    
    **Change from an Invoice Basis to a Payments Basis - clause 22(7)**
    
    Where the change is from an invoice basis to a payments basis the input tax deduction made when an invoice was received from a creditor must be reversed to avoid a double deduction when payment is made. Similarly the output tax brought to account on all debtors must be reversed as output tax will be brought to account in a subsequent period when payment is received for the supply.
    
    It is anticipated that the adjustment will be calculated as follows:
    
    **Step 1 -** Identify all debtors and creditors of the taxable activity as at the last day of the taxable period in which the old accounting method is used;
    
    **Step 2 -** Identify those debtors and creditors relating to the supplies that, pursuant to clause 9 of the Bill, have a time of supply occurring at the earlier of invoicing or payment. There is no adjustment in respect of debtors and creditors relating to supplies which have special time of supply rules.
    
    **Step 3 -** In respect of the amount of all debtors and creditors identified above, calculate the total amount of output tax or input tax by applying the tax fraction to the respective totals.
    
    **Step 4 -** Subtract the output tax from the input tax. The result is tax payable. If the output tax exceeds the input tax the person is due for a refund of the excess.
    
    Change from a Payments Basis to Invoice Basis - clause 22(8)
    
    The reverse of the above applies to a change from a payments basis to an invoice basis.
    
    It is anticipated that the adjustment will be calculated as follows:
    
    **Step 1**
    
    Identify all debtors and creditors of the taxable activity as at the last day of the taxable period during which the old accounting method is used;
    
    **Step 2**
    
    Identify those debtors and creditors relating to supplies that, pursuant to clause 9, have a time of supply at the earlier of invoice or payment.
    
    **Step 3**
    
    In respect of the amount of all debtors and creditors identified above calculate the total amount of output tax or input tax by applying the tax fraction.
    
    **Step 4**
    
    Subtract the input tax from the output tax. The result is tax payable. If the input tax exceeds the output tax the registered person is due for a refund of the excess.
    
    Note, however, that only input tax on supplies in respect of which a tax invoice (if applicable) is held may be deducted in Step 4 above.
    
    **_Tax Invoices_**
    
    Before a deduction can be made of input tax, a "tax invoice" must be held in relation to that supply. Clause 26 of the Bill sets out the requirements relating to tax invoices. It must be remembered that a tax invoice is not necessarily the same as an invoice referred to in the previous parts of this Section. An "invoice" for the purposes of attributing a time of supply is a written notification of an obligation to make payment for a supply. A "tax invoice" is a document that contains all the particulars of a supply required in clause 26 and is, in essence, an evidentiary requirement for a credit of input tax. Although a document may be both an "invoice" and a "tax invoice" it is not necessary for each invoice issued by a firm to be a tax invoice.
    
    Each registered person who supplies goods or services to another registered person must issue a tax invoice if requested to do so by that other registered person. The supplier has 28 days from the date of the request to provide the recipient with a tax invoice. Failure to do so within that time is an offence (clause 26(1) and 64(1)(l)).
    
    **Supplies for up to $10**
    
    No tax invoice is required if the consideration for the supply is up to $10. This provision (in clause 26(5) of the Bill) reflects a recommendation of the Advisory Panel. The Panel considered that no invoices should be required for very small purchases such as parking meter charges, newspapers and bus fares, where the issue of tax invoices is, for all practical purposes, not possible.
    
    Registered persons may still deduct input tax included in the purchase price of goods or services if the purchase price is up to $10 and a tax invoice is not held. Such a deduction can only be made, of course, if the supplier is a registered person. It is, therefore, the responsibility of the person making the deduction to ensure that tax is charged on the supply for which the deduction is claimed. From a compliance point of view some record of the nature of supply, the date of the supply and the consideration for the supply should be retained by the person making the deduction (eg a cash book, petty cash book, etc).
    
    **Supplies for up to $100**
    
    The Advisory Panel recommended that supplies for up to $100 in value need not be supported by a full tax invoice but that some simplified tax invoice be acceptable.
    
    Accordingly, under clause 26(4), provision has been made for a tax invoice to be issued containing much less detail than that required for the majority of supplies. This simplified tax invoice must show the following particulars:
    
    1.  The name and registration number of the supplier:
    2.  The date upon which the tax invoice is issued:
    3.  A description of the goods and services supplied:
    4.  The consideration for the supply and a statement that it includes a charge in respect of tax.
    
    **Full Invoices - clause 26(3)**
    
    In the majority of cases a recipient of taxable supplies will be required to obtain a tax invoice showing the following details in order to make a deduction:
    
    1.  The name, address, and registration number of the supplier;
    2.  The name and address of the recipient;
    3.  An individual serialised number and the date upon which the tax invoice is issued;
    4.  A description of the goods and services supplied;
    5.  The quantity or volume of the goods and services supplied;
    6.  The consideration, excluding tax, for the supply;
    7.  The total amount of tax charged;
    8.  The tax inclusive consideration for the supply.
    
    These requirements are similar to those in the White Paper proposal but the requirement for the date of the supply has been omitted.
    
    **Multiple Supplies**
    
    It is intended that, while the Bill refers to single supplies, a tax invoice may contain details of more than one supply. This approach, combined with the power (under clause 61) of a selling agent to issue tax invoices in his own name as if the supply was made by him, will enable agents and auctioneers to provide tax invoices that cover multiple supplies made by different principals.
    
    **Special Cases where Tax Invoices Not Necessary**
    
    The Advisory Panel noted that many transactions take place in the community in circumstances where no invoice is issued. Automatic bank deduction of rental payments was cited as an example. The Report recommended that, where there is an alternative way of establishing that a transaction took place, a tax invoice should not be required.
    
    To reflect this recommendation clause 26(6) provides for a general discretion on the part of the Commissioner to determine that some particulars in relation to a supply or class of supplies not be required on a tax invoice or that a tax invoice not be required at all. The Commissioner will exercise this discretion where there are, of will be, sufficient records available to establish the particulars of the supply or class of supplies. It is anticipated that the Commissioner will exercise this discretion, for example, in automatic bank deduction situations.
    
    **Self-Billing**
    
    The Advisory Panel commented that, in a number of industries, it is common for the **buyer** to create a document evidencing the circumstances of the sale. Examples were given in the rural sector where freezing companies, dairy co-operatives, or selling agents, produce a sales document that is regarded as an invoice. The Panel recommended that provision be made for these documents to be treated as tax invoices even though they were not issued by the supplier.
    
    To reflect this recommendation, provision has been made (in clause 26(2)) for the Commissioner to grant approval for a recipient of a supply to issue the tax invoice for that supply. The approval may be made in respect of a recipient or class of classes of recipient or a supply of class or classes of supplies. The approval must be obtained prior to such tax invoices being issued. The following further conditions must also be met:
    
    1.  The supplier and the recipient must agree that the supplier shall not issue a tax invoice for the supply; and
    2.  Two copies of that tax invoice must be produced, one to be retained by each party.
    
    It is anticipated that approval will be granted for this approach in industries such as the rural industry (freezing companies, dairy co-operatives etc) and, together with the general discretion outlined above, the provisions assure some degree of flexibility in the process of issuing tax invoices.
    
    **_Other Deductions_**
    
    Reference has been made to deductions - other than input tax - that may be made in calculating tax payable for any taxable period. They are specified in clause 23(3), paragraphs (c) to (f).
    
    The deductions fall under 5 headings:
    
    *   Bad debts
    *   Adjustments - debit notes and credit notes
    *   Cash payment for a claim made under a contract of insurance
    *   Use of private/exempt assets
    *   Tax invoice issued after the end of the taxable period.
    
    **(a) Bad Debts**
    
    Clause 28 of the Bill provides for the deduction of the tax charged in respect of a bad debt has been written off during the taxable period. To qualify for this deduction the following conditions must be satisfied:
    
    *   The registered person making the deduction must be accounting for GST on an invoice basis;
    *   A taxable supply for a consideration in money must have been made and output tax on that supply correctly accounted for;
    *   The Commissioner must be satisfied that the registered person has written off as a bad debt the whole or part of the consideration not paid.
    
    Where the above conditions are met, a deduction may be made of the GST in respect of that part of the consideration that is written-off as a bad debt. Prior approval from the Commissioner to make such a deduction is NOT required. This is a change from the proposal set out in the White Paper. In general, this provision reflects the treatment of bad debts adopted for income tax purposes.
    
    **Example**
    
    A supply is made for a consideration of $1,100 ($1,000 + $100 GST) and only one half of the consideration is paid to the supplier. When the supplier writes off the $550 unpaid amount as a bad debt, a deduction may be made calculated as follows -
    
    |     |     |     |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Bad Debt Written Off | X   | GST on Supply |
    | Total Consideration |
    | ie, |     |     |
    | $550 | X   | $100 = $50 |
    | $1,100 |
    
    **Hire Purchase Agreements**
    
    No deduction for a bad debt is available where the supply of goods to which the bad debt relates is a supply under a Hire Purchase Agreement. The effect is to place finance companies, who often have Hire Purchase agreements assigned to them, in the same position as if they had loaned the funds to the purchaser without the security of a Hire Purchase agreement. In this manner, any loss incurred by the financier is treated as a loss of monies loaned rather than the non-payment for a good or service.
    
    **Recovery of Debts Written Off**
    
    If a supplier, after making a deduction for a bad debt, receives payment of part of the consideration, there is deemed to be a further supply made upon which tax is to be charged. In this manner all or part of the deduction previously made for the bad debt is brought to account as output tax.
    
    **Example**
    
    In the above example, if the supplier subsequently recovers a further $330 (ie total payments of $880), the amount deemed to be tax charged on a supply by the person who recovered the debt is calculated as follows:
    
    (Bad debt Recovered / Bad debt Written Off) × Deduction Made
    
    ie $330 / $550 × $50
    
    \= $30 tax charged to be brought to account
    
    **(b) Adjustments - Credit and Debit Notes**
    
    Clause 27 of the Bill specifies how adjustments are to be made to amounts of GST incorrectly brought to account in a prior period (eg as a result of the return of goods sold, discounts of other changes in previously agreed consideration).
    
    A precondition for the application of the provision is that a supplier has either:
    
    *   provided a tax invoice in relation to a supply and the GST shown thereon is now incorrect; or
    *   furnished a return accounting for an incorrect amount of output tax.
    
    The incorrect GST shown on a tax invoice and the output tax incorrectly accounted for must have arisen due to:
    
    *   the supply of goods and services being cancelled; of
    *   the previously agreed consideration for the supply of goods and services being altered, whether due to the offer of a discount or otherwise; or
    *   the goods and services of part of those goods and services supplied being returned to the supplier.
    
    **_Incorrect Output Tax Accounted For_**
    
    Where the person has accounted for an incorrect amount of output tax, an adjustment must be made in the taxable period during which the error became apparent.
    
    1.  Deduction to be Made
    2.  If the amount of output tax accounted for was **too high**, **a deduction** may be made in the return for the amount by which the output tax accounted for exceeds the correct amount of output tax.
        
        **Example**
        
        Goods are sold for a total of $22,000 over a six month period. A provision for a "discount" or "rebate" existed so that if $10,000 or more of purchases are made over that period, 20 percent of the original sale price would be refunded or credited at the end of that period.
        
        The firm supplying the goods accounts for $2,000 GST on sales for the six month period. When the firm "rebates" $4,400 to the purchaser at the end of the period, a GST deduction of $400 (1/11 of the rebate) is made by that firm.
        
    
    2.  Deemed Supply
    3.  If the amount of output tax accounted for was **less than** that which should have been accounted for, the amount of the excess must be **included as tax charged** on supplies in the taxable period during which the error becomes apparent.
        
        **_Incorrect Tax Invoice, Debit and Credit Notes_**
        
        Where the amount of GST shown on a tax invoice is found to be incorrect, a credit note or debit note **must be** issued to the purchaser.
        
    4.  Credit Note
    5.  Where the GST shown on the tax invoice is **too high** a credit note must be issued to the purchaser. This credit note is similar to a tax invoice and must show the following particulars:
        
        *   the name, address, and registration number of the supplier;
        *   the name and address of the purchaser;
        *   the date on which the credit note was issued;
        *   the amount by which the tax charged shown on the tax invoice exceeds the actual tax charged on that supply;
        *   the number of the tax invoice and the date on which it was issued;
        *   a brief explanation of the circumstances giving rise to the issuing of the credit note.
    6.  Debit Note
    7.  Where the GST shown on the tax invoice is too low a debit note must be issued to the purchaser. This debit note must show the following particulars:
        
        *   the name, address, and registration number of the supplier;
        *   the name and address of the recipient;
        *   the date on which the debit note was issued;
        *   the amount by which the tax charged shown on the tax invoice exceeds the actual tax charged on that supply;
        *   the number of the tax invoice and the date on which it was issued;
        *   a brief explanation of the circumstances giving rise to the issuing of the debit note.
    8.  Position of the Purchaser
    9.  Where a purchaser receives a debit note or credit note an adjustment is necessary to returns made by that person.
        
        **In the case of the receipt of a credit note**, the purchaser must treat the decrease in GST shown on the credit note as tax charged on a supply made during the period in which the credit note was issued, ie in the example given earlier of the $4,400 rebate, the purchaser will account for $400 GST as output tax in the period in which the credit note was issued.
        
        Where the purchaser has not claimed a full deduction for the GST shown on the tax invoice (eg where the purchaser accounts for tax on a payments basis and full payment has not been made) only that part of the adjustment that has been deducted needs to be brought to account as output tax.
        
        **In the case of the receipt of a debit note**, the purchaser may make a deduction of the increase in GST shown on the debit note.
        
    
    **(c) Indemnity under Contract of Insurance**
    
    Where an insurance company pays out a cash amount to another person as an indemnity under a contract of insurance, a deduction may be made under clause 23(3)(d) by the insurance company for the imputed GST in that payment. The payment in this case is treated as a tax inclusive purchase and the amount to be deducted is calculated by applying the tax fraction to the amount paid.
    
    As the insurance company will charge GST on the whole of its taxable premiums, this provision ensures that only the "margin" or "value added" by the company is, in effect, subject to GST. In this way the result is the same as that applying to any other enterprise that charges tax on its outputs and receives a credit for the tax paid on its inputs.
    
    The credit, under this paragraph only applies where the contract of insurance, itself, was a taxable supply (ie the premium was taxed). Further, the credit cannot be claimed if the insurance firm acquires goods or services or imports goods as a result of the payment since an input credit will be given in those cases under the normal rules.
    
    **(d) Use of Private/Exempt Assets**
    
    Input tax can only be deducted where the goods or service is acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. There are circumstances where a registered person may acquire a good or service for only incidental "business" use and subsequently that good or service is put to use in the taxable activity of that person. An example could be a private motor vehicle that is either temporarily or permanently put to use in a doctor's practice.
    
    Clause 23(5) of the Bill provides for a deduction to be made where a good is applied for the purpose of making taxable supplies. The amount that may be deducted is calculated by applying the tax fraction to the lesser of:
    
    *   the cost of the goods or service; and
    *   the open market value of the goods or service.
    
    The deduction is available only to the extent that the goods or service is put to business use. An apportionment will be required where the goods or service is only partly used in the business.
    
    **Cost:**
    
    Where the goods or service originally used for some other purpose is subsequently put to use solely is for the purpose of making taxable supplies, the "cost" will be the full cost to the person who appropriated the goods (ie the price for which the goods were acquired by the person or, if he produced them himself, the cost of production including overheads).
    
    **Open Market Value:**
    
    This term is explained fully in Section II of this commentary and is defined in clause 4 of the Bill.
    
    **Example**
    
    In the case of a person who appropriates for his taxable activity a private motor vehicle with an open market value of $22,000 (tax inclusive) and an original price of $33,000, the deduction to be made (under clause 23(3)(e)) is
    
    1/11th of $22,000
    
    ie $2,000
    
    The situation where a good or service is put partly for business purposes and partly for private or exempt purposes is discussed in Section VI of this commentary.
    
    **(f) Tax Invoice Received After Taxable Period**
    
    Clause 23(2) provides that no deduction may be made for input tax on a supply if a tax invoice required under clause 26 is not held by the recipient.
    
    Clause 23(3)(f) provides for a deduction which has been denied, due to the absence of a tax invoice, to be made in a later period if the tax invoice is subsequently obtained.
    
    ### Section V - Administration
    
    ### Assessments and objections (Parts IV and V of the Bill)
    
    ### Assessments
    
    The tax is essentially "self-assessed", that is registered persons will normally calculate and pay tax without any notice of assessment being issued by the Department.
    
    However, the Commissioner has the power (under clause 30) to issue an assessment where -
    
    1.  default is made in furnishing any return; or
    2.  the Commissioner is not satisfied with any return; or
    3.  the registered person is himself not satisfied with any return made by him; or
    4.  any **non-registered** person purports to charge tax on supplies.
    
    **Objections to Assessments**
    
    If an assessment is made, it may be objected to in the same manner as available for income tax assessments, and may be referred to the TRA or the High Court. Interest will be charged on tax in dispute in the same way as income tax. (refer clauses 36-43)
    
    **Other Objections**
    
    In addition, objections may be made (under clause 35) in respect of the exercise of certain discretions by the Commissioner. These discretions relate to:
    
    1.  the taxable period (category A, B, C or D) allocated to a registered person; or
    2.  the accounting basis to be used by a registered person; or
    3.  certain concessions relating to the issue of tax invoices by registered persons (eg eligibility for self billing);
    4.  whether the person is liable to register under the Bill;
    5.  the cancellation of registration;
    6.  eligibility for grouping of companies;
    7.  eligibility for registration of branches or divisions.
    
    These rights of objection have been introduced into the Bill subsequent to the White Paper and are intended to ensure that, where the determination of a matter of importance is left to the Commissioner the affected party has a right to be heard before an independent body.
    
    ### Recoveries, refunds and reliefs (Parts VI & VII of the Bill)
    
    These provisions are modelled very closely on those in the Income Tax Act 1976. The main points to note are -
    
    *   Additional tax will be charged at the rate of 10% for the first month and a further 2% for each extra month the tax remains unpaid (clause 44);
    *   A procedure similar to that in s 400 of the Income Tax Act 1976 will be available to recover outstanding GST (clause 46);
    *   Outstanding tax will rank the same as PAYE, ie as a debt above all secured debts, but after claims for unpaid wages (clause 45);
    *   Refunds may be claimed within eight years of the return period (clause 48(1));
    *   Any GST refund may be set off against any unpaid GST, income tax or other tax (clause 48(2));
    *   The Commissioner may refrain from either collecting or refunding small amounts of tax (of $5 or under) calculated on the return. Such amounts will be refunded if the person so requests (clause 50).
    
    ### Penalties (Part X of the Bill)
    
    ### Penal Tax
    
    The Provisions for imposing penal tax are identical for those applying for income tax. They are dealt with in clauses 68-74.
    
    ### Offences - clause 64
    
    Certain specific offences relating to GST have been included in addition to other offences that are similar to those in the Income Tax Act 1976. To summarise, these offences cover:
    
    *   failure to register as required;
    *   failure to keep proper records;
    *   issuing a false or erroneous tax invoice;
    *   failure to issue a tax invoice when requested by the recipient of goods and services;
    *   representing that tax is charged, by a person who is not registered.
    
    A variable scale of penalties has been adopted. Major offences are punishable by a penalty not exceeding $2,000, or $10,000 in the case of a company. Lesser offences such as failure to keep records, or issuing an incomplete tax invoice, attract a penalty of up to $500, of $2,500 in the case of a company.
    
    Failure to provide a tax invoice, or failure to notify the Department of certain changes in the taxpayer's status, result in a maximum penalty of $100, or $500 in the case of a company, for each month that the offence continues.
    
    ### General (Part XI of the Bill)
    
    This part of the Bill contains provisions dealing with -
    
    *   Record-keeping requirements - clause 76. These are similar to those in the Income Tax Act 1976, but in addition require the retention of tax invoices, credit notes and debit notes. The retention period is 10 years from the end of the taxable period to which they relate.
    *   Avoidance. The general anti-avoidance provision is similar to section 99 of the Income Tax Act 1976. In addition, its provisions prevent companies or other persons from taking advantage of the registration threshold of $24,000, the payments basis, or the longer return period option, by artificially splitting their activity into branches - clause 77.
    *   The effect of the imposition of the tax on certain fixed contracts and statutory charges. The tax can be added to the contract price, or to statutory charges - clause 79.
    *   Disclosure of information between this Department and the Customs Department for the purposes of GST - clause 80.
    *   Power to make regulations - clause 82.
    
    ### Transitional Provisnios(Part XII of the Bill)
    
    Both the first and second report of the Advisory Panel on Goods and Services Tax contained recommendations on transitional provisions associated with the introduction of GST. These were adopted in part and the transitional provisions therefore differ from the proposals contained in the White Paper. Further consideration has been given to the matter. The transitional provisions are in three parts: arrangements for the registration of taxable activities prior to 1 October 1986, arrangements for credit of Sales Tax paid on goods, and arrangements for long-term contracts. The Bill also specifies the tax status of supplies where invoicing, payment and performance span the introduction date.
    
    ### Registration - clause 83
    
    *   The Bill contains criteria for **early registration** of persons prior to the commencement of the GST in October 1986. Essentially, persons must register if they expect to make supplies of more than $24,000 in the year ended 30 September 1986, or can reasonably expect to have such a turnover in the 12 months following 30 September 1986. The Department's aim is to register these persons by 31 August 1986, in preparation for the commencement of the tax. Failure of a person to register by 31 August 1986 is an offence.
    
    ### Credit for Sales Tax - clause 84
    
    *   A full credit will be given to registered persons for Sales Tax paid on trading stock and stationery held at 30 September 1986. No credit will be given for any Sales Tax incurred in the purchase of goods which form part of the depreciable capital of a business. The Bill provides for the claim for the credit to be made in any return furnished before 31 March 1987.
    
    ### Supplies Spanning Introduction - clause 85
    
    Where the time of supply rules under clause 9:
    
    *   determine the time of supply to be **prior** to 1 October 1986 but the delivery/performance of the supply does not occur until on or after that date; or
    *   determine the time of supply to be **on or after** 1 October 1986 and the delivery/performance of the supply occurs prior to that date,
    
    the time of supply will be the time when the goods are delivered/made available or the services are performed.
    
    **Example**
    
    A one year subscription to a magazine covering July 1986 to June 1987 issues will be taxable to the extent that the payment relates to magazines supplied on and after the 1st of October 1986 - **irrespective** of when the subscription is paid or invoiced. In this case, if 3 magazines are supplied prior to 1 October 1986 and the remaining 9 are supplied after that date, 9/12ths of the subscription value is subject to GST. For the following year's subscription (July 1987-June 1988) the time of supply is determined solely with reference to the rules specified in clause 9.
    
    As a result of these provisions some suppliers may need to increase charges when setting subscriptions covering the period after 1 October 1986.
    
    ### Long Term Contracts - clause 86
    
    In relation to contracts currently in existence, the Bill provides that-
    
    1.  For supplies-
        *   made pursuant to binding non-reviewable contracts that do not contain any provision that would allow the agreed price to be altered by an amount of GST; and
        *   those contracts have been entered into on or before the date of the Statement on Taxation and Benefit Reform (20 August 1985),
    2.  no GST will be chargeable - irrespective of whether delivery/performance, invoicing, or payment occur on or after 1 October 1986. Deduction may be made for input tax on such supplies in the normal way;
        
    3.  For supplies made pursuant to all **other** contracts entered into on or before the date of the announcement, GST will apply only to supplies made after the first opportunity for review of the contract price following 1 October 1986. However, where the contract price is reviewed after 20 August 1985 but before 1 October 1986, GST will apply to supplies made on and after 1 October 1986;
    
    For all other supplies, (ie those made pursuant to contracts entered into after the date of the announcement) primary regard will be had to the time of invoicing or payment when determining whether tax is chargeable in respect of any supply. However, it will be necessary to apply the transitional provisions relating to supplies spanning the introduction date (outlined above).
    
    **Construction in Progress - clause 85(3)**
    
    The Advisory Panel in their recommendations on the transition to the GST sought to apply the tax only to that part of payments relating to construction work undertaken after the date of introduction. The White Paper proposed that the time of supply would be determined with reference to the date a building was made available to the customer. The Advisory Panel considered that this treatment would not recognise the fact that goods and services are continuously supplied in the course of construction and that simply determining the time of supply with respect to the date on which the building is made available would unfairly apply the GST to construction undertaken prior to the time of introduction. The Bill provides that for construction projects being undertaken on 1 October 1986, such projects will be taxable only to the extent of the work done and materials fixed on site after that date.
    
    ### Section VI - Special topics
    
    ### Land sales
    
    Land is not exempt from GST, but the consideration for any supply of land, for GST purposes, is limited, under clause 11(1), to the value of improvements (buildings etc) included in the supply. The supply of bare land is not subject to GST. The main points underlying the treatment of real estate transactions are as follows:
    
    *   "land" is defined in clause 2 as a fee simple estate in land, or a tenancy for a term of or in excess of 21 years. Land leased for a lesser period than 21 years will be fully subject to the tax (eg a shop lease for 3 years).
    *   the value of any supply is limited to the value of "improvements", a term defined in clause 2 as meaning all value added to the land (eg buildings, fences etc), but not including landscaping, drainage or subdivision work.
    *   the value of improvements is calculated (under clause 11(2)) on a pro rata basis from the district land valuation roll, under the Valuation of Land Act 1951. An example would be the taxable supply of a building for total consideration of $100,000. If the last Government valuation showed a value of $60,000, of which $40,000 was improvements, the value of improvements included in the total consideration is-
        *   40,000 / 60,000 x 100,000 = $66,666.
        *   The GST on that supply would be 1/11 of $66,666 or $6,060.
    *   there are provisions in clauses 11(3) and 12 allowing the registered person to appeal against the result of that valuation method.
    *   since the term "improvements" does not include the development, levelling, drainage or subdivision of the bare land, land developers (a defined term based on section 67 of the Income Tax Act 1976) will also be required to charge tax on the value represented by any such land development work done by them within 10 years of selling the land. This will require such persons to keep detailed records of GST deducted in respect of development work. This provision (clause 13) is necessary in order to tax value added to the land by development work, while permitting the developer to make full input tax deductions as the work is carried out.
    
    A common question relates to whether the tax will apply to the sale of private dwellings. In general, GST will **not** apply to the sale of houses by private persons. GST will only apply to houses sold **in the course of a taxable activity**, such as the sale of "spec" houses by a builder.
    
    It should be noted that buildings partly constructed as at 1 October 1986 will only be taxed in respect of the value of work done and materials fixed on site on or after that date (see page 41).
    
    **SEecond-hand sales**
    
    "Input tax" is defined in clause 2 and includes an amount calculated by applying the tax fraction to the price of second-hand goods bought by registered persons if tax is not charged on that supply (ie the vendor is not a registered person of the goods are private assets of a registered person). This ensures that when the registered person charges GST when the goods are resold by him, or when he incorporates them into other goods for sale, only the "margin" or "value added" by him is, in effect, subject to GST.
    
    **Example**
    
    A book shop owner purchases used books from a university student for $55. The shop owner may deduct 1/11th of the purchase price (ie $5) as input tax.
    
    ### Agents - Clause 61
    
    The Bill recognises that in agency arrangements the supply is made by or to the principal and not the agent.
    
    The agent may nevertheless issue a tax invoice on behalf of his principal (where the principal is a registered person), and may request a tax invoice when purchasing on behalf of his principal. The agent is required to maintain sufficient records, in respect of such tax invoices, to enable the Inland Revenue Department to trace the principal on whose behalf the transaction was entered into.
    
    Where the agent is registered, he will be required to charge and account for tax on his commission.
    
    ### Auctioneers - clause 62
    
    Auctioneers often do not know, when selling on behalf of a large number of persons, whether the sales will be taxable or not (ie whether the principal is registered). The Bill therefore provides that **with the agreement of the principal**, the auctioneer can treat **all** sales as taxable. When the principal is **unregistered**, the tax collected is paid to the Department by the auctioneer. Where the principal is **registered**, the GST is passed to the principal and is accounted for by the principal in the normal way. It is stressed that this is an optional approach. If both the principal and auctioneer do not choose to adopt this approach, the sale by auction will only be taxable if the principal whose goods are sold is a registered person selling goods in the course of his taxable activity.
    
    Auctions may themselves be carried on on either a tax-inclusive or tax-exclusive bidding basis - the latter will involve the tax being added onto the successful bid, probably when payment is made. It is expected that each auctioneer will decide on the approach that suits him best.
    
    The commission charged by the auctioneer is, of course, subject to GST if the auctioneer is registered.
    
    ### Non-profit bodies
    
    Two specific concessions are available to these bodies. The concessions are -
    
    (a) Where goods or services are **donated** to the non-profit body, the supply of those goods or services by the non-profit body will be **exempt** (clause 17). The body will, of course, be unable to claim tax credits relating directly to the sale.
    
    (b) For the purposes of applying the $24,000 turnover threshold, non-profit bodies may, in certain circumstances, treat each local branch separately. To take advantage of this provision each branch must maintain an independent accounting system, and be identifiable by its activities or its location - clause 53(5).
    
    **Note:** A specific anti-avoidance provision prevents this kind of splitting of business activities in all cases other than non-profit bodies - clause 77.
    
    ### Hire purchase
    
    Clause 9(3)(b) provides that, where goods are supplied under a hire purchase agreement, the time of supply is the date upon which the agreement is entered into.
    
    The value of the supply under a hire purchase agreement is determined in Clause 10(5). As with all other credit contracts, the cash price of the contract (ie the price charged excluding finance charges) is deemed to be the "consideration in money" for the supply, ie the "cash price" is treated as a tax-inclusive selling price and the GST on the supply is arrived at by applying the tax fraction to that cash price.
    
    The GST on hire purchase transactions must be brought to account in the return for the taxable period during which the agreement was entered into irrespective of the accounting basis being used.
    
    There are three different situations in which hire purchase agreements are made:
    
    1.  A retailer sells a good under a hire purchase agreement to which the retailer and the consumer are parties. The consumer makes payments under the agreement, to the retailer, until such time (on the making of the last payment) that title in the goods passes to the consumer.
    2.  In this case the retailer must account for GST on the supply at the time the agreement is entered into.
        
    3.  A retailer, having negotiated a sale to a consumer, sells the goods to a finance company who then sells that goods to the consumer under a hire purchase agreement. The consumer makes the periodic payments, under the agreement, to the finance company until such time (on the making of the last payment) that title in the goods passes to the consumer.
    
    In these circumstances there are two taxable supplies:
    
    1.  One from the retailer to the finance company, upon which the finance company is entitled to an input credit for the GST charged and accounted for by the retailer. The time of supply and accounting basis are covered by the normal rules.
    2.  Another supply, by way of hire purchase, from the finance company to the consumer. The finance company must account for GST on the supply in the return for the taxable period during which the agreement was entered into.
    
    3.  A retailer sells a good to a consumer under a hire purchase agreement to which the retailer and consumer are parties. The retailer then assigns his right, title and interest in the hire purchase agreement to a finance company for a consideration equal to the amount unpaid by the consumer. The consumer then makes the periodic payments under the hire purchase agreement to the finance company until such time (on the making of the last payment) that title in the goods passes to the consumer.
    4.  In this case there are two supplies also:
        
        *   (a) The sale of the goods under a hire purchase agreement by the retailer is a taxable supply and the retailer must account for GST in the return for the taxable period during which the agreement was entered into.
        *   (b) The assignment of the hire purchase agreement is an exempt supply (refer clause 3(1)(h)). This is necessary because if it were a taxable supply by the retailer, no credit would be available to the finance company as the rights under the agreement were not acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies (the provision of credit is an exempt supply).
    
    The GST consequences of these three situations are illustrated in the following examples:
    
    **Example I**
    
    |     |     |     |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | (a) | Retailer sells goods by hire purchase to consumer who is not registered. |     |
    |     | \- Cash price $2,750 (includes $250 GST) |     |
    |     | Output tax - retailer | $250 |
    |     | No input tax credit | \-  |
    | (b) | Retailer sells goods by hire purchase to consumer who is registered |     |
    |     | \- Cash price $2,750 (includes $250 GST) |     |
    |     | Output tax - retailer | $250 |
    |     | Input tax - consumer | $250 |
    
    **Example II**
    
    |     |     |     |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | (c) | Retailer sells goods to finance company |     |
    |     | \- Price $2,750 (includes $250 GST) |     |
    |     | Output tax - retailer | $250 |
    |     | Input tax - finance company | $250 |
    |     | Finance company sells goods by hire purchase to consumer who is not registered |     |
    |     | Output tax - finance company | $250 |
    |     | Input tax - consumer | \-  |
    | eg (d) | As in (c) above except consumer is registered |     |
    |     | Output tax - finance company | 250 |
    |     | Input tax - consumer | $250 |
    
    **Example III**
    
    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | eg (e) | As in (a) and (b) above for sale by finance company to consumer |
    |     | Retailer assigns hire purchase agreement for $2,750 to finance company - exempt from GST |
    
    **Repossession**
    
    Under a hire purchase agreement the person who holds the agreement (ie retailer or finance company) and, as a result, the title to the goods has the right to repossess those goods if the consumer defaults in payment under the agreement. When this action is taken the goods must be resold by the repossessor and the proceeds are appropriated by the repossessor in satisfaction of the whole or part of the debt outstanding.
    
    This resale by the repossessor will be a taxable supply upon which the repossessor will have to account for GST under the normal rules.
    
    **(i) Consumer is a registered person**
    
    *   The passing of possession from the consumer to the repossessor is a supply of a good. The value of that supply is arrived at by the application of the rules in clause 10 of the Bill. Since the basis of the repossession is that a part of the debt outstanding will be forgiven (or the right to recover it will be waived), the supply of the possession of the goods to the finance company or retailer will be treated as a supply for a consideration in money. The amount of the consideration will be the amount of the debt forgiven. As this amount is not determined at the time of repossession, the provisions of clause 9(5) apply. The result is that the supply (repossession) is deemed to take place to the extent that, and at the time payment is due or is received. This will be the time at which the debt is waived ie after the resale of the repossessed goods. The consequence of this approach is that the repossessor will be entitled to an input credit of 1/11th of the debt waived, and the consumer, being a registered person, will have to account for output tax to that extent.
    
    **(ii) Consumer who is not registered**
    
    *   Where the consumer is not a registered person the repossession constitutes the supply of second-hand goods for which the repossessor will be entitled to deduct input tax of 1/11th of the debt waived.
    
    The following are examples of the GST consequences of repossessions and resales:
    
    eg In the examples cited earlier where a good was sold for $2,750 under a hire purchase agreement it is assumed that only $500 was paid by the consumer. The vendor repossesses the goods and resells it for $1,100.
    
    |     |     |     |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | (a) | Goods repossessed from non-registered consumer, Input tax - retailer (second hand goods) | $100 |     |
    |     | Output tax - retailer (on resale) | $100 |     |
    | (b) | Goods repossessed from registered consumer, Output tax - consumer (on repossession) | $100 |     |
    |     | Input tax - repossessor (On repossession) | $100 |     |
    |     | Output tax - repossessor (On resale) | $100 |     |
    
    ### Pricing requirements
    
    The Bill contains no requirements as to how prices are to be displayed. In responding to the Advisory Panel's report, the Minister indicated that unless prices displayed at the retail level are GST inclusive the consumer must be made aware of the "all up" price of the goods on the ticket. It is likely that legislation to give effect to this decision will be included in appropriate Trade and Industry legislation.
    
    ### Pre-incorporation contracts Clause 24
    
    A provision is necessary to cover the situation where a company is being incorporated. Without this provision a problem arises if that company, after incorporation, wishes to claim input tax credits on expenses incurred before its incorporation (technically there is no legal entity in existence before a company is incorporated). Because it is non-existent, it cannot enter into any sort of binding contract, and therefore there are difficulties in claiming input tax when it is necessary for someone (usually the promoter) to make arrangements for the "company" to adopt when the incorporation is finally effected, for example leasing business premises.
    
    It is also clear that a company cannot be registered before its incorporation because no "company" as such exists, and something which does not exist cannot trade. The promoter (person setting up the company) is personally liable on any contract entered into prior to ratification by the incorporated company. Clause 24 allows a company to claim any input tax on goods and services acquired before the company's incorporation by any person (usually a promoter) who becomes a member of the company (and is reimbursed by the company) if the goods and services were acquired in connection with the incorporation or the taxable activity the company would be carrying on once incorporated. The newly incorporated company is deemed to be the recipient of the goods or services in this situation, and to have paid the tax charged, as if the supply had occurred during the taxable period in which the person was reimbursed by the company. This is subject to a number of conditions listed in the proviso.
    
    This ensures that new companies are not unfairly disadvantaged by being unable to claim input credits and corrects a situation that would otherwise be an anomaly in the GST system.
    
    ### Racing
    
    A special provision on racing is needed in the Goods and Services Tax Bill because only a certain proportion of any bet placed relates to services received by the person placing the bet. The remainder of the bet relates to prizes paid out. It is not the intention to tax prize money, therefore GST is not payable on the full price of a bet. If there is a $1 bet placed, and 80c is paid out in prizes, only the 20c retained by the organiser will be charged with GST.
    
    Clause 5(9) deems a supply to be made where any person bets money on any race, and details the part of the supply deemed to be made by, respectively, the racing club, TAB and New Zealand Racing Authority.
    
    The time of supply (clause 9(2)(e)) is set by reference to the Racing Act 1971. This ensures that the supply of services does not take place when the bet is made, but takes place when the deductions under the Racing Act 1971 (levies etc) are received by the various bodies.
    
    The value of the supply is split between the three organisations mentioned above. (This is done because of the structuring of the racing system pursuant to the Racing Act 1971).
    
    Clause 10(12) states that the consideration for any supply of services deemed to have been made under Clause 5(9) are the deductions made from the total amount of betting under Section 42 and 97 of the Racing Act 1971. This clause ensures that prize money is not subject to GST and that only the sum of the deductions are subject to GST.
    
    The percentage rates of the deductions are listed in the Racing Act 1971 and each body whether it is the Racing Club, TAB or New Zealand Racing Authority, then has to account for GST on the total of the deductions they received.
    
    ### Lotteries and raffles
    
    It is necessary to have specific provision for lotteries to only subject only the services portion to GST. A proportion of the total ticket price will be charged with GST and the sum that is to be paid back in prizes to the ticket holders will not be subject to tax.
    
    The Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977 covers these areas:
    
    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | New Zealand lotteries | \- Golden and Mammoth Kiwis only; |
    | New Zealand prize competitions; |     |
    | Games of chance | \- includes Roulette, Crown and Anchor, Unders and Overs, Pontoon and Rodeo Raceway.  <br>\- also includes Housie which is governed by the Housie Regulations 1975.  <br>\- also includes games of chance played by means of an amusement device such as video machines, pinball machines, flipball; |
    | Prize competitions | \- includes Spot the Ball, similar newspaper competitions, duplicate bridge, snooker. |
    
    Clause 5(11) deems a supply of services to occur where a person pays any amount of money to participate in a New Zealand lottery, New Zealand prize competition, lottery, prize competition, or game of chance. The person or body who organises it is deemed to have supplied the services.
    
    The time of any supply under clause 9(2)(f) is when the first drawing occurs. This ensures that if there is more than one drawing of prizes for any lottery or other competition, that liability to pay GST arises on the date of the first drawing.
    
    Games of chance played by means of a gaming machine or an amusement device come under the time of supply provision in clause 9(2)(g) which applies to all coin operated machines. The time of supply for these machines is when the machine is emptied of its coins or tokens.
    
    The consideration for a supply deemed to be made under clause 5(11) is the total proceeds of the sale of tickets, **after deducting all prizes payable** in respect of that lottery or other competition (clause 10(14)). This ensures that the money to be paid back in prizes is not subject to GST. The person or body who conducts the lottery or any other competition must account for GST on the sum that is left.
    
    **Note:** It is important to note here that, like racing, it is the ticket buyer who is the consumer in this situation. Where any selling agent, for example, is paid commission, he too must charge for GST on this amount, and give a tax invoice to the person who pays the commission to him (for example the New Zealand Lottery Board). The Lottery Board can then claim an input credit for the GST paid on the commission, and the selling agent accounts for the GST charged.
    
    ### Provision of business credit
    
    Financial services are exempt from GST under clause 17. Included in the definition of financial services (in clause 3) is "the provision of credit under a credit contract", a credit contract being as defined in the Credit Contracts Act 1981. The definition in that Act is very broad and essentially encompasses all agreements that provide for the supply of goods of services where payment will occur at a later stage at a price in excess of the "cash price" (ie the price if payment were made at the time the contract is made). The extension of credit for periods of up to 2 months is not included, therefore most common transactions involving a trade discount (eg payment by 20th of month following) are not covered by the exemption.
    
    In general, the definition will encompass (and therefore exempt) any excess charged over the "cash price" for a supply of goods or services where the agreement provides for the extension of credit for a period in excess of 2 months.
    
    **Extension of Credit for up to 2 Months**
    
    Where a discount is offered for payment prior to a due date, or a penalty/charge will be imposed for payment after that due date, and that due date is within 2 months of the date on which the contract for the supply is made, there will generally be no credit contract exemption. For example, where a purchase is made on terms that impose a charge if payment is not made within 7 weeks, no credit contract exists and the charge received on late payment is taxable in full to the supplier.
    
    If a supply is made on terms which offer a discount for prompt payment, and a tax invoice is issued prior to the deadline for taking up the discount, the tax invoice will show the full sale price and charge GST accordingly. Where the discount is subsequently taken up, a credit note will have to be issued to the purchaser showing the adjustment.
    
    Where the tax invoice is issued after the deadline for taking up the discount, no adjustment is needed as the tax invoice will show the correct consideration. If no tax invoice is issued, there is no need for any adjustment.
    
    **Extension of Credit in Excess of 2 Months**
    
    Where a sale is made on terms under which the recipient is obliged to pay an amount in excess of the "cash price" and the imposition of that excess will occur at some time after two months since the contract is made, a credit contract is likely to exist and the credit provided under that contract (ie the excess charged) will be exempt for GST purposes. For example, where a purchase is made from a retailer on terms that if the account is not paid within 10 weeks a 10 percent penalty will be imposed, a credit contract will exist and the penalty charge for the provision of that credit will be exempt from GST.
    
    For traders who provide credit under a credit contract, no GST will be chargeable on the credit charges received, and those traders will not be entitled to a refund of GST paid on inputs purchased for the principal purpose of providing that credit. In determining what input deductions will be denied, regard will be had to the extra inputs that are required as a result of the provision of credits, ie those that would not have otherwise been purchased.
    
    When issuing tax invoices for such transactions it is only the "cash price" that will be subject to GST. If a discount is not taken up or a credit charge imposed, that excess over the cash price is not subject to GST. Provided the tax invoice correctly shows the cash price, no further action is required.
    
    ### Goods and Services used only partly for taxable purposes
    
    Where the principal purpose of acquiring goods is the making of taxable supplies, a full deduction for the tax included in the price of the goods or services is allowable, by virtue of the definition of "input tax".
    
    If, however, the goods or services are later used for some other purpose, eg making an exempt supply such as rental of a dwelling, or used for the private consumption of the registered person (eg trading stock taken home from the business), the Bill provides that a further supply is deemed to take place. Clause 5(2) also applies to supplies made to employees of the registered person.
    
    The value of these deemed supplies is to be the cost (to the registered person) of the goods or services supplied, or any actual amount paid for them, if greater.
    
    Where the use of the goods is only temporary, or partial, and it is not practicable to establish the "cost" of the goods, or that part of them which has been supplied, the Bill provides for the supply to be valued at its open market value.
    
    Similarly, goods and services may be purchased for private purposes and no deduction for input tax made. However, those goods or services may subsequently be, permanently or temporarily appropriated for the making of taxable supplies. In that case, clause 23(5) of the Bill provides for a deduction to be made. The amount of the deduction is again based on the original **cost** of the goods or services, or on their open market value, whichever is the lesser.
    
    In any case where the use of the goods is only partially for the purpose of making taxable supplies the "cost" will need to reflect that appropriate proportion of the full cost that is attributable to the period of the use. Such a value should not necessarily be measured by reference to the diminution (if any) in the value of the goods during the period of business usage. The precise method of arriving at the cost is likely to vary according to the nature and use of the goods concerned. It is intended that guidelines will be developed in due course (perhaps in the case of motor vehicles a per kilometre basis will be used). In other cases if similar goods are commonly hired out commercially, the normal hiring charge might provide a useful indicator.

1 Goods and services tax on listed services GST information for online marketplaces (also known as digital platforms) AD278 Online marketplaces must collect GST on all listed services provided through their online marketplace. Find out what you need to do. The listed services rules Since 1 April 2024, GST-registered online marketplaces that facilitate the sale of listed services by sellers must collect and pay GST of 15% when the service is performed, provided or received in New Zealand. What an online marketplace is You are an online marketplace if your business is an electronic platform (like a website, online booking system, app or internet portal) through which sellers can supply their goods and services to customers. An online marketplace includes situations where the services are offered by or to a specific group of people, that is the platform does not have to be available to the wider public. You will not be an online marketplace if you: ysupply your own services directly to customers through your website or app and use employees or contractors to provide the services (for example food deliveries) yoperate a website that advertises sellers’ services but does not allow customers to purchase or book listed services on that website yoperate a website that is only a messaging board or only processes payments. If you are unsure if you are an online marketplace, you can apply for a ruling to confirm your own GST treatment as well as the GST treatment of the sellers who supply their goods and services through your platform. To do this, apply for a product or private ruling. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz/apply-for-ruling Note: What listed services are Listed services are: yride-sharing and ride-hailing yfood and beverage delivery yshort-stay and visitor accommodation. Listed services do not include supplies of residential rental accommodation that are exempt from GST. This will generally be the case if the accommodation is used by the tenant as their home and there is a residential tenancy agreement. You must also collect GST on closely connected services provided by the seller or a listing intermediary, if they are made available through your marketplace. For example, holiday rental cleaning fees charged on top of the accommodation costs. When you are treated as the supplier You will be treated as the supplier of listed services if you: yauthorise a charge for the supply of listed services to customers yauthorise delivery of the supply of listed services to customers yset the terms or conditions under which the supply of listed services is made, whether directly or indirectly. This applies whether you are resident or non-resident for GST purposes in New Zealand. When to register for GST You need to register for GST if the total sales from all your taxable activities are more than, or are expected to be more than, NZ$60,000 in any 12-month period. When determining if you meet this threshold, you will need to consider all the sales of listed services facilitated through your marketplace, as well as all other goods and services you supply in New Zealand, such as: ythe supply of remote services (for example facilitation services for connecting sellers and buyers) yamounts paid by customers for services such as insurance and your fees. Non-resident marketplaces can use a fair and reasonable method for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars to determine if the GST registration threshold is met. Note: 2 How to register for and pay GST If you are a New Zealand tax resident, you can register for GST in myIR. Choose your filing frequency by applying the ordinary rules for taxable periods. See ird.govt.nz/filing-frequency If you are a non-resident (based offshore), use our online GST registration process for non-residents. You generally will need to file quarterly returns. See ird.govt.nz/register-nrgst Once registered, file returns and pay GST through the myIR online system. If you are already registered for GST in New Zealand and these rules apply to you, please let us know by emailing platformeconomy@ird.govt.nz How much GST to collect GST is always 15% for listed services and is generally collected on all amounts paid by the customer. This includes short-stay or visitor accommodation, which are not exempt supplies, regardless of how long the accommodation period is for. The price of a supply of listed services is set by the parties to the transaction. You must collect GST on all the listed services performed, provided, or received in New Zealand. GST must also be collected on any closely connected services that are charged by the seller or listing intermediary through your marketplace. Do this regardless of whether the seller of the listed services is registered for GST or not. It doesn’t matter if the customer is a non-resident. For example, a non-resident tourist staying in accommodation in New Zealand is required to pay GST on their accommodation. Flat-rate credit scheme for non-GST-registered sellers A flat-rate credit is available to sellers (drivers, deliverers and accommodation owners), that are not registered for GST. This recognises the average costs these sellers incur and would be able to recover if they were GST-registered. You need to collect and pay GST to us at the standard rate of 15%. Under this scheme, you pass on to the seller a flat-rate credit of 8.5% of the GST-exclusive price and claim a credit adjustment for this amount in your GST return. To calculate the flat-rate credit from: ya GST-exclusive amount paid by a customer, multiply it by 8.5/100 ya GST-inclusive amount, multiply it by 17/230. For example, if the total amount paid by a customer is $115 including GST, the flat-rate credit is $115 x 17/230 = $8.50. Do not reduce the flat-rate credit for any discounts you provide customers. You must pass on the flat-rate credit to all sellers who are non- GST-registered. You cannot agree or choose to not pass it on. Do not pass a flat-rate credit to GST-registered sellers. If a GST-registered seller incorrectly receives a flat-rate credit, they may be liable for penalties. Note: You should have systems in place to record which sellers are GST- registered and which are not. Sellers need to tell you their name, IRD number and GST registration status - including any changes. You can contact us to verify the GST registration status provided to you by a seller. Similarly, we may tell you that a seller is GST- registered. If we do this, you will need to act on our notification of a seller’s GST status as soon as practicable. You must provide a statement to the seller showing the flat-rate credits passed on to them. This can be done by itemising the flat- rate credits on at least a monthly basis. The statement must show the seller and the full amount of the flat-rate credits – they should not be reduced or offset by other fees or charges for services provided to them. There is no required frequency for how often the flat-rate credits are passed on to sellers. How to complete your GST returns You need to include the total sales from listed services that you are treated as making under these rules, including 15% GST, as total sales and income. Include these with all other supplies you make. There is no separate box for listed services. To do this, if you are filing using myIR, choose the total sales and purchases filing option. Include the value of listed services you are treated as making including GST in total sales and income (box 5 on a paper return). Claim a credit adjustment for flat-rate credits that are passed on to non-GST-registered sellers. To do this in myIR, select yes for credit adjustments, and include them as other adjustments (box 13 on a paper return). 3 Taxable supply information You need to provide the customer with taxable supply information, for example an invoice, unless the seller has opted out of the marketplace rules. If the seller has opted out, the seller remains responsible for providing taxable supply information. Opt-out rules There are opt-out rules for large GST-registered sellers. Listing intermediaries cannot opt-out. Sellers who opt-out remain responsible for the GST obligations including providing taxable supply information to customers. You do not need to return the GST. Sellers can opt-out if 1 of the following applies. yNon-individual sellers who make more than NZ$500,000 of supplies in a 12-month period. They need to tell you in writing, for example by email that they are opting out. yAccommodation providers who list (or can reasonably expect to list) more than 2,000 nights of accommodation on your marketplace in a 12-month period. They can enter into an agreement with you to opt out. yAccommodation providers who make more than $60,000 of supplies of accommodation in a hostel or motel in a 12-month period. They can enter into an agreement with you to opt out. To qualify, they must have been registered for GST before 1 April 2024 and provide accommodation directly to their guests and through your marketplace. The 2,000-night threshold can be satisfied by a group of related companies. But it is not possible to aggregate accommodation nights across multiple online marketplaces. Note: For an opt-out agreement to be valid, there must be a written agreement the seller will be responsible for the tax obligations under the GST Act for the supplies of listed services. This includes: yproviding the customers with taxable supply information, if required yidentifying the seller as the supplier yfiling GST returns ycollecting and paying GST to Inland Revenue. Keep all information relating to opt-outs in your records. Sales of listed services before 1 April 2024 The rules for listed services took effect on 1 April 2024. This means GST applies to all bookings made from 1 April 2024. In some cases, an accommodation booking may have been made before 1 April 2024 but the guest stays in the accommodation after that date. For GST, the time of supply is the earlier of any invoice being issued or any payment, including a deposit or part-payment, being received. However, a special transitional rule may be applied. If an accommodation booking was made before 1 April 2024 but the guest stays after that date, you can choose not to collect and pay GST. If you decide to use this rule, you need to tell the sellers, or listing intermediary if there is one, within a reasonable time. They will need to have enough information to collect and pay any GST on the relevant bookings. For more information about this rule, go to ird.govt.nz/ transitional-rule Visit: yird.govt.nz/sharing-economy ytaxtechnical.ird.govt.nz and refer to Determination (DET) 24/02: GST on accommodation supplied through electronic marketplaces – opt-out agreement criteria ytaxpolicy.ird.govt.nz and refer to Special report: GST on accommodation and transportation services supplied through online marketplaces Email questions to platformeconomy@ird.govt.nz More information

Governance forums
=================

Strong and effective governance was instrumental in establishing the discipline needed to successfully complete our transformation programme.

We adjusted governance arrangements as we went, ensuring they kept up to date with what was needed and reflected the different phases of the programme. A robust governance system meant there was never any doubt about who had authority to make decisions.

Some of our governance forums included external advisors, who played an important role in challenging our thinking.

The Strategic Governance Board gave approval to start each stage of the transformation, and the Portfolio Governance Board was accountable for making sure it happened on time and within budget.

We reviewed our senior management and organisational-level governance arrangements to ensure Business Transformation was successfully managed. This included the Commissioner’s responsibility to complete our transformation programme.

The principles of our governance structure
------------------------------------------

We established new organisational leadership, management and governance arrangements that supported clear accountability and strongly focused on organisational change. We also put in place independent assurance arrangements to provide confidence that Inland Revenue was successfully delivering the programme. These included:

*   opportunities for Government to regularly monitor programme progress
*   broad engagement with customers, other agencies and third parties to ensure the changes we proposed met their needs, were appropriate and gave the private-sector more chances to get involved
*   ensuring we had the skills to manage large change programmes and the procurement of service and product suppliers
*   bringing on a design and implementation partner who had proven experience in transformation programmes of this scale and complexity.

The programme focused strongly on process, project management and disciplines. This included a large focus on planning, reporting, risk management and documentation.

We also focused on completing each stage on time and did not allow dates to shift without good reason, and not just because work had not been finished. Over time this led to a cultural shift – where people became more accurate in their planning and accountable for meeting their commitments.

Changing governance along the way
---------------------------------

There were 5 changes to our governance structure from 2013-2021 and each change was included as an addendum to the programme business case.

Show all

Governance model October 2013

The Commissioner led the Investment Board, which had a complete view of change across the organisation, including Business Transformation.

We established 3 new governance forums to focus on business performance, investment, and strategy. All the Executive Leadership Team were members of these new governance forums.

![Graph showing the three forums business performance board on left, Investment board in the middle and Strategy board on the right](/-/media/project/ir/home/graphics/about-us/buisness-transformation/business-transformation-guide/october-2013.png?h=132&w=612&modified=20220317235940&hash=C2409790DD2C821D94463DB26A231D08)

Governance model November 2015

Our governance structures continued to be responsive and adaptive over the life of the programme to ensure they remained fit for purpose. By 2015, the programme had begun to mobilise for delivery and as such, required a structure which could facilitate delivery at pace. At this point, therefore, the key features of the governance structure for the programme were:

*   The Senior Responsible Officer was the Deputy Commissioner, Change.
*   The Commissioner chaired the Investment Board, which ensured that Inland Revenue’s investment portfolio lined up with its strategic direction.
*   The Deputy Commissioner, Change chaired the Portfolio Governance Authority, which ensured that programmes and projects met their objectives. The programme provided a status update to PGA (Portfolio Governance Authority) each month.
*   External advisors sat on both the Investment Board and the Portfolio Governance Authority.
*   The Design Council's members represented a wide range of business functions and were chaired by tier 2 or 3 managers. The councils ensured that solutions met business needs and were an important communication channel between the programme and the rest of Inland Revenue.

Inland Revenue governance bodies, including the Risk and Assurance Committee, supplied wider support and assurance.

![Governance model 2015](/-/media/project/ir/home/graphics/about-us/buisness-transformation/business-transformation-guide/nov-2015.png?modified=20220801014717&h=433&w=897&hash=644F99972DC484D8C302711BE35D12B2) 

Governance model October 2018

In July 2017, we reviewed our governance arrangements ahead of the implementation of Release 2.

Prior to this we created the role of Deputy Commissioner of Transformation, replacing Deputy Commissioner of Change. The existing Deputy Commissioner of Change became the Deputy Commissioner of Transformation, with the Commissioner taking on the role of Senior Responsible Officer.

This decision was made for several reasons:

*   The Programme Director resigned leaving a significant gap, ahead of the first release.
*   This resulted in the Deputy Commissioner of Change taking a more active role in the programme’s operation which necessitated a 100% focus on the transformation.
*   Subsequently, the change function which previously reported to the Deputy Commissioner of Change, was moved to the Chief Technology Officer.
*   As the Deputy Commissioner Change became the Deputy Commissioner for Transformation, it was appropriate for the Chief Executive Officer to assume the role of Senior Responsible Officer for the transformation programme.

By October 2018, the governance arrangements consisted of a Strategic Governance Board with 5 committees.

1.  Performance and investment
2.  Customer-centric
3.  Organisation development
4.  Technical governance
5.  Portfolio governance

Transformation provided regular updates to both the Portfolio Governance Committee and Performance and Investment Committee.

We also made changes to design and integration with the replacement of the Design Integration Forum with the Design Authority, and the Technical Design Integration Forum with the Technical Design Authority.

Final governance model October 2020

From February 2020, we made some changes to streamline our governance system and set ourselves up for a smooth transition to a post transformation world.

The governance structures were adjusted to govern the final activities of the programme.

The Performance and Investment, Organisation Development and Customer-Centric committees were formally closed in August 2020. The remaining governance bodies made any governance decisions that would have been made at these committees.

Post transformation governance model March 2022

Our governance arrangements have continued to evolve to ensure they remain fit for purpose. Two new executive-level governance bodies have been established:

*   The Enterprise Priorities and Performance Committee (EPPC) was established in September 2020. EPPC governs our performance, health and delivery of key initiatives and activities, and ensures the focus is on the right areas to achieve the strategic direction set by the Strategic Governance Board.
*   The Data and Information Governance Authority (DIGA) became part of our executive-level governance system in August 2021. DIGA ensures we have transparent and accountable governance arrangements that provide oversight of how we manage and use data.

Government announces BEPS decisions
===================================

**03 August 2017**

Finance Minister Steven Joyce and Revenue Minister Judith Collins have today announced the Government’s final decisions on proposals to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS).

“The new measures will significantly strengthen our tax rules and our ability to ensure that multinationals are taxed fairly and on the basis of their actual level of economic activity in New Zealand,” Mr Joyce says.

In combination the new measures will:

*   Stop foreign parents charging their New Zealand subsidiaries high interest rates to reduce their taxable profits in New Zealand.
*   Stop multinationals using artificial arrangements to avoid having a taxable presence in New Zealand.
*   Ensure multinationals are taxed in accordance with the economic substance of their activities in New Zealand.
*   Counter strategies that multinationals have used to exploit gaps and mismatches in different countries’ domestic tax rules to avoid paying tax anywhere in the world.
*   Make it easier for Inland Revenue to investigate uncooperative multinational companies.

“These changes will result in an estimated $200 million a year in additional tax being paid by multi-national companies,” Mr Joyce says. “The Government budgeted for $100 million annually in out-years for additional multi-national tax, and these decisions mean that will be increased by a further $100 million annually from Budget 2018 onwards.”

“These decisions have been arrived at after weighing up public feedback on three government discussion documents relating to: hybrid mismatch arrangements; interest limitation rules; and transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance,” Ms Collins says.

“For the most part, the proposals will proceed as originally devised but in some instances, public feedback made a good case for refining the scope of proposals or for fleshing out technical detail. We’ll carry out further targeted consultation on such matters of technical detail (including draft legislation), without reducing the effectiveness of the proposals.”

“It is very important that every company operating in New Zealand pays their fair share of tax,” Mr Joyce says. While most multi-national companies follow the rules there are some that attempt to minimise or eliminate their New Zealand tax obligations. The proposals target these multinationals.

“I’m confident that the policy decisions we’ve made will tackle these BEPS activities without reducing the general attractiveness of New Zealand as an investment destination.”

“As we’ve done in the past for BEPS matters, we’re releasing reports and Cabinet papers detailing our key decisions. We are also releasing the public submissions we received,” Ms Collins says.

It is expected that the BEPS measures will be included in a tax bill to be introduced by the end of the year, for enactment by July 2018.

Government backs business through COVID-19
==========================================

**15 April 2020**

The Government has announced a suite of new measures to provide relief for small and medium-sized businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Finance Minister Grant Robertson says while the Government has already acted swiftly in response to the crisis, with about $20 billion in support already announced, it recognises that more is needed.

The new measures include:

*   $3.1 billion tax loss carry-back scheme (estimated cost over the next two years)
*   $60 million estimated annual savings to business each year from changes to the tax loss continuity rules
*   $25 million in the next 12 months for further business consultancy support
*   Greater flexibility for affected businesses affected to meet their tax obligations
*   Measures to support commercial tenants and landlords

“We have taken decisive action throughout this pandemic to cushion the blow for our businesses and workers - today’s announcement continues that focus. We need our businesses to stay solvent to help with the economic recovery as we emerge from this health crisis.

“Our focus on cashflow and confidence continues through these measures. We have approved a tax loss carry-back scheme that will allow a large number of businesses to access their previous tax payments as cash refunds. Essentially this means a forecast loss in the current financial year can be offset against the tax paid on a profit from last year.”

We are also changing the tax loss continuity rules to make it easier for firms to raise new capital without losing the benefit of their existing tax losses” Grant Robertson said

Minister for Small Business Hon Stuart Nash says some businesses are struggling to meet their non-wage fixed costs, like interest, rent and insurance, but are not currently in a position to take on additional debt.

“In the absence of further support from the Government, these otherwise viable SMEs may be forced to close down permanently.

“We don’t want that to happen, so as well as the tax measures which should provide some cashflow relief, we are going to provide tailored support services to help businesses weather the storm, at no charge to the business.

“Using established services including the Regional Business Partner Network and the helplines run by the Employers and Manufacturers Association and Canterbury Chamber of Commerce, we can get specialist, tailored advice where it is needed, fast. This could range from human resources advice to business continuity planning to financial management – because every one of these small businesses will have a different need,” Stuart Nash said.

New measures are also being announced to support stability in commercial property transactions, extending the timeframes required before landlords can cancel leases and mortgagees can exercise their rights to sale or repossession.

Justice Minister Andrew Little says many businesses may be finding it difficult or impossible to pay rent if they are no longer able to access their property, and if landlords are not receiving rent, they may not be able to meet their mortgage obligations.

“As a result, the Government will extend the current 10 working day timeframe that commercial landlords may cancel the lease to 30 working days. This will be for both the period the tenant is in arrears before the notice is given, and for the period to remedy the breach.

“The Government will also extend the timeframes for lenders from 20 to 40 working days for mortgaged land, and from 10 to 20 working days for mortgaged goods. This will apply to commercial mortgages and home loans. However, the already announced mortgage deferrals are likely to be the first port of call for residential borrowers.

“These measures will ensure an orderly process to deal with commercial lease disputes caused by COVID-19," Andrew Little said.

Legislation enacting the changes announced today will be introduced on April 27 and will apply effectively retrospectively once the bill is passed.

Work is also underway on further support for businesses and households as the impacts of COVID 19 become clearer.

Government boosts cashflow support for small businesses
=======================================================

**01 May 2020**

The Government will provide interest free loans for a year to small businesses impacted by the COVID-19 economic shock to support their immediate cashflow needs and meet fixed costs.

The Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue say the Small Business Cashflow Loan Scheme will provide assistance of up to $100,000 to firms employing 50 or fewer full time equivalent employees.

“It has become clear that the support that is available to our small and medium businesses from banks is not meeting their needs nor our expectations as a Government. That is why we have moved to provide this scheme to give some much needed cashflow,” Grant Robertson said

“The scheme will provide $10,000 to every firm and in addition $1800 per equivalent full time employee. Loans will be interest free if they are paid back within a year. The interest rate will be 3% for a maximum term of five years. Repayments are not required for the first two years,” Grant Robertson said.

“We recognise that many businesses have had little or no revenue through Alert Level 4 and Level 3. This scheme is designed to give them access to cashflow to meet fixed costs on concessionary terms,” Stuart Nash said.

“The eligibility criteria are the same as for the Wage Subsidy Scheme. Businesses will also have to declare that they are a viable business, they will use the money for core business operating costs and enter into a legally binding loan contract.”

“We are targeting this scheme to those who have a viable business but have been put in a position of not generating any revenue. These kinds of terms are not available anywhere else. We are committed to sharing the burden of the impacts of COVID-19. As a responsible Government we must ensure we are using taxpayer money carefully as we provide support for business,” Grant Robertson said.

“We understand the importance of getting this money to businesses as soon as possible. The scheme will be administered by Inland Revenue who will be taking applications from the 12th of May, and will pay out very shortly thereafter,” Stuart Nash said.

“By helping small and medium-sized businesses to pay their fixed costs, in addition to the tax changes, wage subsidy, commercial property measures and consultancy support already available - we now have a substantive package to help these firms and sole traders get through this phase and into recovery.”

“The Government is also making changes today to the criteria for the previously announced Business Finance Guarantee Scheme, including removing the requirement for a General Security Agreement.  Further changes to the scheme will also be considered to ensure it plays a useful part in providing support to businesses,” Grant Robertson said.

| Workstream | Description and additional information |
| --- | --- |
| Land | The current land rules will be reviewed, particularly in relation to investment property and speculators, land banking, and vacant land. The objective would be to recommend ways to improve the efficient use of land, and ensure that the current tax settings are fair, balanced, and encourages and supports productive investment. The review will also look at whether we can do anything more around enforcement of the current rules. It is unlikely that any significant reforms relating to vacant land and property would be feasible in the short term. However, in the short-term the Government could consider a number of measures aimed at improving the fairness and balance of the tax rules for land.<br><br>**Possible items that could be included in a short-term package**<br><br>Measures to support efficient land use:<br><br>*   clarifying and tightening the rules for the deductibility of holding costs (e.g. rates and insurance) for land that is taxable on sale; and<br>*   consider ways to encourage seismic strengthening of residential property.<br><br>Measures to improve the integrity of the rules:<br><br>*   review the exemptions in the land rules, in particular the exceptions for developers and habitual renovators; and<br>*   review whether the apportionment rules for GST are working appropriately for mixed use land.<br><br>Measures to improve collection:<br><br>*   consider whether applying withholding tax on transactions involving New Zealand resident vendors is a better approach to collecting this revenue; and<br>*   improving information flows (including from LINZ) to assist compliance with the current land tax rules.<br><br>**Possible items that could be considered in a longer-run review**<br><br>*   the Productivity Commission’s advice on the use of vacant land and property taxes to discourage land banking;<br>*   review whether the land rules, in particular the “10-year” rules, negatively impact the supply of land or create inefficient “lock-in effects”;<br>*   consider whether other tax measures could reduce speculation and improve the supply of land. This could include reviewing the scope of existing rules such as the bright-line test and ring-fencing, as well as looking at potential new taxes to help improve the supply of available housing;<br>*   consider whether withholding taxes might be appropriate for other taxable land transactions;<br>*   consider whether allowing losses on building disposals might improve the fairness and efficiency of the current land tax rules. This option may remove a potential distortion discouraging transactions that may result in capital losses – for example, the acquisition of earthquake prone buildings; and<br>*   review the provisional tax rules in light of bright-line income from land sales. |
| Business | Enhancing economic performance and minimising the tax system’s impact on businesses are priorities for the Government. Reducing compliance costs directly impacts on productivity (particularly of smaller firms) leaving them more time to focus on running their business, as well as continue to innovate and develop new opportunities. Increasing neutrality will also be a focus, ensuring that commercial decisions are not driven by tax whilst protecting the integrity of the tax base.<br><br>This workstream will focus on:<br><br>*   increasing integrity, fairness and the neutrality of the system;<br>*   lifting the economic performance of all businesses, especially smaller firms; and<br>*   ensuring compliance at a low cost to businesses.<br><br>This includes working with other Government agencies to ensure that items in this workstream support wider Government work on business.<br><br>**Examples of items that could be considered for inclusion relating to businesses**<br><br>TWG recommendations including:<br><br>*   seismic strengthening (note this also includes consideration of residential property);<br>*   loss carry forwards and trading when ownership changes; and<br>*   tax treatment of innovative spending (feasibility and blackhole expenditure).<br><br>Items already underway such as:<br><br>*   R&D;<br>*   purchase price allocation;<br>*   cross-border employment;<br>*   financial arrangement issues; and<br>*   other integrity issues.<br><br>**Examples of items that could be considered for inclusion relating to small businesses**<br><br>TWG recommendations including:<br><br>*   closely-held company issues;<br>*   compliance and enforcement issues;<br>*   simplifying FBT; and<br>*   tax disputes for small taxpayers.<br><br>Items already underway such as:<br><br>*   tax compliance for self-employed (accounts payable reporting);<br>*   considering issues around the sharing economy/platforms;<br>*   options for assisting businesses to become more digital; and<br>*   AIM review. |
| Infrastructure | Infrastructure is a key area of interest for the Government. It contributes to economic performance, and the Government is focussed on achieving better outcomes for infrastructure investment in New Zealand. Many of the changes being looked at are outside of the tax system, but the tax system may have to adapt to new arrangements. This project will consider whether the tax system should have a role in driving infrastructure investment.<br><br>The infrastructure project will:<br><br>*   respond to the Tax Working Group’s recommendation to consider developing a regime that encourages investment into nationally-significant infrastructure projects;<br>*   ensure that the tax system treats new institutional arrangements for infrastructure appropriately; and<br>*   consider consistency of revenue collection for infrastructure across Government. |
| Information collection and use | The effective use of information by Government is critical to the efficient delivery of Government services. The efficient and effective collection and use of information helps to ensure the tax system minimises compliance and administration costs, while also supporting and contributing to wider Government priorities. Better information also contributes to the integrity and fairness of the tax system and helps to ensure that the tax system can respond well to future challenges.<br><br>This package will consider:<br><br>*   overall data strategy for the collection and use of information;<br>*   information sharing agreements and development of more efficient ways to allow the sharing of information;<br>*   automatic exchange of information and country-by-country reporting consequential matters;<br>*   repeat collection of large datasets – reporting, consultation and regulation making processes; and<br>*   the collection and public release of information to support policy advice, evaluation and public debate on policy issues. |
| Business Transformation (BT) | We will continue to support Inland Revenue’s BT programme. Over the next 18 months, Inland Revenue will implement Release 4 of its BT programme (Student Loans and KiwiSaver) and commence design on Release 5 (Child Support).<br><br>Further, we envisage the BT policy work stream as identifying and developing policy proposals that leverage off and support the new tax and social policy system. This would include work on:<br><br>*   potential review of the prescribed investor rate (PIR);<br>*   taxation of lump sum payments such as ACC weekly compensation; and<br>*   other possible changes to:<br>    *   withholding tax such as PAYE and RWT to minimise where possible any over- or under-withholding, and ensure that the amount of tax is about right; and<br>    *   the tax products that have been deployed into START such as WfFTC to improve administration. |
| Reforms and remedials | Many of the specific provisions in the Taxation Acts need to be regularly maintained or updated in response to changing technology, business practices, jurisprudence or other factors. In addition, as Inland Revenue and taxpayers begin to apply new tax legislation we may identify legislative errors or unintended consequences which require remedial amendments.<br><br>These issues can create high compliance costs or inadvertent non-compliance so need to be addressed promptly to maintain the certainty, efficiency and fairness of the tax system.<br><br>Some examples of items include:<br><br>*   a GST issues paper to consult on various changes to ensure GST aligns with business practices and modern technology and to maintain the GST Act more generally;<br>*   review of donee status applications under schedule 32 (charities with activities outside New Zealand);<br>*   BEPS remedials; and<br>*   general maintenance and remedial work as issues arise. This includes an important stewardship role, looking ahead to issues that might arise and working with other agencies on Government measures that have tax or social policy implications. |
| Social policy including Government response to Welfare Overhaul | This work stream includes policy work on:<br><br>*   the Government’s welfare overhaul work programme including:<br>    *   reform of Working for Families;<br>    *   child support pass-on; and<br>    *   debt;<br>*   student loan scheme (non-BT work);<br>*   KiwiSaver – enhancing Trans-Tasman superannuation portability; and<br>*   other agency initiatives that impact on the tax or social policy system.<br><br>On the Government response to the welfare overhaul, officials are working closely with MSD and other agencies to develop a welfare package. This will take a phased approach given the complexity of the welfare system and the need to balance fiscal prudence with improving wellbeing and other high priority government objectives. |
| Environment/  <br>sustainable economy | The Tax Working Group noted a range of areas where greater environmental taxation could be used to change behaviour and raise revenue. In response, this project will consider the Group’s framework for taxing negative environmental externalities. The Government decided not to advance specific environmental proposals raised by the Group beyond what is already on its work programme. However, this leaves scope for tax reforms for greenhouse gases, solid waste, water pollution, and congestion.<br><br>Tax policy officials will work with other agencies on environmental issues to provide environmental tax analysis and advise on tax implications of environmental policy. Key areas are:<br><br>*   Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) reform – specific issues include:<br>    *   auctioning of units and hypothecation of revenue from the ETS;<br>    *   options for including agricultural emissions in the ETS;<br>    *   changes to the way that the ETS will apply to new forests; and<br>    *   the introduction of an international scheme for air travel similar to the ETS;<br>*   the Water Taskforce is working to improve water quality and nutrient run-off;<br>*   the Ministry for the Environment is reviewing the Waste Disposal Levy to see how it can be increased and its coverage extended; and<br>*   the Auckland Council is working on congestion charging for the use of key roads in Auckland.<br><br>This project will include two further areas of work:<br><br>*   As part of the work on the environmental tax framework, consider how specific tax regimes, such as FBT, might be used to achieve positive environment outcomes (for example, FBT treatment of employer-provided public transport).<br>*   Review of industry-specific tax provisions impacting on natural capital. Petroleum mining will be the initial focus-industry in a series of reviews. We are currently considering issues relating to the timing of deductions for petroleum development expenditure and have completed the legislative changes for the time-limited non-resident oil-rig exemption. |
| Charities | Government periodically reviews the charitable sector's use of what would otherwise be tax revenue, to verify that intended social outcomes are being achieved.<br><br>This project will include a report to Ministers before the end of 2019 to address recommendations of the TWG. It will take into account DIA’s modernisation review of the Charities Act. On current timeframes, it is anticipated that high level policy decisions arising from DIA’s review will be made by Cabinet before the end of 2019, with detailed policy decisions to follow in the first half of 2020. The specific tax policy issues are:<br><br>*   accumulation (will require coordination with DIA);<br>*   business activity for significant charities (coordination with DIA);<br>*   deregistration tax; and<br>*   GST and not-for-profits (NFP).<br><br>A second report to Ministers will outline other sector tax matters that could potentially be subject to policy change and sector consultation. For example:<br><br>*   imputation credit refundability;<br>*   tax rules for mutuals/the $1,000 NFP deduction threshold;<br>*   rules for donating trading stock;<br>*   removing out-of-date concessions; and<br>*   resetting donee concessions and clarifying the approach to social enterprises.<br><br>Inland Revenue has consulted with DIA on these proposals and will be working with DIA on any policy or regulatory impacts associated with these initiatives. This work is on-going.<br><br>NFP/charity concessions interact with both local government settings and the Māori sector. |
| Tax exemptions | The income tax legislation contains various exemptions from income tax, including income earned by charities and businesses run for charitable purposes, Local Authorities, Government entities often as public authorities, and Crown-controlled companies (in certain circumstances). In contrast state enterprises are subject to income tax and local council-controlled companies are also taxable. The overall treatment of these different entities is not completely consistent. There are an increasing number of requests for income tax exemptions, and a need to adopt a coherent framework to consider these requests.<br><br>The review will consider entity tax exemptions with a view to providing more consistency. It will consider:<br><br>*   how different entities fit within the Government’s public policy purposes;<br>*   the compliance costs and benefits;<br>*   fiscal implications; and<br>*   the impact of particular exemptions on competitive neutrality with the private sector. |
| International | There has been recent and growing concern from Governments and the public about the low levels of income tax paid by digital companies (that is, companies operating through highly digitalised business models). Pressure has been building on the long-standing international income tax framework; and the OECD (including New Zealand) have undertaken to review the framework.<br><br>This workstream will include:<br><br>*   reporting back on the digital service tax discussion document;<br>*   double tax agreement negotiations and assisting with free trade agreements;<br>*   multi-lateral work (including the OECD working parties); and<br>*   follow-on work to monitor and adjust the BEPS measures enacted last year |

[Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-budget-measures-act-2010 "Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010")

Grandparenting certain buildings as structures
==============================================

Certain buildings that have been treated as structures purchased on or before 30 Jul 2009 will continue to be treated as structures for tax depreciation purposes.

#### _Sections EE 37 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

Inland Revenue's Public Rulings unit has recently released the interpretation statement _Meaning of "building" in the depreciation provisions_ (IS 10/02). Under this statement, some items that were previously treated as structures will come within the meaning of "building". This means there will be a change to the way these investments are treated for tax depreciation purposes.

On 30 July 2009, following the release of a draft of this interpretation statement, the Minister of Revenue issued a statement providing that the existing treatment of any affected structure acquired on or before the day of the announcement would be grandparented. Accordingly, section YA 1 has been amended to include a definition for "building". This definition specifies that a building does not include these affected structures.

### Key features

*   Certain buildings that have been treated as structures and were purchased on or before 30 July 2009 will continue to be treated as structures for tax depreciation purposes.
*   Any improvements to these buildings made after 30 July 2009 do not receive this grandparented treatment.

### Detailed analysis

#### _Certain structures purchased on or before 30 July 2009 are not "buildings"_

Amendments to section YA 1 have introduced a definition for buildings, which specify that, in the depreciation provisions, "building" does not include a grandparented structure. This definition of "building" excludes "grandparented structures" from the common law meaning of "building". This definition is not intended to detract from the Commissioner's interpretation statement IS 10/02 _Meaning of "building"_. Instead, the definition is intended to grandparent investments, made before 30 July 2009, in certain types of structures from the depreciation rules applying to buildings.

This means that these buildings will continue to be treated as structures for the purposes of the depreciation provisions (notwithstanding that they are buildings under the Commissioner's interpretation statement IS 10/02). For example, their relevant depreciation rates will still be set using the double-declining balance method, and losses incurred on disposal will remain tax deductible. If a grandparented structure is sold after 30 July 2009, it will lose its grandparented treatment and will be treated as a building.

The definition of "grandparented structure" is an item on the following list, provided its owner acquired it, or entered into a binding contract for its acquisition or construction, on or before 30 July 2009:

1.  barns, including barns (drying)
2.  carparks (buildings)
3.  chemical works
4.  fertiliser works
5.  powder drying buildings
6.  site huts.

More detail on the types of items covered by the definition of "grandparented structure" can be found in [IS 10/02](/interpretation-statements/is1002-meaning-of-building-in-the-depreciation-provisions)
, available on Inland Revenue's website. For example, carparks (buildings) does not include a commercial building that contains carparks.

#### _Some carparking buildings continue to depreciate_

The grandparenting of carparking buildings, described above, means that carparking buildings purchased on or before 30 July 2009 are not subject to a 0% annual depreciation rate.

#### _Improvements to grandparented structures building_

Section EE 37 has been amended to provide that if a person owns a grandparented structure and they make improvements or enter into a binding contract to make them after 30 July 2009, the improvement must be treated as a separate item.

The effect of this amendment is that any new improvements to grandparented structures will be treated as buildings. This means, for example, losses on disposal of the improvements will not be available. In the case of carparking buildings, this means the annual depreciation rate of any improvements will be 0%.

### Application date

The amendments apply from 30 July 2009.

Greater tax incentives for charitable donations
===============================================

2007 amendments enhance tax incentives for donations made by individuals, companies and Maori authorities to charitable and non-profit organisations.

**_Sections DB 41, DV 12 and LD of the Income Tax Act2007_**

Tax incentives for donations of money made by individuals, companies and Maori authorities have been greatly enhanced. The changes include removing the maximum limit on the tax credit for donations made by individuals, removing the 5 percent deduction limit on donations made by companies and Maori authorities, and extending the company deduction to apply to close companies not listed on a recognised stock exchange.

The changes are aimed at facilitating greater giving to charities and other non-profit organisations and encouraging a culture of generosity in New Zealand.

All legislation relating to the changes is contained in the newly enacted Income Tax Act 2007. Unless otherwise stated, the legislative references in this item refer to the Income Tax Act 2007.

#### Background

As part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement between Labour and United Future, the government released the October 2006 discussion document, _Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non-profit organisations_. The discussion document canvassed a range of options for encouraging greater giving to charities and other non-profit organisations and for making it easier to give in time, money and skills to these organisations.

Among the options canvassed in the discussion document were proposals to increase the limits on the current tax incentives for cash donations made by individuals, companies and Maori authorities. In response to submissions on the discussion document, the government agreed to remove the current limits altogether. These changes represent the first stage in the government policy commitment, _Fostering a culture of charitable giving_, which was announced as part of Budget 2007.

The changes were included in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Business Taxation, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Bill, which was introduced in May 2007. The changes amended the Income Tax Act 2004 and applied from the 2008-09 income year.

As the bill passed through its final legislative stage, the Income Tax Act 2007 was enacted. The Income Tax Act 2007 contains rewritten Parts F to the end of the Act, including schedules and consolidated parts A to E. In particular, the Income Tax Act 2007 restructured and rewrote section KC 5 of the Income Tax Act 2004, which contained the tax rebate for donations made by individuals, and consolidated the provisions providing tax relief for donations made by Maori authorities and companies.

As a result, a Supplementary Order Paper was introduced at the final legislative stage of the bill. Its purpose was to cancel the amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004 and insert those amendments (with appropriate modifications) in the Income Tax Act 2007. Because the amendments and the provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply for the 2008-09 income years and later tax years, amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004 were unnecessary.

#### Key features

##### Company deduction

Section DB 41 allows a company to claim a deduction for all charitable or other public benefit gifts it makes to a society, institution, association, organisation, trust or fund of any kind described in section LD 3(2) or set out in Schedule 32. The deduction is limited to the amount that would be the company's net income before taking into account the donation deduction.

The deduction is also available to close companies that are not listed on a recognised exchange.

##### Maori authority deduction

Section DV 12 allows a Maori authority to claim a deduction for all donations it makes to a Maori association [**25**](#25)
 and all charitable or other public benefit gifts it makes to a society, institution, association, organisation, trust or fund of any kind described in section LD 3(2) or set out in Schedule 32. The deduction is limited to the amount that would be the Maori authority's net income before taking into account the donation deduction.

##### Individuals' tax credit

Section LD 1 provides that a person who makes a charitable or other public benefit gift in a tax year and who meets the requirements of section 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is entitled to a tax credit equal to the amount calculated using the following formula:

Total gifts x 33 1/3%

"Total gifts" means the total amount of all charitable or other public benefit gifts made by the person in the tax year.

The equivalent provision in the Income Tax Act 2004 (section KC 5) has been rewritten and restructured in subpart LD and Schedule 32. The following detailed analysis explains both the structural changes and new terminology used.

#### Application date

The changes apply for the income years corresponding to the 2008-09 and later tax years.

#### Detailed analysis

##### Individuals' tax credit

Section KC 5(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 contained the tax rebate for donations made by individuals. This provision was rewritten and its various parts relocated in subpart LD and Schedule 32. Consequential amendments were also made to section 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to take into account new terminology used and renumbering of certain sections.

The tax rebate for donations is now a "tax credit". Part L contains most of the rules relating to the application of tax credits. In particular, subpart LA identifies when a tax credit arises, and sets out how the Act applies a tax credit to satisfy a person's obligations under section BB 2.

Section LD 1 allows a person who makes a "charitable or other public benefit gift" in a tax year to claim a tax credit for the tax year equal to one-third of the total amount of all charitable or other public benefit gifts made in that tax year.

The tax credit is treated as a "refundable tax credit" under section LA 7 and is not to be taken into account for the purposes of sections LA 2 to LA 6 (which relate to a person's income tax liability).

Section LD 2 states that an absentee taxpayer, company, public authority, Maori authority, unincorporated body or a trustee liable for income tax under subpart HC and section HZ 2 are not eligible for the tax credit.

Section LD 3(1) defines a "charitable or other public benefit gift". It means a gift of $5 or more that is paid to a society, institution, association, organisation, trust or fund described in section LD 3(2) or listed in Schedule 32. It also includes a subscription paid to a society, institution, association, organisation, trust or fund, only if the subscription does not confer any rights arising from membership in that or any other society, institution, association, organisation, trust or fund. The term does not include testamentary gifts.

Section LD 3(2) describes the entities or trusts referred to in section LD 3(1). The equivalent provisions are located in sections KC 5(1)(aa) to (ad) of the Income Tax Act 2004.

Schedule 32 contains the list of named organisations that are listed in sections KC 5(1)(ae) to (cu) of the Income Tax Act 2004. These organisations are now referred to as "recipients of charitable or other public benefit gifts".

Section 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has also been rewritten to reflect the renumbering and new terminology used in the Income Tax Act 2007. Therefore, the restrictions on the amount of the tax credit are unaffected.

**Company and Maori authority deduction**

The term "charitable or other public benefit gift" is also used in section DB 41 (which relates to companies) and section DV 12 (which relates to Maori authorities).

The equivalent provisions of the Income Tax Act 2004 use the term "gift of money".

Ngā take mō ngā arotake tautoko tamaiti Grounds for child support reviews
=========================================================================

When you apply for a child support review, also called an administrative review, you must be able to show you have 1 or more of 11 grounds (special circumstances). 

You may choose more than 1 ground, but you'll need to provide evidence for each ground in your review application.

The information you send with your application may be shared with other parents or carer.

Show all

Ground 1 - You have a duty to maintain another child (or children) or person

This ground applies if the ability of either parent to support their children is significantly reduced by obligations to another child or person.

To apply under this ground you should have a duty to maintain another person or child. This usually means you have a legal or moral duty that makes you responsible for their financial support, such as a child from a previous relationship or a court order requiring payment.

You'll need all of these things to apply.

*   A copy of any agreement or court order.
*   Proof of child support or maintenance paid.
*   Your financial details.

Ground 2 - It costs you extra to cover the special needs of another child (or children) or person you have a duty to maintain

This ground applies when the ability of either parent to support their children is significantly reduced by obligations to care for another child or person with special needs.

To apply under this ground, you should have a duty to maintain another person or child with special needs. In most cases, this means you have a legal or moral duty that makes you responsible for their financial support, such as high medical costs or special care because of a disability.

You'll need all of these things to apply.

*   A copy of any agreement or court order.
*   Medical certificate or evidence showing the person or child's condition and specific treatment and costs.
*   A list of costs showing extra expenses after deducting any benefit or allowance paid, or medical insurance refunds.
*   Your financial details.

 Ground 3 - You have necessary expenses in supporting yourself

This ground applies when the ability of either parent to support their children is significantly reduced by commitments that are necessary for that parent to support themselves.

You can apply under this ground if you are paying off loans or have high medical costs.

You'll need all of these things to apply.

*   A list of the costs necessary for your support (you should explain why the expenses are necessary and give details of any steps you've taken to reduce them).
*   Confirmation of your current earnings if you earn a salary or wages.
*   If you're in business, details of your interest in the business, your latest profit and loss statement and balance sheet.
*   If you have loan commitments, the loan start date, term and purpose, minimum liability and actual repayments.
*   Your financial details.

Ground 4 - You have necessary expenses in supporting another child (or children) or person you have a duty to maintain

This ground applies if the ability of either parent to support their children is significantly reduced by necessary commitments to support another child or person they have a duty to maintain.

To apply under this ground, you should have a legal or moral duty that makes you responsible for their financial support with necessary expenses to support them.

You'll need all of these things to apply.

*   A copy of any agreement or court order.
*   A list of the costs necessary to support the other child or person.
*   Reasons why the expenses are necessary with details of any steps you’ve taken to reduce them.
*   Confirmation of your current earnings if you earn a salary or wage.
*   If you’re in business, details of your interest in the business, your latest profit and loss statement and balance sheet.
*   If you have loan commitments, the loan start date, term and purpose, minimum liability and actual repayments.
*   Your financial details.

Ground 5 - Your contact costs are more than 5% of your adjusted income

This ground applies when the high costs of contact significantly affect either parent’s ability to maintain the children. Contact costs can include travel, reasonable or necessary accommodation and toll calls.

Contact costs do not include food, clothing and entertainment.

To apply under this ground, the costs of maintaining contact with the child must be over 5% of your adjusted income for the year. For the 2022 child support year and earlier child support years, the costs must be over 5% of your adjusted taxable income.

You'll need all of these things to apply.

*   Confirmation of the contact arrangements such as a court order, agreement or a letter from a solicitor.
*   A list of costs such as travel fares, accommodation, toll calls, or legal fees for maintaining contact with the child.
*   An estimate of future costs with confirmation from a travel agent, if applicable.
*   Your financial details. 

If you're applying for a review in myIR, we'll ask you for details about your situation and costs.

Working out your cost of travel
-------------------------------

If you use a private motor vehicle to travel to and from contact visits with your child, the cost of this travel is calculated using the following kilometre rates.

*   2021 (from 1 February 2021) 42 cents per km
*   2020 (from 1 August 2019) 40 cents per km.
*   2019 (1 June 2018 - 31 July 2019) 36 cents per km.
*   2013 to 2018 (up to 31 May 2018) 33 cents per km.

The kilometre rate is reviewed periodically.

Ground 6 - It costs you extra to cover the child's (or children's) special needs

This ground applies if both of these apply.

*   A child’s needs are not usual and require funding beyond the normal costs of bringing up a child.
*   The extra costs significantly affect either parent’s ability to maintain the child.

To apply under this ground, your child must have current issues that need special medical treatment or care.

You cannot claim the usual and regular costs of food, clothing, medical and day care.

You'll need all of these things to apply.

*   A medical certificate or evidence showing the child’s condition, specific treatment and costs.
*   A list of costs, showing extra expenses after deducting any benefit or allowance paid, or medical insurance refunds.
*   An estimate of future costs.
*   Your financial details.

Ground 7 - It costs you extra to care for, educate or train the child (or children) in the way that was expected by either parent

This ground applies if the extra costs to care for, educate or train the child significantly affect the parent’s ability to maintain the child.  
  
To apply under this ground, the costs must have been expected by either parent and be reasonable in relation to the family circumstances.

Costs include private schooling or additional costs for sports, music or other activities related to the particular talent of an especially gifted child.

You'll need all of these things to apply.

*   Confirmation of school fees, additional tuition fees or costs of the child’s additional activities.
*   Other information showing expectation of the special training or education (such as family history, situation before separation, formal agreement).
*   Your financial details.

Ground 8 - The child support assessment does not take into account the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of either parent or child (or children)

This ground applies if you feel the child support assessment is unfair because it does not reflect the true income, financial position, assets or earning capacity of either parent or the child.

You'll need all of these things to apply.

*   Confirmation of your changed income, such as a letter from your employer or a copy of the latest profit and loss account and balance sheet.
*   Your financial details.

If the situation relates to the other party or children, you'll need:

*   details of their income, assets and financial position
*   your financial details.

Ground 9 - The child support assessment does not take into account that you have previously made payments, transfers or property settlements for the benefit of the child (or children)

This ground applies if the child support assessment is unfair because a [liable parent](/api/glossary/item?id={2BD1C350-B91A-4EA6-A784-C7C311502E33})
 or [receiving carer](/api/glossary/item?id={ECAE3AEF-DAB7-4A41-BB04-B4E94EFA1B55})
 has previously made financial provisions to the child, other parent or any other person, specifically for the benefit of the child.

The aim of this ground is to avoid unfair doubling up of support payments, possibly as a result of an agreement, property settlements or court orders.

The payments, transfers or settlements need to have been made before the child support assessment was made and should be genuinely for the benefit of the child.

If applying for a year prior to 2016, note that only liable parents can apply under this ground.

You'll need all of these things to apply.

*   Confirmation or evidence of the payments, transfers or settlements made.
*   Your financial details.

Ground 10 - You still have a financial interest in a property that the other person is entitled to live in

This ground applies if the child support assessment is unfair because the [liable parent](/api/glossary/item?id={2BD1C350-B91A-4EA6-A784-C7C311502E33})
 or [receiving carer](/api/glossary/item?id={ECAE3AEF-DAB7-4A41-BB04-B4E94EFA1B55})
 is legally entitled to live in a property you have a financial interest in.

This ground recognises that a considerable amount of a person's capital may be tied up in the home over a period of time while the receiving carer and children or the liable parent continue to live there.

If you are applying for a year before 2016, only liable parents can apply under this ground.

You'll need all of these things to apply.

*   A copy of any agreement or court order.
*   Confirmation that the other person is residing in the property and how long they’re allowed to do this.
*   Confirmation of your financial interest in the property.
*   Your financial details.

Ground 11 - The child support assessment includes extra income earned from additional work to cover costs of re-establishment after separation

This ground applies if all the following are met.

*   You are the parent of a [qualifying child](/api/glossary/item?id={B6040FD9-57EA-4308-A47B-34576F1B3618})
    .
*   You have separated from the child's other parent.
*   You have earned extra income from additional work within the first three years after separation.
*   The extra income is included in the child support assessment being reviewed.
*   Some or all of that income has been used, or will be used, on actual and reasonable costs to re-establish yourself and any child or other person you have a duty to maintain.

A [non-parent carer](/api/glossary/item?id={EF4ECDD5-93C8-4DA4-952F-11ABC20A7BAF})
 of a child can also apply for a review under this ground to have the re-establishment costs of the child's parent taken into account. However, they will still need to get the relevant details and supporting information from the parent.

You can apply under this ground for the child support year 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017 or later child support years.

You will need all the following to apply.

*   Evidence showing the additional work started after separation, for example, a secondary employment contract.
*   Evidence of income earned from additional work, for example, payslips showing overtime or a letter from employer showing details of extra work started after separation.
*   Evidence showing extra income has been or will be used for reasonable re-establishment cost, for example, receipts, quotes or hire-purchase agreements.
*   Dates of any reconciliations after the original separation date.
*   Your financial details. 

Additional work
---------------

The work must be additional in quantity and/or nature to the work done before separation - such as taking on a second job, working overtime or taking on extra contracts after separation.

Maximum extra income that can be excluded
-----------------------------------------

There's a maximum amount of income from additional work that can be excluded from the assessment. 

The maximum is one of the following.

*   The amount that has been or will be used for re-establishment costs.
*   Extra income earned from additional work.
*   30% of the parent's adjusted income for the relevant child support year (or 30% of the parent’s adjusted taxable income for the 2022 child support year and earlier child support years).

Reconciliation and the first three years after separation
---------------------------------------------------------

The 3-year period begins on the day the child's parents stop living together in a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship.

If the parents reconcile for a total of 3 months or less, the reconciliation period(s) may be ignored.

If the parents reconcile for more than 3 months, the 3-year period stops the day before they reconcile. A new 3-year period restarts if the parents separate again.

Reasonable re-establishment costs
---------------------------------

Re-establishment costs can include buying a house, furniture, whiteware, household appliances, paying a rental property bond and removal costs. These costs need to be actual and reasonable given the circumstances of your case.

In myIR, as well as your Application for an administrative review, we'll ask you for details about your situation and costs.

[All GST dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[GST (goods and services tax)])

For periods starting from 1 April 2024 the mixed-use assets rule will not apply to short-stay accommodation, boats and aircraft.

Changes to the mixed-use asset rules
------------------------------------

The general GST apportionment rules should be applied fairly and reasonably. If you would like to, you can carry on using the mixed-use asset apportionment method as a fair and reasonable method.

You do not need our approval to use or carry on using the mixed-use asset method. 

Find out more about the general apportionment and adjustment rules:

[GST adjustments for business, private and exempt use](/gst/gst-adjustments)

GST treatment of mixed-use assets expenses for periods before 1 April 2024
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're GST registered and you have a [mixed-use asset](/api/glossary/item?id={F1D02979-341A-48C1-A59D-72275CED41D6})
, you can claim 100% of the GST you pay for any expense that relates only to the income-earning use of the asset. For example, the costs of advertising for guests for your holiday home. You cannot claim any of the GST that relates only to the private use of the asset.

If an expense is income-earning use and private use, you need to apportion it between those 2 uses. Use the following calculation when you're working out an adjustment for GST input tax on your [mixed-use assets](/api/glossary/item?id={F1D02979-341A-48C1-A59D-72275CED41D6})
.

Income-earning days / (income-earning days + private days)  
x amount of input tax

In the calculation, input tax is the total input tax for the mixed-use expenses. It does not include input tax on expenditure relating only to taxable days and non-taxable days.

Income-earning days are the total number of days when rent or a fee is paid for the use of the asset, regardless of the amount paid. It includes family, non-associated persons and any income-earning use spent repairing or relocating the asset. When you're paid rent at less than market rate, you must pay GST at full market value if you're providing the rental to an associated person.

Private days is the total days the assets is used with no amount of rent or fee paid.

Note that the definition of 'income-earning days' is different from the days used to work out income tax expenses. For GST purposes it includes all days that you get rent for, regardless of what percentage of market rate is paid.

Using alternative measures other than days
------------------------------------------

You can use other measures in the formula if they reflect more accurately the time the asset is used. For example:

*   flying hours for an aircraft
*   nights for a holiday home.

You calculate the adjustment for an adjustment period to get the amount of GST input tax to claim in your return.

Regan's boat

Regan purchases a charter boat on 1 April 2018 for $450,000 which is used both to earn income and for private use. He accounts for GST input tax for the 2019 tax year as follows:

**Fully deductible expenses**

*   annual Maritime NZ survey fees - $700
*   charter advertising - $400
*   food/drinks (charter guests only) - $500

Regan claims the full input tax and does not make an adjustment as the expenses relate solely to earning income.

**Not deductible**

$250 for family fishing licenses is a private expense, so he does not claim any GST input tax.

**Apportioned (mixed-use) expenses**

There are mixed-use expenses that relate to both income-earning and private use.

*   mooring fees - $2,000
*   fuel - $1,200
*   insurance - $2,450
*   general repairs - $300

**Total mixed-use expenses - $5,950**

When Regan bought the boat he estimated that its taxable use would be 50%. He claimed input tax on the mixed expenses of $29,735.86 (credit) as follows:

| Expense | Cost | GST value | 50% input tax claimed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| purchase of boat | $450,000 | $58,695.65 | $29,347.82 |
| mooring fees | $5,950 | $776.09 | $338.04 |
| **Total input tax** |     |     | **$29,735.86** |

  

During the year the boat was used:

**Income earning days**

*   days fully chartered to the public - 102
*   days chartered at 50% market rate to Regan's local fishing club - 20

Total income earning days - 122

**Private days**

Days the family used the charter boat without making any payment - 30

Income-earning + private days = 152

**Total input tax (boat $58,695.65 + mixed-expenses $776.09) = $59,471.74**

The calculation is:

(122 / 152) x $59,471.74 = $47,733.90 input tax

Regan claimed input tax of $29,735.86 during the year. He is entitled to claim a further amount $17,998.04 (credit) as an adjustment for input tax in his final GST return of the 2019 tax year.

The calculation is:

$47,733.90 minus $29,735.86 = $17,998.04

[All GST dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[GST (goods and services tax)])

You acquire a good or service when you either:

*   purchase it
*   introduce it into your business.

Principal purpose method (goods and services acquired for $10,000 or less)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

From 1 April 2023, when you acquire a good or service for $10,000 or less (excluding GST), you need to determine whether the principal purpose is for making taxable supplies.

You can claim the full GST amount of goods or services if they are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies.

You cannot claim any GST if the principal purpose is not for making taxable supplies.

For goods and services valued at $10,000 or less, you cannot make any GST adjustments, even if the principal purpose of those goods or services changes.

Apportionment method (goods and services acquired for $10,000 or less)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can choose to claim the business percentage of goods and services, using the apportionment method (regardless of the principal purpose for acquiring the good or service). No further adjustments in future periods will be required.

If you choose to use apportionment, instead of the principal purpose method, you will need to use this for all goods or services acquired for at least 24 months.

Goods and services acquired over $10,000
----------------------------------------

When you acquire a good or service valued at over $10,000 (excluding GST), you need to work out how much it will be used in your business. You then apportion the amount of GST you claim based on the percentage of the good or service used in your business.

If the good or service will also be used privately or to make exempt supplies, you must apportion the GST amount you can claim based on your estimate of the percentage it will be used in your taxable activity.

You can choose how you work out the percentage of business use, if the method used gives a fair and reasonable result. This can be based on past records, experience, business plans or another suitable method.

Goods that are commonly used in a business and privately include:

*   your home (when you have a home office)
*   vehicles.

You can claim for your home office by comparing the floor area of your office to the total floor area of your home.

You can calculate a private use adjustment for a vehicle by keeping a logbook and comparing private kilometres travelled with total kilometres travelled.

Please contact us if you'd like to use a special apportionment method for your business. You can send us a message in myIR.

Electing to treat goods as non-taxable supplies
-----------------------------------------------

For goods not acquired or used for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, you can choose to treat them as non-taxable supplies.

This only applies to goods such as land, dwellings and vehicles.

You will not have to add GST to any future sale of the good under this election.

To qualify, the following criteria must be met:

*   no previous GST deduction has been claimed for the goods
*   the goods were not acquired or used for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies
*   the goods were not acquired as zero-rated supplies (see below for the exception).

Once applied, you will not need to monitor the use of the good at the end of each GST adjustment period.

Output adjustment for zero-rated supplies
-----------------------------------------

There might be situations where you acquire zero-rated goods, but the principal purpose of the goods is not for making taxable supplies.

To treat the goods as non-taxable, you can make a debit adjustment for the GST you would have been charged, if the goods were not zero-rated (nominal GST amount).

Transitional rule for goods acquired before 1 April 2023
--------------------------------------------------------

If you have claimed GST for a percentage of taxable use, for goods that were not acquired or used principally for making taxable supplies, you can make a debit adjustment under the transitional rule.

If you choose to use the transitional rule, you need to:

*   return any GST you have previously claimed
*   notify Inland Revenue by sending a message through myIR, before 1 April 2025.

When the transitional rule is applied, future disposal of those goods can be treated as a non-taxable supply.

Once applied, future adjustments may only be required if the use of the goods changes to principally making taxable supplies.

Example: Phil uses the principal purpose method

Phil is a GST-registered contractor who bought a laptop for $3,000 (GST exclusive) for use in his business, for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Phil also uses it occasionally for private use.

Phil can claim the full cost of purchasing the laptop as an expense in his next GST return.

Example: Amy uses the apportionment method

Amy has a GST-registered business and bought a car for $10,350 (including GST of $1,350). Amy bought the car principally for private use but will sometimes use it for business. Amy estimates she will use the vehicle for 10% business use.

Under the principal purpose method, Amy would not be able to claim the cost of the car purchase in her GST return, as the GST exclusive price of the car is less than $10,000.

Under the apportionment method, Amy could claim 10% of the GST in her next return. Amy needs to apply this method to all goods and services valued at $10,000 or less (GST exclusive), for a minimum of 24 months.

Example: Rebecca treats a sale as a non-taxable supply

Rebecca is GST-registered and has a small farming business. While her farmhouse is used to help run her business, the principal purpose is for her private residence.

When Rebecca bought the farmhouse, the purchase was not zero-rated for GST (as the seller was not GST-registered). Rebecca did not claim any GST on the purchase or any capital improvements relating to the farmhouse.

Rebecca can elect to treat a future sale of the farmhouse as a non-taxable supply for GST purposes. She will not have to pay GST on the sale. The land used for farming would still be subject to GST.

Rebecca can still claim part of her operating costs (such as rates, insurance and utilities), based on the percentage of the farmhouse used for making taxable supplies.

If the property use does not change, Rebecca will not have to charge GST on a future sale or disposal of the farmhouse.

Example: Gavin completes an output adjustment

Gavin is GST-registered and buys a holiday home for $1 million from another GST-registered person. The sale was zero-rated for GST purposes. The principal purpose for buying the house is for private recreation. However, Gavin also intends to rent out the property for short term accommodation.

Gavin can choose to make the future disposal of this property a non-taxable supply, by returning output tax of $150,000 in his next GST return (the nominal GST amount that would have been charged, had the purchase not been zero-rated).

If the property use does not change, Gavin will not have to charge GST on a future sale or disposal of the holiday home.

Example: Mary uses the transitional rule

Mary is GST-registered and bought a lifestyle block next to her beef farm in March 2022, for $1.15 million dollars. The seller was not GST registered.

The principal purpose for buying this property was for long-term residential rental. The property included land which Mary uses in her beef farming business. Only 25% of the total property value relates to her farming. Mary claimed GST of $37,500 in her March 2022 GST return.

In September 2023, Mary decides to use the transitional rule for the lifestyle block and notifies us. Mary makes a debit adjustment of $37,500 in her September 2023 GST return. If the property use does not change, Mary will not have to charge GST on a future sale or disposal of this property.

Te tāke hokohoko mō ngā whare noho wāpoto, tauhokohoko hoki GST on short-stay and commercial accommodation
==========================================================================================================

Generally, you need to charge GST when you lease out commercial property. This includes short-term leases and commercial accommodation like hotels, hospitals, residential care homes and some serviced apartments. 

How much you charge depends on how long your customer is staying and what kinds of services you offer. 

[The difference between commercial and residential property](/property/commercial-residential/tax-difference)

The 4-week rule
---------------

You’ll need to charge GST on the full value of accommodation for the first 4 weeks' stay. After 4 weeks, you charge GST at a lower rate on certain items.

However, if you agree up-front that a stay will be for more than 4 weeks, charge GST on 60% of the value of domestic goods and services **from the start of the stay**. 

### Domestic goods and services

After 4 weeks, charge GST on only 60% of the value of the ‘domestic goods and services’.  

These usually include:

*   the right to stay on the property
*   cleaning and maintenance
*   electricity, gas, air-conditioning or heating
*   telephone (not tolls), television, radio or similar items. 

### Non-domestic goods and services

Continue to charge GST as normal on the full value of these items or services:

*   food
*   toll calls
*   medication
*   nursing. 

### Combined charges

You'll need to separate any combined charges that cover domestic and non-domestic goods and services. For example, bed and breakfast.

We'll need the non-domestic, fully taxable supplies (breakfast) separate from the domestic goods or services (bed).

Rest homes and private hospitals
--------------------------------

When you’re providing accommodation in rest homes and private hospitals, you split the costs for domestic and non-domestic goods and services.  

These are the standard rates we allow for rest homes and private hospitals.

### Rest homes

*   45% domestic goods and services
*   55% non-domestic goods and services

### Private hospitals

*   35% domestic goods and services
*   65% non-domestic goods and services 

Changing accommodation type
---------------------------

You'll need to make a GST adjustment if you turn your commercial property into exempt long-term residential accommodation.

If you change the use of a property, you may need to make a GST adjustment when the property is sold or there is a change in use.

[GST adjustments for business or private use](/gst/gst-adjustments)

Example: changing property from commercial to residential

Smith Properties Ltd decides to convert their entire building to residential apartments. All commercial tenants vacate the building. The building is now used for non-taxable purposes (residential renting). Smith Properties Ltd must make a GST adjustment for the period the use changed to 100% non-taxable purposes.

GST and exported second-hand goods
==================================

2009 changes to the GST Act allows exported second-hand goods to be zero-rated when a registered person has claimed a second-hand goods input tax deduction.

_**Sections 10(4), 11(3B), 11(3C) and 11(3D) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985**_

Changes have been made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to allow, in certain circumstances, exported second-hand goods to be zero-rated when a registered person has claimed a second-hand goods input tax deduction. The changes ensure that exported second-hand goods that are not brought back into New Zealand are treated in the same way as exported new goods.

### Background

Under section 11(3)(a) of the GST Act, exports of second-hand goods are subject to GST at the standard rate of 12.5% if the exporter, or an associate of the exporter, has claimed a second-hand goods input tax deduction. The specific application of this section was considered by the Taxation Review Authority in _Case N66_[\[1\]](#01)
.

The imposition of GST in these circumstances is designed to prevent revenue losses from exporting second-hand goods that have never been subject to GST but gave rise to an input tax deduction when acquired. A further tax base risk arises if the goods are subsequently brought back to New Zealand without GST applying on importation and again sold to the exporter or an associate of the exporter to create another second-hand goods deduction. GST therefore applies to remove the incentive for second-hand goods to be repeatedly imported to and exported from New Zealand to take advantage of the resulting input tax deductions.

The problem with charging GST on exported second-hand goods is that if the goods do not return to New Zealand, they will have been taxed differently from exported new goods.

The changes are consistent with the objective that:

*   The GST Act does not distort the tax treatment of second-hand goods that are consumed outside New Zealand.
*   The GST base is not exposed to "leakage" arising from transactions that repeatedly seek to claim the deduction available on the purchase of second-hand goods.

Under the amended rules, the supply of second-hand goods in situations - when there is limited prospect of the goods being brought back to New Zealand in substantially the same condition as when they were exported - will be zero-rated.

### Key features

The zero-rating rules that apply to exported goods have been changed by inserting three new subsections into section 11 of the GST Act.

New section 11(3B) permits registered persons to zero-rate certain exported second-hand goods for which a second-hand goods input tax deduction has been claimed, if:

*   the goods are entered for export under the Customs and Excise Act 1996; and
*   the goods leave New Zealand within 28 days of the goods being supplied (as determined by the earlier event of the recipient paying for the goods or the supplier issuing an invoice).

New section 11(3B) will apply if the recipient provides the registered person, at or before the time of supply, a written undertaking that the goods will not be brought back to New Zealand by the recipient, or a person associated with the recipient, in a condition that is substantially the same as the condition in which they were exported.

New section 11(3C) is an anti-avoidance provision that requires GST to be charged if all of the following events have taken place:

*   the exported goods were previously zero-rated;
*   the goods are subsequently imported into New Zealand;
*   the goods are reacquired by the registered person in a condition that is substantially the same as when the goods were zero-rated; and
*   the registered person had claimed a second-hand goods input tax deduction in connection with the original export of the goods.

New section 11(3D) provides that section 11(3C) applies at the time the goods are reacquired unless GST is levied when the goods are subsequently imported into New Zealand. This change is designed to remove the possibility of double taxation under section 11(3C) and section 12.

A consequential change has been made to section 10(4), which determines the taxable value of the exported goods if section 11(3C) applies.

##### Example: Exported scrap metal

Company A Ltd pays $630 for scrap metal (2,000 kg of light gauge grade steel and 1,500 kg of oversized grade steel) acquired from the demolition of a haybarn on private property. The owner of the haybarn is not registered for GST, and Company A claims a second-hand goods deduction of $70 ($630 ÷ 9) on the purchase of the scrap metal. Company A cleans and sorts the steel and cuts any oversized components to light gauge specification. The steel is baled and stored with similar gauged steel which is held as trading stock.

Company A receives an order for 6,000 kg of steel from an Indonesian firm.

Supplying the order involves Company A using a mixture of scrap metal that has been acquired from unregistered and registered suppliers (including all of the steel that was formerly part of the haybarn).

The entire export can be zero-rated if the Indonesian firm provides a declaration (for example, a clause in the sale and purchase agreement) that it or a person associated with the firm will not cause the goods to be brought back into New Zealand in substantially the same condition in which they were exported.

#### _"In a condition that is substantially the same"_

Section 11(3B) uses the phrase "in a condition that is substantially the same" for the export and re-importation of second-hand goods. The phrase is not defined and is intended to be given its ordinary meaning.

The purpose of the phrase is to ensure, in the event that the goods return to New Zealand (and tax is not levied on the importation), that GST will apply unless any of the following apply:

*   the nature of the goods has been fundamentally varied;
*   the goods are in a form that is unrecognisable contrasted to the goods when they were exported; or
*   the goods have been subsumed into other goods so that they are no longer identifiable from the goods as a whole.

For example, if the scrap metal in the example above returned to New Zealand in the form of metal window frames, the goods would not be considered to be in a condition that is substantially the same. A similar outcome would result if the scrap metal in example 1 returned to New Zealand in the form of an artistic metal sculpture.

### Application date

The change applies from the date of Royal assent, being 6 October 2009.

* * *

1 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,495. The case concerned an exporter of second-hand motorcycles to Japan. The taxpayer acquired the motorcycles from a number of sources, both GST-registered and unregistered. The Taxation Review Authority held that the motorcycles acquired from unregistered persons could not be zero-rated if the second-hand goods input tax deduction had been claimed.

GST and financial services
==========================

2006 changes to the GST Act to treat certain activities involving investments in equity securities and participatory securities as supplies of financial services.

##### Sections 3 and 20F of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

Changes have been made to section 3(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to treat certain activities involving investments in equity securities and participatory securities as supplies of financial services. The financial services may be zero-rated if supplied to businesses.

### Background

Supplies of financial services in New Zealand are generally exempt from GST. Since 1 January 2005, however, supplies of financial services to GST-registered persons whose taxable supplies equal or exceed 75% of their total supplies may be zero-rated, when the financial services provider elects to do so.

The amendment recognises that, in its absence, certain activities involved with investments in the form of shares may not be treated as supplies of goods and services for the purpose of the GST Act. For example, entities, such as investment companies and equity funds, whose sole activity is to hold shares are generally unable to register for GST. Any GST incurred by these entities (investors) is therefore irrecoverable.

If the investor seeks to pass on the cost of the irrecoverable GST- for example, in the form of requiring higher returns from investments in other GST-registered persons (investees) - tax cascades may arise. The greater the activity associated with the management of the investment, the more likely it will be that the investor will seek to recover those costs from the investee.

The amendment seeks to resolve this problem by treating certain equity security or participatory security investments (such as the acquisition of shares) that allow the investor to influence the management of the investee as a supply of "financial services". If the investor acquires shares in an investee that is GST-registered and 75% of the investee's total supplies are taxable supplies, the investor may elect to zero-rate the investment (including such activities associated with maintaining the investment) and register for GST. Information on when the supply of financial services may be zero-rated can be found in Inland Revenue's _GST guidelines for working with the new zero-rating rules of financial services_.[1](#01)

A consequential amendment has also been made to section 20F(1) so that it refers to a "person" rather than a "registered person". The change means that a person making GST-exempt supplies, and who is therefore unable to register for GST, can elect to zero-rate supplies of financial services under section 20F and register for GST.

| more than $9,500 and not more than $38,000 | 21 cents for every dollar of contribution |
| more than $38,000 | 33 cents for every dollar of contribution |

Where no such election is made33 cents for every $1 of contributionThe income tax rates confirmed are the same as those that applied for the 2005–06 tax year.

### Key features

Section 3(1) has been amended by inserting new paragraphs (m) and (n).

#### New paragraph (m)

An investment in an entity will be treated as a supply of financial services if:

*   the investment is in an equity security or participatory security that is equal to or greater than 10 percent of all the equity securities and participatory securities issued by the entity; and
*   the investment allows the investor, or a person acting on behalf of the investor, to influence the management of the business of the entity.

The reference to influence over an entity that is exercised by a person other than the investor was changed from an "associated person" to "a person acting on behalf of the investor" at the recommendation of the Finance and Expenditure Committee. The change reflects that the investment sector commonly uses independent managers to influence the business of the investee.

#### New paragraph (n)

The bill initially included a definition of "actively managed investment". This definition was removed as part of the Finance and Expenditure Committee deliberation on the bill and the clause was re-written as new paragraph (n).

Activities, including on-going activities, that an investor undertakes to evaluate an investment meeting the requirements of section 3(1)(m), such as monitoring or holding the investment, will be treated as a supply of financial services under section 3(1)(n). Activities connected with influencing the management of the investee are also treated as a supply of financial services. The paragraph extends to pre-acquisition activities that are carried out for the principal purpose of acquiring an investment described in section 3(1)(m).

### Application date

The changes apply from the date of enactment, 18 December 2006.

### Detailed analysis

#### Active investment

The changes to the definition of "financial services" are directed at active investment in the share capital of another entity. The active nature of the investment is measured using two conjunctive tests.

The first test requires that the investment is equal to or greater than 10 percent of all the equity securities and participatory securities issued by the entity.

The second test requires that the investment allows the investor, or a person acting on behalf of the investor, to influence the management of the business of the entity. This test considers whether the investment allows the investor an active role in the management of the investee entity.

#### Consideration for the supply of goods and services

"Consideration" for the purposes of the GST Act is typically thought of in terms of discrete amounts or obligations, such as explicit fees. "Consideration" can also take the form of margins in certain circumstances - for example, the interest rate differential between borrowing and lending rates. In the case of equity investment, the consideration received by an investment company for its intermediation services would be the net difference between the dividends it receives and the dividends it pays to its own shareholders. Additional commentary on valuing supplies of financial services is set out in Inland Revenue's guidelines on the application of the zero-rating rules for business-to-business supplies of financial services.[2](#02)

If your koha is an unconditional gift you do not have to pay GST on it. An unconditional gift is a voluntary payment to a non profit body that does not benefit the payer or giver in the form of goods or services.

If the koha, such as payments, goods or services are not an unconditional gift they will be liable for GST.

Deciding if your koha is liable for GST
---------------------------------------

Using the unconditional gift rule will let you know whether your koha is liable for GST. To help you decide, we’ve added some examples below. They’re based on a non profit marae registered for GST.

GST on marae member payments
----------------------------

When a marae member gives money, goods or a service (koha) to their marae and expects nothing in return, then it is not subject to GST or liable for income tax.

Types of payments not taxed are:

*   money given to bereaved family or committee at a tangihanga or hura kōhatu
*   money given to a married couple or committee at a mārena
*   koha given to a marae committee to assist in paying for a building house or church
*   visitors on a marae giving a collection to donate to the marae committee

Types of payments that must be taxed are:

*   a government department giving payment on a marae
*   tourists given a tour on a marae for a fee
*   fund raising activities by marae committee
*   a marae building is made available for a function in exchange for koha.

Koha given to the tangata whenua

A group of people arrange to stay on your marae for a couple of nights at no charge by your marae. The group gives a koha to the tangata whenua at the pōwhiri.

The koha is an unconditional gift and is not liable for GST. It’s unconditional because the payment was voluntary and not given for goods or services.

Staff workshop on your marae

A company holds a two-day staff workshop for thirty people on your marae. You charge a fee of $50 per person per day. You must charge GST, because the money is paid for the goods and services supplied by you. You can claim GST on all goods and services you purchase to host this workshop.

Participants give a koha after staff workshop

After the workshop (in the example above) some of the participants give a koha to you in appreciation of the hospitality shown. As this koha is not for goods and services you have supplied and gives no direct benefit to the payers/giver, it is an unconditional gift and not liable for GST.

If your marae is not registered for GST, it cannot charge GST for any goods and services they supplied and cannot claim GST back on goods and services they pay for.

Te tāke hokohoko me ngā hokonga wharenoho iti e rīhitia ana GST and leased apartment sales
==========================================================================================

You may have GST to pay when you buy or sell an apartment that has or had a managed lease.

We recommend you get advice from a tax professional before you buy, sell or change the use of an apartment that has a managed lease. 

What managed leased apartments are
----------------------------------

People often buy apartments as investments, planning to rent them out. Sometimes these apartments come with a lease to a management company included in the purchase.

Generally, if an apartment has a lease to a management company at the time it’s bought, it’s likely to be considered a ‘going concern’, with GST charged at 0% (or ‘[zero-rated](/api/glossary/item?id={E70187A5-4135-491B-BB28-E46477AF54E4})
’).

Read more about zero-rating and going concerns.

[Zero-rated supplies](/gst/charging-gst/zero-rated-supplies)

Was your apartment zero-rated when you bought it?
-------------------------------------------------

You may have bought the apartment as a going concern (with the purchase zero-rated) if both you and the seller were GST-registered.

For the purchase to have been treated as a going concern, you must have notified the seller before settlement of the purchase that:

*   you intended to use the apartment to make [taxable supplies](/api/glossary/item?id={07FA406A-D39C-4573-B445-274D0F443A3F})
     in a [taxable activity](/api/glossary/item?id={F966147A-3408-4CDD-A965-AF294365FA2D})
    
*   the property would continue to have a managed lease agreement.

Generally, you will have done this when you signed the agreement for sale and purchase.

What this means when you sell
-----------------------------

You probably will not have a GST tax bill on the sale of your apartment if you are still GST-registered and the sale meets the requirements to be zero-rated. For example, the management lease is still in place and the buyer is GST-registered.

However, you may have to pay GST if **any** of the following apply.

*   The original lease agreement expired, and you did not negotiate another one with the management company.
*   You changed the way you used the apartment. For example, you or a member of your family moved into the apartment.
*   You rented it out yourself to tenants for long-term rental.

Example: Bill and Marie sell a leased apartment

In 2021, Bill and Marie bought an apartment as an investment. The apartment was leased to a management company and was zero-rated as a going concern.

Bill and Marie signed a lease setting out conditions of use with the management company. They also signed some papers relating to GST.

When the lease ended, they decided to sell their apartment rather than negotiate another lease with the management company. Their daughter moved in on a casual basis while the apartment was on the market.

They accepted an offer of $455,000. This covered their mortgage, real estate fees and other expenses, and gave them a $40,000 profit.

When Bill and Marie told their accountant about the sale, they were shocked to find they had a GST bill of $59,347.83 (the GST component of the sale price, which included GST at 15%).

GST needed to be paid because the apartment was no longer a going concern. The lease had ended and there'd been a change in the apartment's use.

If Bill and Marie had checked the GST status of their apartment before they sold it, they may have avoided an expensive mistake.

GST and loyalty points
======================

2009 legislation allows loyalty programme operators to defer GST until the redemption of loyalty points to ensure payment at the correct rate.

_**Sections 2(1), 9(9), 9(10), and 11C of the Goods and Services Act 1985**_

Changes have been made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to allow certain loyalty programme operators to defer the imposition of GST until the redemption of loyalty points to ensure that GST is being paid at the correct rate.

### Background

GST is charged on goods and services consumed in New Zealand. Since exported goods and services are consumed outside of New Zealand, as a general rule, exports of goods and services are zero-rated. Zero-rating allows a supplier of goods and services not to charge GST, but to still be able to claim input tax deductions.

Before the current amendment to the GST Act, because of the involvement of an intermediary, supplies of what are normally considered zero-rated goods or services could be subject to GST at the standard rate. For example, a loyalty programme operator (such as an airline) could enter into a transaction with a purchaser whereby the purchaser paid consideration to the loyalty programme operator for crediting loyalty points to a customer. The customer would later redeem the loyalty points for a zero-rated reward supplied by the loyalty programme operator. By imposing GST on the loyalty points at the time they were issued, GST was in effect imposed on what would normally be a zero-rated supply. This anomaly would not exist if the supply was acquired directly from the operator for a monetary consideration instead of through the use of loyalty points.

The amendment to the GST Act allows certain loyalty programme operators to defer the imposition of GST until such time as the nature of the reward and the normally applicable GST rate is known.

### Key features

New section 9(9) of the GST Act allows certain loyalty programme operators to defer the imposition of GST on a sale of loyalty points to another person until such time that the loyalty points are redeemed.

New section 11C specifies the requirements which have to be satisfied before a loyalty points operator can defer the imposition of GST under section 9(9). A loyalty programme operator is able to use the rules if it makes supplies for consideration under an arrangement with another person to provide loyalty points to a third person and the following conditions are satisfied:

*   25% or more of the loyalty programme operator’s or its associated person’s business involves the provision of zero-rated goods or services.
*   The operator or its associated person has a business activity outside the activity of operating a loyalty programme (the main business activity) and the loyalty points are able to be redeemed for rewards supplied by the operator or associate as part of the main business activity.
*   The loyalty programme operator is able to identify, at the time of the redemption of loyalty points, whether GST was imposed on the points in question when they were issued or whether the GST liability was deferred until the redemption of points under proposed section 9(9).

A new section 11C(6) states that the second requirement will still be satisfied if, in addition to being redeemable for rewards supplied by the operator’s or associated person’s main business activity, the loyalty points are able to be redeemed for a reward supplied by an operator’s partner under an associated loyalty programme.

New section 9(10) states that when the GST “reverse charge” provisions in the GST Act treat the New Zealand-resident purchaser of the loyalty points as supplying the loyalty points, the purchaser is able to choose whether to defer the payment of the GST until those points are redeemed. If the purchaser chooses to defer the imposition of the GST, they must be able to meet the requirement of being able to identify whether GST has been paid and deferred.

The legislation also introduces a definition of the term “loyalty programme” in section 2, and makes a consequential amendment to the meaning of the term “supply” in section 5(14).

### Application date

The amendments apply from the day of Royal assent, being 6 October 2009.
