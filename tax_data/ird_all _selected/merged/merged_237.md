24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 - Appendix - April 1993 Chapter Eight - Assets acquired after 31 March 1993 but before the end of the 1994-95 income year 8.1 Qualifying assets Between 1 April 1993 and the end of your 1994-95 income year is a transitional period, where the previous depreciation rates are phased out and the new economic rates are introduced. Generally for assets acquired during this period you have a choice of which rate to use to calculate deprecia- tion. If you have a late balance date (i.e. 1†April to 30†Sep- tember) you may use the depreciation calculated under these rules in your 1992-93 return for assets purchased after 1 April 1993. These rules also apply to assets which were depreciated in your 1992-93 income tax return using one of the following : ï Standard value method ï Replacement value method ï Annual revaluation method. These assets are able to be depreciated in the 1993-94 and subsequent income years using the new rules. This is to minimise compliance costs and more specifically, to allow them to be pooled with similar assets acquired on or after 1 April 1993. 8.2 New assets acquired These are either: ï New assets never used before in New Zealand or elsewhere ï Imported second hand assets used in New Zealand for the first time Specific exclusions are: ï Imported used cars ï Buildings ï Software (see section 5.4) ï Intangible assets (see section 5.3) The rates to be used are either one of the following: ï The rates shown in section 7.2 including the 25% loading, (i.e. columns 2 and 4), and including any shift allowance if applicble ï The economic rate as listed in section 10.5 8.3 Other assets acquired Second hand assets, imported cars and buildings are to be depreciated using either: ï The rates list in section 7.2 excluding the 25% loading (i.e. columns 1 & 3), and including any shift allowance if applicble ï The economic rates as listed in section 10.5 Part Four - Rates for 1995-96 and Future Years Chapter Nine - Assets acquired in the 1995-96 and future income years 9.1 New assets acquired These are assets which are either: ï New assets never used before in New Zealand or elsewhere ï Imported second hand assets used in New Zealand for the first time, but excluding imported used cars, buildings, intangible assets (see section 5.3) or software (see section 5.4). Assets in this category are depreciated at the economic rate plus a 20% loading. The banded economic rates including the 20% loading are listed opposite.

These are listed in section 10.5. Part Three - Assets Acquired During Transitional Period 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 - Appendix - April 1993 9.3 International aircraft The annual depreciation rate for passenger interna- tional aircraft acquired in the 1995-96 or future income years is 15% diminishing value or 10% straight line. Chapter Ten - Schedule of rates 10.1 Organisation of the schedule The schedule has two types of categories: ï Industry categories ï Asset categories. When assets are peculiar to one or two specific indus- tries, they have been listed under that industry. When an asset is typically used in a variety of different industries (for example, tanks, boilers and heating), they have been listed under the general asset categories. Within each category, the assets have been ordered so that: ï The depreciation rate at the beginning of each category is for assets which are not specifically listed in the category (default class) ï The assets specified within each category are listed alphabetically. Some assets are listed under two or more industry categories. In some of these cases the depreciation rate is the same, and in other cases the depreciation rates are different, which reflects the different industrial environment in which the asset is used. For each asset the following details are shown: ï The estimated useful life, as used in the formula for calculating the diminishing value rate (as explained in section 3.1) ï The banded diminishing value depreciation rate ï The equivalent banded straight line depreciation rate. Where we've used a residual value other than 13.5% in calculating the depreciation rate, the asset has been marked with an asterisk. In these cases a residual value of 25% has been used in the calculations. 10.2 How to use the depreciation schedule Generally the following rules apply: Where there is an appropriate Industry Category for your industry and an asset is specifically listed, use that depreciation rate. Where there is an appropriate Asset Category and the asset is specifically listed, use that depreciation rate. Where the asset is specifically listed under an Industry Category which is not your main industry, you must use that depreciation rate if you use the asset in a similar way to how it is used in that industry. Finding the right rate Follow these steps to find the depreciation rate for an asset: 1. See the Industry Category index on page 26. ïIf there is not an appropriate Industry Category, go to step 2. ïIf there is an appropriate Industry Category, go to the listed page. - If the asset is specifically listed on that page, use the depreciation rate shown. - If the asset is not listed go to step 2 (don't use the rate for the default class at this stage). 2. See the Asset Category index on page 26. ïIf there is no appropriate Asset Category, go to step 3. ïIf there is an appropriate Asset Category, go to the listed page. - If the asset is specifically listed on that page, use the depreciation rate shown (do not use the rate for the default class at this stage). - if the asset is not listed on that page, go to step 3. 3. See the alphabetical listing of assets in section 10.6 on page 68. ïIf the asset is not listed go to step 4. ïIf the asset is listed see the Industry Category for which the asset is listed, and use that rate. (If the asset is listed under more than one industry, use the industry which is most appropriate to your industry.) 4. Refer back to the Asset Category index on page 26. ïIf there is an appropriate Asset Category, use the rate for the default class. ïIf there is no appropriate Asset Category, go to step 5. 5. See the Industry Category index on page 26. ïIf there is an appropriate Industry Category, use the rate for the default class. ïIf there is no appropriate Industry Category, go to step 6. 6. Apply for a provisional rate. See section 3.5 for details. 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 - Appendix - April 1993 10.3 Index to Industry Categories Industry CategoryPage Agriculture, horticulture and

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 - Appendix - April 1993 Appendix to Tax Information Bulletin Volume Four, No. 9: Amendments Section 1.2 Assets that cannot be depreciated (page 3) The first sentence states that to claim depreciation on an asset, it must decline in value while used or avail- able for use in your business. This is not entirely correct. It is not necessary for an asset to decline in value, but there must be a reasonable expectation that in normal circumstances it will do so. Section 1.4 GST implications (page 3) This section states that if you are registered for GST you can claim the GST component of an assetís cost price. There are circumstances where this is not so, such as when you buy an asset which you will use to make non-taxable supplies. Section 2.8 Calculating depreciation under the pool method (page 5) The example in this section refers to the pool value as $21,000. This figure is the average pool value on which pool depreciation is based. The pool value as at the end of the income year (before deducting depreciation) is $24,000. Also, the example shows an incorrect adjusted tax value. The correct value is $19,380, calculated as follows: value of pool at the end of income year$24,000 less depreciation $ 4,620 adjusted tax value of pool$19,380 Section 3.1 How rates are calculated (page 5) The correct formula is: †1† 1 - \[( residual value ) n \] cost 5.4 Computer software (page 10) Since we published this Appendix the policy on computer software has been finalised. Software expenditure incurred before 1 July 1993 is fully deductible as an expense for tax purposes. From 1 July 1993 onwards the tax treatment of ex- penditure on computer software is summarised in the six categories below. For the purposes of this policy the terms used are explained as follows: Development - the following activities are likely to be part of a development phase: ï gathering and analysis of user requirements ï system design ï detailed software specification ï programme construction ï software testing ï user or customer testing (acceptance testing) ï development of manual and training materials ï preparation of documents to describe, support, and for on-going maintenance of software product ï management review throughout the development phase (eg quality assurance) Maintenance - the following activities will generally be accepted as deductible maintenance payments: ï help desk facilities ï fixing programme bugs ï bringing performance up to the original specifi- cations of the software ï making minor changes such as increasing field sizes Pre-development - this term refers to a feasibility study of a project as part of on-going business ISSN 0114-7161 Depreciation In April 1993 we sent out the Appendix to Tax Information Bulletin Volume Four, No 9. That Appendix dealt with depreciation. Since publishing it, we've learned that it contained a number of errors. We apologise for this, and we've sent you these amendments to to correct those errors. Please cross-reference these amendments to the appropriate pages in the original Appendix. The new policy on software has been finalised since the original Appendix was printed, so we’ve included it in this supplement. A number of the rates listed in section 7.2 of the Appendix (pages 13 to 23) were incorrect, so we’ve included replacement pages for this entire section. These have the original page numbers on them for ease of reference, which is why the page numbering in this supplement apparently doesn’t follow a logical sequence. 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 - Appendix - April 1993 Software - includes all programmes or routines used to cause a computer to perform a desired task or set of tasks, and the documentation and training materials required to describe and maintain these pro- grammes. Upgrade - generally an upgrade of computer software: ï adds new features to the structure ï increases its capacity or performance ï extends the life of the software ï provides a new version of the software that has more capacity or increased performance Categories of expenditure i) Software purchases ï Cost of purchase to be capitalised and depreci- ated at 40% diminishing value or 30% straight line ï Immediate write-off available for software costing less than $200 ï Cost of maintenance may be deducted ï Cost of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated at 40% diminishing value or 30% straight line ii) Specified lease of software ï Cost price of software to be capitalised and depreciated at 40% diminishing value or 30% straight line ï Interest component of lease payments may be deducted ï Maintenance costs may be deducted ï Cost of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated at 40% diminishing value or 30% straight line iii)Software developed in-house for use in business ï Pre-development expenses may be deducted ï Development expenses must be capitalised until project completed and then depreciated at 40% diminishing value or 30% straight line ï Costs of unsuccessful development may be deducted ï Maintenance costs may be deducted ï Costs of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated at 40% diminishing value or 30% straight line iv) Commissioned software ï Development costs must be capitalised until project accepted, then depreciated at 40% diminishing value or 30% straight line ï Costs of unsuccessful development may be deducted ï Maintenance costs may be deducted ï Costs of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated at 40% diminishing value or 30% straight line v) Software leased other than under a specified lease ï Lease payments ar deductible over the term of the lease vi) Software developed for sale or licence ï Development costs deductible in year incurred ï Value of unbilled work in progress and unsold completed software must be taken into account as trading stock. The value of trading stock at balance date must be included as income in your return. Where a payment covers both maintenance and up- grades, the cost must be apportioned between the two. The cost of maintenance is deductible and the cost of upgrade must be capitalised. The appendix to TIB Volume Four, No.10 contains full details of depreciation on software. You can get a copy from any Inland Revenue office. Section 6.2 Assets acquired between 16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993 (page 11) If you are switching from the diminishing value method to the straight line method (or vice versa), to make the conversion: 1. Determine the ordinary rate (as highlighted in section 7.2) 2. Add 25% loading (also shown in section 7.2) 3. Use the chart in section 2.6 (page 4) to convert to the alternative method Example Accounting machines ordinary rate20% DV with loading25% DV convert to straight line17.5% SL Section 6.3 Shift incentive (page 12) The first example given in this section shows an incorrect conversion to the straight line rate. The correct example is: Example DV SL general plant and machinery rate 10% 7% qualifying for 2 shift incentive13% 8.5% qualifying for 3 shift incentive16% 10.5% Where an asset qualifies for the shift incentive and the 25% loading, the rate is converted after these have been incorporated. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 - Appendix - April 1993 Example general plant & machinery rate 10% DV qualifying for 2 shift incentive13% DV add the 25% loading16.3% DV converted to straight line rate11% SL qualifying for 3 shift incentive16% DV add 25% loading20% DV converted to straight line rate13.5% SL Section 10.4 Index to asset categories (page 26) The correct heading is ìAsset Categoryî rather than ìIndustry Categoryî. The correct entry for ìReticulation systemsî is: ìReticulation systems (excluding electrical, communi- cations and gas reticulation)î Section 10.5 Economic depreciation rates Factory and other sundries (page 59) An additional asset is to be added to this category: Advertising blimps estimated useful life5 years DV Banded Depn rate33% SL Banded Depn rate24% Transportation (pages 65 & 66) Add an asterisk to this asset listed on page 65: ìAeroplanes (mechanically propelled, fixed wing, of an unladen weight exceeding 15,000kg, other than helicopters) This indicates that a residual value of 25% has been used in calculating the depreciation rate for this asset. See section 10.1 for more information about ìresidual valueî.

This policy statement sets out the Commissioner of Inland Revenueís views on the income tax treatment of computer software. It applies to expenditure incurred on or after 1 July 1993. Software expenditure incurred before 1 July 1993 was fully deductible as an expense for tax purposes; this policy does not alter that treat- ment. The policy is based on Inland Revenue's view of the law, including the new depreciation regime introduced by the Income Tax Amendment Act 1993. The policy is also consistent with generally accepted accounting princi- ples. Where this policy statement does not cover a taxpayerís particular circumstances, Inland Revenue is willing to discuss the matter. We are also happy to help if any taxpayer has difficulties with interpreting this state- ment. Direct your inquiries to: The Manager (Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Head Office PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Taxpayers who disagree with an assessment based on this policy have statutory objection rights. Inland Revenue's ìObjection Proceduresî book (IR†266) explains how to make an objection. This policy statement may be amended from time to time in the light of any relevant court decisions. Summary of tax treatment of computer software Software purchases ï Cost of purchase to be capitalised and depreciated at 40% diminishing value or 30% straight line ï Immediate write-off available for software costing less than $200 ï Cost of maintenance may be deducted ï Cost of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated at 40% diminishing value or 30% straight line TIB Appendix Volume Four, No. 10May 1993 Income Tax Treatment of Computer Software A Policy Statement from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue Introduction 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.10 (May 1993) - Appendix Detailed policy This statement sets out the detailed policy on the tax treatment of expenditure incurred on computer software on or after 1 July 1993. For the purposes of this policy ìsoftwareî includes all programmes or routines used to cause a computer to perform a desired task or set of tasks, and the documentation and training materials required to describe and maintain those programmes. The policy provides details of the tax treatment for taxpayers who: (a) Purchase software; (b) Lease software under specified leases; (c) Develop software in-house for use in their business; (d) Commission software development; (e) Lease software other than under specified leases; (f) Develop software for sale or licence. This statement is divided into three sections. Section 1 concerns taxpayers who have to capitalise and depreci- ate the cost of software (categories (a), (b), (c) and (d) above). Section 2 concerns taxpayers who may deduct the cost of software and do not have to capitalise and depreciate those costs (category (e) above). Section 3 concerns taxpayers in the business of developing software for sale or licence who are subject to the trading stock regime (category (f) above). The depreciation for software is set at 40% diminishing value or 30% straight line, depending on the method the taxpayer adopts. This section describes the four categories of taxpayers required to depreciate the cost of software and deals with specific issues related to each. It then deals with a number of general issues (e.g., special depreciation rates), which apply equally to all four categories. Software purchases A taxpayer who acquires software for use in a business gets an enduring benefit. This will be the case whether the taxpayer acquires all or only some rights in the software. The expenditure incurred is capital in nature and non-deductible, but the taxpayer can claim depre- ciation on the software over its life. Example 1: Purchase and Depreciation LMN Ltd purchases a software package for $300 in the 1994-95 income year. The company's balance date is 31†March. The depreciation treatment is as follows: DiminishingStraight Line YearValue (40%)(30%) 1Cost300300 less depín12090 balance180210 2opening value180210 less depín7290 balance108120 3opening value108120 less depín4390 balance6530 4opening value6530 less depín2630 (balance) balance390 Specified leases of software A specified lease is defined in section 222A of the Income Tax Act (ìthe Actî). Generally, this definition includes a lease with a guaranteed residual value, or (where certain other criteria are met) a lease with a term of more than 3 years. Where a taxpayer acquires software under a specified lease its treatment will be covered by sections 222A to 222D of the Act. The taxpayer is deemed to purchase the software and must capitalise the cost price and depreciate it. The difference between the total lease payments and the cost price of the software is deemed to be interest for tax purposes. The taxpayer can deduct this ìinterestî over the term of the lease. See section 2 of this statement for the treatment of software leased other than under a specified lease. In-house software development An in-house software developer is a taxpayer who develops software for use in their own business. Devel- oping software in-house creates a capital asset (i.e., an asset which gives an enduring benefit to the business). The tax treatment of expenditure incurred on the software development is linked to the different phases of the process. The three phases are: (a) The pre-development phase - usually including reviewing and analysing the project's feasibility; (b) The development phase; (c) The post-development phase - occuring after the project has been accepted and including things such as implementing and maintaining the software. The following table shows how to treat the expenditure incurred in each of these phases: Section 1 Taxpayers Who Acquire, Commission, or Develop Software for Their Own Use 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.10 (May 1993) - Appendix Pre-development phase Feasability study of the project as part of on-going businessRevenue Development phase Gathering and analysis of user requirements Systems design Detailed software specification Programme construction Software testing User or customer testing (acceptance testing)Capital Development of manual and training materials Preparation of documents to describe, support, and for on-going maintenance of software product Management review throughout the development phase (e.g., quality assurance) Post-development phase Implementation costs: Instruction and training of staffRevenue Implementation of software (after software functionally complete) Maintenance Help desk facilities Fixing programme bugs Bringing performance up to specification Revenue Making minor changes such as increasing field sizes Upgrades Product enhanced by new functions and features to increase capacity or performance Trade-in of software for new versionCapital with more capacity or increased performance Expenditure incurred during the pre-development and post-development phases (excluding expenditure on upgrades) is deductible. Expenditure incurred during the development phase must be capitalised to a software development account until the development is either completed or abandoned. This expenditure includes both direct and indirect costs. The major direct costs in developing software are the personnel and machine time involved. ï Personnel cost can be determined by using a system which records against a project the direct hours that each staff member spends on that project. ï The cost of machine time can be calculated on the system hours allocated to the project. These costs would generally be included as direct costs, but there may also be other direct costs to include, such as depreciation on computer hardware dedicated to the project. Indirect costs include all the overhead costs associated with the taxpayerís software development process which cannot be directly linked to a particular project. These may include: (a) The costs of running the software operation; for example rates, rent, insurance, energy costs (heat, light, and power): (b) Indirect labour costs; clerical and management costs that can't be directly attributed to the project: (c) Indirect material costs; computer paper, floppy disks, printer toner. The most appropriate method for allocating indirect costs will be based on direct person hours allocated to each project. However, a taxpayer can use another method if s/he can show that it is appropriate. Example 2: Allocation of indirect costs for in-house developer XYZ Bank Ltd has an in-house operation which develops software for use in the bankís business. In the last income year the software development operation worked on one major project and spent the rest of the time on maintenance work for existing software. The in-house operation employs two staff for software development and maintenance work. Each staff member works 1,000 hours a year. ProjectMaintenance Development workworkTotal (hours)(hours) Jack 8002001,000 Jill 6004001,000 Total1,4006002,000 Overhead costs allocated to software development operation for income year: $100,000 Allocation of overhead to project: Total hours worked=2,000 hours Proportion of hours worked for project= 1,400 2,000 =0.7 Overhead costs of project = $100,000 x 0.7 = $70,000 Therefore, besides the direct costs of the project, XYZ Bank Ltd must capitalise an additional $70,000 of overhead cost for the project. When the development is completed capitalised costs will be deductible under the depreciation regime. 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.10 (May 1993) - Appendix Commissioning a software development A taxpayer who commissions a software development receives an enduring benefit when it is completed. Therefore, all the taxpayer's development costs relate to producing a capital asset. The taxpayer must capitalise all expenditure until the software is fully developed (i.e., when the final form of the package is accepted). These costs can then be depreciated over the life of the asset. Example 3: Successful development In Year 1, ABC Ltd contracts Software Develop- ment Ltd to develop a software programme. The contract requires payment of $10,000 for the pre- development work and $90,000 for the development work. In Year 1, ABC Ltd makes the first payment of $10,000 for pre-development work. ABC Ltd deducts that cost for tax purposes. In Year†2, the software programme is completed and ABC Ltd makes the second payment of $90,000. ABC Ltd must capitalise and depreciate that cost, as the development is completed. Unsuccessful developments The cost of an unsuccessful software development can be deducted if the software can no longer be used and the project is stopped. This includes the case where the unsuccessful software development is never imple- mented. Section 108K of the Act requires the taxpayer to apply to the Commissioner for a determination that the software can no longer be used. Such applications should be sent to: The Manager (Rulings) Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 WELLINGTON Example 4: Unsuccessful development In Year 1, Customer Ltd contracts with AB Soft- ware Consultants to design a computer programme to monitor and analyse production efficiency. Customer Ltd is to make three progress payments during the contract. At the end of Year 1 the first two payments have been made. One payment was for the pre-development phase and is treated as an expense for tax purposes. The other payment (which is for development work) is capitalised for tax purposes. During Year 2, Customer Ltd varies its requirements and AB is unable to complete the development. Accordingly the project is abandoned by mutual consent without the third payment being made. For tax purposes Customer Ltd may deduct in its return for Year 2 the amount of the payment capitalised in Year 1. Subsequent sale A taxpayer who has developed software for his/her own use (and capitalised and depreciated the development costs) may also subsequently sell a copy to a third party. For example, a manufacturing business may sell a copy of the stock control software used in its business to another manufacturing business. The proceeds of the sale will be assessable income. In these circumstances the taxpayer must continue to depreciate the development costs. The deductible costs of sale will be the costs of producing the second copy of the software (for example, the costs of copying disks and printing manuals and training material). Maintenance and upgrades Payments made for the maintenance of software used for business purposes will be deductible, as the business does not gain an enduring benefit. Software mainte- nance ensures the software continues in its original intended state. Maintenance corrects errors or keeps the product updated with current information. It includes such things as adding data items to a thesaurus, soft- ware encyclopaedia, or database. Generally, mainte- nance activity includes routine changes which do not materially increase the capacity or performance of the software. Inland Revenue would generally accept that payments for the following are deductible maintenance payments: (a) help desk facilities; (b) fixing programme bugs; (c) bringing performance up to the original specifica- tions of the software; (d) making minor changes such as increasing field sizes. An upgrade of a computer software package provides a new advantage to the business, so there is a new endur- ing benefit. Payments for upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. Generally, an upgrade of computer software: (a) adds new features to the software; (b) increases its capacity or performance; (c) extends the life of the software; (d) provides a new version of the software that has more capacity or increased performance. Example 5: Depreciation of an upgrade In October 1993 Serviceco Ltd acquires Version 3 of the software programme ìModernproî for $5,000. Since Serviceco has owned the software for only part of the year, it may deduct part of the cost of $5,000 (i.e., $1,000) as depreciation for the year ending 31†March 1994. continued on page 5 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.10 (May 1993) - Appendix Section 2 Software Leased Other Than Under Specified Leases If a taxpayer leases software under a lease which is not a specified lease, section 222E of the Act requires that the deduction of the lease payments be spread over the term of the lease. The definition of ìleaseî in section 222A of the Act is very broad and includes any hire or bailment of a ìlease assetî. Any arrangement to hire software that is not under a specified lease is likely to be covered by section 222E of the Act. However, if an arrangement falls outside section 222E of the Act, the deduction for the payments will be determined by section 104, and the timing under section 104A (which requires the spreading of the deduction over the term of the arrangement). In July 1994, Serviceco Ltd acquires the newly- released improved Version 4 of ìModernproî for $2,000 by trading in its existing Version 3 pro- gramme. For the year ending 31 March 1995, Serviceco Ltd may either: (a) continue to depreciate Version 3 (as if no disposal had occurred) and commence depreci- ating Version 4 (from the cost price of $2,000); or (b) add the tax written down value of Version 3 ($4,000) to the $2,000, and depreciate Version 4 based on a $6,000 adjusted tax value. NB Section 117 of the Act does not allow an immediate write-off of the book value of Version 3, because it has been used as a trade in. The nature of the payment in each case will determine whether it is deductible. Simply labelling a payment as a maintenance payment will not necessarily make it deductible. Maintenance will not cover situations where software obtains new features to increase capacity or performance and/or to extend its life, or where the user gets another version of the software with more capacity or increased performance. Sometimes a payment may cover both maintenance and upgrades (whatever the payment is called). The taxpayer must then apportion the cost between the revenue and capital items. Example 6: “Maintenance” fee includes upgrade In August 1993 UVW Ltd acquires a software programme from Software Ltd. The two companies also enter into a two year ìProgramme Maintenance Agreementî. Under that agreement Software Ltd receives $3,000 to provide UVW Ltd with: (a) a telephone hot-line for user inquiries, a 24 hour bug fixing service and adjustments to formatting to meet UVW Ltdís internal docu- mentation; and (b) an enhanced Version 2 of the software pro- gramme when available. from page 4 The part of the fee relating to the services in (a) above will be deductible as a maintenance payment. The part of the fee that relates to the acquisition of version 2 must be capitalised until that version is acquired, and then depreciated as a cost of that enhanced programme. Low value packages Section 108O of the depreciation regime provides a deduction for the purchase of low value packages. This deduction is available where the total value of packages purchased from a supplier at one time is $200 or less, and the software does not form part of other software. Software and hardware purchased for a global price If a purchaser acquires software with hardware (with no breakdown of the price into component parts), the cost must be apportioned between the hardware and soft- ware, and each depreciated at their respective rates. The onus is on the taxpayer to make the apportionment. Modular development If a project is developed as a series of modules which can each be operated independently, each module can be depreciated as it is implemented. Special depreciation rates The depreciation rates set for software are based on an average economic life for software of 4 years. This rate has been arrived at after specialist analysis. Taxpayers may apply to Inland Revenue for a special economic rate if they can demonstrate that the economic life of a particular software package is greater or less than 4 years. Applications for special economic rates should be made to: The Manager (Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Head Office PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON from previous column continued in next column 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.10 (May 1993) - Appendix Section 3 Taxpayers Who Develop Software for Sale or Licence The business of software development includes develop- ing software packages for the outright sale of all rights in the software (either to known or prospective clients) and developing software for a specific client but retain- ing copyright for multiple licensing. A taxpayer in this business is entitled to deduct ex- penditure related to the development when it is in- curred. Section 85 of the Act requires taxpayers to take into account, at balance date, the value of their trading stock. In the case of software developers this requires the inclusion, as income, in the taxpayerís return of: (a) The value of work in progress (i.e., uncompleted and unbilled projects) at balance date; and (b) The value of any completed (but unsold or unbilled) project at balance date. The value of trading stock (including work in progress) ceases to be taken into account as income once it has been sold or billed. This is so even where the taxpayer expects to make further sales of the same programme in later income years. Options for valuing trading stock Section 85 of the Act gives a taxpayer the option, at the end of the income year, to value trading stock at cost price, market selling value, or replacement cost. The nature of software development is such that, in the majority of cases, the Commissioner expects the cost price option to be used as the basis of valuing work in progress. If a taxpayer elects to use a valuation other than cost, the taxpayer will need to support the validity and factual accuracy of the method. Market selling value Market selling value is an option available to a software developer. However, in many cases there will not be a readily determinable market selling value for an incom- plete software project. A claim that all partially com- pleted software has a nil or negligible market selling value by virtue of being incomplete, will not be accepted as a valuation under section 85 of the Act. For the market selling value option to be used the onus will be on the taxpayer to establish that value on the facts of the case. Replacement cost Replacement cost is also an option available to a software developer. However, there will rarely be a ready market in which a taxpayer could obtain the equivalent product. In such a case, the replacement cost will generally be equal to the cost that has already been incurred by the developer in developing the project to its current state. Cost basis Where a taxpayer adopts the cost basis of valuation, the Commissioner considers a partial absorption method of valuing work in progress as appropriate. In this method direct costs and an appropriate proportion of the indirect costs relating to the development project are included. The major direct costs in developing software are personnel and machine time. Personnel cost can be determined by using a time recording system where the direct hours spent on a project by each staff member are recorded against that project. The cost of machine time, for example where mainframe systems are used in the development of the project, can be calculated on the system hours allocated to the project. The Commis- sioner would expect these costs to be included in direct costs but there may also be other direct costs which should be included, for example the depreciation of computer hardware dedicated to the project. Indirect costs include all overhead costs which cannot be directly linked to the project. These may include: (a) The costs of running the business premises; for example rates, rent, insurance, energy costs (heat, light, and power): (b) Indirect labour costs; for example clerical and management costs attributable to the project: (c) Indirect material costs; for example computer paper, floppy disks, printer toner. The most appropriate method for allocating the indirect costs will be based on direct person hours allocated to each project. It is reasonable to assume that a project which takes 500 hours to complete requires a greater use of energy costs, management time and incidental running costs than a project which takes 100 hours to complete. There may be cases where the taxpayer can show that another method is appropriate for allocating cost to indirect items. For example, where a particular software development area can be identified with a project, an apportionment based on floor space may be appropriate. Examples 7 and 8 illustrate the method of allocation of cost to indirect costs of a development. Example 7: Allocation of indirect costs ABC Limited is a software development company, which produces software packages for sale to independent clients. In the last income year it worked on three packages; Projects 1 and 2 were sold before year end and Project 3 was still in production. How should it value the work in progress on the uncompleted Project 3? continued on page 7 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.10 (May 1993) - Appendix Obsolescence Although it would be very unusual for work in progress to be written down below the valuation base adopted by the taxpayer, the Commissioner does have a discretion to accept a lower value. Under section 85(5) of the Act the Commissioner may, in the case of obsolescence, approve a value lower than the valuation adopted by the taxpayer. For the discretion to be exercised, the taxpayer must make a written application to the Commissioner within the time required to furnish a return. This application must be to the taxpayer's District Office of Inland Revenue. Treatment of progress payments Where a developer is entitled to bill the client for progress payments under a contract or arrangement spanning two or more income years, part of the profit must be brought into account in all the tax years concerned. The Commissioner will accept the profit emerging or percentage completed contract, basis. Example 9: Treatment of progress payments Software Ltd is developing software for a client over a 13 month period. The contract provides for the following payments: $ Project Inception August 199320,000 Phase I February 199430,000 Completion September 199420,000 TOTAL70,000 The company has a balance date of 31 March. Progress on the project is not expected to proceed on an even basis. By 31 March 1994, 30% of the project is completed. Therefore, in terms of the percentage completed method, at 31†March 1994 only 30% of the total income of $70,000 should be recognised - i.e., $21,000. Treatment of pre-application date expenses As stated, the policy applies to expenditure incurred on or after 1 July 1993 and all costs incurred after that date must be identified. This will be so even if a project was commenced before 1 July 1993. The Commissioner will not disturb the treatment of costs incurred before that date where the taxpayer has treated those costs as expenses for tax purposes. If the taxpayer adopts a cost price basis for valuing software trading stock (including work in progress) at year end, the taxpayer must take into account only those costs incurred on or after 1†July 1993. The company employs three staff. They work full- time on the projects (1,500 hours per staff mem- ber). Direct development time Project 1 Project 2 Project 3Total Bill1,00050001,500 Jane1,000 200 3001,500 Susan 0 800 7001,500 Total2,0001,5001,0004,500 Overhead costs Energy$5,000 Premises$12,500 Support Staff (secretarial)$50,000 Management$55,000 Incidentals $1,000 Total$123,500 Allocation: Total development hours = 4,500 Project 3 = 1,000 hours 4,500 hours = 0.222 0.222 x $123,500 = $27,417 Therefore, besides the direct costs of production allocated to Project 3, an additional $27,417 for indirect costs must be added to the cost of the project. Example 8: Allocation of indirect costs John works from home as a free lance software developer. At year end, he is half-way through a project. John has set aside one room in his house in which he carries out his work. He is therefore entitled to apportion a percentage of the costs of his house against his business. Work area:15 square metres Total floor space of house:150 square metres Percentage of work area10% House costs which John could expect to deduct are: interest, rates, insurance, power, maintenance, and depreciation. John has been working on this project for the last 10 weeks of the income year. His total house costs are $8,000 (excluding interest). He should calculate the value of the work in progress as follows: 10 x $8,000 x 10% = $153.85 52 Interest attributable to the business does not have to be included when calculating the value of work in progress. This has to be apportioned between Johnís business (deductible) use and his private (non- deductible) use. from page 6 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.10 (May 1993) - Appendix Example 10: Pre-application date expenses Floppy Solutions Ltd is a software development company with a 31 March balance date. In January 1993 it began developing a new expert system programme for sale to accounting firms. The company had a policy of treating costs on develop- ment as expenses for tax purposes. The product is completed in April 1994 and the first sales occur in the following June. The treat- ment of costs related to this development for the 1993 and 1994 income years is as follows: (a) Costs incurred before 1 April 1993 - deductible in the year ended 31 March 1993: (b) Costs incurred from 1 April 1993 to 30 June 1993 - deductible in the year ended 31 March 1994: (c) Costs incurred from 1 July 1993 to 31 March 1994 - deductible in the year ended 31 March 1994, but taken into account as work in progress if a cost basis of valuation is adopted (under section 85) for the year ended 31 March 1994.

Corrections
-----------

On page 1 of TIB Volume Four, No.11 (June 1993), there was an article dealing with releasing Official Information about taxpayers.

In this article we said that _"We have consulted with the Ombudsman, and between us we've agreed that it is vital that Inland Revenue does not release information we receive in confidence,..."_

The Chief Ombudsman has pointed out that this statement reflects the general approach to release of informants' identities, but the rationale is not because the information is received in confidence. The reason is that releasing such information could well prejudice Inland Revenue's ability to detect revenue offences.

Where such factors are not involved in a particular case, the Ombudsman might form the opinion that the information ought not to be withheld and might recommend that it be released.

However, the sections in the previous article about confidentiality, defamation, illegal activities and safety still stand. Inland Revenue will not release any information if doing so would contravene any of these factors.

Explanation Section 64H(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 requires the full disclosure of all financial arrangements that are interrelated arrangements. This exemption removes the disclosure requirement in respect of all interrelated arrangements, the making of which is a generally accepted commercial practice, except for those interrelated arrangements referred to in the Schedule to this exemption. 2. Reference This exemption is made pursuant to section 64H(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 3. Scope of exemption This exemption shall apply to the income year com- mencing 1 April 1993. 4. Interpretation In this exemption, unless the context otherwise re- quires†- (a) Expressions used have the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act 1976: (b) Every reference to an income year shall, where a person furnishes a return of income under section 15 of the Income Tax Act 1976 for an accounting year ending with a day other than the 31st day of March, be deemed to be a reference to the accounting year corresponding with that income year: (c) ìInterrelated Arrangementî means a financial arrangement that consists of two or more arrange- ments, whether or not those arrangements are themselves financial arrangements: (d) ìLiabilityî includes a contingent liability: (e) A person shall be deemed to be a resident of New Zealand in relation to any activity or arrangement carried on through a fixed establishment outside New Zealand: (f) A person shall be deemed to be a resident of New Zealand in relation to any activity or arrangement carried on through a fixed establishment outside New Zealand: (g) ìValueîí in relation to any financial arrangement, means†- (i) In relation to any variable debt instrument, other than an interrelated arrangement, the amount of money owing to the holder pursuant to the arrangement: (ii) In relation to any fixed principal debt instru- ment, other than an interrelated arrangement or an instrument involving a notional principal, the greater of the acquisition price of the arrange- ment or the nominal or face value of the ar- rangement: (iii) In relation to any security arrangement, the greater of - (A)The amount of the maximum liability of the surety under the security arrangement: (B)The sum of the values of the financial arrangements wholly or partially secured by the security arrangement: (iv) In relation to any financial arrangement involv- ing a notional principal (for example, certain types of interest rate or currency swaps, forward rate agreements, certain futures contracts), the amount of the notional principal: (v) In relation to any arrangement which is not a financial arrangement, the total amount of consideration required to be provided under the arrangement by the person having the greatest liability under the arrangement: (vi) In relation to any interrelated arrangement, the sum of the values of the arrangements that constitute the interrelated arrangement: Provided that where, under an interrelated arrange- ment, consideration is required to be passed between persons more than once and as a consequence an amount would, but for this proviso, be required to be taken into account more than once in calculating the value of an interrelated arrangement, that amount shall not be taken into account more than once in calculating the value of the financial arrangement: Provided also that where the value can be ascertained pursuant to more than one of the foregoing subparagraphs, the value shall be ascertained pursuant to the subparagraph that provides the greatest value. 5. Exemption Any person who in an income year is party to an interrelated arrangement shall be exempt from the requirements of section 64H(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 in respect of the interrelated arrangement and the income year where- (a) The making of the interrelated arrangement is a generally accepted commercial practice; and (b) The interrelated arrangement is not of a kind specified in the Schedule hereto. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.11 (June 1993) - Appendix Schedule 1. Any interrelated arrangement where: a) The parties to one of the arrangements making up the interrelated arrangement include both the resident of New Zealand and a non resident of New Zealand; b) The value of the interrelated arrangements exceeds $2 million at any time in the income year; and c) The interrelated arrangement has a purpose other than only to achieve the exchange of money in one currency for an equivalent sum of money in another currency, such exchange not being subject to any agreement to reverse the exchange at some future date. 2. Any interrelated arrangement where one of the arrangements making up the interrelated arrange- ment is a perpetual note and the value of the interre- lated arrangement exceeds $2 million at any time in the income year. 3. Any interrelated arrangement where: a) One of the arrangements making up the interre- lated arrangement is a share in a company which does not rank equally with the ordinary shares in the company in terms of voting rights to distributions; and b) The value of the interrelated arrangement exceeds $2 million at any time in the income year. 4. Any interrelated arrangement where- a) In respect of one of the arrangements (ìthe sub- arrangementî) making up the interrelated arrangement, the amount of consideration provided or received by one of the parties under the sub-arrangement is influenced by the fact that the sub-arrangement is part of an interre- lated arrangement; and b) The value of the interrelated arrangement exceeds $2 million at any time in the income year: Provided that this provision shall not apply to an interrelated arrangement where the amount of consideration to be provided or received by one of the parties to the sub-arrangement is influenced only by the existence of a security arrangement as part of the interrelated arrangement. 5. Any interrelated arrangement the value of which exceeds $20 million at any time in the income year. This determination is signed by me on the second day of June in the year 1993. H. G. Holland Deputy Commissioner of Inland Revenue 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.11 (June 1993) - Appendix Appendix B Exemption D4 - Persons not required to comply with Section 245W of the Income Tax Act 1976 This exemption may be cited as ìInternational Tax Disclosure Exemption D4î 1. Reference This exemption is made pursuant to section 245W(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976. It details interests in foreign companies and foreign investment funds in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirement in section 245W of the Income Tax Act 1976 to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ending 31 March 1993. 2. Interpretation In this exemption, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section 2 or Part IVA of the Income Tax Act 1976. 3. Exemption Interest in a Foreign Company Any person who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company, in the income year ending 31 March 1993, shall not be required to comply with section 245W(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 in respect of that foreign company and that income year, except where: ï the interest held by that person during any accounting period of the foreign company (the last day of which falls within that income year of the person), would constitute an ìincome interest of 10% or greaterî, as defined by section 245A of the Income Tax Act 1976, as if the foreign company was a controlled foreign company. Interest in a Foreign Investment Fund Any person who has an interest in a foreign investment fund, in the income year ending 31 March 1993, shall not be required to comply with section 245W(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 in respect of that interest and that income year, except where: ï the person has made an election in terms of section 245Y(10) of the Income Tax Act 1976 in respect of that interest; or ï that interest was acquired or reacquired on any day between 2 July 1992 and 31 March 1993 (both days inclusive). This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 11 of the Inland Revenue Depart- ment Act 1974. This exemption is signed on the 8th day of June 1993. Tony Bouzaid Director - Taxpayer Audit 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.11 (June 1993) - Appendix Appendix C Section 1.2 Assets that cannot be depreciated (page 3) The first sentence states that to claim depreciation on an asset, it must decline in value while used or avail- able for use in your business. This is not entirely correct. It is not necessary for an asset to decline in value, but there must be a reasonable expectation that in normal circumstances it will do so. Section 1.4 GST implications (page 3) This section states that if you are registered for GST you can claim the GST component of an asset's cost price. There are circumstances where this is not so, such as when you buy an asset which you will use to make non-taxable supplies. Section 2.8 Calculating depreciation under the pool method (page 5) The example in this section refers to the pool value as $21,000. This figure is the average pool value on which pool depreciation is based. The pool value as at the end of the income year (before deducting depreciation) is $24,000. Also, the example shows an incorrect adjusted tax value. The correct value is $19,380, calculated as follows: value of pool at the end of income year$24,000 less depreciation ($21,000 x 22%)$ 4,620 adjusted tax value of pool$19,380 Section 3.1 How rates are calculated (page 5) The correct formula is: †1† 1 - \[( residual value ) n \] cost 5.4 Computer software (page 10) Since we published this Appendix the policy on computer software has been finalised. Software expenditure incurred before 1 July 1993 is fully deductible as an expense for tax purposes. From 1 July 1993 onwards the tax treatment of ex- penditure on computer software is summarised in the six categories below. For the purposes of this policy the terms used are explained as follows: Development - the following activities are likely to be part of a development phase: ï gathering and analysis of user requirements ï system design ï detailed software specification ï programme construction ï software testing ï user or customer testing (acceptance testing) ï development of manual and training materials ï preparation of documents to describe, support, and for on-going maintenance of software product ï management review throughout the develop- ment phase (eg quality assurance) Maintenance - the following activities will generally be accepted as deductible maintenance payments: ï help desk facilities ï fixing programme bugs ï bringing performance up to the original specifi- cations of the software ï making minor changes such as increasing field sizes Pre-development - this term refers to a feasibility study of a project as part of on-going business continued on page 6 Depreciation In April 1993 we sent out the Appendix to Tax Information Bulletin Volume Four, No 9. That Appendix dealt with depreciation. Since publishing it, we've learned that it contained a number of errors. We apologise for this, and we've sent you these amendments to to correct those errors. Please cross-reference these amendments to the appropriate pages in the original Appendix. The new policy on software has been finalised since the original Appendix was printed, so we've included it in this supplement. A number of the rates listed in section 7.2 of the Appendix (pages 13 to 23) were incorrect, so we've included replacement pages for this entire section. These have the original page numbers on them for ease of reference, which is why the page numbering in this supplement apparently doesn't follow a logical sequence. 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.11 (June 1993) - Appendix v) Software leased other than under a specified lease ï Lease payments are deductible over the term of the lease vi) Software developed for sale or licence ï Development costs deductible in year incurred ï Value of unbilled work in progress and unsold completed software must be taken into account as trading stock. The value of trading stock at balance date must be included as income in your return. Where a payment covers both maintenance and up- grades, the cost must be apportioned between the two. The cost of maintenance is deductible and the cost of upgrade must be capitalised. The appendix to TIB Volume Four, No.10 contains full details of depreciation on software. You can get a copy from any Inland Revenue office. Section 6.2 Assets acquired between 16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993 (page 11) If you are switching from the diminishing value method to the straight line method (or vice versa), to make the conversion: 1. Determine the ordinary rate (as highlighted in section†7.2) 2. Add 25% loading (also shown in section 7.2) 3. Use the chart in section 2.6 (page 4) to convert to the alternative method Example Accounting machines ordinary rate20% DV with loading25% DV convert to straight line17.5% SL Section 6.3 Shift incentive (page 12) The examples given in this section are incorrect in that the diminishing value rate is to be converted to a straight line rate after the addition of the shift incentive, and the 25% loading. Example DV SL general plant & machinery rate 10% 7% qualifying for 2 shift incentive 13% 8.5% qualifying for 3 shift incentive 16% 10.5% Where an asset qualifies for the shift incentive and the 25% loading, the rate is converted after these have been incorporated. from page 5 Software - includes all programmes or routines used to cause a computer to perform a desired task or set of tasks, and the documentation and training materials required to describe and maintain these pro- grammes.

The correct entry for ìReticulation systemsî is: ìReticulation systems (excluding electrical, communica- tions and gas reticulation)î Section 10.5 Economic depreciation rates Factory and other sundries (page 59) An additional asset is to be added to this category: Advertising blimps estimated useful life5 years DV Banded Depn rate33% SL Banded Depn rate24% Transportation (pages 65 & 66) Add an asterisk to this asset listed on page 65: ìAeroplanes (mechanically propelled, fixed wing, of an unladen weight exceeding 15,000kg, other than helicop- ters) This indicates that a residual value of 25% has been used in calculating the depreciation rate for this asset. See section 10.1 for more information about ìresidual valueî.

Corrections
-----------

This item corrects an example in the item on stamp duty and forest sales, which appeared on page 5 of TIB Volume Four, No.8 (April 1993). The example omitted to show that stamp duty was levied on the GST-inclusive value of the transaction. The correct treatment is:

(2) SilviCo Ltd purchases the registered forestry right in a block of land planted in four year old eucalyptus botryoides with the intention of milling them for hardwood in twenty five years. The purchase price is $23,000 plus GST (i.e., $25,875.00 including GST).

The annual payment for the forestry right is $3,000 (i.e., $3,375.00 including GST).

Conveyance duty at $1.00 per $100 or part thereof is levied on the GST-inclusive purchase price ($259.00); and 

Lease Duty of $0.40 per $100 or part thereof is levied on the GST inclusive maximum annual payment for the forestry right ($13.60).

The total stamp duty payable is $272.60.

The values have been announced later than usual this year due to a review of the way they are worked out. The Government has trialled a "snapshot" valuation method (recommended by the Livestock Valuation Consultative Committee) alongside the existing sales-based system. Government has decided that the ìsnapshotî valuation of ìon-farmî values gives a more accurate value of the livestock on a farmerís property at or near the end of year balance date. The values listed below apply to animals valued under the herd scheme. Trading stock values are not shown this year as that scheme has been repealed from 1†April 1992. Animals not valued under the herd scheme must now be valued under one of these new options: ï national standard cost ï self assessed cost ï replacement price or market value. High Priced Livestock The trigger price for high priced livestock purchased in the 1992/93 income year is now the greater of: ï $500, or ï five times the greater of (a) the national average market values listed below, or (b) the national average market values declared for the 1991/92 income year. 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.1 (July 1993) Type ofAverage Market Livestock Classes of LivestockValue Per Head $ Dairy cattleJersey and other dairy cattle: Rising one-year heifers393.00 Rising two-year heifers693.00 Mixed-age cows824.00 Rising one-year steers and bulls240.00 Rising two-year and older steers and bulls460.00 Breeding bulls842.00 DeerRed deer: Rising one-year hinds123.00 Rising two-year hinds232.00 Mixed-age hinds277.00 Rising one-year stags188.00 Rising two-year and older stags (non-breeding)310.00 Breeding stags1,999.00 Wapiti, elk, and related crossbreeds: Rising one-year hinds156.00 Rising two-year hinds282.00 Mixed-age hinds329.00 Rising one-year stags216.00 Rising two-year and older stags (non-breeding)369.00 Breeding stags2,043.00 Other breeds: Rising one-year hinds60.00 Rising two-year hinds98.00 Mixed-age hinds125.00 Rising one-year stags83.00 Rising two-year and older stags (non-breeding)120.00 Breeding stags426.00 GoatsAngora and angora crosses (mohair producing): Rising one-year does24.00 Mixed-age does26.00 Rising one-year bucks (non-breeding/wethers14.00 Bucks (non-breeding)/wethers over one year17.00 Breeding bucks124.00 Other fibre and meat producing goats (cashmere or Cashgora producing): Rising one-year does17.00 Mixed-age does20.00 Rising one-year bucks (non-breeding)/wethers13.00 Bucks (non-breeding)/wethers over one year14.00 Breeding bucks77.00 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.1 (July 1993) Type ofAverage Market Livestock Classes of LivestockValue Per Head $ GoatsMilking (dairy) goats: Rising one-year does53.00 Does over one year64.00 Breeding bucks152.00 Other dairy goats34.00 PigsBreeding sows less than one year of age149.00 Breeding sows over one year of age253.00 Breeding boars340.00 Weaners less than 10 weeks of age (excluding sucklings)45.00 Growing pigs 10 to 17 weeks of age (porkers/ baconers)124.00 Growing pigs over 17 weeks of age (baconers)178.00 Type ofNational Livestock Classes of LivestockStandard Cost $ SheepRising 1 year13.00 Rising 2 year7.50 Dairy cattle Purchased bobby calves119.00 Rising 1 year232.00 Rising 2 year58.50 Beef cattle Rising 1 year109.00 Rising 2 year62.70 Rising 3 year male non-breeding cattle (all breeds)62.70 DeerRising 1 year31.20 Rising 2 year18.10 Meat and Rising 1 year9.90 Fibre Goats Rising 2 year6.00 Dairy Goats Rising 1 year52.70 Rising 2 year9.70 PigsWeaners to 10 weeks of age74.10 Growing pigs 10 to 17 weeks of age56.10 continued on page 4 National Standard Cost Values for Livestock - 1993 The National Standard Cost (NSC) scheme for valuing livestock was introduced in the new section 86C of the Income Tax Act 1976 (the Act). The 1992 - 93 income year is the first year it has operated. Under the authority of section 86C(1) of the Act the Governor-General has declared the national standard costs for the income year commencing on 1 April 1992. The costs are listed in the table below. 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.1 (July 1993) Late Release of Livestock Values and 1993 Return Filing Requirements Introduction The 1993 National Average Market Values (NAMVs) for specified livestock were released later than usual this year. We have been asked if Inland Revenue intends to make concessions to the 1993 return filing requirements for practitioners who have a large proportion of live- stock farming clients. This item explains our views on the matter and what we will take into account for extension of return filing arrangements. Background In TIB Volume Four, No.7 (page 5) we explained the reason for releasing the NAMVs at a later date. We also said that the late release of the values should not unduly affect the income calculations (and therefore the return filing timing) for most farmers. That statement related to farmers who have †May or †June balance dates. Recently we were reminded that there is a significant number of farmers with balance dates in March and April. The late announcement of the NAMVs will delay the finalisation of these farmers' tax returns. This in turn will put back the preparation of later balance date returns. Comment There will be difficulties for farmers and their agents for the 1993 income year due to the need to make decisions in moving livestock out of the now repealed trading stock scheme. The Government has decided that in future years the NAMVs will be based on the snapshot valuation method. The valuation will take place on 30†April each year. This will mean that the Order in Council declaring the values will be released before the end of May. We believe that in future years the May announcement of the NAMVs will not unduly affect return filing targets for most practitioners, but we accept that some will be disadvantaged. from page 3 (continued at top of next column) The previous table on page 3 gives the breeding, rearing and growing (BRG) costs for rising 1 year animals and the rearing and growing (RG) costs for rising 2 year animals - apart from pigs which show the BRG for weaners up to 10 weeks of age and RG costs for grow- ing pigs between 10 and 17 weeks of age. Under the national standard cost scheme, a farmer applies a national standard cost value to homebred stock, and values purchased stock at their purchase price. The farmer then applies the average of these costs to stock on hand at yearís end to derive a closing value. This approach is used to determine the value of rising one year and rising two year immature stock (and rising three year male non-breeding cattle). Once livestock reach maturity the cost assigned to a particular animal is held until the animal is sold or dies. Example In 1993 a farmer home breeds 1,000 lambs and purchases 400 lambs during the year for $25.00 a head. In this example we have used the BRG figure for the 1992-93 year from the table above ($13.00) Calculation 1,000 homebred lambs at $13/head$13,000 400 purchased lambs at $25/head$10,000 1,400$23,000 Average cost per lamb =$23,000 1,400 = $16.42/head In the following income year (1993-94) the opening value of hoggets on hand will be $16.42/head. The farmer will add to this the RG cost for that year (say $7.50). Providing there are no purchases of sheep in that income year the closing value of two-tooths on hand at year's end will be $23.92. Any purchases of mature sheep will need to be averaged and added to this cost as follows: Calculation 400 opening hoggets at $16.42/head$6,568 Rearing and growing cost of opening numbers (400 x $7.50) $3,000 200 sheep purchased at $30/head (average) $6,000 600$15,568 Average cost per mature sheep =$15,568 600 = $25.94/head For the 1992/93 income year the opening value for the rising two year classes will be the 1991/92 closing value for the rising one year class. This will generally be the trading stock value for that year. See the previous article in this TIB for the 1993 Na- tional Average Market Values (NAMVs) for livestock. 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.1 (July 1993) Policy Inland Revenue does not intend to give a general relaxation of the return filing percentages for 1993 or any future year. Practitioners who feel disadvantaged by the change in the announcement timing of NAMVs should discuss the matter with their local Inland Revenue office. If you wish to discuss this issue with your local Inland Revenue office, please could you gather this information to help with any negotiations: ï The percentage of your clients who are livestock farmers. ï The number of associated returns i.e. partners, beneficiaries etc. ï The number of these clients with 31†May and 30†June balance dates. ï Any other reasons that may affect return filing percentages. ï An amended filing schedule to best meet return percentage targets, particularly at 31†March. Employment Status of Couriers Summary Recently the Court of Appeal allowed an appeal by TNT Express Worldwide (NZ) Ltd (TNT Express Worldwide (NZ) Ltd v Neil Cunningham C.A. 180/92 5/7/93) against a judgment of the Employment Court (\[1992\] 3 E.R.N.Z. 1030). The Employment Court had held that a TNT owner/driver courier was an employee. The Court of Appealís decision reversed that finding. This item confirms that Inland Revenue will not be altering our policy on determining the employment status of owner drivers for tax purposes as a result of the Court of Appeal decision. Our policy is that a taxpayerís employment status for tax purposes is determined in the same way as it is under general law, and that the same tests will apply. Background In TIB Volume Four, No. 7 (March 1993) we said we would wait until the Court of Appeal issued its judg- ment before issuing further guidance on the tests to be applied to determine a taxpayerís employment status for tax purposes. However, whatever the outcome, we would not assess couriers for back taxes if we had previously accepted their tax status. The Court decision TNTís appeal was successful. The Court accepted that an owner-driver courier whose contract with TNT: 1) required him to provide his own vehicle, uniform, approved radio telephone, goods service licence under the Transport Act 1962 and insurance; 2) paid him mainly on a per trip basis; 3) made him responsible for employing any relief drivers; 4) referred to the courier as an independent contractor; 5) gave TNT very extensive control over his operations was an independent contractor - not an employee. The Court of Appeal said that where the contract is wholly in writing and it is not a sham, then the nature of the relationship intended by the parties is determined from the terms of that contract in the light of all the surrounding circumstances at the time it was made. However, employment relationships do change and the Courts may enquire into the dealings between the parties after that date to see if in fact the relationship has changed from that envisaged by the contract. Judge Hardie Boys emphasised that the control exerted by TNT was only one of several factors relevant to the interpretation of the contract. The Court of Appeal considered this factor had been given too much weight by the Employment Court. Policy Inland Revenue's policy is that a taxpayer's employment status for tax purposes is determined in the same way as under general law. We consider that the Court of Appealís decision in the TNT case affirms our present approach as set out in TIB Volume Four, No.7. We will continue to apply our present policy, both to couriers and to other workers. Implications for couriers Couriers who are employed under similar contracts to the contract in the TNT case are independent contractors for tax purposes. They must account to Inland Revenue for income tax, ACC Premiums and GST on this basis, and they may deduct allowable business expenses. Correction - Computer Software In TIB Volume Four, No.10 (May 1993), there was an introduction on page 1 of the main TIB refer- ring to the separate Appendix on computer software. In this introduction, the date shown as 31 July 1993 should in fact be 30 June 1993. This error does not affect the Appendix itself, it appears only in the introduction in the TIB. We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused. 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.1 (July 1993) Correction - Stamp Duty on Forest Sales This item corrects an example in the item on stamp duty and forest sales, which appeared on page 5 of TIB Volume Four, No.8 (April 1993). The example omitted to show that stamp duty was levied on the GST-inclu- sive value of the transaction. The correct treatment is: 2 SilviCo Ltd purchases the registered forestry right in a block of land planted in four year old eucalyptus botryoides with the intention of milling them for hardwood in twenty five years. The purchase price is $23,000 plus GST (i.e., $25,875.00 including GST). The annual payment for the forestry right is $3,000 (i.e., $3,375.00 including GST). Conveyance duty at $1.00 per $100 or part thereof is levied on the GST-inclusive purchase price ($259.00); and Lease Duty of $0.40 per $100 or part thereof is levied on the GST inclusive maximum annual payment for the forestry right ($13.60). The total stamp duty payable is $272.60 Expatriate Home Leave Travel - Fringe Benefit Tax Summary 1. Employers are liable for Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) on any free or subsidised travel they provide to their ìexpatriateî employees to enable them to travel overseas on recreational leave. This policy applies from 1†August 1993 onwards. Background 2. Businesses and other organisations often arrange for their employees to work overseas, whether by being employed by overseas employers (e.g., on a second- ment), or remaining with the same employer and just being posted overseas for a period. Sometimes the employer provides free or subsidised return overseas so the employee (sometimes with his/her family) can leave the country of posting or secondment for their holidays. This item sets out the correct tax treatment of these travel benefits and explains why they are subject to FBT. For the purposes of this policy: ìTravel Benefitsî are provided, by an employer to an employee for recreational purposes (as part of the employment relationship). They include all forms of free or subsidised overseas travel for the employee (and/or any family members), and are not exchange- able for cash. ìExpatriate employeesî derive source deduction payments in or from New Zealand and either: (i) Come to New Zealand from overseas under an arrangement with their overseas employer or its associates, to be employed by a New Zealand taxpayer (for a defined term or otherwise) and receive Travel Benefits from the New Zealand employer; or (ii) Work outside New Zealand (again on a non- permanent basis) for a New Zealand resident taxpayer who provides them with Travel Benefits. Policy 3. Employers who are New Zealand taxpayers are liable for FBT on Travel Benefits they provide to their expatri- ate employees (and/or associated persons of those employees) to enable them to take recreational leave overseas. The relevant law 4. FBT applies to Fringe Benefits that an employer provides (directly or indirectly) to an employee and/or to any associated persons of that employee as part of an employment relationship. Is there a “Benefit”? 4.1 Travel Benefits are ìbenefitsî under the definition of ìFringe Benefitî in section 336N(1) since they advantage expatriate employees (both directly and relative to other employees) by enabling them to take leave overseas and removing the need for them to pay for their own holiday travel. Is there a “Fringe Benefit”? 4.2 Travel Benefits can be one of two types of Fringe Benefit i.e.: ìSubsidised Transportî (as defined in section†336N(1)), which is travel provided at nil or lower than normal price by an employer who carries on the business of general public carriage or trans- portation (section†336N(1)(d)); or Any other kind of benefit received or enjoyed by the employee (section†336N(1)(e)); and they are for the employeeís private use and enjoy- ment, and the employee receives or enjoys them directly or indirectly because of the employment with the employer. 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.1 (July 1993) Travel Benefits and the Fringe Benefit definition 5.1 Certain benefits are not liable for FBT because they are excluded from the definition of Fringe Benefit. For Travel Benefits, the only exception that could be relevant is section 336N(1)(j)(v). This excludes benefits that replace a need for the employer to reimburse an employeeís work related costs of transport between home and work, where those costs are incurred for the employerís benefit or convenience. 5.2 For the exclusion to apply, Inland Revenue must be satisfied that these costs are attributable to one of the factors specified in section 73 (3)(a)-(f). The only ones relevant to expatriate travel benefits are: (c) Fulfilling an obligation under any Act; (d) A temporary change in the employeeís workplace from the normal place of work, in relation to the same employer; (e) Any other condition of work of the employee. Criteria 6.0 Most Travel Benefits will not meet the criteria for exclusion under section 336N(1)(j)(v) because: 6.1They do not replace a need to reimburse transport expenditure. They give a gain or benefit to the employee, whereas reimbursement relates only to compensation for expenditure. 6.2Travel Benefits do not relate to travel between the employeeís place of work and ìhomeî because: (i) Travel Benefits relate to leave and recreation (especially where they are enjoyed by the employ- eeís family as well) and are not ìin relation to that employmentî as required by the subsection. (ii) An employeeís ìhomeî is the place s/he currently and regularly uses for personal residential occupation in non-working hours (i.e., the base from which s/he habitually travels to work). A home is the place around which, for the present, the normal course of the employeeís life revolves. If the expatriateís family is with him/her during the posting, ìhomeî will be where family life takes place during the posting (even if the expatriate keeps a residence in the country of origin, or has no intention of living permanently in the country of posting). \[Geothermal Energy NZ Ltd v IRC at 341; Newsom v Robertson (1952) 2 All ER 728\]. The Commissioner’s discretion 7. For the exception to apply, the Commissioner must also be satisfied that any transport costs incurred by the employee are attributable to at least one of the factors specified in section 73(3) (see paragraph 5.2 above). 7.1 Each situation will be assessed on its own facts, but generally Travel Benefits would not relate to any of those factors except: ì(d) Temporary change in workplace from the normal place of work of an employee, in relation to the same employerî. An expatriateís recreational travel from New Zealand back to his/her country of origin is unlikely to relate to travel to another work site of the same \[NZ\] employer. A New Zealand employee posted overseas by his/her New Zealand employer could qualify, but is unlikely to satisfy the first part of the exception (see paragraph 6). ì(e)Any other condition of workî - i.e., additional transport costs caused by any condition of work other than any already specified in section 73(3). The oil rig workerís Travel Benefit (covered in paragraph 8.1 below) would meet this requirement and be exempt FBT. Examples 8.1The criteria in paragraphs 6 & 7 are met where an employee works on an oil rig in New Zealand waters for ì3 weeks on and 1 week offî. The ìone week offî is a standard safety requirement in the industry. The employee returns (at the employerís expense) to his apartment in the United States for the one week off. The employee has no residence in New Zealand from which he travels to work, and has not severed any connection with the US place of residence. The nature of the job is such that the employee would have had to incur the transport costs to get to work if the costs were not paid by the employer. The travel is directly for the purposes of the employment and the employerís convenience. 8.2The criteria are not met where an accountant employed by the London branch of an international accounting firm is seconded to Wellington to work for its New Zealand associates for 2 years. The accountant, her spouse and child rent a house in Wellington and get tenants for their London house. The secondment contract with the New Zealand associate says that after 9†months' service the employee qualifies for 3 weeks' annual leave and free return air travel to Great Britain for her and her family. This Travel Benefit does not replace a need for the employer to reimburse the accountant for transport costs she would have incurred in travelling between home and work. Her ìhomeî is the Wellington house - not the London property. The travel relates to recreation, not ìthe purposes of that employmentî and costs of holiday travel are not costs she would otherwise be ìrequired to incur for the benefit or the convenience of the employer in relation to that employmentî. 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.1 (July 1993) Fishing Industry - Employer Premium Rate Changes Several rates of Employer Premium deductions for the fishing industry have been changed recently by the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance (Employment Premiums) Regulations (No.2) 1992 (Amendment No.2). Specifically, the changes are: ï a rate reduction from $4.49 to $2.08 per hundred dollars of income for the businesses of eel farming, fish farming and shellfish processing (These activities have been reclassified into Class No.21) ï a rate increase from $4.49 to $5.46 for the catching sector of the fishing industry. The businesses to which this applies are crayfishing from vessels, fishing from vessels, shipping (fishing from vessels), and collect- ing and bagging shellfish. These activities remain in Class No.23. These changes apply from 30†April 1993. Good Results for IRD's Small Business Service In June 1992 Inland Revenue set up our Small Business Tax Information Service, to help small business opera- tors deal with their tax obligations. At that time we expected that our 37 Small Business Officers would deal with about 12,000 clients in the first year. However, they exceeded that figure in just nine months. For the year to 30†June 1993, the service helped 17,703 small business operators, and held 568 seminars which reached an additional 9,031 people. This showed us that we are meeting a real demand in the business commu- nity. Small business operators make up a large percent- age of our business clients, so it's important that Inland Revenue makes it as easy as possible for them to comply with their tax obligations. Advise given is mainly on GST and employer taxes such as PAYE and the Employer Premium. Our officers aim to follow up each meeting within six months to check that everything is going smoothly. The benefits of this service for small businesses include reduced compliance costs, better record-keeping and less time spent preparing tax returns. Small business operators who want help with their tax obligations should contact the Small Business Officer at their local Inland Revenue office. Tax-Free Allowances Inland Revenue is studying the implications of cases involving the treatment of tax-free allowances, follow- ing recent cases heard by the Taxation Review Author- ity. In the meantime, we will not change our current practice regarding these allowances. There have been some queries and speculation about a change in Inland Revenue's policy after these TRA decisions. Any employer with doubts about the tax treatment of allowances they pay should contact Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue will continue to take a realistic ap- proach when looking at tax-free allowances. We will look at each case on its own merits, and decide whether allowances are fair and reasonable. Family Support Increase will be Automatic Current Family Support recipients will not have to re- apply to receive the increased payment rates announced in the Budget. Inland Revenue pays Family Support fortnightly to low- income working families. We will send new Certificates of Entitlement to these recipients to confirm the in- creased amounts that they will get. The increased amounts will be credited to their bank accounts from Tuesday 12†October onwards. People who are on benefits receive their Family Support along with their benefit payments from the Income Support Service. These people will receive the increased Family Support payments with their first or second October benefit payment. From 1†October the new maximum Family Support rates will be: First or only child$42 per week For each additional child: ï aged under 13$24 per week ï aged 13 or over$35 per week Currently, if a family has two or more dependent children over the age of 16, they are eligible for the ìfirst childî rate of $42 per week for each of these children. This treatment will no longer be available from 1†October 1993, but families who are presently receiving this entitlement will continue to do so until the children are no longer dependent. 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.1 (July 1993) Questions We’ve Been Asked This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that we've received. We've published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts.

Section 61(24) exempts the income derived by any society or organisation estab- lished for promoting or encouraging scientific or industrial research. The organi- sation must meet these conditions to qualify for an income tax exemption under this section: 1. Whether it is incorporated or not, the society or association must be estab- lished substantially or primarily for the purpose of promoting or encouraging scientific or industrial research. 2. The society or association must be approved by the Royal Society of New Zealand. 3. No part of the society or association's income or other funds may be used, or be available for use, for the private pecuniary profit of any proprietor, mem- ber, or shareholder. In this case the organisation met the above conditions, so the interest and any other income it may have is exempt from income tax. Scholarships and Bursaries Section 61(37) - Incomes Wholly Exempt from Tax: An organisation intended to sponsor a student by way of a scholarship allowance. It wanted to know whether the student would have to pay tax on the allowance. Section 61(37) does not specify the items of expenditure or levels of payment that qualify for the exemption. To work out the tax status of a scholarship, the determining factor is the nature of the payment. Inland Revenue will consider this nature principally from the contractual documents, the terms and provisions applicable between the payer and payee, and the surrounding circumstances. As the individual personal circumstances of each recipient will vary, we would need to consider each case on its own merit. In order to qualify under section 61(37), the recipient of the scholarship needs to be attending an “educational institution”. We would expect that the scholarship was paid to sustain the recipient while s/he was furthering his/her education. Factors we would look at include: • Is the money paid out as a scholarship to be repaid at a later date? • Is the purpose of the scholarship to secure the future services of the recipient? • Is there any relationship between the type of study to be undertaken and the employment (if any) of the recipient? In this particular case, the sponsorship was not to secure the future services of the recipient, and the student did not have to pay tax on the allowance. 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.1 (July 1993) United Nations Salary Section 61(50) - Income Exempted by Another Act: A New Zealand resident was employed by the United Nations and stationed overseas. She asked if her United Nations salary was taxable in New Zealand. She was on leave without pay from a New Zealand employer, and she owned a home in Wellington. Under section 61(50), income expressly exempted by another Act is exempt from income tax. This salary is exempted by clause 14(b) of the Diplomatic Privileges (United Nations) Order 1959 (No 51), which was an Order in Council made under the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1968. US Non-Taxable Bond Interest Received By New Zealand Resident Section 65(2)(jb) - Accrual Income Derived: A taxpayer was thinking of emi- grating from the United States to New Zealand. He asked whether a bond that is not taxed in the United States would be taxable in New Zealand if he became a New Zealand resident. If he became a New Zealand resident this taxpayer would fall within section 64J(2). This sub-section provides that: 1. a taxpayer is deemed to acquire any financial arrangement at the time at which the taxpayer becomes a New Zealand resident; and 2. the acquisition is deemed to have been made at market value. Although the bond interest is not taxable in the United States , it is taxable in New Zealand. There is no provision in the New Zealand tax laws or the United States double tax agreement\* that exempts income simply because it is exempt in the United States Bonds are included in the section 64B(1) definition of “financial arrangement”. As such, any interest income from a bond is calculated under the accrual provi- sions in accordance with sections 64B to 64M, and taxable in New Zealand under section 65(2)(jb). Determination G9A sets out the accrual method to calculate income on foreign currency denominated bonds. Under section 64M(e)(i), any income that a non-resident earned from a bond before s/he became a resident is not taxable in New Zealand as accrual income. \* Double Taxation Relief (United States of America) Order 1983 United Kingdom Government Pension Section 65(2)(j) - Items Included in Assessable Income: A New Zealand resi- dent taxpayer asked whether his United Kingdom pension was taxable in New Zealand. Article 19 of the UK double tax agreement\* provides that any United Kingdom pension or similar annuity paid to a New Zealand resident is only taxable in New Zealand. Under section 65(2)(j), the United Kingdom pension is taxable in New Zealand. \* The Double Taxation Relief (United Kingdom) Order 1984 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.1 (July 1993) House Built by a Builder Section 67 - Profits or Gains from Land Transactions: A builder bought a sec- tion which he then subdivided. He used part of the section for his building business, and built a house on the remainder, which he intended to sell when completed. He asked if the profit he made on selling the land with the house was assessable for income tax purposes. Section 65(2)(f) deems all profits or gains derived from land to which section 67 applies to be assessable income. Section 67(4)(c) includes as assessable income all profits or gains a taxpayer makes from selling any land, where s/he was in the business or erecting buildings at the time s/he acquired the land, and where s/he made improvements to the land (not being improvements of a minor nature); and 1. S/he acquired the land for the purpose of the business of erecting buildings; or 2. S/he sold or disposed of the land within 10 years of acquiring it. As this taxpayer was a builder and the land with the house on it was sold within 10 years of acquisition, the profit on the sale of the land was taxable. Expenses Incurred After Failure of a Business Section 104 - Expenditure or Loss Incurred in Production of Assessable In- come: A businessman whose business had failed asked whether he could deduct the expenses he incurred after the closure of his business (e.g., interest, rent, etc) from his assessable income. Under section 104, expenses are only deductible where they are incurred either in the production of assessable income, or in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income. In this case, as the taxpayer incurred the expenses after the business had failed, they are non-deductible, being neither incurred in the production of assessable income, nor in the carrying on of a business for that purpose. Share Loss on Compulsory Acquisition Section 106 - Certain Deductions Not Permitted: A taxpayer purchased shares in a public company, with the intention of holding on to them for dividend revenue purposes. Later, he had to sell the shares because of a compulsory acquisition due to a takeover. He asked whether he could deduct the capital loss he sustained on this sale from his assessable income. Each claim for a deduction for share losses incurred must be considered on the facts of the particular claim. Share losses will be deductible if a taxpayer is in the business of trading in shares, or if at the time s/he bought the shares, the clear and dominant purpose of acquiring them was for resale. However, a deduction is not allowable where the principal purpose for buying the shares was to re- ceive dividends and some capital growth. If the shares had been disposed of at a profit that profit would not have been assessable income. In this case the taxpayer was not entitled to a deduction as the expenditure is considered to be of a capital nature, and precluded from a deduction under section 106(1)(a). 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.1 (July 1993) New Zealander Trading Overseas Section 242 - Liability of Income Derived from New Zealand and Abroad: A taxpayer was trading as a sole trader overseas in Hong Kong, Tokyo, and the United States. He asked whether he will have any New Zealand tax obligations on the income earned while overseas. The taxpayer is a New Zealand citizen, and will be overseas for seven months. The permanent place of abode test in section 241(1) is the pre-eminent test for residence. A resident becomes a non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes under section 241 where: 1. s/he is personally absent from New Zealand for a period or periods exceed- ing in aggregate 325 days in any period of 12 months (section 241(3)); and 2. s/he does not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand (section 241(1)). Under section 242(a) all income that a New Zealand resident derives is assess- able for income tax in New Zealand, whether it is derived from New Zealand or elsewhere. Therefore, this taxpayer will be liable for New Zealand income tax on all income he earns while overseas, unless he becomes non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes. He will be given a credit in New Zealand for any tax he pays overseas on income that is taxable in New Zealand, to the extent allowable under section 293(2). Overpaid Family Support Section 374F - Allowance of Credit of Tax in End of Year Assessment: A tax- payer asked why his overpaid family support was deducted from his income tax refund. Section 374F generally allows the Commissioner to add any excess tax credits to tax payable. In particular, section 374F(2)(d) requires any overpaid family sup- port amount to be adjusted against the amount of tax payable in that income year. The tax payable, including the family support overpayment, is reduced by any rebates and tax credits, such as PAYE. The final result is either refunded (where it is a credit) or due for payment on the appropriate due date (if it is a debit). Australian Sourced Investment Income Double Taxation Relief (Australia) Order 1972: A New Zealand resident who receives interest and “franked” dividend income from Australia asked how this income was treated for both Australian and New Zealand tax purposes, and the legislative authority for such treatment. Under Article 9 of the Australian double tax agreement, Australia can only withhold 10% tax from interest that a New Zealand resident earns in Australia. The interest income is then subject to tax in New Zealand, but section 293(2) allows a credit for the tax paid in Australia (limited to the New Zealand tax payable). The Australian imputation system (franking system) operates in a similar man- ner to the New Zealand imputation system. Like New Zealand, the Australian system is quarantined, so the franking credit is only available to an Australian tax resident. A taxpayer cannot claim in New Zealand the franking credit at- tached to a dividend received from Australia. Section 394ZC(4) operates to prohibit the grossing up of the dividend amount of the franking credit. 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.1 (July 1993) Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 GST on Fire and General Insurance Section 5(13) - Receipt of an Indemnity Payment: An overseas government asked how fire and general insurance was treated for GST purposes in New Zealand. The activities which relate to life insurance and superannuation are defined as the supply of financial services, and are therefore exempt from GST. All other types of insurance are dealt with by sections 5(13) and 20(3)(d). There are two rules which apply to claims made under insurances other than life insurance: 1. The insurance company can claim an input tax deduction on any indemnity payment it makes, subject to certain exceptions. 2. The registered person receiving the indemnity payment from the insurance company must account to Inland Revenue for one-ninth of any payment, to the extent that it is received for a loss incurred in the course of making a taxable supply (provided GST is charged at the standard rate on the premi- ums, and the insurance is not a loss of earnings policy). Example: A domestic insurance company charges GST when it provides insurance for a building situated in New Zealand. If the insurance company subsequently pays out for damage to the building, it can claim one-ninth of the pay-out as input tax. A registered recipient must return output tax on that amount, to the extent that the building is used in the course of making taxable supplies. GST on Services Performed in New Zealand for Overseas Company Section 11 - Zero-Rating: An overseas market research company engaged a New Zealand firm to handle and mail out market research questionnaires in New Zealand. It asked whether it had to pay GST on the fee charged by the New Zealand firm. Section 11(2)(e) provides for the zero-rating of services supplied for and to a person who is not resident in New Zealand, and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. In this case a registered person in New Zealand made supplies to the overseas company. The overseas company did not have a presence in New Zealand, so the supply is zero-rated. Sale of Commercial Building to Lessee as Going Concern Section 11 - Zero-Rating: A solicitor acting for the parties to a sale and purchase agreement for a commercial building asked whether the agreement should be treated as the sale of a going concern. The building is to be sold to the existing major tenant, who occupies over 50% of the floor space. Both the vendor and the purchaser are registered for GST. For a sale of a taxable activity to be considered to be a sale of a going concern, the particular undertaking transferred must be capable of being continued by the 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.1 (July 1993) purchaser after the transfer. In this case, on selling to the lessee the leasehold and freehold interest merge. The purchaser cannot continue the undertaking in its original form. Accordingly, the sale of the commercial building to the lessee will not be the sale of a going concern, but rather the purchase of a capital asset. GST will be pay- able. Bad Debts and GST Section 26 - Bad Debts: A taxpayer wished to know the legal process for han- dling the writing off of bad debts and the treatment of recoveries, for GST pur- poses. Section 26(1) provides that where a registered person has: • made a taxable supply for consideration in money; and • furnished a relevant return and properly accounted for output tax on the supply; and • written off as a bad debt all or part of the consideration not paid to that person, the registered person may deduct the GST charged on the amount that has been written off. Note that if only a proportion of a supply is written off as a bad debt, the registered person can only claim back the same proportion of the GST on the supply. The debt must be identifiable as relating to a specific debtor, and all reasonable efforts to collect the debt must have been made. No deduction is allowed for a percentage of debtors as a provision for doubtful debts. Where a registered person subsequently recovers all of the bad debt, the amount of GST deducted under section 26(1) must be repaid to Inland Revenue. Where only a part of the debt is recovered, there will need to be a pro-rata adjustment. Interest on GST Refund Section 46 - Interest on Refunds: A taxpayer experienced a delay in receiving his GST refund, and wanted to know whether Inland Revenue paid interest on it. Under section 46, Inland Revenue will pay interest where we have received a satisfactory return, but we have not refunded the credit to the registered person within fifteen working days (as defined in the Act) from the day we received the return. Child Support Act 1991 Non-Custodial Parent Living in Australia Section 6 - Parents by Whom Child Support Payable: A custodial parent asked how the Child Support Act applied when her ex-spouse (the non-custodial parent) is living in Australia. When a liable parent is living in Australia, the Child Support Agency is able to assess child support liability for children living in New Zealand if the absent parent is a New Zealand citizen. The assessment would be based on income earned in New Zealand, with a $10 per week minimum liability applying. 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.1 (July 1993) Liable Parent Providing Items for Children Section 29 - Basic Amount of Child Support Payable: A liable parent asked whether extra items that he provided for his children could be taken into ac- count when determining his child support liability. Section 29 provides the formula for determining the amount of child support a liable parent must pay. This section does not take into account the fact that liable parents may provide additional items for their children. Therefore, additional items that a liable parent provides are not considered when determining a child support liability. Extra Details for Earlier Items We've received some questions about items we published in an earlier issue of “Questions We’ve Been Asked” (Volume Four, No.10). We felt that we should publish some the answers to some of those questions. Subdivision of an Orchard The item stated that any profits from the subdivision were assessable under section 67(4)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1976, and that the value of the land at the time of the undertaking or scheme may be used in determining the assessable income. We have been asked whether the item should refer to value at the beginning of the development, or original cost to the owner. The wording of section 67(4)(e) uses the word cost. However, section 67(9A) allows the Commissioner to deter- mine the cost price of land for the purposes of sections 67(4)(a) to (e), if this is necessary. Therefore in situations where a landowning taxpayer subsequently decides to develop land Inland Revenue can determine that the value of the land is higher than the cost price. Tax Treatment of Foreign Teacher's Salary The teacher in this item was a visiting Japanese school teacher. The item should have mentioned that section 61(38) only applies where: • the visiting teacher is not a resident of New Zealand; and • the employer is not resident in New Zealand. If a visiting teacher is present in New Zealand for more than 183 days s/he will be a New Zealand resident under section 241(2) of the Income Tax Act. In this case, the teacher will not qualify for the income tax exemption in section 61(38). A non-resident teacher who is employed by a resident employer (such as a New Zealand school) will not qualify for the income tax exemption under sec- tion 61(38). Article XI of the Japanese double tax agreement\* provides relief for visiting Japanese teachers who teach at a university or similar institution for up to two years. \* Double Taxation Relief (Japan) Order 1963 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.1 (July 1993) Legal Decisions - Case Notes This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

In fact that section was replaced by section 11(2)(ca) from 13 March 1992. Section 11(2)(ca) requires that the services be supplied to a person who is a non- resident at the time the services are supplied. The item also referred to section 60 of the GST Act. For that section to apply there must be a clear agency agreement. 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.1 (July 1993) Tax Status of Reimbursing Allowance paid by Real Estate Principal Rating:•• Case:TRA 92/149 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, section 73 Keywords:“Real estate agents”, “reimbursing allowance” Summary:A reimbursing allowance cannot be tax free unless it has been exempted under section 73. Facts:Before 5 January 1990 the payments a real estate agent received from the Real Estate Licensee for whom he worked were entirely commission. Until that time the agent and his principal had assumed that their relationship was one of independent contractor and client. The Court of Appeal's decision in Challenge Realty v CIR \[1990\] 3 NZLR 58 (given on 19 December 1989) reversed that as- sumption. It held that real estate agents were employees, not independent contractors. The agent and the licensee then entered a written agreement which provided that part of the payments to the agent were reimbursements for expenses and the remainder were commission. The agreement probably took effect from 5 January 1990. Decision:The so-called “reimbursing allowances” could not be tax free to the agent be- cause section 73(5) a reimbursing payment cannot be tax-exempt until the Com- missioner has approved it. Inland Revenue acted correctly in assessing tax on the income that the agent received in the 1990 year for vehicle, stationery and other miscellaneous work expenses. These payments were assessable income, not tax free reimbursing allowances. Comment:The taxpayer has lodged appeal against this decision. Penal Tax charged for Failure to Account for PAYE Rating:• Case:TRA 92/108 and 92/109 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, Sections 369 and 423 Keywords:“Penal tax” Summary:The taxpayers objected to the imposition of penal tax of 150%. Facts:A husband and wife partnership that employed staff failed repeatedly over a number of years to account to Inland Revenue for PAYE deductions. Penal tax of $9,300 was imposed (150%). Decision:The right to impose penal tax was upheld. The penal tax reduced to 22% of the deficient tax. Comment:Inland Revenue is not appealing this case. 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.1 (July 1993) Input Tax cannot be claimed on Barrister's Fee Rating:•• Case:TRA 92/131 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, sections 2, 6, 8 and 20(3) Keywords:“Input tax”, “taxable activity” Summary:The objector was not entitled to an input tax credit on its barrister’s fee for de- fending the objector against a prosecution for offences under the GST Act. The inputs were not incurred for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Facts:The objector was a property developer who was placed in liquidation by a debenture holder in 1989. The receiver discovered that the only prospect of any recovery for the debenture holder was a disputed GST refund. The objector was prosecuted and convicted for offences under the GST Act. The issue was whether the objector acquired the barrister’s services for the principal purpose of making its taxable supplies. Inland Revenue argued that the barrister’s fee was incurred defending the objector against prosecution for false declarations in a GST return, and that the objector was engaged in criminal activities which could not be said to be its taxable activities. Decision:Judge Barber held that the barrister’s fee was not incurred to make taxable supplies. The fee could not be related back to some activity which was prior to the service provided by the barrister. Comment:The taxpayer has not appealed this decision. Supply of On-Site Accommodation not a Fringe Benefit Rating:• Case:TRA 93/24 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, sections 336N(1), 336N(1)(e) and 340(2) Keywords:“Benefit”, “fringe benefit tax” Summary:This case concerns whether a caravan provided by an employer is a fringe ben- efit which is subject to FBT. The TRA concluded that the caravan was not a benefit but a burden, and that no fringe benefit tax was payable. Facts:The objector has a contract with a local authority to run a motor camp. The authority employs a manager who is responsible for the day to day running of the camp. The manager needs to be on call 24 hours a day. The objector requires the manager to live at the camp in a caravan which is situated alongside the motor camp’s office. The wages paid to the manager would remain the same whether she stayed in the caravan or in some other dwelling near the site. Decision:Judge Willy found that the provision of the caravan to the employee was not a benefit. The Judge considered the requirement to stay on the camping site to be a burden that the employee must assume if she wished to obtain employment with the local authority. The objector received no fringe benefit within the provi- sions of the Income Tax Act 1976, so no FBT was payable. Comment:Inland Revenue is not appealing this decision. 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.1 (July 1993) Which Document is an “Invoice” for Imported Goods Rating:•• Case:Shell NZ Holding Company Ltd v. CIR, AP 259/90 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, sections 12 and 20 Keywords:“Invoice”, “tax invoice”, “import entry”, “deferred duty statement” Summary:A deferred duty statement constitutes an “invoice” under the section 2 definition for importing purposes. An import entry notice does not constitute an “invoice”. Facts:This case was an appeal from Judge Keane's decision in TRA 88/92 (reported as L83 1989 11 NZTC 1477). The objector company accounted for GST on the in- voice basis. For customs purposes and for the importation of goods, the objector operated under the deferred payment scheme. It used the import entry notice as the instrument to trigger off the claim for input tax credits under section 20(3)(a)(ii). Inland Revenue contended that the import entry notice was not an invoice because it was not “a document notifying an obligation to make pay- ment” - rather it was the deferred payment statement which served notice on the importer to make payment that was the “invoice”. Decision:The High Court upheld the TRA’s decision, concluding that the deferred duty statement was the invoice. Judge Heron said that a realistic implementation of the GST law was to be preferred and that the true function of the deferred duty statement was to crystallise the importer’s GST obligations. The import entry notice merely confirmed importation and indicated the levels of duty and GST applicable. It did not crystallise the GST liability. Comment:The taxpayer has appealed this decision to the Court of Appeal. Supply for GST purposes between Parent and Subsidiary Companies Rating:••••• Case:Case Q34 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,159, TRA No. 93/11 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, section 5 Keyword:“Supply” Summary:This case concerned whether the objector had made supplies to subsidiaries. The Taxation Review Authority found that the objector could not discharge the burden of proof and decided the case in the Commissioner’s favour. The Taxa- tion Review Authority concluded that Income Tax cases on the same facts were not decisive for GST cases. Facts:This case concerns complex intercompany transactions between a parent com- pany and its subsidiaries. The facts of this case are identical with those in TRA Cases M104 and M109. In these cases, the TRA concluded that the payments between the companies were in the form of dividends. The objector is a parent company of many subsidiary companies. The sharehold- ers of the objector hold the shares on trust for Mr. and Mrs. M. The objector purchased shares in a subsidiary company QP Ltd with funds borrowed from Mr. and Mrs. M. The objector has a management contract with CM partnership to supply man- agement services to QP Ltd. The objector pays 5% of its income for these man- agement services. The objector pays the remainder of the income to the unpaid vendors of QP Ltd and to its shareholders, who ultimately pass the funds on to Mr. and Mrs. M. 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.1 (July 1993) The objector submitted that they had never supplied goods or services to their subsidiary companies, but merely arranged for the CM Partnership to supply those services. The objector sought to rely upon the findings in Cases M104 and M109 that the payments were dividends. Decision:Judge Willy held that the objector could not discharge the burden of proof to establish that the objector had made no supply of goods or services to QP Ltd. This was due to the inconsistency between the documents presented to the TRA, the witness’ evidence in the present hearing and the witness’ evidence in the Income Tax cases. Judge Willy concluded that even if the CM partnership had been the agent of the objector, section 60 of the GST Act would deem the objector to have made the supplies. The Taxation Review Authority’s earlier Income Tax decisions were not decisive for this case and the payments made by the subsidiary companies were not in the nature of dividends. Comment:The taxpayer is appealing this decision. Deductibility of Interest, and Value for Depreciation Purposes Case:TRA 92/9 and 93/23 Rating:•• Act:Income Tax Act 1976, sections 104, 106(1)(h)(i), 108 and 111. Keywords:“deductibility of interest” , “direct use of capital”, “cost price” Summary:The decision in this case confirms that the deductibility of interest relates to the use to which the borrowed capital is put. Further, that depreciation is calculated on the cost price of an asset rather than the market value at the time the asset was first used for producing assessable income. Facts:On moving from Wellington to Auckland the taxpayer and spouse decided to let their Wellington home. They purchased an apartment in Auckland using bor- rowings secured over the Wellington property. Later they purchased a second home in Auckland and let the apartment. The capital used to purchase the second home was partly secured over the apartment. Some of the money raised at that time was used to purchases shares in a property owning company and to deposit funds in an interest free current account in the same company. The objector claimed interest on most of the money borrowed including that used to purchase private residences. The taxpayer also claimed depreciation on the properties based on the market value at the time of first letting. Decision:The Authority confirmed the deductibility rules relating to interest. “... the deductibility of interest flows from the use of the capital on which the interest is being paid, Pacific Rendezvous Ltd. v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,146: interest incurred on capital put to private use is not deductible; interest incurred on capital used to acquire rental property is deductible. This meant the interest on the money used to purchase company shares from which dividends would flow was allowed as a deduction, but that relating to the interest free deposit was denied. The TRA also confirmed that depreciation must be based on the cost price of the rented properties, not the market value at the time of first letting. Comment:Inland Revenue is not appealing this decision. 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.1 (July 1993) Finance Company's Gains on Government Stock - Business Gain or Windfall Income? Rating:• Case:AA Finance Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue Act:Income Tax Act 1976, sections 33, 65(2) Keywords:“Gains derived from business”, “windfall gains” Summary:This issue in this case is whether gains were capital or revenue in nature. The taxpayer was required by law to hold Government Stock and considered that the gains did not arise from its business. Inland Revenue considered that the gains arose from the taxpayer’s business. Facts:AA Finance Ltd (AAF) operates as a finance company borrowing from the public and lending primarily to fund purchases of motor vehicles. As a finance company, AAF is required by law to hold Government Stock. The amount of Government Stock it had to hold varied, but was always stated in terms of face value. This is a condition of its entitlement to carry on business as a finance company. Often the Government Stock was bought at a discount. On maturity or sale stock bought at a discount was realised at a gain. The taxpayer treated the gains made from selling stock as windfall capital gains. In the income years 1984 to 1987 AAF sold considerable stock at a gain. Inland Revenue argued that the gains arose from AAF’s business as a finance company and were assessable under section 65(2)(a) as business profits. It was argued that as the taxpayer carried on the business of borrowing and lending money, the Government Stock was effectively trading stock. This would mean any gains or losses arising from the disposition of the stock were revenue in nature. The taxpayer’s argument was that the gains were windfall. AAF held the stock only to comply with regulatory requirements so that it could conduct its busi- ness, and not as part of that business. The gains were merely incidental to its business activities. Decision:The High Court decided that the gains were income derived from business. Comments:The situation in this case would now be covered by the accrual rules (sections 64B - 64M). Those rules render any gains from holding financial arrangements assessable under section 65(2)(jb). We do not know whether the taxpayer will appeal the decision. 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.1 (July 1993) Correction - Releasing Official Information about Taxpayers On page 1 of TIB Volume Four, No.11 (June†1993), there was an article dealing with releasing Official Information about taxpayers. In this article we said that ìWe have consulted with the Ombudsman, and between us we've agreed that it is vital that Inland Revenue does not release information we receive in confidence,...î The Chief Ombudsman has pointed out that this statement reflects the general approach to release of informants' identities, but the rationale is not because the information is received in confidence. The reason is that releasing such information could well prejudice Inland Revenue's ability to detect revenue offences. Where such factors are not involved in a particular case, the Ombudsman might form the opinion that the information ought not to be withheld and might recom- mend that it be released. However, the sections in the previous article about confidentiality, defamation, illegal activities and safety still stand. Inland Revenue will not release any informa- tion if doing so would contravene any of these factors.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) Upcoming Legislation - Taxation Reform Bill No.7 This article sets out the main points in the Taxation Reform Bill (No.7), which was introduced into Parlia- ment on 5†August 1993. This Bill has passed its first reading, and been referred to the Finance and Expendi- ture Select Committee for consideration. Please note that this Bill has not yet been passed by Parliament, so the following information is not law. Tax rates for foreign investors eased Non-resident portfolio investors who have less than a 10% holding in a New Zealand company will no longer have their income taxed twice. The underlying company tax will be credited, so total tax on most dividends paid to these investors will be 33% (the same as for New Zealand investors). This will apply to dividends paid after the Bill is enacted. Underlying foreign tax credits introduced The Bill introduces a new regime that will allow New Zealand taxpayers to claim a credit against their Foreign Dividend Withholding Payments for tax that the overseas company has paid. This will apply to dividends received after the Bill is enacted. The Bill also makes several technical and remedial amendments to the CFC, FIF and BETA regimes. Offshore reinsurance premiums now deductible From 1 July 1993 New Zealand insurance companies will be able to claim a deduction for reinsurance premiums that they pay offshore. Claims received on these contracts will be assessable from that date. New Zealand insurance companies will also have to return their offshore insurance income for New Zealand tax purposes, and reinsurance premiums paid to overseas insurance companies will be subject to a 3.8% tax. FBT uniform exemption extended ìDistinctiveî uniforms provided to employees by an employer will be exempt from FBT in many circum- stances, not just when they are worn on the employer's premises. This exemption will apply from the date the Bill is enacted. Overseas FBT to be deductible From 1†April 1994 any fringe benefit tax paid overseas will be deductible for New Zealand income tax pur- poses. GST records for secondhand goods From the date the Bill is enacted, GST-registered people will not have to hold a tax invoice for second hand goods they purchase up to the value of $50. This limit was previously $20. Bailed livestock transition eased The provisions applying to livestock bailments will be amended to ease the transition of bailors to the new livestock valuation regime, and to generally make the treatment of bailments more flexible. These changes will apply from 1†April 1992. Forestry tax loophole closed In June the Government announced that it would close a loophole that might allow forestry companies to avoid tax on the sale of forests. Once the Bill is passed, any dispositions of timber or timber rights by methods other than selling them will be treated as sales at market value for tax purposes. Buyers will be able to claim the cost of buying the timber when they harvest it, or the cost of the rights when they sell them. The rules for timber dispositions will apply from 24†June 1993 (the date of the Government's original announcement), and the rules for dispositions of timber rights will apply from 5†August 1993 (the date the Bill was introduced). Double deduction loophole closed The bill closes another loophole that allowed certain corporate groups to claim deductions for debt and share losses. It also rewrites the bad debts provisions so that deductions for bad debts arising from financial instru- ments can only be claimed under the accrual rules. ...and the telly loophole The Bill also closes the loophole in section 222E of the Income Tax Act that allowed deductions for leased assets (such as domestic television sets) that are not used for business purposes. This amendment is back- dated to 1982, but it won't apply to lease payments already claimed in returns filed with Inland Revenue before 5†August 1993. Hire purchase assignments clarified The bill amends the hire purchase legislation which was enacted earlier this year, to clarify the treatment of transfers of hire purchase agreements where legal title in the asset changes hands. These amendments will apply to hire purchase agreements entered into on or after 1†April 1993 (the date the hire purchase regime came into effect). continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) grouped in a year following the year they are incurred. Insurance companies that do not issue shares will be exempted from measuring shareholder interests, as a result of an amendment to the definition of special corporate entity. Miscellaneous amendments ï The Bill corrects minor drafting errors in the depre- ciation and petroleum mining regimes. ï It clarifies that entities listed in section 197A to 197J that were exempt from tax at the time they acquired assets cannot claim first-year depreciation. ï PAYE and ACC deductions can be collected and recovered as one sum. ï Section 353(5A) is being amended to reflect the recent grouping provision requirements. ï A mineral mining company may form a consolidated group only with other mineral mining companies. ï From 26 April 1993 the dividend definition will be amended to include benefits passed by a company to associate companies ï Investment income earned by National Provident's Pension National and Lump Sum National superan- nuation schemes will no longer be double taxed. ï From 1†July 1993 superannuation funds that lend to or invest in another superannuation fund cannot avoid tax on interest. ï Airport, port and energy companies are included in the local authority trading enterprise definition for purposes of the wholly-owned group intercorporate dividend exemption. ï Crown Health Enterprises are added to the list of companies that are prohibited from maintaining imputation credit accounts. ï The gift duty exemption applying to Court-ordered matrimonial property transfers will be limited to transfers of matrimonial property between spouses. ï The Ministry of Transport will return GST on motor vehicle registration fees from 1†April 1994. ï Social Welfare will be exempted from the requirement to make student loan repayment deductions from income-tested benefits until 31†March 1994. ï The unmarried specified exemption rate will be used to calculate surcharge liability where the spouse of someone receiving means-tested residential care disability services is paid the unmarried rate of National Superannuation. from page 1 Test case procedure introduced The bill establishes a procedure for hearing tax objec- tions where there are several cases with a similar point in dispute between taxpayers and Inland Revenue. Test cases will be able to be advanced urgently, and similar cases deferred until the test case's outcome is known. This will apply from the date the Bill becomes law. Case stated procedures amended Taxpayers will have to take a more active role in preparing for their cases stated. They will have to describe in writing the specifics upon which their case is based, before the case is filed. This document will then become part of the Court record. This amendment will apply from 1†January 1994 for TRA cases, and from 1†April 1994 for High Court cases. Family Support increases The Bill gives effect to the increased Family Support rates announced on Budget night, which apply from 1†October 1993. As well, 1994/95 Family Support applications must be accompanied by birth certificates or other documentation to prove children's existence. More IRD/DSW information sharing Inland Revenue will be able to supply information we hold about Family Support recipients to Social Welfare, to identify taxpayers who are receiving double pay- ments. Where a double payment is identified the recipient will be notified as required by the Privacy Act, and if s/he does not provide a good explanation Inland Revenue can stop payment. Inland Revenue can also supply Social Welfare with information to help them recover debts from liable parents and past beneficiaries. The information we can supply is the person's last known address and the address of his/her employer. These amendments will apply from the date the Bill becomes law. Business tax changes The Bill contains a number of taxpayer-friendly amend- ments to the business tax rules. It removes the potential for double taxation of remitted debts under the loss carry-forward rules by ensuring that losses will not be reduced by any remitted debt that is taxed as a dividend. More than one method of accounting for financial instruments will be allowed. Part-year losses may be 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) Depreciation Determinations - Fees and Procedures Introduction The Income Tax (Depreciation Determinations) Regula- tions 1993 were made recently, and came into force on 5†August 1993. These regulations set out the procedures and the fees chargeable where a person asks Inland Revenue to make a determination under the new depreciation regime. Background Under the new depreciation regime (contained in sections 107A to 108M of the Income Tax Act 1976) taxpayers can request the following depreciation determinations: (a) A determination by the Commissioner under section 108I, to allow a taxpayer to claim a special or provisional economic depreciation rate for any depreciable property. (b) A determination by the Commissioner under section 108J(6), to allow a greater than normal maximum pooling value for any depreciable asset. (c) A determination by the Commissioner under section 108K, to allow a taxpayer to deduct the remaining tax value of any depreciable property. The regulations set out the procedures to follow and fees payable when a taxpayer makes such an application. Procedures To apply for a determination, a taxpayer must use the approved form, and send in any other necessary infor- mation. The approved forms are: ï IR†260A - Application for a provisional rate of depreciation ï IR†260B - Application for a special rate of depreciation ï IR†260C - Application for a higher maximum pooling value ï IR†260D - Application for a deduction for an obsolete asset. For applications for a special or provisional depreciation rate, or for a higher maximum pooling level, Inland Revenue must prepare a draft determination and send it to the applicant. At the same time, we will set a date by which the applicant must notify us if s/he wants to hold a conference to discuss the determination. This date must be at least ten working days after the draft deter- mination is sent to the applicant. If the applicant wishes to hold a conference, or if we decide to hold such a conference, we will set a time, date and place for the conference, and notify the appli- cant accordingly. Once the conference has been held, or at the end of the allowable time for calling a conference, Inland Revenue can proceed to finalise the determination arising from an application. Fees For all determination applications except applications for a provisional depreciation rate, there are some fees that the applicant must pay. These fees are: (a) An initial fee of $50, due when the application is lodged (b) A processing fee of $30 per hour for every hour (or part-hour) after the first two hours that Inland Revenue spends processing the application (c) a reimbursement fee where Inland Revenue engages consultants to advise on the estimated useful life or estimated residual value of the property covered by the application. This fee will be the amount that Inland Revenue pays the consultants, limited to a maximum of $300. (d) an additional reimbursement fee if the applicant requests a conference and Inland Revenue's consult- ant attends the conference, or if the applicant asks that Inland Revenue's consultant undertakes further work. The amount of this fee will be the amount that Inland Revenue pays the consultant (this is not limited to $300). However, Inland Revenue will advise the applicant of the likely fees before engag- ing the consultant for further work, so the applicant can decide whether or not to continue with the application. Before Inland Revenue engages a consultant, we will take into account the information that the applicant provides. We will not unreasonably require a consult- ant's advice if the information already provided by the applicant is sufficient to work out an appropriate depreciation rate. An applicant who withdraws an application is still liable for all processing or consultation fees incurred up until the date Inland Revenue is advised of the with- drawal. In exceptional circumstances, Inland Revenue may waive all or some of any fees payable by the applicant. National Standard Costs for Livestock The Appendix to this Tax Information Bulletin contains the determination of 1993 livestock National Standard Costs, and some examples of how to use these. There are also a number of other livestock-related matters covered in it, including the livestock information from TIB Volume Five, No.1. We've repeated this last section so all the livestock information appears in one place. 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) Questions We’ve Been Asked This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that we've received. We've published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received.

Any individual person’s employment status will be determined by referring to his/her individual contract of employment, and on the facts of each particular case. This is especially relevant in situations where the contract concerned pro- vides for the terms to be negotiated, as this could result in a variation between contracts within the same profession. In this particular case the contract indicated that the locum was self-employed rather than an employee. The following features of her contract supported this: • the specified period of the contract • her ability to schedule her own work and hours • she was responsible for her own professional liability, loss of profits, health insurance and ACC levies • she could advertise/promote her own work • there was no holiday/severance pay, etc • there was no guarantee of work/earnings Tax Code for Student Allowance Section 50C - Transitional tax Allowance: A student asked why she could not use the transitional tax code “T” for the student allowance she receives while at University. She did not have any other earnings while she received the student allowance. The “T” tax code is available to any taxpayer who is a “Qualifying person” for the purposes of the Income Under $9,880 Rebate (Transitional Tax allowance). To meet this criteria a taxpayer must be a “Full-time earner”, which means s/he must be engaged in remunerative work for 20 or more hours in any particular week. Study does not meet the definition of “remunerative work” in section 50C(1). The student in this case is not entitled to claim the rebate. She could not use the “T” tax code unless she was engaged in remunerative work, and earned $190 or less per week - $9,880 per year (including the student allowance). Low Income Rebate for Visitor to New Zealand Section 56 - Rebates for Absentees: An overseas visitor had worked for 12 weeks of the five months she spent in New Zealand. She asked why her low income rebate was calculated on an increased assessable income figure, and why the rebate calculated was then reduced. Section 50D allows a rebate where a taxpayer's income for the year is less than $9,500. If a taxpayer either arrives in or leaves New Zealand in the income year, and s/he was a non-resident for New Zealand income tax purposes before arriving in New Zealand, section 50D(2) applies. Under this section, the taxpay- continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) er’s assessable income is multiplied by the number of days in the income year, and divided by the number of days s/he was personally present in New Zea- land. The rebate is then calculated on this grossed up amount. Section 56 applies to the low income rebate of an absentee (defined in section 37 as a person who is not a resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year). Under section 56(1) an absentee's low income rebate must be reduced in proportion to the number of weeks s/he was actually working (if paid for regu- lar pay periods), otherwise in proportion to the number of days of work that s/he was paid. Under section 241 the taxpayer in this case was not a resident of New Zealand at any time during the income year. This means that both section 50D(2) and section 56(1) applied to her rebate. This example shows how to calculate the rebate when both of these sections apply: A taxpayer was in New Zealand for 150 days, and earned $6,000 during 12 weeks of paid employment. Step 1 - Section 50D(2) calculation - grossing up the income: $6,000 x 365 / 150 = $14,600 (grossed-up income) Step 2 - Rebate calculation \[s.50D (2)\] (calculating the abatement) Grossed up income$14,600 Less $ 9,500 $ 5,100 x 0.04 = $204.00 (abatement) Step 3 - Calculating the rebate Maximum rebate$855.00 Less abatement $204.00 $651.00 (rebate on grossed-up income) Step 4 - Section 56(1) calculation $651.00 x 12 / 52 = $54.25 Rebate Payments to Clergy Employed by Church Section 61(54) - Income of Religious Workers Exempt Where No Monetary Remuneration Received: A church administrator asked whether payments made to their clergy by way of reimbursements for accommodation costs (in- cluding mortgage payments, house insurance, rates and power charges, plus small payments to help with personal living costs) are exempt from income tax. Unmarried clergy who receive no remuneration from their church - but who have the cost of all their necessities paid by the church - are exempt from income tax under section 61(54). A further requirement for the tax exemption is that the conditions of service of the clergy are such that no monetary remuneration or other rewards are payable by the church. In this case the clergy receive more than that allowed by section 61(54). They either have full accommodation costs paid for, or the expenses of maintaining their homes are met. In addition the clergy of this church receive a monthly stipend to cover personal living costs. The Commissioner has no discretion to extend section 61(54) to cover these types of payments. Therefore, the income that these clergy receive from the church will be assessable for income tax from page 5 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) purposes. Overpayments Made to Growers by the Kiwifruit Marketing Board Section 65 - Items Included in Assessable Income: A kiwifruit orchardist asked how overpayments made by the Kiwifruit Marketing Board in the 1993 income year are to be treated for taxation purposes. Under section 65(2)(a) payments made to growers during the 1993 income year are assessable in their hands in that year, as they form part of the growers' business income in that year. Under section 104 any repayments will only be deductible for tax purposes in the year they are repaid or deducted from pay- ments to growers by the Board. One way of lessening the tax consequences of the expected reduction in 1994 and future years' income is to use the income equalisation scheme provided for in sections 175 to 185. This scheme is designed to level out the year-to-year fluctuations in primary sector incomes. Growers could make deposits in the 1993 income year and deduct them from that year's assessable income. Refunds from the scheme are assessable in the year the taxpayer withdraws them. This way, those growers with high 1993 incomes can transfer the assessability of all or part of that income to 1994 and up to four future years. Builders - Accounting for Unimproved Land at Balance Date Section 67 - Profits or Gains from Land Transactions: A builder purchased land on which to erect dwellings for subsequent sale. He asked whether a block of land on which he has not yet made any improvements should be taken into account as trading stock at the end of the income year. Under section 67(4)(c) a builder is assessable on all profits or gains from selling property after making improvements to it. However, the unsold land is not brought into account as trading stock at balance date because section 85(1)(e) specifically excludes land from the definition of “trading stock” used in that section. Therefore, the builder does not account for the land for tax purposes until it has been sold or disposed of. Sale of Land after District Plan amended Section 67(4)(d) - Land Sales Where Re-Zoning Changes Exist: A kiwifruit orchardist asked whether the profit on land sold as a result of a change in a District Council’s District Scheme would be assessable for income tax purposes. The changes give an automatic right, for properties in excess of four hectares to create one extra title, and properties in excess of twelve hectares to create two additional titles. Generally, section 67(4)(d) provides that any profit arising from the alteration of an operative District Plan, or any other change to the classification of land (such as the removal of a restriction or covenant) will be treated as assessable income. To be taxable under this section the land must be held by the vendor for less than 10 years and the Commissioner must be satisfied that at least 20% of the profits arose through the reclassification of the land. However, section 67(6) exempts from tax any such profit if it arose from land that the taxpayer acquired for the purpose of carrying on a farming or agricul- continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) tural business, and if the taxpayer sold the land to a person who would continue to use it for carrying on a farming or agricultural business. In this case the extra title created and sold was not of sufficient area to realisti- cally expect the purchasers to continue a farming or agricultural “business” of an economic kiwifruit orchard. The profit on the sale of the title was assessable to the vendor. Reimbursement of Travel Costs from Home to Work Section 73 - Power to Exempt Employees’ Allowances: An employer paid a reimbursement allowance to one of his employees for travel by private car between the employee’s home and the employer’s premises. The employer asked if this allowance was taxable in the hands of the employee. Travelling expenses were part of the employee's contract, but the employee worked normal hours and the travel was from one side of the city to the other, so sufficient public transport was available. It is an established principle that the cost of travel between home and work in normal circumstances is a private expense, and that any reimbursement of private expenditure is taxable to the employee. However, section 73 allows the Commissioner to exempt from income tax any allowance paid to an employee to cover “... additional transport costs incurred by that employee in travelling between his home and his place of work ... where those additional transport costs were attributed to the following factors”. • The time of day the employee is required to perform the duties of employ- ment. • The carriage of any plant, machinery etc. for use in that employment. • The fulfilling of any obligation under any Act. • The temporary change in the work place of the employee. • Any other condition of work of the employee. • The absence of a public passenger transport system serving the place of work. This case does not meet the requirements of the legislation. The taxpayer is only travelling in normal circumstances, and is not incurring any additional transport costs as a result of any of the factors set out above. The reimbursement allow- ance that the employer pays will be taxable in the hands of the employee. Damages Caused by Dog Section 104 - Expenditure or Loss Incurred in Production of Assessable In- come: A farmer asked whether a compensation payment he made for damages caused by one of his dogs is deductible. The dog had attacked and killed a number of sheep in the farmer’s district. Section 104 allows a deduction for expenditure incurred in gaining or producing assessable income, or necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for that purpose. Where a dog which causes damage is a dog used in the production of assessable income (i.e., a working dog), a deduction is allowable for any expense incurred in respect of that dog. However, where the dog is not a working dog, section 106(1)(j) prohibits a deduction, as the expenditure will be considered of a private nature. from page 7 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) In this case a deduction was not allowable as the dog was kept for hunting, which was a hobby of the farmer. Deduction of Legal Expenses in regards to Loss of Capital Section 104 - Expenditure or Loss Incurred in Production of Assessable In- come: A taxpayer asked whether he could deduct legal expenses that he in- curred in attempting to recover a loss of privately-invested savings. For an expense to be deductible under section 104 it must be either incurred in the production of assessable income, or incurred in carrying on a business for that purpose. In this case the taxpayer is not in the business of advancing money, so the costs incurred in attempting to recover a capital asset (the savings) are not tax deduct- ible under section 106(1)(a). They have not been incurred in the production of income. Educational Seminars Section 104 - Expenditure or Loss Incurred in Production of Assessable In- come: An agent, acting on behalf of a group of doctors wishing to attend an overseas seminar, requested approval for travel and accommodation expenses to be deductible for those doctors who were self-employed. Approval was given for the following expenses to be deductible from the doctors’ assessable income: 1. A doctor who travels to a destination alone and specifically for viewing the course material is entitled to a deduction for the full costs of travel, course expenses and accommodation costs. 2. Where the doctors are accompanied by their families the participants would be entitled to deduct the cost of their own air fares, course expenses and the costs of a single room only rate of accommodation. 3. A doctor going alone but combining course attendance with some leisure activities is eligible for a deduction to the extent of the cost of air fares, course fees and accommodation for the days attending the course only. 4. A doctor travelling with family who combines course attendance with some leisure activities will be eligible for a deduction to the extent of the doctor’s own air fares, course fees and accommodation for the days attending the course only. 5. If the doctor travels to more than one venue then the same rules apply. Cost of Parking Space Section 104 - Expenditure or Loss Incurred in Production of Assessable In- come: A self-employed business consultant asked whether he could deduct the cost of leasing parking space next to his office, for his car used for business during the day. The consultant is regularly called out during the day to other businesses to give advice, and usually uses his car for the travelling involved. Section 104 allows a deduction for expenses incurred in the production of assess- able income, or necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for that purpose. In this case the taxpayer is allowed a deduction for the cost of leasing parking space as the expense is necessary to allow him to effectively operate his busi- ness. 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) If a car is used extensively for business purposes a deduction will be allowed for the cost of using a parking space. However, where a taxpayer is merely using a car as a matter of convenience for travel between home and place of business, the expenditure is of a private nature and not deductible. If the taxpayer was an employee, no deduction would be permitted from employment income. Private Living Area in Hotel Section 106(1)(j) - Expenditure or Loss of Private Nature: A publican asked whether he had to take into account that he lived on his hotel premises, when deducting expenditure incurred in providing hotel premises on which he oper- ated his business. Section 104(b) allows a deduction for expenditure incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income. However, section 106(1)(j) prohibits a deduction for expenditure incurred which is of a private or domestic nature. The provision of the hotelier’s private quarters is considered private expenditure, and therefore is not deductible in terms of this section. The following formula is used to establish the amount of expenditure which is not deductible in these circumstances: a / b - x c x 50%(The 50% is set by Inland Revenue to recognise the private business use of the premises) where - a = Area of the hotel used for hotelier’s private quarters. b = The total area of the hotel. c = Total expenditure on - • interest or rent • rates • power • telephone rental • insurance • “other costs” The other costs are any other expenses not solely attributable to the hotelier or to the business. Accordingly, the hotelier is entitled to deduct expenses incurred in providing the establishment on which to run his business, but he must make an adjustment to those expenses for private expenditure, calculated using the above formula. In some circumstances the formula will arrive at an unfair result. If this happens taxpayers should contact their local Inland Revenue Office. For further informa- tion on this topic see Tax Information Bulletin No. 4, October 1989. Tax Treatment of Royal Navy Pension Section 336D - Determination of “Other Income”: A New Zealand resident national superannuitant asked what percentage of his British Royal Navy pen- sion he should include when calculating his national super surcharge. Pensions and annuities paid from funds that are subject to New Zealand tax 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) rules are non-assessable (i.e. free of taxation), and only 50% of such a pension is included when calculating surcharge. Overseas superannuation payments are fully taxable in the recipient’s hands and count fully for surcharge calculation purposes. Foreign schemes are still taxed under the old regime because the New Zealand Government does not have the ability to impose our superannuation tax regime on other countries. Foreign countries typically provide tax concessions for contri- butions to superannuation schemes, and for earnings of superannuation funds, but tax the pensions when paid out. Since we cannot tax the investment income, (as we do with New Zealand superannuation schemes), earned on the pension- er’s behalf by the overseas scheme, it is not appropriate to allow the pension payments to be free of tax in New Zealand or to exempt part of the pension from the surcharge. FBT on Employer-paid Child Care Section 336N - Interpretation: An employer asked about the Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) implications of either paying childcare agencies directly for the childcare of employee’s children, or of reimbursing employees for the cost of the childcare. Section 336N(1) of the Act defines “fringe benefit” to include “any benefit of any other kind whatever, received or enjoyed by the employee.” Where an employer pays or has a liability to pay for the childcare provided to an employee’s chil- dren, the employer must pay FBT on that benefit. Where the cost of the childcare is paid to the employee by way of reimbursement, the amount of the reimburse- ment will be taxable in the hands of the employee, so the employer must deduct PAYE from the reimbursement. Where childcare facilities are provided by an employer on the employer’s premises, the value of that childcare is not taxable to the employee, neither is FBT payable by the employer. The provision of the facility by the employer does not come within the definition of “monetary remuneration” so it is not taxable to the employee. Section 336N(1)(n) specifically exempts from fringe benefit tax any benefit supplied to the employee on the employer’s premises. Calculating FBT where Vehicle used Privately less than when Available Section 336O - Value of Fringe Benefit: An accountant acting on behalf of an employer asked whether the Commissioner could exercise any discretion to calculate the employer’s FBT liability on the actual number of days the employ- er’s motor car was used privately by the employee, rather than the number of days the motor car was available for private use. Under section 336O(1) the value of any fringe benefit of a motor vehicle pro- vided to an employee is calculated based on the number of days of “... private use or enjoyment, or the availability for private use or enjoyment, of a motor vehicle ...”. The Commissioner has no discretion under this section to alter the basis for calculating the fringe benefit provided to an employee. Deducting Withholding Tax from Payments to Actors Section 338 - Tax deductions to be Made by Employers: An actor’s agent asked who was responsible for deducting withholding tax from payments to actors. continued on page 12 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) The payments in question are those made by a film production company to an actor via the actor’s agent. Part B, paragraph 4, of the Schedule to the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 (“withholding payment regulations”) includes as a withhold- ing payment specified payments to resident entertainers, and requires withhold- ing tax to be deducted from these payments at the rate of 20 cents per $1. The person who must deduct and account for the tax deduction is the person who made the specified payment. This is the person to whom the actor rendered services for a “specified activity”. Specified activity is defined in the withholding payment regulations as meaning: “... in relation to any ... resident entertainer, means any activity or performance “ Therefore, where the specified payment relates to the performance of a specified activity, the person who is making that payment is required to deduct withhold- ing tax. In the situation described above, the production company has contracted with the actor for his or her services. The actor may require the payment to be made to his/her agent, but the agent is only acting as an intermediary. The agent is not making the specified payment, nor has the agent engaged the actor’s serv- ices for the purpose of conducting a specified activity. This means the produc- tion company is responsible for deducting withholding tax (at 20 cents per $1) from the actor’s fee. Note: A resident actor must include this income in a tax return each year. A non- resident actor (or other entertainer) has the option of accepting the withholding tax as a “final Tax” or furnishing a return of income claiming expenses. Business Losses and Family Support Section 374B - Determination of Assessable Income: A taxpayer asked how business losses affected the calculation of family support. Business losses are disregarded when calculating assessable income for family support purposes. However, under section 374B(2)(b) where two or more busi- nesses are carried on by the taxpayer and the Commissioner is satisfied the businesses are “of the kind that are normally carried on in association with each other”, such businesses may be deemed to be one business. In effect, this allows a loss to be offset against any profit otherwise derived. Whether or not two businesses can be treated as one depends on whether Inland Revenue is satisfied that the nature of the businesses is such that they are nor- mally carried on in association with each other. This is a subjective matter, and we will determine it a on case by case basis. We cannot give a blanket ruling. An example of two such businesses is a taxpayer who has a motorcycle repair shop which also has a franchise for retailing new bikes. The retail business and the repair business are considered to be associated businesses, so they would be treated as one for family support purposes. Remission of Underestimation Additional Tax after a Legislation Change Section 384 - Additional Tax Where Income Tax Underestimated: An account- ant, acting on behalf of his client, asked whether underestimation additional tax charged on his client’s 1992 residual income tax could be remitted. The addi- tional tax was imposed as a result of the accountant recalculating his client’s from page 11 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) 1992 terminal tax, after filing a new notice of election for changing the method of livestock valuation in the 1992 year. Section 384(3) allows for underestimation additional tax to be remitted where the Commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayer’s residual income tax payable was higher than what was estimated due to - (a) A change to the Act or any regulation relating to income tax on or after the 1st day of the month in which the 3rd instalment of provisional tax is due; or (b) The Commissioner making public a change to a previous ruling on or after the 1st day of the month in which the 3rd instalment of provisional tax is due; or (c) The adoption of an incorrect interpretation of a provision of the Act which was reasonable given the circumstances of the case. In this case the underestimation additional tax was remitted because the election was made after a change to a previously adopted ruling that the Commissioner made. If Inland Revenue is satisfied that the underestimation was due to this change, paragraph (b) of section 384(3) applies. Publication of Tax Offender's Name Section 427 - Publication of Names of Tax Evaders: A taxpayer previously found guilty of failing to properly account for PAYE asked why his name had been published in the Gazette when he had since begun properly handling his tax affairs. Under section 427 the Commissioner has a statutory obligation to list the names and particulars of taxpayers who have been adjudged culpable of any one of a number of offences under the Act. As this taxpayer had committed an offence under section 368(1) the Commissioner had no discretion as to whether his name should be publicised or not. However, there is discretion available to the Commissioner not to publicise the names of culpable taxpayers where a taxpayer has voluntarily disclosed infor- mation as to an offence or evasion, before Inland Revenue begins any investiga- tion or makes an enquiry. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Sale of Recently Purchased Section Section 6 - Meaning of Term “Taxable Activity”: A taxpayer purchased a section of land, then resold it and purchased another section. He asked whether he should have registered for GST, and whether the profit on sale was taxable for income tax purposes. The taxpayer bought the first section for $40,000 with the intention of building a private residence for himself on it, but another more suitable section came on the market later. He resold the original section for $50,000, and bought the more suitable section. Section 51 requires a taxpayer to register for GST where s/he carries on a “tax- able activity” and total supplies of goods or services exceed $30,000 per annum. Section 6(1)(a) defines a taxable activity as: “Any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuniary profit, and involves ... the supply of goods and continued on page 14 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) services”. In this case the activity of buying and selling the section would not constitute a “continuous or regular” activity so the taxpayer should not register for GST. Section 67(4)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1976 includes as assessable income: “All profits or gains derived from the sale or other disposition of any land if the land was acquired for the purpose or intention ... of selling or otherwise dispos- ing of it:” Therefore, any profit that a taxpayer made by purchasing a section with the intention of reselling it will be assessable. In this case the taxpayer is not liable to register for GST, nor is the profit made on reselling of the section assessable for income tax purposes, as the taxpayer’s intention at the time of buying the section was to build a home for himself on it. Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 Gift Duty on Matrimonial Property Transfer Section 75A - Exemption for Certain Dispositions of Matrimonial Property: A taxpayer asked whether any transfer of property made under an agreement under the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 was exempt from gift duty. A “disposition of property” includes “... any conveyance, transfer, assignment, settlement, delivery, payment, or other alienation of property, whether at law or in equity;” If a disposition of matrimonial property is made to one partner under an agree- ment, and the value of all that partner's legal and equitable interests does not exceed 50 percent of the total of the matrimonial property, the disposition shall not constitute a gift. This means no gift duty will be payable. Gaming Duties Act 1991 Gaming Machine Duty payable by Sports Club A sports club asked why they had to pay gaming machine duty on their gam- bling machines. Gaming machine duty is not aimed at individual operators, but it is a duty on the actual activity of gaming. The gaming machine duty is a duty on the amounts bet and lost by players of gaming machines, regardless of where those machines are located or who operates them. All gaming machine operators must collect the duty and return it to Inland Revenue. (All kinds of duties, including those on tobacco, alcohol, and other gaming activities, do not seek to tax suppliers on their income. Individual operators are free to move to lower payout machines to compensate for the effect of the duty on their income level, subject to Internal Affairs restrictions.) Using the income tax system is the best method to collect Gaming Machine Duty from different types of operators. If there are gaming machines being run for a profit and not for charity then such profits are fully taxable. Charitable organisations are exempt from income tax but still have to account for gaming machine duty.

It is therefore a dividend, and assessable income in the hands of the shareholders. Facts:A husband and wife were shareholders in a company which realised a capital gain on the sale of a building. The capital gain was held in a capital reserve account. The minutes of the annual general meeting held in September 1989 recorded that: • the capital reserve of $67,610.00 was distributed to the shareholders ($56,792.40 to his current account, and $10,817.60 to her current account) • the balance sheet and accounts for the year ended 31 March 1989 be adopted. The minutes were signed as correct by the husband as the chairman of the meeting. Judge Willy said that taking the minutes and accounts at face value, clearly the money was transferred from the capital reserve and credited to the current account and loan accounts of the two shareholders, and that the pay- ments are dividends under section 4 of the Act. However the objectors claimed that: • the annual general meeting did not take place as recorded in the minutes, i.e., the meeting lacked a quorum and therefore any resolutions passed were null, • the shareholders did not instruct the accountant to transfer the funds, • on the evidence given by the accountant, the accountant transferred the funds in error, and • the annual general meeting was not held within the time prescribed by the Companies Act. Judge Willy considered each of these arguments and concluded that they failed. Decision:Inland Revenue acted correctly in treating the distributions as dividends. Comment:The taxpayer is not appealing this decision. Charitable Status of the Medical Council of New Zealand Rating:•• Case:TRA 92/131 and 93/39 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, sections 2, 61(2), 61(25) Keywords:“public authority”, “instrument of Executive Government” Summary:The Medical Council of NZ is an instrument of the Executive Government. It is established exclusively for charitable purposes and is not carried on for private pecuniary profit. It is therefore exempt from income tax under sections 61(2) and 61(25) Income Tax Act. Facts:The Medical Council of New Zealand is a statutory body created and governed by the Medical Practitioners Act 1968. Its primary functions are to maintain a 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) formal register of medical practitioners; discipline medical practitioners; oversee the undergraduate and postgraduate education of medical practitioners; identify and rehabilitate impaired medical practitioners; and advise, provide statistical information and administrative services to the Minister of Health as required. The Medical Council argued that they were exempt from income tax under either sec.61(2), as a public authority in terms of the section 2 definition of that term, or section 61(25), being established exclusively for charitable purposes. Inland Revenue contended that they were neither a public authority, nor were they established exclusively for charitable purposes. We submitted that practi- tioners also derived private benefits from the establishment of the Council. Decision:Judge Willy held that the Medical Council exists as an instrument of Executive Government. It ensures that medical services are provided to the public by suitably qualified and registered practitioners, and assists the Minister of Health in the discharge of his public duties. The Authority also held that the Council was established exclusively for charita- ble purposes and that while the Medical Practitioners Act conferred some pri- vate benefits on practitioners, those benefits are no more than incidental to the predominant public benefit of the Council. Because of the specific nature of the objector’s activities, the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974's secrecy requirements concerning the objector’s identity were waived by the parties. Comment:Inland Revenue is appealing this decision. Fringe Benefits, Current Account Balances and Directors' Fees Rating:•• Case:TRA No.92/43 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 sections 6, 336N(2), 336S(1) Keywords:“fringe benefit”, ”employee”, ”source deduction payment” Summary:Judge Willy stated that the fringe benefit legislation took effect from 1 April 1985. He held that payments received before 1 April 1985 were not relevant in determining whether a person was an employee for the purposes of fringe benefit tax. The Judge also held that because a resolution to pay directors' fees did not quantify the amount the directors did not have any entitlement to the fees. Facts:On 1 April 1985 the shareholders in the objector company sold their shares to CM Ltd. After a complex chain of transactions the shares were eventually held on trust by CM Ltd for B Ltd. The former shareholders were appointed as man- agers but also continued as directors. They received directors' fees but no salary. Their current accounts had debit balances, and Inland Revenue treated these as interest-free advances when assessing the company for fringe benefit tax. The objector argued that Inland Revenue had failed to recognise that the directors were owed the outstanding balance for the sale of their shares in the objector company to CM Ltd. Decision:Judge Willy held that the objector company’s current account debit balances could not be set off against the amounts owing by CM Ltd. It was not possible for the sale of shares to an entirely independent third party to be recorded in the current accounts. Judge Willy also held that there was no credit for the unpaid share money which would have been expected if there was an attempted set off. continued on page 18 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) However, he also found that the directors were not employees because they did not receive any source deduction payments. He held that, as fringe benefit tax came into effect on 1 April 1985, payments before that date could not be taken into account for the definition of an “employee”. Nor could a resolution to pay directors' fees entitle the directors to fees if the resolution did not specify the amount of the fees. Comment:Inland Revenue is appealing this decision. Timing of the Deductibility of Warranty Costs Rating:••• Case:Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited (MMNZ) v Commissioner of Inland Revenue HC AP165/92 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, section 104 Keywords:“warranties”, “incurred” Summary:This case reviews the timing of deductibility of the costs of warranty claims on obligations on new car sales from the wholesaler to the retailer. The principal issue resolved was that MMNZ is entitled to deduct the reasonably estimated costs of meeting warranty claims under section 104, for vehicles sold in the particular tax year. Facts:MMNZ argued that as vehicles are supplied subject to warranty with defects inherent in them, it has incurred a liability under the warranty. Inland Revenue argued that until a purchaser of a vehicle brings a claim which complies with the terms of the warranty, MMNZ is under no liability. There is no accrued obliga- tion of any kind before that time. It is therefore a contingent liability. Decision:Under the warranty conditions, MMNZ is “definitively committed” to the war- ranty expenditure at the time of the sale and delivery of the vehicle. The event which gives rise to the contractual warranty liability is the provision of a vehicle containing inherent defects. MMNZ has incurred an expenditure or loss for the warranty liability for the purposes of section 104. Comments:Inland Revenue has not yet decided whether to appeal this decision. Assessability of Payment for Goodwill Rating:•• Case:TRA 92/150 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, section 65(2)(g) Keywords:“goodwill”, “owner of land” Summary:The case concerned whether a payment for goodwill made by a purchaser of a service station to a vendor company could be assessable to the company's major shareholder under section 65(2)(g). The TRA concluded that although there appeared to be an amount of goodwill relating to the land this should be assess- able to the company and not to the shareholder. Facts:The objector owned the land on which a service station business was conducted. The objector also owned all except one of the shares in the company which ran the service station business. The company sold the business for an amount which included $420,000 for goodwill. The objector and the purchasing company from page 17 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) entered into a new lease. Inland Revenue argued that the $420,000 was assess- able under section 65(2)(g), as it included an amount for site goodwill and was assessable to the objector (being the major shareholder of the company and the owner of the land). Decision:Judge Barber found that the payment made was partly for goodwill related to the site and was therefore assessable income. However he found that the vendor company, not the objector, derived the goodwill. The vendor company and the objector were two quite separate legal persons and the company was not the agent or trustee of the objector. Comments:Inland Revenue is not appealing this decision. Deductibility of Cost of an Appeal to the Public Service Appeal Board Rating:• Case:Hindmarsh v. CIR, AP 289/90 Act:Income Tax Act, 1976, section 105 Keywords:“Condition of employment” Summary:In the 1987 income year, the objector claimed a deduction for costs incurred in taking a successful appeal to the Public Service Appeal Board. The High Court ruled in Inland Revenue's favour that the expenditure was not deductible for income tax purposes. Facts:The objector incurred expenditure in taking an appeal to the Public Service Appeal Board. He claimed the expenditure as a deduction against his employ- ment income in the 1987 income year. The question the High Court was asked was whether the expenditure was incurred as a condition of employment (and would therefore qualify for a deduction under section 105 and clause 8 of the Fourth Schedule to the Act). Decision:The High Court recognised that the objector had a right of appeal. This right was part of the terms of the package of employment in general but it was not some- thing that the objector was required to do as a condition of employment. The Court confirmed Inland Revenue’s decision not to allow the costs of the appeal as a deduction. Comments:We do not know whether the taxpayer will appeal this decision. Deductibility of Wages when Employees working on Capital Improvements Rating:••• Case:Christchurch Press Company Ltd v CIR AP.241/91 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, sections 104 and 106(1)(a) Keywords:“Capital expenditure” Summary:Wages paid to employees who are engaged in making capital improvements cannot be claimed as a deduction under section 104. Facts:The taxpayer used its own employees rather than outside contractors to install new plant and to undertake a renovation and repair programme. The employees were engaged in capital works which were not part of the taxpayer’s income earning activity. Inland Revenue disallowed a deduction claimed under section continued on page 20 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) from page 19 104 as the wages were not an expense incurred in producing assessable income. Decision:The Judge confirmed that the wages paid were capital in nature. However, an apportionment may be required between capital and revenue expenditure as a dual purpose may be attributable to some of the wages. Comment:We do not know whether the taxpayer will appeal this decision. Sale of Orchard - a Going Concern? Rating:•• Case:TRA 93/55 Q47 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,234 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, sections 8 and 11 Keywords:“Going concern” “taxable activity” Summary:The taxpayers sold a kiwifruit orchard and claimed that it was a sale of a going concern. Inland Revenue argued that the taxpayers had sold the property rather than a business, so there was no sale of a going concern. The Taxation Review Authority found in favour of the taxpayers. Facts:The taxpayers sold a kiwifruit orchard. The orchard had five- to six-year old vines planted. It had shelter belts, pergolas, strainers, and irrigation. In the 1990 season the orchard produced 400 trays of fruit and the forecast for the forthcom- ing season was for 2,500 to 3,000 trays of fruit. The Agreement for Sale and Purchase of the orchard was in the form of a stand- ard agreement for the sale and purchase of real estate. The purchaser had not examined the accounts of the orchard and the sale price did not include good- will. The purchaser paid the deposit on the 31 August 1990 and took possession on 20 December 1990. This was also the date of final settlement. The taxpayers did no further work on the orchard as the purchasers stated they did not require the taxpayers to maintain the orchard. Inland Revenue argued that the taxpayers were not carrying on a taxable activ- ity at the time of settlement. Even if they were carrying on a taxable activity, the taxpayers had wound it down prior to settlement. Inland Revenue also argued that the sale was not the sale of a going concern because there was no business element in the sale. The taxpayers argued that they had sold the orchard as a complete business process capable of being carried on by the purchaser. It was irrelevant that the purchaser did not carry on the business. The taxpayers submitted that the or- chard was a going concern at the time of supply (31 August 1990) and at the time of settlement. Decision:Judge Barber found in favour of the taxpayers. He concluded the taxpayers were carrying on a taxable activity and that they supplied the orchard as a going concern to the purchasers. Comments:Inland Revenue is not appealing this decision. 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) Apportionment on Sale - Going Concern and Taxable Supply Rating:•• Case:TRA No. 92/151 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, sections 11(1)(c) and 5(14) Keywords:“Going concern” “apportionment” Summary:The taxpayer purchased a property, which had a guesthouse on it and some vacant land at the rear of the property. Inland Revenue disallowed the input tax credit as we considered the property was sold as a going concern. The Taxation Review Authority found that the supply of the property involved two supplies; a supply of a going concern in the form of a guesthouse and the supply of the land at the rear that was liable for GST. Facts:The taxpayer claimed an input tax credit for the purchase of a property. The contract for the sale and purchase of the property made no reference to GST. The property consisted of a guesthouse and some subdivisional land at the rear. At the time of sale the guesthouse had a manager, guests, and was equipped with chattels and fixtures. The vendor endeavoured to have the Boarding license transferred to the purchaser, but the City Council refused to do this until the building had been renovated. Therefore, the vendor dropped the purchase price. The vendor had already planned and deposited a plan of subdivision with the Land Transfer Office. This meant that the owner of the land could sell or lease the rear of the property independently of the guesthouse. Inland Revenue disallowed the purchaser’s claim for input tax credits on the basis that the sale of the property - guesthouse and the land at the rear - was a going concern. The purchaser argued that the guesthouse was not a going concern and he should be allowed to claim input tax credits. Furthermore, even if the guesthouse was a going concern, Inland Revenue should allow an input tax credit for the purchase of the land. Decision:Judge Barber decided that the sale of the property included two supplies; the supply of the guesthouse and the supply of the land at the rear. The supply of the guesthouse was the supply of a going concern. However, the sale of land was not a going concern. Comment:Inland Revenue is not appealing this decision. Whether Income derived by Company or Proprietor Rating:•• Case:TRA 91/125 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, sections 65(2)(b), 2 and 38 Keywords:“Derived”, “illegality” Summary:The case concerned whether the objector had personally derived income of commissions, or whether the income was derived by the company of which he was the proprietor. The income was the objector’s personal income received by way of commission, and it was taxable in his hands. Facts:The objector was the proprietor of two businesses which he restructured as a Management company and a trading entity. Because the trading entity needed additional income the objector chose the business of selling real estate and continued on page 22 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) businesses (i.e., a broking business). The objector was a certificated salesperson. The objector made the money earned from the broking business available to pay creditors of the companies under a consultancy agreement which provided that the objector would act as a nominee for the trading entity in the broking busi- ness. The trading entity was entitled to all the net income generated by the broking business. Decision:The trading entity did not hold a licence under the Real Estate Agents Act 1976 to carry on the broking business, so it was trading illegally. Parliament intended to make it illegal for unlicensed persons to act as a go-between for the buying and selling of real estate. The trading entity could not take the benefit of any commission earned for it by the objector because it was at all times unlicensed. The consultancy agreement that the taxpayer relied on is of no effect in vesting the commission earned by the objector in the trading entity. Judge Willy found that the objector earned income from the broking business through his own personal efforts and expertise, and his liability for income tax was not avoided by the consultancy agreement. Comment:The taxpayer is not appealing this the decision. from page 21 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) September 5 PAYE deductions and deduction schedules for last 16 days of August 1993 due - ìlargeî employers only. 7 First instalment of 1994 Provisional Tax due for taxpayers with May balance dates.

On 24 August the Commissioner issued a number of amendments and variations to the determination, which are outlined below. This Tax Information Bulletin includes a consolidated determination incorporating the amend- ments and variations. These changes take effect from the 1992-93 income year. Accounting For Large Number of Purchases and Deaths Paragraph 3 of the determination has been amended to provide that where calculating livestock on hand results in a negative number, an alternative formula is applied to derive a value for livestock of that type. A negative number is likely to occur only in limited circumstances. The alternative formula is: e + (f x g) c where - c is the number of livestock of the type purchased by the taxpayer during that income year which are, or would have been if still on hand, rising one year livestock of the taxpayer at the end of the income year; e is the aggregate purchase cost of livestock of the type purchased during that income year by the taxpayer which are, or would have been if still on hand, rising one year livestock of the taxpayer at the end of the income year; f is, in the case of either beef or dairy cattle, the number of bobby calves purchased by the taxpayer during the income year; and g is the national standard cost for the income year of acquired bobby calves. Valuing Mature and Maturing Livestock Intake for Beef and Dairy Cattle (other than Male Non-Breeding Cattle) Paragraph 4 of the determination values cattle other than non-breeding cattle. This paragraph required an opening number and value based on rising one year cattle (whether breeding or non-breeding) on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year. Paragraph 5 of the determination, which values non- breeding cattle, specified that the opening number and value to be used in that calculation are those which applied to rising one year male non-breeding cattle on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year. Thus there was an inconsistency between the two paragraphs. This was important for the 1992-93 income year as the trading stock values for male and female rising one year cattle are substantially different. This has been corrected. Establishing NSC where Calculation of NSC using any of Paragraphs 3 to 7 produce Nil Values In rare circumstances calculating national standard cost will produce nil values. These circumstances are: ï where no livestock is on hand in the rising one year class for an income year but some livestock in an older class which was already on hand and valued under a different option is now to be valued on NSC at the end of the same income year; or ï where no livestock is on hand in a class category for which national standard cost is being calculated but a bailment deficiency exists and the taxpayer (bailee) wishes to value that deficiency under the NSC option. The determination has been amended to provide that under these circumstances: ï the rising one year class have a national standard cost set as the breeding, rearing and growing costs (BRG) announced for that income year; and ï the rising two year class have a national standard cost set as the BRG for the rising one year class plus the rearing and growing cost (RG) announced for that income year; and ï the rising three year non-breeding male cattle class have a national standard cost set as BRG plus two sets of rearing and growing costs announced for that income year. Two sets of rearing and growing costs are used to reflect the cost of these cattle being raised to rising two years of age then rising three years of age. This amendment is included as paragraph 9A of the determination. Interpretation Of Opening Value Paragraph 27 of the determination gives effect to the Livestock Valuation Consultative Committeeís recom- mendation that the closing value of livestock for the 1992-93 income year can be based on last yearís trading stock values or this yearís national standard cost values. However, the current wording could have been inter- preted as allowing the opening value of livestock to be revised rather than the alternative value being applied in determining closing value. Paragraph 27 has been amended to make it clear that the recalculation of opening values is only undertaken to determine the closing value of livestock on hand at the end of the 1992-93 income year. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) - Appendix Transitional Provision Amendment Paragraphs 30 and 31 include reference to paragraph 27 in setting the opening average inventory value in the 1992-93 income year. This reference was incorrectly included and if it remained it would allow taxpayers to alter their opening inventory valuations without any tax consequence. This would allow in some cases substan- tial tax free increases in the opening value of livestock on hand. Alternatively, in other situations this problem would result in a reduced opening inventory value without an accompanying tax deduction. The determi- nation has been amended to remove the reference to paragraph 27 from paragraphs 30 and 31 Consolidated Version - Income Tax (National Standard Costs for Livestock) Determination 1993 Title and Application 1. This determination may be cited as the Income Tax (National Standard Costs for Livestock) Determination 1993. This determination applies in respect of the valuation of specified livestock under the national standard cost scheme for the 1992-93 income year and subsequent years. Any taxpayer valuing any specified livestock in accordance with the provisions of section 86C of the Income Tax Act 1976 shall calculate the cost of such livestock on hand at the end of the income year in accordance with this determination. For the purposes of this determination where a taxpayer separately accounts for more than one livestock business under national standard cost then national standard cost in relation to the livestock used in each of those busi- nesses shall be calculated separately. Interpretation 2. In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires, - Expressions used have the same meanings as in sections 2, 2A and sections 85 to 86L of the Income Tax Act 1976.

Pigs valued in the growing pigs 10 weeks to seventeen weeks of age category of livestock Pigs on hand at the end of an income year which are growing pigs ten weeks to seventeen weeks of age or pigs which are grown on to an older age (including the 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) - Appendix purchase of pigs intended for breeding purposes) shall have an average value, at the end of an income year, for the purposes of the national standard cost scheme, calculated in accordance with the following formula: ((a - b - c) x d) + ((a - c) x e) + f a - b - c + g where - a is the number of growing pigs which at any time during the income year were aged between 10 and 17 weeks of age and which were sold during the income year or are on hand at the end of that income year; b is the number of weaned pigs purchased by the taxpayer during the income year for the purposes of rearing to about 17 weeks of age or older; c is the number of pigs on hand at the beginning of the income year which were valued as growing pigs 10 to 17 weeks of age; d is national standard cost for the income year for pigs in the weaners to 10 weeks of age category of live- stock; e is the national standard cost for the income year for pigs in the growing pigs 10 to 17 weeks of age category of livestock; f is the aggregate purchase cost of pigs purchased at the age of weaning or older during the income year by the taxpayer; g is the total number of pigs purchased by the taxpayer at the age of weaning or older during the income year. Provisions which apply to Para- graphs 3 to 7 of this Determination 8. Treatment of high-priced livestock transferred from high-priced livestock scheme to national standard cost scheme Where any high-priced livestock is required under section 86I of the Act to be valued under the national standard cost scheme, that livestock shall be treated under this determination as livestock purchased at the national average market value for the income year in which the livestock is no longer taken into account under section 86I of this Act. 9. Exclusion of certain livestock from livestock cost calculations Exclusion of breeding sires where the herd scheme is being used in conjunction with national standard cost Where the herd scheme has been adopted for a particu- lar livestock type and the taxpayer is using that scheme to value any livestock of that type, the purchase cost of breeding sires of that livestock type and the number purchased during the income year must be excluded from the calculation of average cost of the taxpayerís livestock of the type under the national standard cost scheme. In any case where a taxpayer commences to use the herd scheme in conjunction with the national standard cost scheme, no adjustment to the calculation of average costs under the national standard cost scheme shall be made in respect of breeding sires purchased in earlier income years. Exclusion of high-priced livestock Any livestock purchased which must be valued under the provisions of section 86I of the Act as high-priced livestock at the end of the income year must be excluded from the calculation of average cost under the national standard cost scheme with regard to both the number and cost of livestock purchased. 9A. Establishment Of NSC Where Calcu- lation Of NSC Using Any Of Paragraphs 3 To 7 Produces Nil Values. In the event of any of the formulas in paragraphs (3) to (7) of this determination producing an average value at the end of an income year of nil, the average value shall be deemed to be, in the case of: ï a rising one year class of livestock, the national standard cost of rising one year livestock of that type for that income year; and ï a rising two year and older intake of livestock other than rising three year male non-breeding cattle, the national standard cost for rising one year livestock of that type plus the national standard cost for rising two year livestock of that type for that income year; and ï rising three year male non-breeding cattle, the national standard cost for rising one year male non- breeding cattle plus an amount equal to twice the national standard cost for rising two year male non- breeding cattle for that income year. Inventory System Requirements under the National Standard Cost Scheme 10. General In respect of sheep, cattle, deer and goats, as this livestock ages until it becomes mature livestock, the costs of production of the livestock accumulate and are incorporated into average values over balance dates. Once the livestock has first become mature livestock of the taxpayer at the end of an income year, the value of the livestock to the taxpayer under the national standard cost scheme becomes fixed (not accumulating any further production costs) and remains in the taxpayerís inventory valuation for the mature inventory grouping until such time as the livestock is sold, transferred to another livestock valuation option or dies (each as determined having regard to any sub-inventory group- ing adopted by the taxpayer and to the cost flow identifi- cation system applied by the taxpayer, as each is detailed further below). 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) - Appendix In respect of pigs, the average cost identified with respect to the pigs entering inventory in any particular income year and remaining on hand at the end of the income year remains fixed (not accumulating any further production costs) and remains in the taxpayerís inventory valuation for the mature inventory grouping until such time as the pigs are sold, transferred to another livestock valuation option or die (as each is determined having regard to any sub-inventory group- ing adopted by the taxpayer and to the cost flow identifi- cation system applied by the taxpayer, as each is detailed further below). For the purposes of identifying the end of year valuation of mature livestock under the national standard cost scheme, a taxpayer must have a cost flow identification system involving specific identification, average costing or first-in first-out (FIFO) costing, as detailed further in paragraphs 12 to 14 of this determination. The average cost inventory system or the first in first out inventory system represent the minimum standard of inventory accounting for all types of livestock. The taxpayer may choose to use more accurate inventory accounting systems. Different systems may be adopted by the same taxpayer for different types of livestock. Where a mature inventory grouping of a type of live- stock is broken down by a taxpayer into sub-inventory groups (as detailed further below), each sub-inventory group of that type of livestock must be valued by the taxpayer under the national standard cost scheme using the same cost flow identification system. Where a taxpayer is using the national standard cost scheme to value any livestock of a type within an inventory grouping, or as the case may be, sub-inven- tory group, the taxpayer shall value all livestock of that inventory grouping or sub-inventory group under the national standard cost scheme, except for: ï livestock of that type valued under the herd scheme at the end of the relevant income year; or ï Bailees who elect to account for deficiencies of bailed livestock at market value or replacement price. 11. Separate sub-inventory groups for non-breeding and breeding livestock Notwithstanding any other provisions of this determina- tion (including in particular the formulae in paragraphs 3 to 7), a taxpayer may elect to establish separate sub- inventory groups, with respect to each livestock type, for the livestock: (a) Intended to be used by the taxpayer for breeding purposes; and (b) Intended to be used by the taxpayer for purposes other than breeding. Where separate sub-inventory groups are established by a taxpayer: (c) All livestock of the relevant inventory group which are valued under the national standard cost scheme and are intended for breeding purposes or, as the case may be, purposes other than breeding purposes, must be included in the relevant sub-inventory group of the taxpayer until disposed of or death; and (d) Separate calculations of average cost for each sub- inventory group may be made under the formulae in paragraph 3 to 7 of this determination and the taxpayer may separately apply the cost flow identifi- cation system adopted by the taxpayer for mature livestock of that type to each sub-inventory group. Once livestock is included in a sub-inventory group it must continue to be accounted for under that sub- inventory group until treated as sold, disposed of, or valued under one of the other livestock valuation options. It may not be moved to another sub-inventory group. Cost Flow Identification Systems for the Valuation of Mature Livestock 12. First-in first-out system (FIFO) Where the taxpayer elects to use the FIFO system for cost flow identification, the cost and number of the livestock intake entering the taxpayerís inventory system in an income year must be recorded. In accord- ance with the normal rules applying under FIFO systems, dispositions and deaths of mature livestock of the type in question, and where the taxpayer so elects maturing livestock of that type, will be treated as reducing first the oldest intake of livestock of that type on hand. A taxpayer may however, at the taxpayerís option and to such extent as the taxpayer chooses, with regard to any specific livestock, adopt a specific identification system for accounting for acquisitions, dispositions and deaths. Refinements to the minimum standard of the FIFO inventory system as described above to more accurately account for purchases, sales and deaths affecting different intake years within the FIFO inventory system may be made. Where the average closing cost calculated in accordance with paragraphs 4 and 6 (and 7 at the taxpayerís option) of this determination is to be used in association with the minimum standard FIFO inventory system that average closing cost shall be applied to all of the livestock intake of that livestock in that income year valued under the provisions of section 86C of the Act at the end of the income year. 13. Average cost system where the herd scheme was not used in the current in- come year or in the immediately preced- ing income year This inventory system is the minimum standard of inventory accounting where the herd scheme was not used in the preceding income year or the current income year. 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) - Appendix Where a taxpayer uses the average cost system of cost flow identification, the value of the taxpayerís mature and maturing inventory grouping of any type under the national standard cost scheme at the end of an income year shall be calculated by multiplying the number of mature and maturing livestock of that type on hand by the average cost calculated in accordance with the following formula in relation to that type of mature and maturing livestock and the income year: ((a - b) x c) + ((e - (a - b)) x d) e where - a is the number of livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year, being at that time mature livestock; b is the lesser of a and - (i) The number of livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the immediately preceding year, being at that time mature livestock; or (ii) At the election of the taxpayer except where the livestock are pigs, the number of livestock of the taxpayer, being livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year which were at the time mature livestock or during the income year maturing livestock of the taxpayer,- which are disposed of by the taxpayer or die (while owned by the taxpayer) during the income year; c is the average cost or value of mature livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year; d is the average cost of livestock intake of the taxpayer as calculated under paragraph 4, 6 or 7 of this deter- mination; e is the number of mature livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the income year. The average closing cost calculated according to the formula shall be applied to all livestock of the mature inventory group which are to be valued under using the average cost system the provisions of section 86C of the Act at the end of the income year. 14. Average cost system where the herd scheme was used in the preceding in- come year or is to be used in the current income year This inventory system is the minimum standard of inventory accounting where the herd scheme was used in the preceding income year or is to be used in the current income year. Where a taxpayer uses the average cost system of cost flow identification, the value of the taxpayerís mature and maturing inventory grouping of any type under the national standard cost scheme at the end of the income year shall be calculated by multiplying the number of mature and maturing livestock of that type by the average cost calculated in accordance with the following formula in relation to that type of mature and maturing livestock and the income year: ((a - b) x c) + ((e - (a - b)) x d) e where - a is the number of livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year, being at that time mature livestock valued under a valuation method other than the herd scheme; b is the lesser of a and - (i) The number of livestock, other than male breeding sires, of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the immediately preceding year, being at that time mature livestock; or (ii) At the election of the taxpayer except where the livestock are pigs, the number of livestock, other than male breeding sires, of the type of the taxpayer, being livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year which were at the time mature livestock or during the income year maturing livestock of the taxpayer,- which are disposed of by the taxpayer or die (while owned by the taxpayer) during the income year; c is the average cost or value of mature livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year valued under a valuation method other than the herd scheme; d is the average cost of livestock intake of the taxpayer as calculated under paragraph 4, 6 or 7 of this deter- mination; e is the number of mature livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the income year valued under the national standard cost scheme. The average closing cost calculated according to the formula is applied to all of livestock of the mature inventory group which are to be valued using the average cost system under the provisions of section 86C of the Act at the end of the income year. Where the herd scheme is to be used in relation to a type of livestock and no livestock of that type were valued using the herd scheme in the immediately preceding income year then the rules associated with paragraphs 18, 19 (and paragraph 30 in the case of the 1992-93 income year) of this determination must be applied before calculating the average closing cost in accordance with this paragraph. 15. Change in cost flow identification system when using the national standard cost scheme Subject to the rules contained in this paragraph and in the following paragraphs of this determination, a 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) - Appendix taxpayer may change the cost flow identification system used when valuing the taxpayerís mature inventory grouping under the national standard cost scheme from FIFO to average cost or vice versa. Where a taxpayer changes to the average cost system, for the purposes of determining the average cost in the year of change, the average cost of mature livestock of the type in question on hand at the end of the immedi- ately preceding income year will be calculated as follows: a b where: a is the total closing cost of that inventory grouping valued under national standard cost in the preceding income year; and b is the total closing number of livestock in that inven- tory grouping valued under national standard cost in the preceding income year. If the FIFO inventory system is being adopted, the opening inventory cost in the year of the change will be the total closing cost of that inventory grouping in the immediately preceding income year. 16.Reduction in livestock numbers where stock valued under national stand- ard cost scheme and the herd scheme Where a taxpayer in any income year values any livestock under the herd scheme and also values other livestock of the same type under the national standard cost scheme, any reduction in the number of livestock of that type below the number on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year must first be accounted for from the relevant class (in any case where the taxpayer adopts a class by class separation of livestock numbers) or inventory grouping valued at the end of the immediately preceding income year under the national standard cost scheme. Accordingly, any reduction in the number of livestock of that type shall only commence to reduce the number of livestock valued under the herd scheme: (a) In any case where the taxpayer uses an inventory system which separates out livestock of that class, where no livestock of that class is on hand at the end of the income year to be valued under the national standard cost scheme; or (b) In any case where the taxpayer uses an inventory system which does not separately identify livestock of that class, where no livestock of the relevant inventory grouping is on hand at the end of the income year to be valued under the national standard cost scheme. 17. Treatment of livestock bailed by a taxpayer which may be valued under the national standard cost scheme Under section 86C(3) of the Act, taxpayers who bail livestock are only eligible to use the national standard cost scheme in relation to bailed livestock where the taxpayer expects to have the livestock originally bailed to be re-delivered. In such a case, the provisions of this determination shall apply as if the bailed livestock were livestock on hand. Movement between National Standard Cost and Other Livestock Valuation Schemes 18. Changing from herd scheme, market value option or replacement price option to national standard cost scheme In respect of each livestock type, in the income year in which the national standard cost scheme is first adopted by the taxpayer, the opening inventory structure and cost must be calculated, in accordance with the appro- priate paragraph 19 or 20 of this determination, in order to allow calculation of the closing inventory number and cost in respect of that type of livestock in that income year under the provisions of paragraphs 12 to 14 of this determination. 19.Where the taxpayer adopts the average cost system of cost flow identifi- cation If a taxpayer is to use the average cost system in respect of livestock valued under the national standard cost scheme, in respect of each relevant inventory grouping of livestock, the average cost at the beginning of the income year will be deemed to be equal to the amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: a b where - a is the aggregate value adopted for income tax pur- poses in the preceding income year by the taxpayer in respect of all classes of livestock of the taxpayer of the type which would have been included in the inventory grouping on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year; b is the number of livestock of the taxpayer of the type which would have been included in the inventory grouping on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year. 20. Where the taxpayer adopts the FIFO system of cost flow identification If a taxpayer is to use the FIFO system to account for livestock under the national standard cost scheme, the value of the opening inventory of mature livestock of the taxpayer in the relevant income year will be equal to the values for income tax purposes of each class of livestock of the taxpayer in an inventory grouping of the type in question on hand at the end of the immediately preced- ing income year. For the purposes of application of the FIFO system in the income year of the change and subsequent income years, the opening inventory of 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) - Appendix mature livestock (in all cases other than pigs) shall be subdivided and be deemed to be aged as follows (from newest to oldest): (a) Rising two year female breeding stock; (b) Older classes of female breeding stock (subdivided and ranked from newest to oldest to the extent possible having regard to the taxpayerís preceding tax accounting system); (c) Non-breeding livestock (excluding male non- breeding dairy cattle and male non-breeding beef cattle); (d) Male breeding stock. In the case of pigs, the mature livestock included in opening inventory in the income year shall be subdi- vided and be deemed to be aged as follows (from newest to oldest): (a) Weaner pigs less than 10 weeks of age; (b) Growing pigs between 10 and 17 weeks of age; (c) Pigs over 17 weeks of age; (d) Breeding sows less than one year old; (e) Breeding sows over one year of age; (f) Breeding boars. The FIFO system will be applied accordingly, in the income year in which the national standard cost scheme is first adopted and in subsequent income years in which it is used, so that dispositions and deaths are deemed to reduce first the oldest still existing class of mature livestock. 21. Change from national standard cost scheme to the herd scheme, market value option or replacement price option for any complete inventory grouping Irrespective of which cost flow identification system was used in the income year preceding the year of the change, the opening value of the livestock of the inventory grouping in the year of change shall be treated as being equal to the value for tax purposes at the end of the immediately preceding income year. A value of the livestock at the end of the year of change will be calculated accordingly under the chosen valua- tion option on an class-by-class basis. 22. Change from national standard cost scheme to the herd scheme for some livestock only If the number of livestock of an inventory grouping moved from valuation under the national standard cost scheme to valuation under the herd scheme in any income year still leaves some livestock of the particular inventory grouping to be valued under the national standard cost scheme at the end of the income year, then paragraphs 23 to 25 (as appropriate) of this determina- tion shall apply. 23. Average cost system used in year preceding the year of change If the average cost system of cost flow identification was used in the income year preceding the income year of change to the herd scheme, the number of livestock moved to the herd scheme shall be accounted for as if they were livestock disposed of or dying in the income year (see paragraphs 13 and 14 of this determination). No other adjustment is required to opening inventory numbers and costs. 24. FIFO system used in year preceding the year of change If the closing inventory system used in the income year preceding the income year of the change to the herd scheme was the FIFO system, then the number moved to the Herd scheme will be deemed to have been derived from the oldest inventory on hand at the opening balance date in the income year of the change to the Herd scheme in the same manner as sales and deaths are accounted for when using the FIFO type of inven- tory system unless the inventory account has been accurately prepared on an age class by age class basis with the appropriate costs per head recorded for each group of livestock in each age class, under which conditions, the adjustment to closing inventory numbers and costs can be made on a class by class basis. 25. Change in cost flow identification system in the same income year as some livestock are moved from the national standard cost scheme to the herd scheme system of valuation If a change in the cost flow identification system is made in the same income year as some livestock are moved to the herd scheme, this adjustment shall be effected only after the appropriate adjustment has been made for moving those livestock to the herd scheme on the basis of the cost flow identification system used in the immediately preceding income year. 26. Complete change from national standard cost scheme to self-assessed cost or from self-assessed cost to national standard cost scheme The value of livestock of each type on hand in each inventory grouping at the end of the immediately preceding income year under the preceding method will be deemed to be the opening value of livestock of that type in that inventory grouping in the year of change. Any change in the cost flow identification system accompanying the change will be subject to paragraphs 15 and 25 of this determination. 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) - Appendix Transition to National Standard Cost (and National Standard Cost in Combination with Other Valuation Options) in 1992-93 Income Year Opening values in the 1992-93 income year where the Trading Stock Scheme was used to value livestock in the 1991-92 income year 27. Where livestock has been valued under the trading stock scheme in the 1991-92 income year, and the taxpayer is to adopt national standard cost, the taxpayer may elect whether the opening value of the rising one year classes of livestock and rising two year male non- breeding cattle on hand at the start of the 1992-93 income year shall be, for the purposes of calculating the value of livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the 1992-93 income year, either: (a) The trading stock scheme value of that livestock at the end of the 1991-92 income year; or (b) The average closing cost calculated for that inven- tory grouping of livestock under the provisions of section 86C of the Act and under this determination in relation to that stock for the 1992-93 income year and using stock numbers and purchase costs as contained in the 1992-93 financial accounts. Opening values in the 1992-93 income year where other than the Trading Stock Scheme was used to value livestock in the 1991-92 income year In relation to livestock valued in the 1991-92 year under any valuation option other than the trading stock scheme, the opening value of the livestock in the 1992- 93 income year shall be the value of the livestock at the end of the 1991-92 income year. 28. Treatment of livestock in the 1992-93 income year for NSC purposes when changing from the trading stock scheme to any other valuation option in the 1992- 93 income year The treatment of livestock value or cost at the beginning of the 1992-93 income year will be determined in accordance with either of paragraphs 29, 30 and 31 of this determination as appropriate. 29. Trading stock scheme to national standard cost scheme The closing value in the 1992-93 income year will be calculated in accordance with paragraphs 3 to 7 of this determination and the other provisions of this determi- nation which relate to those paragraphs. The opening cost shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph 27 of this determination. 30. Trading stock scheme to national standard cost scheme where national standard cost is to be used in conjunction with the herd scheme, or the market value option or the replacement price option The movement from the trading stock scheme to a combination of the herd scheme, national standard cost scheme, market value option or replacement price option will be accounted for by applying the provisions of paragraph 31 to the opening value of livestock on hand at the start of the 1992-93 income year. 30. Trading stock scheme to national standard cost scheme where national standard cost is to be used in conjunction with the herd scheme, or the market value option or the replacement price option The movement from the trading stock scheme to a combination of the herd scheme, national standard cost scheme, market value option or replacement price option will be accounted for by applying the provisions of paragraph 31 to the opening value of livestock on hand at the start of the 1992-93 income year. 31. Transitional inventory treatments for livestock valued under national standard cost at the end of the 1992-93 income year In the case of an inventory grouping: (a) In which there is only one class of livestock, the standard rules for accounting for changes in valua- tion over the income year will apply without adjust- ment; (b) In which there is more than one class of livestock and some of the inventory grouping is to be valued under the national standard cost scheme in the 1992- 93 income year, alternative treatments are to be adopted (with separate calculations for the mature inventory groupings in respect of each type of livestock) dependent upon the cost flow identifica- tion system adopted by the taxpayer in respect of the 1992-93 income year: (i) If the FIFO system is to be used, for the purposes of calculating the value of livestock on hand at the end of the 1992-93 income year under the national standard cost scheme, the following calculation shall be undertaken with respect to each livestock class: a - b where - a is the number of livestock of the taxpayer of that class on hand at the start of the 1992-93 income year; and b is the lesser of (a) and the number of live- stock of the taxpayer of the class on hand at the end of the 1992-93 income year valued under the herd scheme. Only in the case of a class of livestock which has a positive total (a-b) is there to be an opening 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) - Appendix inventory figure equal to that positive total, to be accounted for under the national standard cost scheme and the FIFO rules, as detailed in this determination (including in particular paragraph 20). (ii) If the average cost system is to be used, the average cost of inventory on hand at the start of the 1992-93 income year in that inventory grouping for the purposes of the national stand- ard cost scheme shall be calculated in accordance with the following formula: c d where - c is the amount calculated by aggregating the amounts calculated, in respect of each class of livestock of the taxpayer in the inventory grouping, under the formula set out below; and d is the number calculated by aggregating the number calculated, in respect of each class of livestock of the taxpayer in the inventory grouping, under subparagraph (b)(i) of this paragraph. For the purposes of item (c) in the above formula, the amount to be included for each class of livestock of the taxpayer will be calculated as follows: e x f where - e is the number calculated, in respect of the class of livestock of the taxpayer in the inventory grouping, under subparagraph (b)(i) of this paragraph; and f is the opening value per head of livestock of the taxpayer of that class. This average cost of opening inventory will be used in calculating the closing average cost of those livestock valued under national standard cost at the end of the 1993 income year. This is a consolidated Determination, incorporating variations and extensions made and signed on 24†August 1993.

Using the sample data for the sheep flock, the standard cost calculation is made as follows: Std Cost = ((600 + 1,900 - 500) x $13) + $16,000 + (N/A) 600 + 1,900 =(2,000 x $13) + $16,000 2,500 =$42,000 2,500 = $16.80/head This standard cost will be applied to all hoggets on hand valued on the NSC option at the end of income year. Separating stock into sub-inventory groups intended for breeding or non-breeding uses is allowed as an alterna- tive to valuing the entire group as a single inventory (paragraph 11 of the Determination). An example of sub-inventory cost calculations is shown in Example Three. Note:In the case of rising one year dairy cattle, any bobby calves sold are excluded from item b of the formula, so they are not included in the calcula- tion of average cost of rising one year dairy cattle at the end of the income year. This example uses the following formula, which is contained in paragraph (4) of the Determination: (a x b) + c + d a + e Where: a is the number of rising one year livestock of the type that the taxpayer has on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year; b is the national standard cost of rising two year livestock of the type for that income year; c is the aggregate purchase cost of livestock of the type that the taxpayer purchased during the income year, which are (or would have been if still on hand) rising two year or older livestock at the end of that income year; d is the aggregate income tax value of the taxpayer's rising one year livestock of the type on hand, as at the end of the immediately preceding income year; e is the number of livestock of the type that the taxpayer purchased during the income year, which are (or would have been if still on hand) rising two year or older livestock at the end of that income year. Using the example data for the sheep flock, the standard cost calculation is made as follows: Std Cost = (600 x $7.50) + $11,000 + $9,000 600 + 220 =$24,500 820 = $29.88/head This standard cost will be applied to this yearís intake of livestock (adult sheep) on hand valued on the NSC option at the end of the income year. Note:Where the National Standard Cost option is used in combination with the Herd Scheme, the calculation of standard cost is made as if the herd scheme were not being used. The only adjust- ment to this is in the exclusion of both the Example Two - Calculation of Standard Cost for the Rising Two Year and Older Livestock Intake (Mature and Maturing Sheep) (continued at top of opposite column) (continued on page 16) 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) - Appendix If the herd scheme were being used to value some sheep in this example, then the exclusion of the rams from the standard cost calculation would reduce the average standard cost to $26.88/head for this yearís intake. Example Three - Calculation of Standard Cost where Sub-Inventory Treatment of Rising One Year Sheep is Adopted Livestock intended for breeding use and livestock intended for trading can be separated into sub-inventory groups (see paragraph (11) of the Determination). The standard costs for each sub-inventory group are calcu- lated using the same formula as for the single inventory group, by simply making a separate calculation for each group. In this example, the female hoggets are intended for breeding use, and the male (wether) hoggets for trading purposes. The following calculations would be made: ((a + b - c) x d) + e + (f x d) a + b Where: a is the number of rising one year livestock of the type on hand at the end of the income year; b is the number of livestock of the type that the taxpayer sold during the income year, which would have been rising one year livestock if they were still on hand at the end of that income year; c is the number of livestock of the type that the taxpayer purchased during that income year, which are (or would have been if still on hand) rising one year livestock at the end of the income year. d Is the national standard cost of rising one year livestock of the type for that income year; e is the aggregate purchase cost of livestock of the type that the taxpayer purchased during that income year, which are (or would have been if still on hand) rising one year livestock at the end of the income year; f for either beef or dairy cattle, is the number of bobby calves purchased by the taxpayer during the income year; and g is the national standard cost of acquired bobby calves for the income year . This example assumes that 2,000 lambs (half female and half male) were homebred. Example A - Standard Cost for Ewe Hoggets Std Cost =((500 + 600 - 100) x $13) + $4,000 + (N/A) 500 + 600 = (1,000 x $13) + $4,000 1,100 =$17,000 1,100 = $15.45/head This standard cost will be applied to all ewe hoggets on hand valued on the NSC option at the end of the income year. Example B - Standard Cost for Wether (and Ram) Hoggets Std Cost =((100 + 1,300 - 400) x $13) + $12,000 + (NA) 100 + 1,300 =(1,000 x $13) + $12,000 1,400 =$25,000 1,400 = $17.86/head This standard cost will be applied to all wether hoggets on hand valued on the NSC option at the end of the income year.

All other relevant stock numbers and costs must be included. 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) - Appendix The average cost inventory system for mature livestock valued on the NSC option at the end of any income year is detailed in paragraph (13) of the Determination. For purposes of this example, the closing value of mature sheep in the previous income year is assumed to have been $51,600, or an average of $24 per head (for the 2,150 mature sheep on hand). The formula for calculat- ing the average closing value (cost) of mature livestock on hand at the end of an income year for use with the average cost inventory system (paragraph (13) of the Determination) is shown below: ((a - b) x c) + ((e - (a - b)) x d) e Where: a is the number of livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year, being at that time mature livestock; b is the lesser of a and: (i) the number of livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the immediately preceding year, being at that time mature livestock; or (ii) at the election of the taxpayer except where the livestock are pigs, the number of livestock of the taxpayer, being livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year which were at the time mature livestock or during the income year maturing livestock of the taxpayer;- which are disposed of by the taxpayer or die (while owned by the taxpayer) during the income year; c is the average cost or value of mature livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year; d is the average cost of the livestock intake of the taxpayer as calculated under paragraph 4, 6 or 7 of this determination; e is the number of mature livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the income year. Using the sample sheep flock structure, the following average cost of closing mature sheep is calculated: Avge = ((2,150 - 600) x $24) + (2,150 - (2,150 - 600) x $29.88) Cost2,150 = (1,550 x $24) + (600 x $29.88) 2,150 =$55,128 2,150 = $25.64 per head This average cost per head will be applied to all mature sheep on hand at the end of the income year (all classes and sex). In this example, the increase in valuation at the end of the income year is an average of $1.64/head (or $3526 for the flock of mature sheep). The new closing value will provide the base for calculating the average cost in the following income year. This average cost per head could be presented in the livestock reconciliation for income tax purposes as follows: Opening (1/4/97) ClassNo.Avge CostTotal per Head ($)($) 2 Tooth Ewes60024.0014,400 MA Ewes1,00024.0024,000 5-6 Yr Ewes40024.009,600 Breeding Rams5024.001,200 MA Wethers 10024.002,400 2,150$ 51,600 Closing (31/3/98) ClassNo.Avge CostTotal per Head ($)($) 2 Tooth Ewes60025.6415,384 MA Ewes1,00025.6425,640 5-6 Yr Ewes40025.6410,256 Breeding Rams5025.641,282 MA Wethers 10025.64 2,564 2,150$55,126 Total Increase in Value $3,526 Note:Item b in the formula relating to this example has two options. It allows sales and deaths to be accounted for from mature stock only (over the age of two years) or to be accounted for from all stock of that type over the age of one year. The second option will result in a faster turnover of inventory, but reduces the need to separately identify sales and deaths in the rising two year class of livestock. Example Four - Average Cost Inventory System where the Herd Scheme was not used in the Previous Income Year and is not to be used in the Current Income Year 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) - Appendix Paragraph (14) of the Determination sets out the average cost inventory system for valuing mature livestock on the NSC option where some livestock of the same type are being valued on the herd scheme in the same income year. The formula for calculating the average cost per head for the average cost inventory system of the mature livestock under these circum- stances is shown below: ((a - b) x c) + ((e - (a - b) x d) e Where: a is the number of livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year, being at that time mature livestock valued under a valuation method other than the herd scheme; b is the lesser of a and - (i) the number of livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the immediately preceding year, being at that time mature livestock; or (ii) at the election of the taxpayer except where the livestock are pigs, the number of livestock of the type of the taxpayer, being livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year which were at the time mature livestock or during the income year maturing livestock of the taxpayer - which are disposed of by the taxpayer or die (while owned by the taxpayer) during the income year; c is the average cost or value of mature livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the immediately preceding income year valued under a valuation method other than the herd scheme; d is the average cost of livestock intake of the taxpayer as calculated under paragraph 4, 6 or 7 of this Deter- mination; e is the number of mature livestock of the taxpayer on hand at the end of the income year valued under the national standard cost scheme. For the purposes of this example, it is assumed that the following sheep numbers were valued on the herd scheme at the end of the previous year: - ClassNo. on Herd Scheme 2 Tooth Ewes 300(50%) MA Ewes100(10%) 5-6 year Ewes400(100%) Breeding Rams50(100%) MA Wethers 100(100%) TOTAL:950 No. Valued on NSC:1,200 Total Mature Sheep Prev. Year: 2,150 It is also assumed that the closing value of mature sheep valued under the NSC option at the end of the previous income year was $28,800, or an average of $24 per head (for the 1,200 sheep concerned). The standard cost calculated in Example Two for mature sheep at the end of the income year will exclude the number and cost of breeding rams purchased (as these must be automatically included on the herd scheme) and is calculated to be $26.88 per head. Using the sample flock structure, the average cost of mature sheep valued on the NSC option for the purposes of the average cost inventory system is calculated as follows: Avge = ((1,200 - 600) x $24) + (1,200 - (1,200 - 600) x $26.88) Cost1,200 =(600 x $24) + (600 x $26.88) 1,200 =$30,528 1,200 = $25.44 per head This average cost per head would be applied to the 1,200 mature sheep being valued under the NSC option at the end of the income year. Accounting presentation for these sheep could be made on the same basis as outlined in Example Four. A separate herd scheme account for those mature sheep valued on the herd scheme would also be included in the sheep reconcilia- tion account for income tax purposes. This formula automatically adjusts the average cost per head for purposes of the average cost inventory system where stock are moved from NSC to the herd scheme at the end of any income year. If an extra 300 mature sheep were to be moved to the herd scheme at the end of the income year, the calculation would change to the following: Avge = ((1,200 - 600) x $24) + (900 - (1,200 - 600) x $26.88) Cost900 = (600 x $24) + (300 x $26.88) 900 =$22,464 900 = $24.96 per head This average cost per head would then be applied to the 900 mature sheep still being valued under the NSC option. Example Five - Average Cost Inventory System where the Herd Scheme was used in the Previous Income Year or is to be used in the Current Income Year to value some Sheep 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) - Appendix Example Six - Use of the Minimum Standard FIFO Inventory System in Accounting for Mature Livestock Valued under the NSC Option The minimum standard FIFO inventory system is discussed in paragraph (12) of the Determination. There is no set formula approach to this system. Using the sample flock structure, and following assumed mature livestock (sheep) number intakes and standard costs in earlier years, an example of the FIFO system in practice is shown below. Year of IntakeNumber ofStandard Cost (31 March)Mature Sheep(in each year) 1998†(current yr)600$29.88 1997600$28 1996500$27 1995700$26 1994 350$24 2,150 The first part of the FIFO calculation makes the adjust- ment to numbers on hand at the end of the income year. The oldest inventory on hand (1994) is the first to be offset by the new intake for the year. The next oldest inventory group is then accounted for (and so on) until the number removed from the oldest groupings (1994, 1995 and 1996) exactly equals the total of sales and deaths for the current income year: Year of OpeningLess SalesPlus CurrentClosing IntakeStockand DeathsYear Intake(on NSC) (on NSC)(on NSC) 1998 N/A+ 600600 1997600600 1996500500 1995700- 250450 1994350- 3500 TOTAL:2,150- 600+ 6002,150 Note:It is not necessary to actually count the new intake of mature sheep entering the FIFO system at the end of an income year. This will automati- cally be calculated along the total line in the above table as: Closing No. MINUS Opening No. PLUSSales/deaths 2,150-2,150+ 600 = 600 The following table calculates the change in value of mature livestock (sheep) on hand at the end of the income year. This table automatically takes into account any change in numbers, the new standard cost for the current year, and the offset of the oldest inventory against sales and deaths.

Opening and closing numbers will only relate to the livestock valued under the NSC option. Sales and deaths, however, will be the total for both NSC and the herd scheme stock, and the intake for the year will be a maximum of the closing number valued under NSC. Refinements to the minimum standard FIFO system are allowed, including adjustments that allow a class by class breakdown and incorporate the average standard cost relating to the livestockís actual year of intake. Note:For the purposes of illustrating the FIFO system, the historical costs used in the above example are purely hypothetical, and have been set on a relatively steep curve in order to clearly differen- tiate between intake years. Example Seven - Transition from the Trading Stock Scheme to NSC in the 1992-93 Income Year This example outlines the inventory treatment under the average cost and FIFO inventory systems in the 1992-93 transition year (for mature livestock). For purposes of this example, it is assumed that all mature sheep were valued on the Trading Stock Scheme at the end of the 1991-92 income year, and that all are transferring to NSC at the end of the 1992-93 income year. The same procedures will apply if a partial move to the herd scheme also occurs. The average cost calculated for the 1992-93 livestock intake (using Example Two) has been recalculated to include opening hoggets at the Trading Stock Value of $14.28 per head ($8,568 in total). This average cost for the 1992-93 livestock intake of sheep is calculated to be $29.35 per head. (This would reduce to $26.33 per head if the herd scheme were to be adopted for some sheep because of the requirement to include breeding sires under that scheme.) The closing value of mature sheep in the 1991-92 income year using Trading Stock values is summarised in the following table: (continued at top of opposite column) (continued on page 20) 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) - Appendix Value of Stock on Hand Year ofOpeningClosingHistorical Opening Closing IntakeNumberNumberCostValueValue (on NSC) (on NSC)$$$ 1993N/A60029.350 17,610 2T Ewes60060019.51 11,706 11,706 MA Ewes1,00095011.88 11,880 11,286 5-6 yr Ewes 40009.733,8920 MA Wethers 100011.501,1500 Br.

The increase in value of $6,779 would be eligible for the 5 year transitional spread in this example as opening and closing sheep numbers are the same. Further Comments on the Transition Paragraph 27 allows item d of the formula in paragraph 4 (or paras 5 or 6 for cattle) of the determination to be either the 1992 trading stock scheme standard value, or the NSC calculated for the 1992-93 income year, as follows: Opening StockValue for “d” 600@ $14.28 =$8,568 (para 27(a) value) 600@ $16.80 =$10,080 (para 27(b) value) The $16.80 is the result of the calculation in Example One. Where the herd scheme is to be used in association with NSC to value a livestock type, particular attention must be given to calculating the opening inventory stock numbers and value. The series of calculations involved is contained in paragraph†(31) of the Determination. In effect, the formulae associated with setting the opening inventory values for 1993 (in paragraph 31) remove any livestock which is to be valued on the herd scheme on a class by class basis. The formulae effec- tively perform the following operations, laid out in tabular form.

Average Cost per Head = $33,823 2,150 = $15.73 per head Using the formula contained in Example Four (para- graph (13) of the Determination), the average closing value of stock is calculated as: Avge =((2,150 - 600) x $15.73) + (2,150 - (2,150 - 600) x $29.35) 2,150 = $19.53 per head In this example, because stock numbers at the start and the end of the 1992-93 income year are the same, the increase in value of stock on hand ($3.80 per head amounting to $8,170 in the example) is eligible for the 5†year transitional spread.

For purposes of this example, the following hypothetical pig farming operation is as- sumed. Pigs Farmed During YearNo.Purchase Cost No. of pigs 10 to 17 weeks2,000N/A sold or on hand No. of weaned pigs purchased400$28,000 to be grown on($70/head) No. of pigs 10-17 weeks at opening 300N/A Purchases of older pigs (sows)30$6,000 ($200/head) NSC for pigs to 10 weeks of age $74.10 NSC for growing pigs 10 to 17 weeks $56.10 The formula for standard cost calculation for the growing pigs 10 to 17 weeks of age (as contained in paragraph (7) of the Determination) is shown below: ((a - b - c) x d) + ((a - c) x e) + f a - b - c + g Where: a is the number of growing pigs which at any time during the income year were aged between 10 and 17 weeks of age and which were sold during the income year or are on hand at the end of that income year; b is the number of weaned pigs purchased by the taxpayer during the income year for the purposes of rearing to about 17 weeks of age or older; c is the number of pigs on hand at the beginning of the income year which were valued as growing pigs 10 to 17 weeks of age; d is national standard cost for the income year for pigs in the weaners to 10 weeks of age category of livestock; e is the national standard cost for the income year for pigs in the growing pigs 10 to 17 weeks of age category of livestock; f is the aggregate purchase cost of pigs purchased at the age of weaning or older during the income year by the taxpayer; g is the total number of pigs purchased by the taxpayer at the age of weaning or older during the income year. On the basis of this formula, the calculation is made as follows: Std =((2,000 - 400 - 300) x $74.10) + ((2,000 - 300) x $56.10) + $34,000 Cost2,000 - 400 - 300 + 430 = (1,300 x $74.10) + (1,700 x $56.10) + $34,000 1,730 = $225,700 1,730 = $130.46/head This standard cost will be applied to all pigs over the age of 10 weeks on hand at the end of the income year. Note: (i) The breeding stock may be kept separate and accounted for through an inventory system (or different valuation option such as the herd scheme) in preference to applying the current yearís standard cost to these stock on hand. (ii) Weaned pigs up to the age of 10 weeks (excluding suckling pigs) on hand at the end of an income year and valued under the NSC option do not require a standard cost calculation. They will be valued directly at the announced NSC for that age class of pigs on hand at the end of an income year.

Background The livestock valuation regime which took effect from the 1992-93 income year provides a specific valuation method for any specified livestock farmed on the Chatham Islands. In past years livestock on the Islands had been valued at market values because the national values announced for mainland livestock far exceeded the true value of the Islandsí animals. The new valuation regime authorises the Commissioner to fix a herd value ratio for animals farmed on the Chathams. This is covered under section 86E (7) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Ruling A comparison of the on-farm values of sheep and beef cattle with the National Average Market Values for the past two years shows that the Islandsí values average out at 30% of mainland values. Setting the herd value ratio at 0.3 means that Chatham Islands farmers may, if they so elect, value their sheep and beef cattle at 30% of the National Average Market Values (herd values) announced for the 1992-93 income year. By making this election farmers in business on the Chathams will be benefit from the ìvalue proofingî of the herd scheme. Farmers will also have the option of using any of the new valuation methods of National Standard Costs, Self Assessed Costs and the market value/replacement price options. The fixing of the Chatham Islands herd value ratio has been limited to sheep and beef cattle, as these are the only type of livestock farmed on the Islands. Future Ratio Reviews We will review the Chatham Islands ratio yearly, and amend it if it becomes significantly out of line. Self-Assessed Cost - Dual Product Multiplier for Dairy Goats In the guidelines for developing self assessed costs for sheep, dairy cattle, beef cattle, deer and goats published in the Appendix to TIB Vol 4 No.7 March 1993, the dual product multiplier for dairy goats was incorrectly published as 0.67. The correct dual product multiplier is 0.33. Corrections to Calculation Forms - Livestock Revaluation Income IR 3F form The present set-out and wording of the IR 3F form gives an incorrect net farming income figure for farmers who elect to spread livestock revaluation income. Livestock revaluation income results from changes to the livestock valuation system which first applied to the 1992-93 income year. The additional income that may arise from the change in valuation methods can be calculated on form IR 3FV. Farmers can spread the revaluation income over a five year period instead of returning it all in the 1992-93 income year. When using the form IR 3F, the livestock on hand at the end of the year figure (page 1) will include the livestock revaluation income, as that livestock has been valued under the new rules. If a farmer elects to spread the revaluation income, to arrive at the correct Net farming income, the revalua- tion income should be deducted as an expense on page 2 (use the Other expenses box.) Remember that at least 20% of the revaluation income must be included as income for the 1993 income year. There is a box provided for this on the IR 3F. IR 3FV form Since we issued the IR 3FV form, it has been brought to our attention that the form gives incorrect instructions for calculating revaluation income for taxpayers who used the herd scheme for a class of animal for the 1991- 92 income year. In the ìNotes for Guidanceî the amount to go in Column 3, îIf you used the Herd Scheme in 1991-92,î should be the National Average Market Value for the 1992-93 income year, (not the 1991-92 year as stated in the guidance notes.) This aligns the calculation of the revaluation income with the legislation. Where a class of livestock has been valued under the herd scheme in the 1991-92 income year there will only be a plus or minus amount of revaluation income where a farmer has elected to use a Herd Value Ratio other than 1.0. 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) - Appendix Assigned Percentages of High-Priced Livestock For the 1992-93 income year the existing 1991-92 straight line rates of depreciation will be continued. However, livestock owners will have the choice of applying diminishing value rates for livestock pur- chased in the 1992-93 income year instead of the straight line rates. Economic rates will be introduced for the 1993-94 income year. As part of the review of the old livestock valuation regime, the Livestock Valuation Consultative Commit- tee concluded that the depreciation of high-priced livestock should be brought in line with the treatment of other depreciable assets. It also recommended that the depreciation rates applying to high-priced livestock be set at their economic rates. The Government agreed with the Committeeís recommendation. The existing straight line depreciation rates as detailed below will be continued for the 1992-93 income year, and economic straight line depreciation rates will be set for the 1993-94 income year. In line with the treatment accorded to other depreciable assets, taxpayers will have a choice of the existing rates or economic rates for 1993-94 LivestockStraight LineEquivalent CategoryRateDiminishing Value Rate Sheep25%33% Cattle20%26% Stags20%26% Other Deer15%22% Goats20%26% Pigs33%40% The diminishing values rates are calculated as per Schedule 23 of the Income Tax Act. A taxpayer who wishes to apply the diminishing value rate to an animal must clearly use the diminishing value rate in the financial statements that support the tax return. Once a taxpayer makes this election it is irrevocable. If there is no such clear use of the diminish- ing value rate, the straight line rate applies. (continued on page 24) Taxation Reform Bill (No.7) 1993: Livestock Valuation for Tax Purposes The Taxation Reform Bill introduced in Parliament on 5 August 1993. Clauses 20-27 and 39-41 of this Bill contain proposed amendments to the treatment of bailed livestock. The general effect is to ease the transition for bailors to the new livestock valuation regime. Unless stated to the contrary all the following proposed amendments apply from the 1992-93 income year. Tax Treatment of Bailed Livestock A bailment is usually a long-term lease of livestock where the person leasing the livestock (the bailor) does not expect the actual livestock leased to be returned, but expects animals of the same quality and quantity to be returned at the end of the bailment by the bailee (the person who uses the livestock during the term of the bailment). The Livestock Consultative Committeeís recommendation that bailors and lessors of livestock be excluded from using national standard cost (NSC) or self assessed cost (SAC) was agreed by Government and enacted. An exception was made that where the bail- ment was more akin to the grazing out of livestock (with the expectation that the original livestock would be returned at the end of the bailment); national stand- ard cost or self assessed cost could be used if certain criteria were met. Bailors were provided with a transitional five-year spread to move to the herd scheme, the market value option, the replacement price option, or a transitional scheme solely for bailed livestock. The spread applies to the additional income arising in the 1992-93 income year as a result of a person moving to another livestock valuation method. This transitional scheme was avail- able only to bailments in existence as at 2 September 1992 or where a binding agreement to enter a bailment existed at that date and Interest Rate for Adverse Event Income Equalisation Scheme The adverse event income equalisation scheme interest rate for deposits on or after 1 April 1993 is 4.7%. The adverse event income equalisation scheme helps farmers smooth their income flows. The Livestock Valuation Consultative Committee considered that the Government should not gain financially from this smoothing and therefore should pay a market interest rate to farmers who deposit money into the scheme. The Government agreed to the recommendation that a market interest rate should be paid. The adverse event income equalisation interest rate has been set by reference to the six month Government stock rate after taking into account that deposits to the adverse event income equalisation scheme are out of pre-tax rather than after tax income. The Governor-General set a rate of 4.7% by Order in Council. 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) - Appendix Because the capped values can be used, no transitional spread is available for the cost of moving livestock from the capped value provision to other schemes, the increased flexibility under the herd scheme would allow livestock to be moved to that scheme on an animal by animal basis. The Bill also provides for elections already furnished and those which may be furnished before the Bill is enacted. Any notice of election to value livestock under the 70% of the national average market value option shall be treated as not being made unless it clearly identifies, or is subsequently confirmed as identifying, whether the taxpayer wishes to use the capped standard value option or the 70% rolling average option. The Commissioner has been given the discretion to extend the time in which elections can be furnished to cover cases where a taxpayer wishes to revise an election already furnished with a return. Livestock Placed At Use Of Another Person The treatment of bailed livestock has been amended to provide for arrangements where livestock is placed at the use of a farming entity for no fixed fee and the return to the bailor is dependent on the profit of the business. This type of arrangement is most commonly based around a partnership where a partner places livestock at the use of the partnership but retains legal ownership and in return shares any profits earned by the partnership. In effect this arrangement is a way of pooling trading stock when commencing a business, rather than a bailment arrangement. Given this, it is appropriate to allow bailors to use national standard cost and self assessed cost where all the persons involved are treated as one taxpayer. To qualify for this provision the bailment must meet the test of being a profit sharing arrangement, meaning: ï the bailor must make the livestock available to the other party without a specified fee; and ï the return to the bailor is dependent on the profits of the business in which the livestock is used; and ï the bailor directly or indirectly participates in the profit or losses of the business in which the livestock is used; and ï where the livestock is bailed to a partnership, the bailor is a partner in the business to which the livestock is bailed and is bound by the liabilities and obligations of the Partnership Act. Where an arrangement qualifies as a profit sharing arrangement the bailor may use national standard cost or self assessed cost provided that the bailor's livestock values are calculated as if the bailor, the person using the livestock and any other person making livestock available to the person using the bailorís livestock under a profit sharing arrangement, were one person. (from page 23) ï the livestock had been valued under the former trading stock scheme for 1991-92 income year; or ï where a class of livestock was not owned in the 1991- 92 income year was acquired and bailed on or before 2†September 1992 or subject to a binding agreement to bailment at that date. It allowed bailors to value their bailed livestock at 70% of the national average market value. After approaches by people concerned about the tax treatment of bailments the Minister of Revenue an- nounced a review of the tax treatment of bailed live- stock. The review concentrated on the transitional treatment applying to taxpayers who entered into bailments before the announcement of the new livestock valuation regime. Proposed Amendments to the Treatment of Bailors Transitional Treatment of Bailed Live- stock The transitional provisions applying to bailed livestock have been amended in two ways. The Bill proposes to amend the transitional scheme for bailments or agree- ments to bail in existence as at 2†September 1992 to provide closing values based on 70% of a three year rolling average of the relevant national average market values. This replaces the current approach of a straight 70% of the relevant national average market value. The ruling average approach spreads the transition to higher values rather than impacting in one income year. In effect, this duplicates the now repealed trading stock scheme without the capping. This provision is available permanently to those who elect, with their 1992-93 tax return, to use the provi- sion. It does not expire unless the bailment ceases or the bailor elects another valuation option. If another valuation option is elected, however, this provision cannot be re-adopted. The second proposed amendment is an introduction of a new transitional provision allowing bailors to continue to value bailments or agreements to bail in existence as at 2†September 1992 at the capped 1991-92 trading stock values until the end of the 1996-97 income year. At the end of that year the bailor must adopt either the herd scheme, the market value option or replacement price. The option to use 70% of three yearsí worth of national average market values will not be available at that time, nor will the transitional spread. This provision is intended for those winding up bailments before the end of the 1996-97 income year or who cannot afford to move to another valuation scheme currently but will be able to by 1996-97. 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) - Appendix Other Amendments Included in Reform Bill The Government has agreed to replace the current method of determining the national average market values with a survey based upon the opinions of live- stock valuers. The livestock valuer survey, known as the ìsnapshotî, is considered more accurate than the previous method, especially in the case of female breeding stock. The Government also decided that the date on which the snapshot should be undertaken should be 30 April each year for all livestock types to allow for early release of the national average market values. This proposed amendment applies from the 1993-94 income year. The adoption of the 30 April snapshot date requires a consequential amendment to bring the provisions relating to the calculation of differential herd values (the option to value a type of livestock at 90% - 130% of the national average market values) into line. For the 1993-94 income year and future years a farmer adopting a differential herd value will be required to value a type of livestock as at 30 April rather than 15 May, as currently provided by the legislation. The provisions relating to the treatment of persons required to make a joint election to value livestock under a particular livestock valuation scheme have been amended. Where no valid election exists livestock will be valued at market value in the case of bailed or leased livestock or livestock subject to a profit sharing arrange- ment. In all other cases where no joint election is received national standard cost is applied. A number of changes have been made to the income equalisation scheme and the adverse event income equalisation scheme to consolidate under one Crown Bank account deposits to the income equalisation scheme and the adverse event income equalisation scheme This will allow for quicker movement of funds and updating of accounts. A number of minor drafting errors are also corrected. These changes apply from 1 April 1993. The high-priced livestock scheme has been amended to remove a drafting error which prevented livestock being transferred from the high-priced livestock scheme to other schemes when depreciated to on or below the national average market value. The bailment provisions have been tidied up to provide that the transitional provisions apply in all cases to bailments and binding agreements to bail livestock entered into on or before 2†September 1992 (the an- nouncement date of the amended treatment of bailed livestock). Other issues addressed by Government The Livestock Valuation Consultative Committee proposed that separate North Island and South Island national standard cost values for pigs be set. However, the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1993 provided for national pig values. The Committeeís reason for proposing separate values was the likelihood of substan- tial differences in national standard cost value between the two islands. This difference has not arisen so national values will continue to be set for pigs. Average Market Values of Specified Livestock - 1993 The Governor-General has announced the average market values of specified livestock for the 1992-93 income year, by Order in Council. The values have been announced later than usual this year due to a review of the way they are worked out. The Government has trialled a "snapshot" valuation method (recommended by the Livestock Valuation Consultative Committee) alongside the existing sales-based system. Government has decided that the ìsnapshotî valuation of ìon-farmî values gives a more accurate value of the livestock on a farmerís property at or near the end of year balance date. The values listed below apply to animals valued under the herd scheme. Trading stock values are not shown this year as that scheme has been repealed from 1†April 1992. Animals not valued under the herd scheme must now be valued under one of these new options: ï national standard cost ï self assessed cost ï replacement price or market value. High Priced Livestock The trigger price for high priced livestock purchased in the 1992-93 income year is now the greater of: ï $500, or ï five times the greater of (a) the national average market values listed below, or (b) the national average market values declared for the 1991-92 income year. 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) - Appendix Type ofAverage MarketHigh-Priced Livestock Classes of LivestockValue Per HeadThreshold $$ SheepEwe hoggets40.10500.00 Ram and wether hoggets40.60500.00 Two-tooth ewes47.00500.00 Mixed-age ewes (rising three-year and four-year old ewes)41.60500.00 Rising five-year and older ewes35.20500.00 Mixed-age wethers35.10500.00 Breeding rams151.70876.50 Beef cattleBeef breeds and beef crosses: Rising one-year heifers324.001,620.00 Rising two-year heifers474.002,370.00 Mixed-age cows616.003,080.00 Rising one-year steers and bulls427.002,135.00 Rising two-year steers and bulls612.003,060.00 Rising three-year and older steers and bulls757.003,785.00 Breeding bulls1,499.009,635.00 Dairy cattleFriesian and related breeds: Rising one-year heifers451.002,255.00 Rising two-year heifers799.003,995.00 Mixed-age cows917.004,585.00 Rising one-year steers and bulls318.001,635.00 Rising two-year steers and bulls521.002,605.00 Rising three-year and older steers and bulls699.003,740.00 Breeding bulls1,030.005,265.00 Jersey and other dairy cattle: Rising one-year heifers393.001,965.00 Rising two-year heifers693.003,465.00 Mixed-age cows824.004,120.00 Rising one-year steers and bulls240.001,765.00 Rising two-year and older steers and bulls460.002,685.00 Breeding bulls842.004,210.00 DeerRed deer: Rising one-year hinds123.00615.00 Rising two-year hinds232.001,160.00 Mixed-age hinds277.001,385.00 Rising one-year stags188.00940.00 Rising two-year and older stags (non-breeding)310.001,550.00 Breeding stags1,999.009,995.00 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) - Appendix Type ofAverage MarketHigh-Priced Livestock Classes of LivestockValue Per HeadThreshold $$ DeerWapiti, elk, and related crossbreeds: Rising one-year hinds156.00780.00 Rising two-year hinds282.001,410.00 Mixed-age hinds329.001,645.00 Rising one-year stags216.001,080.00 Rising two-year and older stags (non-breeding)369.001,845.00 Breeding stags2,043.0010,215.00 Other breeds: Rising one-year hinds60.00500.00 Rising two-year hinds98.00500.00 Mixed-age hinds125.00625.00 Rising one-year stags83.00500.00 Rising two-year and older stags (non-breeding)120.00600.00 Breeding stags426.002,130.00 GoatsAngora and angora crosses (mohair producing): Rising one-year does24.00500.00 Mixed-age does26.00500.00 Rising one-year bucks (non-breeding/wethers14.00500.00 Bucks (non-breeding)/wethers over one year17.00500.00 Breeding bucks124.00620.00 Other fibre and meat producing goats (cashmere or Cashgora producing): Rising one-year does17.00500.00 Mixed-age does20.00500.00 Rising one-year bucks (non-breeding)/wethers13.00500.00 Bucks (non-breeding)/wethers over one year14.00500.00 Breeding bucks77.00500.00 Milking (dairy) goats: Rising one-year does53.00500.00 Does over one year64.00500.00 Breeding bucks152.001,000.00 Other dairy goats34.00500.00 PigsBreeding sows less than one year of age149.00745.00 Breeding sows over one year of age253.001,265.00 Breeding boars340.001,700.00 Weaners less than 10 weeks of age (excluding sucklings)45.00500.00 Growing pigs 10 to 17 weeks of age (porkers/ baconers)124.00620.00 Growing pigs over 17 weeks of age (baconers)178.00890.00 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) - Appendix National Standard Cost Values for Livestock - 1993 The National Standard Cost (NSC) scheme for valuing livestock was introduced in the new section 86C of the Income Tax Act 1976 (the Act). The 1992 - 93 income year is the first year it has operated. Under the authority of section 86C(1) of the Act the Governor-General has declared the national standard costs for the income year commencing on 1 April 1992. The costs are listed in the table below. Fibre Goats The table above gives the breeding, rearing and growing (BRG) costs for rising 1 year animals and the rearing and growing (RG) costs for rising 2 year animals - apart from pigs which show the BRG for weaners up to 10 weeks of age and RG costs for growing pigs between 10 and 17 weeks of age. Under the national standard cost scheme, a farmer applies a national standard cost value to homebred stock, and values purchased stock at their purchase price. The farmer then applies the average of these costs to stock on hand at yearís end to derive a closing value. This approach is used to determine the value of rising one year and rising two year immature stock (and rising three year male non-breeding cattle). Once livestock reach maturity the cost assigned to a particular animal is held until the animal is sold or dies. Example In 1993 a farmer home breeds 1,000 lambs and purchases 400 lambs during the year for $25.00 a head. In this example we have used the BRG figure for the 1992-93 year from the table above ($13.00) Calculation 1,000 homebred lambs at $13/head$13,000 400 purchased lambs at $25/head$10,000 1,400$23,000 Average cost per lamb = $23,000 1,400 = $16.42/head In the following income year (1993-94) the opening value of hoggets on hand will be $16.42/head. The farmer will add to this the RG cost for that year (say $7.50). Providing there are no purchases of sheep in that income year the closing value of two-tooths on hand at year's end will be $23.92. Any purchases of mature sheep will need to be averaged and added to this cost as follows: Type ofNational Livestock Classes of LivestockStandard Cost $ SheepRising 1 year13.00 Rising 2 year7.50 Dairy cattle Purchased bobby calves119.00 Rising 1 year232.00 Rising 2 year58.50 Beef cattle Rising 1 year109.00 Rising 2 year62.70 Rising 3 year male non-breeding cattle (all breeds)62.70 DeerRising 1 year31.20 Rising 2 year18.10 Meat and Rising 1 year9.90 Rising 2 year6.00 Dairy Goats Rising 1 year52.70 Rising 2 year9.70 PigsWeaners to 10 weeks of age74.10 Growing pigs 10 to 17 weeks of age56.10 29 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993) - Appendix Calculation 400 opening hoggets at $16.42/head$6,568 Rearing and growing cost of opening numbers (400 x $7.50) $3,000 200 sheep purchased at $30/head (average) $6,000 600$15,568 Average cost per mature sheep =$15,568 600 =$25.94/head For the 1992-93 income year the opening value for the rising two year classes will be the 1991-92 closing value for the rising one year class.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.3 (September 1993) New TIB Index, and Upcoming Articles We're posting out an updated index to the Tax Information Bulletin with this issue. This index covers all the issues from Volume One, No.1 to Volume Five, No.2. There's also a full list of Inland Revenue's booklets on page 13. We'll be publishing this list in most TIBs from now on. In the next few months we'll be releasing policy statements on these topics in the Tax Information Bulletin: ï Repairs and maintenance policy resulting from the new depreciation regime ï When Inland Revenue can grant relief from payment of tax in cases of financial hardship ï The GST implications of funding from regional health authorities to rest homes and private hospitals ï Tax implications of the benefits from belonging to a frequent flyer scheme ï Various qualifying company statements We'll publish these statements as soon as we've finished consulting with external commentators. The IR 10 and Section 25 of the Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction We've recently been asked to re-state Inland Revenue's policy on filing the IR†10 Accounts Information form instead of financial statements with a tax return. Background The IR 10 is an integral part of Inland Revenueís E-File system. We use it for providing information to the Statistics Department and to build up data for audit case selection. Accountants and taxpayers who file returns manually (i.e., who donít use E-File) may either send in an IR†10 or a set of financial statements with tax returns. How- ever, we are encouraging accountants to use both the E- File system and the IR 10. There have been some concerns with the IR 10. Specifi- cally, there is a lack of information disclosure when using an IR†10 compared with the information disclosed in the financial statements. This could affect how Section 25 of the Income Tax Act 1976 applies to reassessments after the four year time limit has passed. Problem 1. Income shown in statements, but not in IR 10 A taxpayer who filed an IR 10 instead of financial statements may be disadvantaged if an audit/investiga- tion of back year returns reveals a discrepancy. If such a discrepancy is in an item that is recorded in the finan- cial statements (obtained during the audit/investiga- tion), but which did not need to be recorded on the IR†10, section 25(2) could be used to reopen the statute- barred assessment with the argument that full disclosure was not given in the return for that particular item. This problem does not exist when financial statements are filed with the tax return. If a reassessment is not issued for the item before the four year time limit has passed, then Inland Revenue is statute-barred from re- opening that assessment because full disclosure was made to Inland Revenue with the return. 2. All Mention of Income Omitted The details of income to be recorded on the IR 10 do not cover all income sources. Two situations can occur where there will be omission of income when filing a return (either manually or through the E-File system) with an IR 10. a) If an item of assessable income did not have to be recorded on the IR 10, but has been recorded in the financial statements. b) The income is omitted completely from the financial statements, and is not included when calculating taxable income. Policy Inland Revenue will be applying the following policy when auditing/investigating back year returns which were filed with an IR 10: If an audit/investigation reveals an item incorrectly recorded in the financial statements which is deemed to be either assessable income or non-deductible expendi- ture, but which did not have to be so recorded on the IR†10, then - If no conclusive evidence is held to prove a fraudulent or wilful misleading by the taxpayer, no statute-barred back year assessment will be re-opened under section 25(2). If there is conclusive evidence that a taxpayer in- tended to fraudulently or wilfully mislead, then continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.3 (September 1993) FBT - Prescribed Interest Rate from 1 July 1993 The prescribed interest rate used to calculate the fringe benefit value of low interest employment-related loans has been lowered to 8.5% for the quarter commencing 1†July 1993. The new rate will apply to all subsequent quarters unless it requires further revision. This rate reflects the continued reduction in market interest rates. The prescribed rate was previously 9.0% for the quarters commencing 1†October 1992, 1†January 1993 and 1†April 1993. Big Reduction in Tax Debt for Second Year in a Row Inland Revenue has reduced the amount of overdue tax owed by $119†million in the last year. This is the second year in a row that there has been such a reduction. At the end of June 1993 the collectible debt was $970 million, compared to $1,089 million for the 1992 year. Collectable debt excludes money which cannot be retrieved while an objection to a tax assessment is unresolved, or which is owed by a person in the process of bankruptcy. Inland Revenue's new debt systems have been a major factor in the drop in debt level. Staff were also more effective at chasing people up faster, since our systems automatically take initial recovery actions. Inland Revenue collects nearly $40 in outstanding tax for every dollar we spend to retrieve debt. Better systems combined with staff efforts have also helped us to dramatically reduce the number of out- standing tax returns during the year to 30†June 1993. from page 1 section 25(2) will be applied to re-open statute-barred assessments. If an audit/investigation reveals an omission of income then - If the omission is because disclosure was not required on an IR 10, (but the income was recorded in the financial statements which were not filed with Inland Revenue), then this will not be a reason for re- opening a statute-barred assessment. If the income was omitted from the financial state- ments then section 25(2) may be applied to re-open a statute-barred assessment. In some cases there is no provision on the IR 10 to show an item, but it must still be disclosed in a Disclosure Return, IR†4A (covering ìinter-related arrangementsî) or in a Property Disclosure Return, IR†4T. If the profit on an item has been disclosed in either of these returns, there is not an omission of all mention of the item. This means there will not be reason to reopen an assessment. This is the case whether or not the profit in the disclo- sure return is recorded in the IR†10. If a Disclosure Return IR 4A, or a Property Disclosure Return, IR 4T, has not been furnished, the above policy on income which is not mentioned will apply. Note: If someone is a party to a financial arrangement which must be disclosed to Inland Revenue under section 64H of the Income Tax Act 1976, s/he must file a Disclosure Return (IR 4A) or a Property Disclosure Return (IR 4T) as appropriate. However, this return wonít have to be filed if there is a reporting exemption for the arrangement. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.3 (September 1993) Questions We’ve Been Asked This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that we've received. We've published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts.

Section 75 - Income Credited in Account or Otherwise Dealt With: A taxpayer asked when he should return the interest on his investment, which was credited to his account. The terms of the investment prohibited the taxpayer from receiv- ing the interest income until the investment matured. Interest income is assessable in the year the taxpayer derives it. Section 75 deems the taxpayer to have derived the interest when it is credited to the taxpayer’s account. Resident withholding tax is deducted at the time the interest is credited to the taxpayer’s account. In this case the taxpayer must return the interest in the income year that it is credited to his account, even though he doesn't have access to the interest. 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.3 (September 1993) Retired Scientist's Research Expenses Section 104 - Expenditure or Loss Incurred in Production of Assessable In- come: A retired scientist asked if he could deduct the costs of continuing his research from his investment and superannuation income. He will not derive any income as a result of his further research. Under section 104 expenditure is only deductible if the taxpayer incurs it in gaining or producing assessable income, or in carrying on a business for that purpose. This taxpayer is not incurring this expenditure for the purposes of gaining or producing assessable income, as the research bears no relationship to his invest- ment or superannuation income. He cannot deduct the research expenses even though he was previously employed to carry out this type of research. If the taxpayer was still employed to carry out his research, section 105 (which deals with expenses against income from employment) would preclude a deduc- tion for this expenditure. Deductibility of Postgraduate Courses Section 104 - Expenditure or Loss Incurred in Production of Assessable In- come: A doctor asked whether he could claim a deduction for the costs of a postgraduate course in accounting. Taxpayers cannot claim any expenses against their salary or wage income. Only taxpayers who are self-employed may claim deductions for postgraduate course fees. However, these postgraduate courses must be in the same field as the taxpayer‘s present expertise, or be an extension of that field. In this case the postgraduate course was unrelated to the doctor's present exper- tise; it was not an extension of his current field. Therefore, he could not claim a deduction for the costs of the course. Costs of Providing Information for Completing Accounts Section 165 - Expenditure Relating to Determination of Liability to Tax: A self- employed taxpayer asked whether he could deduct the costs of completing his financial statements from his assessable income. Before the taxpayer’s account- ant could complete the financial statements, the accountant needed to update the taxpayer's business books and obtain additional information from the taxpayer. Under section 165(2)(a) taxpayers can deduct expenditure that they incur in connection with calculating or determining their assessable income. Preparing financial statements, and the work necessary to allow such preparation, is ex- penditure incurred in connection with calculating or determining a taxpayer's assessable income. This means the taxpayer can claim the costs of preparing a financial statement as long as s/he has not already claimed a deduction for that expenditure elsewhere under the Act. 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.3 (September 1993) GMFI Where Partial Benefit Received Section 374E - Guaranteed Minimum Family Income Credit of Tax (“GMFI”): A single parent asked whether she was entitled to receive GMFI. She worked 20 hours per week in paid employment and received a “top-up” in the form of a partial Domestic Purposes Benefit (“DPB”) from Social Welfare. Under section 374E(3), a person must be a “qualifying person” to be eligible to receive GMFI. A qualifying person is defined in subsection (1) and excludes “... any person who, ..., receives an income tested benefit, ...”. Because this taxpayer is receiving the DPB (which is an income tested benefit), she is not entitled to receive GMFI. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 GST on Sales of Farm Land Goods and Services Tax Act: A taxpayer asked why a purchaser of farm land who enters into a sale and purchase agreement could claim a GST refund before the completion of the sale. A purchaser (the recipient) of goods or services pays GST on the supply of those goods or services. The recipient can recover the GST (also known as input tax) paid for goods or services that are purchased in the course of the recipient’s taxable activity. The GST can be claimed in the taxable period that the supply was made to the recipient. Section 9 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 determines the time of supply of goods or services. Generally, this will be the earlier of the time an invoice was issued or the time the supplier received any payment for the supply. A registered person must hold a tax invoice to be able to claim an input tax credit. In some instances, an unconditional agreement for the sale and purchase of land will meet the requirements of a tax invoice. Then, the recipient will be able to claim back the GST content of the purchase in the taxable period when the sale and purchase agreement was signed. Therefore in some cases, a purchaser may be able to recover the GST paid on the purchase of the land before the actual completion of the sale. No GST on Fines Imposed by Statute Section 2 - Taxable Supply: A taxpayer asked whether a court fine for a civil offence included a GST component. The GST Act imposes GST on the supply of goods or services by a registered person in the course of a taxable activity. Paying a fine for an unlawful act is not payment for a “supply” of goods or services. Accordingly, paying a fine for an offence against a statute or regulation is not a taxable supply for GST purposes, so the fine does not include a GST component. Surrender of a Commercial Tenancy Lease Section 5 - Supply of Goods: A registered person asked what his GST liability would be when he surrenders his commercial lease. A surrender value is being negotiated with the owner of the building. continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.3 (September 1993) A lease is a conveyance of the possession of property for a fixed period. For GST purposes, the lease will normally be a supply of goods and the lump sum pay- ment the owner receives will be subject to GST. The surrender of a commercial tenancy lease also represents a supply of goods. The supply is subject to GST when made by a registered person in the course of a taxable activity. Services Supplied by Overseas Resident - GST Liability Section 8(2)(b) - Supply of Services In New Zealand: A consultant from Ger- many asked whether his technical advice to a company in New Zealand would be subject to GST. He worked for a period of three weeks in New Zealand. Under section 8(2)(b), a supply by a non-resident to a GST-registered person in New Zealand is deemed to be supplied outside New Zealand, as long as the supply was for the NZ resident's taxable activity. Such a supply will not be liable for GST unless both the supplier and the recipient agree that the supply takes place in New Zealand. In this case, the GST Act deems the consultant to have supplied technical advice outside New Zealand. There was no agreement between the parties that the supply would take place in New Zealand, so there is no GST liability. Gift Concession On Imported Gifts Section 12 - GST On Imported Goods: A taxpayer asked whether presents sent to her two children by her mother from Australia would incur customs duty and GST. The value of the presents total $NZ100. Bona fide gifts sent from overseas residents to New Zealand residents are al- lowed an exemption from customs duty and GST if the values of the gifts do not exceed $NZ110. Where the gifts are for more than one person the exemption is $NZ110 per person. Any amounts over the exemption are liable for customs duty and GST. NZ Customs will not collect Customs Duty and GST where the combined total is $50 or less. In this situation the presents were for two people. This means that gifts to the value of $NZ220 qualify for the exemption. Tax Invoices For Amounts up to $50 Section 24(5) - Tax Invoice Not Required: A treasurer for a non-profit body asked if supporting tax invoices are required for the non-profit body's returns to be amended. He had come across some old receipts dating back to 1991, none of which were for more than $50. The organisation had not claimed input tax for these receipts previously. Section 24(5) does not require a tax invoice to be issued by a supplier if “...the consideration in money for a supply does not exceed $50”. As none of the receipts exceeded $50, tax invoices are not required for the GST returns to be amended. from page 5 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.3 (September 1993) Refund Of Credit Interest offset against Tax Debt Section 46(2) - Interest Payable Offset Against Arrears: A registered person asked why she could not receive the credit interest on her December 1992 GST return. Inland Revenue had transferred her credit interest along with the actual refund to offset her income tax arrears . Under section 46(2), Inland Revenue may offset any refund of GST or interest payable against debts owing under any of the other Inland Revenue Acts. Inland Revenue must give written notice to the registered person that the refund is being offset against the other revenue. We must give this notice within 15 work- ing days following the day on which we receive the return. In this situation, the registered person received notification of the transfer within the 15 day period. Therefore, we were not required to refund the interest pay- able. Estate and Gift Duty Act 1968 Gift Duty Exemptions for Superannuation Assignments Section 74 - Exemption for Certain Elections by Members of Group Superannuation Schemes: A taxpayer asked whether he would incur gift duty if he elected to receive a reduced pension from his Government Superannuation Scheme. In return his wife would also receive a pension. Section 91B of the Government Superannuation Fund Act 1956 (“GSF Act”) allows a contributor to the fund to elect to surrender up to one-half of his/her superannuation entitlement. The contributor's spouse would then receive an immediate payment of the contributor's pension. Section 74 now provides a gift duty exemption for members of group superan- nuation schemes. The exemption applies to members who elect under the GSF Act to receive a reduced pension, in return for the payment of a pension to the member’s spouse. Accordingly, the taxpayer did not incur any gift duty liability on electing to receive a reduced pension. 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.3 (September 1993) Legal Decisions - Case Notes This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

In this case Inland Revenue also suffered no real prejudice. Facts:A widow and the executors of her late husband’s estate applied under section 5A of the Matrimonial Property Act 1963 for leave to commence proceedings out of time. The proceedings involved a claim for a share of the deceased’s estate to be vested in the widow and an order that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue reassess the estate duty payable. The application was delayed beyond 12 months after the grant of probate due to the deceitful inaction of the widow’s solicitor. 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.3 (September 1993) Decision:Master Towle granted the widow leave to commence proceedings out of time. The Court considered that section 5A of the Matrimonial Property Act 1963 was designed to protect the beneficiaries of an estate. The evidence showed that the widow had a strong claim and that she was not responsible for the delay in application. In this case, although the amount of estate duty would be reduced if the claim were successful, Inland Revenue would suffer no real prejudice if leave were to be granted. Comment:Inland Revenue has not yet decided whether to appeal this decision. Application to have Taxation Review Authority Decision Set Aside Rating:•• Case:Murray Darnill Limited and Darnill's Food Market Limited v Taxation Review Authority & Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1993) 15 NZTC 10,253 CCP 77/ 91 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, Sections 27, and 30 - 33; Inland Revenue Department Act 1974, section 43; Judicature Amendment Act, section 4(1) Keywords:“judicial review”, “striking out”. Summary:On 27 November 1991 the taxpayer applied for judicial review of a TRA hearing, to have the decision of the TRA set aside. This case is the hearing of Inland Revenue’s application, which sought to have the taxpayer’s application for judicial review dismissed. The Master held that the taxpayer’s application was unlikely to succeed, but he gave the taxpayer a further 7 days to amend the statement of claim. Facts:Inland Revenue disallowed a deduction of $235,826 for the purchase of land five years ago. The taxpayer objected, and Inland Revenue disallowed the objection. A case was stated to the TRA. On 4 September 1990 the TRA found that it had not been shown that the Commissioner acted incorrectly. On 27 November 1991 the taxpayer applied for judicial review to have the TRA decision set aside. This case dealt with Inland Revenue's application to have the taxpayer’s request for a review of judicial proceedings dismissed. Inland Revenue submitted that the taxpayer’s statement of claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action, and it was an abuse of process. We submitted that there was no jurisdiction to review proceedings because section 27 of the Income Tax Act 1976 excluded judicial review proceedings, and that the time limit requirements of section 43 of the Inland Revenue Department Act 1976 meant that the court could not hear the issues raised in the original case. The taxpayer alleged in the statement of claim that the decision was invalid, because the Authority did not give a proper or fair hearing on the basis of the information available to it, and it misdirected itself as to the relevant law. Master Hansen considered sections 27 and 30 to 33 of the Income Tax Act 1976. He reviewed statements made in various cases including, CIR v Lemmington Holdings Limited \[1982\] 1 NZLR 517, Challenge Realty Limited v CIR \[1993\] 1 NZLR 42, Re Preston \[1985\] 1 AC 835, Richardson v CIR \[1986\] 9 TRNZ 261, ER Squibb & Sons New Zealand Limited v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8,096, and Miller v CIR (Auck- land M103/93, unreported decision 10/6/93). continued on page 10 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.3 (September 1993) from page 9 Decision:Master Hansen held that the pleadings in their present form were an allegation that the Commissioner and the TRA were wrong in law. Counsel for the tax- payer argued that they were seeking to review the process adopted in making the assessment, rather than the assessment itself. Master Hansen considered the application for judicial review was unlikely to succeed given the form of the pleadings and the considerable delay, but he considered the taxpayer should be given an opportunity to amend the pleadings. He struck out part of the state- ment of claim and gave the taxpayer a further 7 days to file an amended state- ment of claim. Comment:Inland Revenue is appealing this decision. Loss on Sale of Shares Rating:•• Case:TRA 92/104 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, sections 65(2)(e) Keywords:“Purpose of selling”, “intention”, “motive”, “circulating capital” Summary:A taxpayer’s objection to disallowance of a deduction for losses on share trading was allowed. The dominant purpose at the time of acquisition was sale at a profit. The transactions were of a revenue character. Facts:The objector purchased shares in BIL between December 1986 and November 1987. He took up a one-for-ten issue in January 1988, and also took dividends in shares instead of cash. He sold the shares in July 1990 at a loss of over $67,000, and sought to claim the loss as a deduction. The objector stated that his intention had been to hold the shares and then sell for a quick capital profit. He had significant income from other investments and a history of investing for income. There was no evidence of a pattern of share trading, or of systematic portfolio review. Inland Revenue submitted the shares were purchased for growth and as a long term investment, and were only sold when the objector ceased to regard the investment as sound. Judge Barber found the evidence of both parties to be reliable. The objector’s evidence of purpose was accepted. Decision:If a profit on a transaction would be assessable under any limb of section 65(2)(e), then the outlay on the transaction is made on revenue account, not capital, and any loss is deductible. The objector's dominant purpose inten- tion at the time he acquired each parcel of shares was to sell them in the future at a profit. In terms of the principles in Inglis, the share purchase monies were circulating capital and revenue. The assessment was to be amended in favour of the objector. Comment:Inland Revenue is not appealing this decision. 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.3 (September 1993) Frivolous or Vexatious Proceedings Rating:•• Case:TRA 92/22 and 92/17 Act:Inland Revenue Department Act 1974, Section 39 Keywords:“Frivolous or Vexatious” Summary:The taxpayer sought to litigate matters that were or should have been litigated in an earlier proceeding. The cases stated were held to be vexatious and an abuse of the processes of the Court and were struck out. Facts:The objectors objected to assessments for the 1983 to 1988 years. In a pre-hearing call-over the objectors contended that it would be necessary to relitigate some of the issues disposed of in an earlier case to which one of the objectors was party. Inland Revenue applied for an order that the objections were frivolous or vexa- tious or made solely for the purposes of delay. Decision:It was held that it was an abuse of the processes of the Court to allow a proceed- ing to continue once it becomes apparent that it will involve an attempt to relitigate matters that were or should have been litigated in an earlier proceed- ing. In some cases it may be possible to sever the material which is an abuse of the court process from other material which is not, but in this case the objectors were actively seeking to mingle the two. It was also held that the cases stated were not brought solely for the purposes of delay. Comment:We do not know whether the taxpayer will appeal this decision. Deductibility of Unrealised Loss on Preference Shares Rating:•• Case:TRA 92/84 and 92/83 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, sections 65(2)(e) and 104. Keywords:“loss on redemption of specified preference shares” Unrealised loss” Summary :The case concerned whether an unrealised loss on the redemption of specified preference shares was deductible. The TRA found that the shares were acquired for the purpose of disposal in terms of section 65(2)(e), and in terms of the prin- ciples in Inglis the losses were revenue and deductible. Facts:The objectors purchased 50,000 50 cent redeemable preference shares on 24 Au- gust 1988 for $22,405 including brokerage fees of $405. The shares were to be redeemed on 31 May 1989 for $25,000. The company that issued the shares collapsed and was delisted from the stock exchange and the shares became worthless. The objectors sought to deduct the loss of $22,405 under section 65(2)(e) in the year ended 31 March 1990, as their dominant purpose at the time of buying the shares was to make a profit. Inland Revenue argued that the transaction did not come within section 65(2)(e) and that the objectors did not acquire the shares for any business or for the dominant purpose of re-sale. We argued that the purchase was not part of any undertaking or scheme and therefore any profits would not have been assess- able under 65(2)(e), so losses cannot be deducted. We also argued that a “re- demption” was not a sale or disposition as required by section 65(2)(e). continued on page 12 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.3 (September 1993) October 5 PAYE deductions and deduction schedules for last 15 days of September 1993 due - ìlargeî employers only. 7 First instalment of 1994 Provisional Tax due for taxpayers with June balance dates.

He also found that the redemption of shares in the context of this case is a disposition in terms of the second limb of section 65(2)(e). Accordingly, under the principles in the Inglis case, the share purchase monies were circulating capital and revenue and the losses deductible.

The regime applies to all dividends paid on or after 28†Sep- tember 1993. Background Currently New Zealand companies must deduct FDWP at the rate of 33% from any dividends they receive from foreign companies. Non-Resident Withholding Tax (NRWT) deducted by the foreign country is the only credit allowed against the FDWP payable in New Zealand. No credits are allowed for any underlying taxes that the foreign company has paid. The UFTC regime will allow taxpayers to claim a credit against any FDWP payable for underlying taxes that the foreign company has paid, as well as for the NRWT paid to the foreign country. Amount of FDWP payable - section 394ZM(1) The amount of FDWP payable is the greater of nil and the amount calculated using this formula: (\[a + b + c\] x d) - b - c where - a is the amount of the dividend paid after deducting NRWT b is the amount of any NRWT paid on the dividend c is the amount of UFTC calculated on the dividend d is the income tax rate for resident companies for the income year that covers the imputation year in which the dividend was paid. Eligibility for UFTC - Sufficient Interest - section 394ZMA(2) A company can only claim a UFTC if it is liable for FDWP. To qualify for a UFTC, the New Zealand company receiving the dividend must have a ìsufficient interestî in the foreign company. A company has a ìsufficient interestî if it has a voting interest or market value interest of 10% or greater in a foreign company and the foreign company is either: ï resident in a grey list country; or ï a Controlled Foreign Company (CFC); or ï a Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) for which the taxpayer is using the branch equivalent method to calculate the FIF income or loss. Summary of Amendment Acts Several Revenue Acts were enacted on 28 September 1993 The Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1993 amends the Income Tax Act 1976. The principal features are: ï relief from double taxation for foreign portfolio investors by refunding company tax ï the underlying foreign tax credit regime ï a new regime for the taxation of general insurance ï taxation of transfers of forests and forestry rights ï a new system for resolving tax disputes, including a test case procedure ï clarification of the treatment of employer-provided clothing for fringe benefit tax purposes ï a number of other remedial issues The Inland Revenue Department Amendment Act (No 2) 1993 amends the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 by providing for the exchange of information between the Inland Revenue Department and the Depart- ment of Social Welfare. The Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1993 amends the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The Estate and Gift Duties Amendment Act 1993 amends the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. The Stamp and Cheque Duties Amendment Act 1993 amends the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. The Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Amendment Act (No 3) 1993 amends the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 The Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act (No 2) 1993 amends the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) ìVoting interestî is determined by the taxpayerís right to appoint or elect the directors of the company. Eligible Accounting Year - section 394ZMA(1) A company can only claim a UFTC in an ìeligible accounting yearî. This is defined to mean any of the company's accounting years in which it meets these four conditions: 1. The company has a sufficient interest (see above) at all times in the accounting year. 2. The year is either (i) the year the dividend is paid; or (ii) the year immediately before the accounting year in which the dividend is paid; or (iii) an accounting year immediately before any eligible accounting year. 3. If the company is a low tax jurisdiction company, (i) the accounting year must end on or after 28 September 1993; or (ii) the accounting year must end after 1 April 1988, if the company is a CFC. 4. If the accounting year starts before the commence- ment date, the accounting year must be one for which the taxpayer has given details to Inland Revenue (see page†6). A ìlow tax jurisdiction companyî is any company resident in a country specified in Part A of the Seven- teenth Schedule to this Act. There must be no break in continuity of ownership between years before a yearís earnings and taxes can be taken into account. For example, a taxpayer may have a sufficient interest in a foreign company for three years. It then sells its shares in the company, and at a future date acquires a sufficient interest in the company. If it does this, it cannot use the earnings and taxes from the three year period to calculate a UFTC on dividends received. Situations where no UFTC is available - section 394ZMB(2) A company cannot claim a UFTC if: ï It is a qualifying company (defined in section 393A of the Act), or ï It doesn't have a sufficient interest in the company at the time it derives the dividend, or ï The dividend is paid on a fixed rate share, or ï The company paying the dividend can claim a deduction for it outside New Zealand, or ï The dividend is paid out of an amount that one company (Co.1) derives from another company (Co.2), and Co.1 was not liable for tax outside New Zealand on the dividend, yet Co.2 could claim a deduction for the dividend outside New Zealand. Dividends paid from lower tier companies - section 394ZMD A New Zealand company can claim a UFTC for tax paid by lower tier companies, as long as the NZ company has a sufficient interest in the lower tier company. The amount of the UFTC which can be claimed is limited to the tax paid by the lower tier company and the amount calculated using this formula: (\[ a + b + c\] x d) - c where - a is the amount of the dividend after the deducting any NRWT b is the amount of UFTC calculated c is the NRWT paid on the dividend d is the income tax rate for resident companies for the income year in which the dividend is paid. This formula effectively limits the foreign tax credit to the lesser of the foreign tax paid and the New Zealand tax on that income. Calculating the amount of UFTC - sections 394ZMC and 394ZME The UFTC regime distinguishes between dividends paid from companies resident in grey list countries and dividends paid from companies resident in non-grey list countries. Dividends paid from grey list countries are deemed to have tax paid equal to the New Zealand tax on the dividend income, but dividends paid from non- grey list countries are only allowed credits for actual tax paid. Dividends paid from companies resident in non-grey list countries A credit will only be allowed for actual tax paid on dividends paid from companies resident in non-grey list countries. The UFTC is calculated by allocating the proportion of foreign taxes paid on the foreign compa- ny's earnings to the dividend paid, on a pro-rata basis. This is achieved by the following formula: a x (b + c - d - e) (f - g - h) where - a is the amount of the dividend (before deducting any withholding tax) on which a foreign dividend with- holding payment must be made b is the aggregate amount of income tax paid or payable by the company for all eligible accounting years (excluding income tax deemed paid on dividends from lower tier companies) continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) ï comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Princi- ples (GAAP) of New Zealand and be audited, or (if these accounts do not exist) they must: ï comply with the GAAP of the country in which the foreign company is resident, or (if these accounts do not exist) they must: ï be used by the company for reporting to any central or state government or creditors unassociated with the company. Dividends paid from companies resident in a grey list country - section 394ZME(1) Where a company resident in a grey list country pays a dividend, deemed paid tax credits arise if all of the following conditions are satisfied: ï The company paying the dividend is resident in a grey list country. ï The company has been liable for tax in a grey list country in all eligible accounting years, because of where it is domiciled, resident, incorporated, or has its place of management. ï The company has been calculating its income without applying any of the preferences listed in Part A of the Sixteenth Schedule (apart from the preference listed in paragraph 1 of Part A of that Schedule, where the exemption is for a grey list country). The preference in paragraph 1 of Part A of the Sixteenth Schedule applies where a grey list company is carrying on business in another country and the income derived from that business is exempt from tax in the grey list country. As long as the business activity which is exempt from tax is being carried on in another grey list country, the use of this preference will not deny the New Zealand company from claiming deemed paid tax credits. ïEither the company has been a foreign company (as defined in section 63(1) of this Act) at all times during the period starting on (i) the first day of the third accounting year before the first accounting year in which the taxpayer had a sufficient interest in the company; or (ii) the company's incorporation date, where the taxpayer had a sufficient interest in the company when it was first incorporated or first acquired a sufficient interest in the company less than three years after the incorporation date, and ending with the time the dividend is paid; Or the company is a member of the same wholly- owned group of companies as the taxpayer at the time the dividend is paid. ï The company has maintained a tracking account (explained on page 5) for transactions occurring on or after the latest of these dates: (this will be the ìeffec- tive dateî) from page 3 c is the amount of income tax deemed paid by the company on dividends derived from lower tier companies in all eligible accounting years d is the amount of UFTCs the company claimed during an eligible accounting year (excluding the current year), calculated as if (i) for dividends the company didn't derive, assume the company did derive the dividends at a time when it had a sufficient interest in the foreign company; and (ii) for any dividend derived before 28 September 1993, assume this section applied at the time the dividend was derived e is the aggregate amount of dividends from grey list countries which are deemed to have tax paid credits attached to them paid in the current year calculated as if, for dividends the company didn't derive, the company derived them at a time when it had a sufficient interest in the foreign company f is equal to the greater of (i) the aggregate amount of the company's after- income tax earnings (less after-income tax losses) for all eligible accounting years; or (ii) the aggregate of (a) all dividends the company paid during the year (except dividends included in item h of the formula); and (b) the amounts of items g and h of this formula g is the aggregate amount of dividends the company paid during an eligible accounting year (excluding the current year) h is the aggregate amount of dividends paid during the current year on which the company: (a) is entitled to no credit; or (b) received dividends paid from grey list countries which have deemed paid tax credits; and where dividends not derived by the taxpayer were treated as if they were. Where the foreign company's financial statements are not prepared in New Zealand currency, the UFTC should be calculated in the foreign currency and con- verted to New Zealand currency on the day the dividend is paid. Earnings of a foreign company - section 394ZMA(1) A foreign company's after-income tax earnings amount is its after-tax net accounting profit. (This includes extraordinary items and the accounting provision for tax, but not statutory liabilities for tax). To qualify, the accounts must: 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) (i) 20†October 1992 (ii) The first day of the first eligible accounting year (iii) The first day of the accounting year in which the company elects to maintain a tracking account. If the company meets all of these conditions, it can use this formula to calculate UFTC: a x† b † (1 - b) where - a is the amount of dividend (before the deduction of any withholding tax); and b is the rate of resident companies tax, expressed as a percentage, applying in respect of the income year in which the dividend is paid. This will mean that dividends paid from grey list countries will be effectively exempt from FDWP. Note that if any of the conditions listed above do not apply, although the company will not be able to claim deemed paid tax credits, it may be able to calculate a UFTC for tax actually paid using the formula in section†394ZMC. The tracking account - section 394ZME(2) As stated above, one of the criteria for receiving deemed paid tax credits from a grey list company is that a company must maintain a tracking account for that company. A tracking account is needed so only credits for actual tax paid can be claimed where income earned outside the grey list is routed through a grey list company. The tracking account keeps a record of dividends that grey list companies receive for which a deemed paid tax credit would not arise if those dividends were received directly by the New Zealand company. Therefore, the tracking account keeps a track of the following divi- dends received by grey list companies: ï All dividends received by the grey list company (except those that are taxable in the grey list country) from companies resident in non-grey list countries (excluding New Zealand) ï All dividends received by grey list companies from other grey list companies in which the New Zealand company has an interest of less than 10%; and ï All dividends received by a grey list company from another grey list company to the extent to which the dividend would include tracked income if it were paid directly to the New Zealand company. Credits to the tracking account These items are referred to as applicable payments. They are credited to the tracking account: ï any standard dividends on which the grey list com- pany is not liable for tax. A standard dividend is defined to mean cash dividends, any loans that have been forgiven, any property that has been distributed to all shareholders to the extent the property's market value exceeds the consideration provided by the shareholder, any taxable bonus issue, any amount distributed as a reduction or return of share capital, and any income that a unit trust distributes to a unit holder ï Any other dividend on which the grey list company is not liable for tax, which is not: (i) a standard dividend; or (ii) an attributed repatriation; or (iii) a dividend arising from the difference between the rate of interest specified for FBT purposes and the interest rate in fact payable on a loan, to the extent the loan is treated as an applicable payment paid by a ìrelevant associateî ï Any amount that a relevant associate subscribes for shares issued by the company, to the extent the relevant associate has retained earnings ï Any loan that a relevant associate advances to the company, to the extent the relevant associate has retained earnings (except to the extent the company anticipates that the loan will be repaid within five years) ï Any amount a relevant associate pays which is not a dividend, but would be assessable income of the company if the company were resident in New Zealand ï If the company elects to have a later effective date, the company's retained earnings at the end of the account- ing year immediately before the year for which the taxpayer makes the election A relevant associate is a company that is associated with both the grey list company that receives the dividend and the New Zealand company that would receive dividends from the grey list company, and is a CFC or resident in New Zealand. Retained earnings Retained earnings is defined to mean the aggregate of shareholders' funds calculated under GAAP, less the aggregate of these amounts: ï The companyís paid-up share capital ï The companyís share premium account ï Any amount of shares subscribed by the company where that amount has been credited to another companyís tracking account ï Any principal balance of a loan outstanding which has been credited to another companyís tracking account ï Any other income which has been credited to another companyís tracking account. continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) 1993 balance date, the regime has a commencement date of 1 April 1993 for this company. However, the UFTC regime does allow companies to claim credits for taxes paid before the commencement date. To claim these credits, the company must furnish these details to Inland Revenue within two years from 28 September 1993 (or by such later date as Inland Revenue may allow if we are satisfied that the failure to meet the deadline is beyond the company's control): ï the company's earnings for any one or more consecu- tive accounting years immediately before the com- mencement date ï the income tax paid or payable on the earnings of those years ï dividends paid by the company during those years ï amounts of UFTCs on those dividends. Low tax jurisdictions The UFTC regime does not allow income tax paid by low tax jurisdiction companies to be claimed for pre- commencement years. An exception to this is where the low tax company is a CFC or where it has received dividends from a company not resident in a low tax jurisdiction. In the latter situation, the low tax jurisdic- tion company is deemed to derive and pay underlying taxes on only those dividends received from another company which is not resident in a low tax jurisdiction. Any New Zealand company that wants to claim a credit for taxes paid during those years must file appropriate details with Inland Revenue. Evidence of tax paid A company will be treated as having no amount of income tax payable on its earnings for an accounting year unless the company can furnish one of these to Inland Revenue: ï a copy of a receipt from the relevant revenue authority to confirm that the tax was paid ï a copy of the foreign company's tax return ï a copy of a statement of account from the relevant authority requesting payment ï Any other evidence which satisfies Inland Revenue that the amount is payable, such as an auditorís certificate. Inland Revenue may ask the New Zealand company for details of the calculation of the UFTCs claimed, details of any tracking account and information about taxes paid by lower tier companies. Interest paid in conduit financing arrangements - section 394ZMH Section 394ZMH is an anti-avoidance rule to protect the New Zealand tax base. This section denies a company interest deductions in circumstances where that com- These items should not be deducted: bonus issues or reinvested distributions made by the company, except to the extent to which such bonus issues or reinvested distributions: (a) are derived by another company as applicable payments; or (b) give rise to a FDWP liability; or (c) are derived by a shareholder of the company and are subject to income tax. Debits to the tracking account The following items are debits to the tracking account: ï Applicable payments paid by one grey list company to another grey list company if the New Zealand com- pany maintains a tracking account for both compa- nies; ï Dividends paid from the grey list company to the New Zealand company. Deemed paid tax credits are only available to the extent the dividend paid exceeds the amount calculated by multiplying the dividend by the lesser of 1 and the amount determined by the formula: a/b where - a is the credit balance of the tracking account on the last day of the accounting year; and b is aggregate amount of all dividends paid by the company during the accounting year. Where the accounts are not kept in New Zealand currency, they should be kept in the currency of the grey list company, and all dividends paid to the grey list company from non-grey list companies should be converted to the currency of the grey list company's accounts. An amount derived will be treated as being liable for income tax if the income is taxed but the taxpayer is able to offset the income with a benefit which reduces the tax liability (For example, a loss or a foreign tax credit which results in no income tax being payable in the grey list country). Where the tracking account only applies to part of a dividend, the part for which deemed paid tax credits cannot be claimed will be treated as a separate dividend and the UFTC on this dividend may be calculated on the basis of the amount of tax paid. Procedures for UFTCs - section 394ZMF Taxes paid before the commencement date The commencement date for all companies is the first day of the accounting year in which the enactment date falls. This means that if a company has a 31†March from page 5 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) pany can be seen as acting as a conduit for the financing of investments into grey list countries. The avoidance opportunity arises because dividends from grey list countries will be free of FDWP because they are deemed to be fully covered by overseas tax credits. The provision only applies where all of these conditions are met: ï A company derives dividends that are deemed to be fully credited. ï The same company pays interest to that company or to a person associated with that company. ï Non-residents own 50% or more of the company receiving the interest, and this company is not a CFC. Where the provision applies, interest is non-deductible up to the extent of the grey list country dividends. Interest on some dividend with- holding payments - section 394ZMG FDWP is payable quarterly. However, taxpayers will not have all the information to work out the UFTC until the end of the foreign companyís accounting year. For example, they will not know the foreign company's earnings for the current year or its tax payable on those earnings at the time when the FDWP is payable. Therefore, section 394ZMG requires taxpayers to estimate their FDWP liabilities and pay the correct amount of FDWP within one year of the 20th of April immediately following the end of the dividend-paying company's accounting year in which it paid the divi- dend. Interest will be payable to Inland Revenue if any FDWP is owing, and Inland Revenue will pay interest if FDWP has been overpaid. The interest rates will be the same as those for the provisional tax regime. Examples These examples show how the UFTC regime operates. Example 1 Dividend Dividend 50% 100% New Zealand Company Australian Holding Company Australian Company New Zealand Company (NZCo) owns 50% of Austral- ian Holding Company (OZHCo), which owns 100% of Australian Company (OZCo). OZCo pays $100 divi- dend to OZHCo, which pays a $100 dividend to NZCo. No NRWT has been deducted in Australia as the dividend is fully franked. To claim a UFTC, NZCo must have a 10% or greater interest in OZHCo and OZCo, which it does. As OZHCo and OZCo are resident in a grey list country, NZCo will be entitled to deemed paid tax credits. The tracking account of OZHCo and OZCo will have a nil balance as neither has received any dividends from companies resident in non-grey list countries or from companies in which NZCo has an interest of less than 10%. Therefore, NZCOís UFTC will be calculated using the formula in section 394ZME as follows: a x † b † (1 - b) where - a is the amount of dividend (before deducting any withholding tax); and b is the rate of resident companies tax, expressed as a percentage, applying for the income year in which the dividend is paid. Therefore a equals 100 and b equals 33%. UFTC = $100 x .33/.67 = $49 If this was the only foreign dividend that NZCo received, its FDWP position will be as follows: Dividend ($100 + $49)$149 FDWP @ 33%$ 49 Less UFTC $ 49 FDWP payableNIL This example illustrates that the deemed paid tax credit will apply where a New Zealand company receives a dividend from a company resident in a grey list country and the grey list company has not received any divi- dends from companies not resident in grey list countries or grey list companies in which the New Zealand taxpayer has an interest of less than 10%. Example 2 Assume NZCo also has an interest of 60% in a Korean Company (KCo) which is a CFC. KCo has been trading for two years and has accumulated accounting earnings of $500 on which it has paid taxes in Korea of $100. It has paid no dividends in the past to NZCo. KCo now pays a $200 dividend to NZCo which includes NRWT of $20. NZCOís underlying foreign tax credit will be calculated using the following formula: a x(b + c - d - e) (f - g - h) Where - a = $200e = 0 b = $100f = 500 c = 0g = 0 d = 0h = 0 (These letters are all explained on pages 3-4.) continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) UFTC = $100 x .33/.67 = $49 If this was the only foreign dividend received by NZCo, its FDWP position will be as follows: Dividend ($100 + $49)$149 FDWP @ 33%$ 49 Less - UFTC $ 49 FDWP payable NIL Year 2 In year 2, HKCo pays $100 dividend to OZCo. No NRWT is deducted in Hong Kong. This dividend is not taxable in Australia. OZCo pays a $200 dividend to NZCo. No NRWT is deducted from this dividend in Australia. The $100 dividend received by OZCo from HKCo will be credited to the tracking account of OZCo maintained by NZCo. Deemed paid tax credits will only be available where the dividend paid by OZCo exceeds the balance in its tracking account maintained by NZCo. The portion of the dividend paid to NZCo which is to come out of the tracking account is calculated by multiplying the dividend received by NZCo ($200) by the fraction: a/b where - a is the credit balance of the tracking account of OZCo at year end. b is the total amount of dividends paid by OZCo Therefore a = 100 and b = 200 Dividend paid from tracking account = 200 x 100/200 = $100 This means NZCo is treated as receiving two dividends from OZCo, a $100 dividend which will be entitled to deemed paid tax credits, and a $100 dividend which must have the UFTC calculated based on the amount of tax paid by OZCo. OZCOís UFTC It must be first worked out what share of taxes OZCo can attribute from HKCo. This is calculated using the formula: a x (b + c - d - e) (f - g - h) Where - a = $100e = 0 b = $50f = 300 c = 0g = 0 d = 0h = 0 (These letters are all explained on pages 3-4.) which = $100 x†$50† = $17 $300 Therefore OZCo will be deemed to have paid a further $17 of taxes. Therefore NZCOís underlying foreign tax credit will be $40, calculated as follows: $200 x$100 = $40 $500 The amount of FDWP that NZCo must pay on this dividend is calculated as follows: Foreign dividend ($200 + $40)$240 FDWP @ 33%$79 Less - Underlying foreign tax credit$40 - NRWT paid in Korea $20 $60 FDWP payable$19 This $19 FDWP liability may be offset by any credits in NZCoís branch equivalent tax account. Example 3 In this example, NZCo owns 100% of OZCo (resident in Australia) which owns 100% of HKCo (resident in Hong Kong). No income of HKCo is taxed in Australia. OZCo and HKCo derive the following income and pay the following taxes in their first two years of trading: ProfitTaxes Paid Year 1 OZCo$200$70 HKCo$100$20 Year 2 OZCo$300\*$100 HKCo$200$30 \* Includes $100 dividend from HKCo. Year 1 In year 1, HKCo pays no dividends to OZCo. OZCo pays a $100 dividend to NZCo. OZCo is resident in a grey list country so deemed paid tax credits will apply. The balance in the tracking account of OZCo is nil as it has received no income from companies resident in non-grey list countries or from grey list companies in which NZCo has an interest of less than 10%. Therefore NZCOís UFTC will be calculated using the formula: a x † b † (1 - b) where - a is the amount of dividend (before deducting any withholding tax); and b is the rate of resident companies tax, expressed as a percentage, applying for the income year in which the dividend is paid. Therefore a is equal to 100 and b is equal to 33% from page 7 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) NZCOís UFTC The deemed paid tax credit for the first $100 dividend will be calculated as follows: a x† b † (1 - b) where - a is the amount of dividend (before the deduction of any withholding tax); and b is the rate of resident companies tax, expressed as a percentage, applying in respect of the income year in which the dividend is paid. Therefore a equals 100 and b equals 33%. UFTC = $100 x .33/.67 = $49 The UFTC on the second $100 dividend paid from the tracking account will be calculated using the following formula: a x (b + c - d - e) (f - g - h) Where - a = $100e = $49 b = $170f = $500 c = $17g = $100 d = $49h = $100 (These letters are all explained on pages 3-4.) which = $100 x 89/300 = $30 If this was the only foreign dividend received by NZCo, its FDWP position will be as follows: Dividend ($200+ $49 + 30)$279 FDWP @ 33%$92 Less - UFTC ($49 + $30)$79 FDWP payable$13 This $13 FDWP liability may be offset by any credits in NZCo's branch equivalent tax account. Application Date The regime will apply to all dividends paid on or after 28 September 1993. continued on page 10 International Tax Amendments Branch Equivalent Tax Accounts Sections 394D, 394E, 394ZM, 394ZZP, 394ZZQ and 394ZZX, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction The Branch Equivalent Tax Account (BETA) system has been made more flexible so foreign dividend withholding payments (FDWP) can be offset against an attributed foreign income tax liability, as well as allowing tax paid on attributed foreign income to offset a FDWP liability. This will ensure that an early divi- dend from a controlled foreign company (CFC) will not cause double taxation. In summary, the new BETA account system allows: ï a BETA debit balance (arising from FDWP payments) to satisfy an attributed foreign income tax liability; ï attributed foreign income tax liabilities to credit a BETA account; ï a BETA credit balance to satisfy a FDWP liability; and ï FDWP liabilities to debit a BETA account. Background Previously, an early dividend from a CFC could result in double taxation. The BETA account system resulted in a timing problem in the first year if a CFC paid a dividend before tax on the attributed foreign income from that CFC was paid. FDWP, which is payable quarterly, would be due, as would tax under the CFC regime. The previous regime was not flexible enough to deal with such timing problems. It was not possible to offset FDWP payments against an attributed foreign income tax liability. Under the previous law a BETA credit balance could only be offset against FDWP liabilities or transferred to an imputation credit account. Key issues The major feature of the new BETA regime is that FDWP can now be offset against an attributed foreign income tax liability, as well as allowing tax paid (or losses offset) in respect of attributed foreign income to be offset against an FDWP liability. An early dividend received by a New Zealand company from a CFC will therefore no longer cause double taxation. Allowing FDWP paid to offset an attributed foreign income tax liability is achieved by providing that debits arise to a BETA account when FDWP payments are made (whether directly or by reducing a loss under section 394ZN) in respect of dividends received from CFCs (section 394ZZP(3)(a)). Section 394ZZQ(5) allows a company to use the BETA debit balance arising from FDWP paid to satisfy an attributed foreign income tax liability. A BETA debit balance is accordingly credited in payment of an attributed foreign income tax liability (section 394ZZP(1)(c)). Section 394ZZX, which limited refunds of tax paid on attributed foreign income to the amount of the BETA credit balance, has been repealed. The repeal is neces- sary because debits can now arise to a companyís BETA account for FDWP paid. 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) from page 9 International Tax Amendments Dividend Withholding Payments Sections 394D, 394ZN, 394ZO and 394ZV, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction The procedures for paying and refunding FDWP have been made more flexible. Inland Revenue may now allow late elections to offset losses against FDWP liabilities, and the ability to use losses to claim a refund of FDWP has been increased. Minor amendments have also been made as a consequence of an earlier amend- ment to section 394ZN allowing group losses to be offset against a FDWP liability. Election date to use losses to offset FDWP liability - section 394ZN A company must pay the amount of FDWP due to Inland Revenue within 20†days after the end of the quarter in which it was paid foreign dividends. A company can elect to use its own or any group losses to satisfy a FDWP liability. Previously, this election had to be made within the same period for payment of FDWP, i.e., within 20 days after the end of the quarter. Grouping of BETA debit balances The grouping of BETA debit balances is provided for under the new BETA regime (sections 394ZZQ(5) and 394ZZP(1)(c)). A debit balance in a companyís BETA account can be used to satisfy an attributed foreign income tax liability of another company in the same group. Grouping of BETA credit balances The previous BETA regime did not allow BETA credits to be transferred within a group of companies. The new regime will allow a BETA credit balance of one com- pany to be offset against the FDWP liability of another company in the same group (sections 394ZM(2), 394ZZP(3)(b) and 394ZZQ(3)). As BETA credits can arise in a companyís BETA account from offsetting the losses of other group companies against the company's attributed foreign income, it is consistent that the BETA credits of one company should be allowed to be offset against the FDWP liability of another group member. Reversal of BETA debit balances A reversal, by way of a credit arising in the BETA account, of BETA debit balances arising from FDWP paid will occur in the following circumstances: ï on a refund of FDWP paid to the company under section 394ZO (section 394ZZP(1)(d)); ï where the company has not satisfied the 66 percent shareholder continuity requirements from the time at which the debit balance arose (section 394ZZP(1)(e)); and ï where the company ceases to be resident in New Zealand (section 394ZZP(1)(f)). Credits and debits arising in ICA It is not possible under the new BETA regime to transfer non-loss related BETA credits to a company's imputation credit account, either by way of direct election (former section 394ZZQ(1)) or when the company offsets the credit balance in its BETA account against a FDWP liability. Accordingly, paragraphs (h) and (i) of section 394D(1) which provided for such transfers to be recorded as credits in an imputation credit account have been repealed. Such transfers are no longer necessary as tax paid on attributed foreign income will now credit both the imputation credit account and the BETA account. A credit will arise in a companyís imputation credit account equal to any credit balance existing in the companyís BETA account at the time of the transition to the new rules (28†September 1993). This ensures that such credit balances are not effectively lost. Because of the changes to the operation of the BETA account system, a further amendment provides that a credit arising to a companyís BETA account from tax paid on attributed foreign income will no longer result in a debit to the company's imputation credit account (achieved by the repeal of paragraph (f) of section 394E(1)). Tax paid on attributed foreign income will therefore give rise to a credit both in a company's BETA account and its imputation credit account. An attributed foreign income tax liability satisfied by way of crediting a BETA debit balance under section 394ZZQ(5) does not give rise to a credit in the compa- nyís imputation credit account (section 394D(1)(a)(vii)). Application date The amendments to the BETA account regime apply from 28†September 1993. 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) Inland Revenue may now extend the period for electing to meet a FDWP liability by offsetting a loss in any particular case. It is envisaged that Inland Revenue will use this discre- tion in cases where losses were available for offset against a FDWP liability within the 20 day period after the end of a quarter, although the election to use those losses was not made within this period. Any additional tax payable under section 394ZN(4) because FDWP has not been paid by the standard due date will be recalculated based on the later date allowed by Inland Revenue to elect to use losses to offset a FDWP liability. This amendment applies to dividends paid on or after 28†September 1993. Using losses of obtain FDWP refund - section 394ZO A company can now use its own carried forward and current year losses or those of other group members to obtain a refund of FDWP it has paid. Previously, a company could only use its own current year losses to obtain a FDWP refund. The treatment of losses in relation to obtaining FDWP refunds under section 394ZO is now consistent with that for elections to satisfy a FDWP liability by reducing a loss under section 394ZN. This amendment applies from 28†September 1993. Restriction on credit arising where losses used to satisfy FDWP liability - sections 394D and 394ZV Under section 394ZV(1)(a), a credit equal to the amount of FDWP a company pays is recorded in its dividend withholding payment account. A qualification to this provision is that a credit shall not arise to the extent that payment of FDWP has been satisfied by electing to reduce losses (section 394ZV(3)). The reason for this limitation is to prevent company losses being passed on to individual shareholders. With effect from the 1992-93 imputation year, a com- pany has been able to offset its FDWP liability against the losses of other companies in the same group (section 394ZN(2A)). A reference to this subsection has now been included in section 394ZV(3) to ensure that a credit will not arise in a dividend withholding payment account where the payment of FDWP has been by way of reducing the losses of another company in the same group as well as the companyís own losses. A similar amendment (i.e., insertion of a reference to section 394ZN(2A)) has also been made to section 394D(3) which prevents credits arising in the imputa- tion credit account of a company which does not maintain a dividend withholding payment account where the payment of FDWP has been satisfied by utilising losses. These amendments apply from the 1992-93 imputation year. International Tax Amendments CFC Life Insurers Section 245J(20A) and (25), Income Tax Act 1976 Where a CFC carries on a business of providing life insurance, or is owned by a CFC carrying on the business of providing life insurance, its assessable income or loss will be the amount that is actuarially determined to be its profit or loss with which the shareholders (and not the policyholders) are attributed. This provision does not apply where Inland Revenue: ï considers that the amount so determined is not a reasonable and fair reflection of the relevant profit or loss; or ï has requested and not received sufficient information to enable us to review the actuarial calculation. Foreign investment fund income or loss relating to a CFC life insurer which is determined to be an entitle- ment of the policyholders is not attributed to the New Zealand shareholders in the CFC life insurer. These provisions are necessary because a CFC foreign life insurer's income is mostly attributable to its foreign policyholders rather than its New Zealand shareholders. It is therefore not appropriate to attribute the policy- holder-related income of a CFC life insurer or its lower tier CFC or FIF interests to its New Zealand sharehold- ers. The previous section 245J(20A) only dealt directly with a CFC life insurer; it did not cater for the lower tier CFC or FIF interests of the CFC life insurer. 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) Definition of entitlement to benefit - section 245R(1) A definition of the term ìentitlement to benefitî has been inserted into the legislation. It clarifies that for the purposes of determining what is a foreign investment fund (FIF) interest, an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme or a foreign life insur- ance policy includes a contingent or discretionary entitlement. It is not considered that beneficiaries under the will of a person whose life is insured will be subject to the FIF regime because of this definition. However, it is clear that a policyholder's entitlement to benefit will include benefits of a discretionary or contingent nature. New market value definition - section 245R(1) The aggregate contributions method of measuring the market value of a foreign superannuation interest when using the comparative method of calculation may be used only on first entry to the FIF regime. This method of measuring market value deems the market value of a foreign superannuation interest to be an amount equal to the total contributions made. The definition may not therefore be used for the comparative value method of calculation on an on-going basis. Non-standard accounting years - section 245R(7) The non-standard accounting years provision in the FIF regime has been repealed. This provision was superflu- ous in light of an equivalent provision in section 245A(2)(f) which applies for all Part IVA purposes. De minimus exemption - section 245RA(2) The de minimus exemption from the FIF regime (applying when an individualís foreign investments do not cost more than $20,000) has been amended to ensure that expenditure incurred on a person's behalf - as well as expenditure directly incurred by the person - will be taken into account in determining whether the $20,000 threshold has been reached. This amendment will ensure that employer contribu- tions to foreign superannuation schemes are taken into account for the purposes of the de minimus exemption. If expenditure incurred on behalf of a person was not taken into account for the purposes of the de minimus exemption, significant foreign investments directly owned by individuals would not be covered by the FIF regime and therefore would not be taxed on a current basis. Life insurance policy death benefits - section 245RB(7) The exemption from the FIF regime of death benefits from foreign life insurance policies has been amended to apply when a person entered into the policy: ï before first becoming resident in New Zealand; or ï if the person was previously resident in New Zealand, during a period of at least ten years when the person was non-resident before becoming a New Zealand resident again. Using alternative methods to calculate FIF income or loss - section 245RC(8) An amendment has been made to clarify that where persons voluntarily elect to change their method of calculating FIF income or loss, the election must be in accordance with the various restrictions applying to voluntary elections. Comparative value method of calculation - section 245RD The comparative value method for calculating a per- sonís FIF income or loss has been amended to allow a deduction for expenditure incurred on the person's behalf in acquiring a FIF interest as well as for expendi- ture directly incurred by the person. In particular, the amendment will benefit members of foreign superannuation schemes, and will ensure that only the proportion of the underlying income of a scheme, not employer contributions, will be taxed as it accrues. Deemed rate of return calculation method - section 245RE For FIF interests held in the previous income year, the deemed rate of return method formula has been amended so that any expenditure a person incurs to acquire any more of the FIF interest during the current income year is taken into account. Under the deemed rate of return method, where a FIF interest is acquired or disposed of during an income year, the income year is divided into separate notional income years. The prescribed rate of return applying to each notional year is adjusted according to the number of days in each. The start and end of these notional income years has been clarified to ensure that there is no double counting of the date on which the acquisition or disposition International Tax Amendments Foreign Investment Funds 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) occurs. A notional income year will end either on the day the FIF interest is disposed of or on the day before the day on which the interest is acquired. A new notional income year will start either on the day after the day the FIF interest is disposed of or on the day the interest is acquired. Accounting profits calculation method - section 245RF The wording of the accounting profits method of calculation formula has been amended to refer to net after-tax accounting losses as well as profits. Similar amendments have been made to section 245RC(6), which sets out the restrictions on the use of the account- ing profits calculation method. Extension of BETA regime - section 245RH A taxpayer holding an interest in a second tier FIF interest will be allowed a BETA credit for tax paid under the FIF regime where a CFC or a FIF using the branch equivalent method is interposed between the taxpayer and the second tier FIF interest. The BETA regime will also continue to apply to FIF income calculated under the accounting profits or branch equivalent methods. The BETA regime applies as if: ï the FIF income were attributed foreign income of the person; ï the FIF were a CFC; and ï the FIF interest were an income interest (within the meaning of the CFC regime). The extension of the BETA regime to certain FIF interests and calculation methods is intended to avoid double taxation of dividend flows by allowing BETA credit balances to be used to offset FDWP liabilities. Taxation on distributions from foreign investment funds - section 245RI Under section 245RI, any distribution from a FIF interest already held on 2†July 1992 is assessable as a dividend, if that distribution would have been assessable had the FIF regime not been enacted, and to the extent that it exceeds the net FIF income derived. Section 245RI ensures that pre-effective date (generally 1 April 1993) accumulated earnings don't receive more generous tax treatment under the FIF regime than they would have before the FIF regime was introduced. The provision qualifies section 245RB(6), which provides that any person using the comparative value or deemed rate of return methods is deemed to derive no assessable income (other than FIF income) from a FIF interest. The previous exemption from section 245RI which applied to gains derived from a partial or total disposi- tion of an interest has been removed. It was unnecessary since the section only applies to gains which would have been assessable if the FIF regime hadn't been enacted (in particular, the section does not apply to non-taxable capital gains). The previous exemption was also unde- sirable as it may have exempted gains from certain types of disposition that were previously taxable. Income arising under section 245RI is now treated as FIF income rather than dividends. This amendment has the following results: ï income arising under section 245RI can now obtain the benefit of the transitional provision in section 245Y(10), which allows FIF income derived in the 1992-93 income year to be returned in the 1993-94 income year ï section 245RI income can now be offset against FIF losses and also be taken into account for determining the amount of FIF loss which may be offset against New Zealand sourced income under section 245RJ ï timing problems in calculating a FDWP liability on an amount that will not be known until after the end of an income year are removed. Minor drafting changes - sections 245N, 245RF, 245RJ, 245RK and 245RI A number of minor drafting changes which arose out of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1993 have also been made, such as corrections to several wrong cross- references. Application date All of the above FIF-related amendments have the same application date as the new FIF regime which was enacted by the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1993 (generally 1 April 1993). 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) Foreign Investor Tax Credit Regime Sections 308A, 4B, 327K, 375 and 394D, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction Double taxation of non-resident portfolio investors has been reduced. The total New Zealand tax on most distributed company income which is paid to non- resident portfolio investors will be limited to 33%, the same level of tax as on New Zealand shareholders. The relief from double taxation (a combination of company income tax and non-resident withholding tax) for non-resident portfolio investors is achieved by reducing the company tax (by way of a credit) which is charged on a company's income to the extent it is owned by non-resident portfolio investors. The company in turn will pass on this credit for company tax to its non- resident portfolio shareholders in the form of a supple- mentary dividend. Non-resident portfolio investors remain liable for non- resident withholding tax (NRWT) on dividends (includ- ing supplementary dividends) they derive from New Zealand resident companies. Where a companyís dividends are fully imputed the tax credit has been set so that the total New Zealand tax is 33% on distributed company income received by investors which are resident in countries with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement. The measures providing relief for non-resident portfolio investors from double taxation are mainly contained in new section 308A. Minor consequential amendments have also been made to the dividend definition, resident withholding tax, provisional tax and imputation credit provisions (sections 4B, 327K, 375 and 394D, respec- tively). Key features ï The regime applies to non-resident investors with less than 10% interests in New Zealand resident compa- nies. ï Only direct interests in New Zealand companies are taken into account in determining which investors are non-resident portfolio investors. The regime does not take into account indirect interests held through other companies (i.e., the corporate look-through rules do not apply). ï Associated person interests are aggregated when determining whether the interest of a non-resident investor constitutes a less than 10% interest. ï Underlying company tax is effectively refunded to non-resident portfolio investors, resulting in the total New Zealand tax on most company income distributed to non-resident portfolio investors being limited to 33%. ï The refund of company tax is achieved by allowing New Zealand companies a tax credit, which they will use to pay non-resident portfolio investors a supple- mentary dividend. ï The tax credit that a company receives is available only to the extent of imputation credits attached to the dividends that it pays to non-resident portfolio investors. The company can only use this credit to reduce company tax liabilities. If it has no such liability the credit is not refundable. ï Special rules apply where dividends have dividend withholding payment credits attached. ï If a company has paid no tax in the current year it can use the credit to refund tax paid in any of the four immediately preceding income years. ï The tax credit is offset against income tax payable after allowing for foreign tax credits but before allowing for imputation and resident withholding tax deductions. ï A tax credit received by a company can be claimed against the tax liability of another company in the same wholly owned group. ï A ìsafe harbourî rule applies to protect companies in certain circumstances where a supplementary divi- dend is paid to a non-resident investor which does not in fact qualify as a non-resident portfolio investor. ï Special rules apply to the application of the bench- mark dividend and anti-credit streaming rules. ï Specific statutory authority has been given to compa- nies to pay supplementary dividends to ensure that there is no conflict with company law rules. Background Previously, non-resident portfolio investors were double taxed on income distributed from New Zealand compa- nies. A New Zealand company pays tax at a 33% rate. A further 15% is levied on dividends, in the form of NRWT, resulting in a total New Zealand tax impost of 43% on pre-tax income. For countries with which New Zealand has no double tax agreement, the NRWT rate is 30% and the total New Zealand tax impost was there- fore 53%. In contrast, the total tax levied on New Zealand com- pany income which is distributed to New Zealand shareholders does not exceed 33% (provided the shareholderís effective tax rate does not exceed this level) because of the effect of the imputation system which prevents double taxation of New Zealand share- holders. The reason for this different treatment is that resident shareholders can use imputation credits to reduce tax on dividend income, but non-residents cannot. 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) Eligibility to receive supplementary dividend - section 308A(1) The tax credit is only available for dividends paid to non-resident portfolio investors. A ìnon-resident portfolio investorî is defined as any person (corporate or individual) not resident in New Zealand whose voting or market value interests in a New Zealand company are less than 10%. Only direct interests are taken into account in determin- ing whether a non-resident shareholder has a less than 10% interest in a New Zealand company. The corporate look-through rules in sections 8C(3)(d) and 8D(3)(d), under which interests held by companies in other companies are traced through and attributed to the ultimate individual shareholders, do not apply. The non-inclusion of indirect interests is intended to sim- plify the operation of the non-resident portfolio investor regime. Example If Foreign Co.A owns 20% of NZ Co. and Foreign Co.B owns 5% of Foreign†Co.A and 9% of NZ†Co., only Foreign†Co.Bís direct interest in NZ Co. is taken into account in determining whether it qualifies as a non-resident portfolio investor. Foreign†Co.Bís 1% indirect interest (i.e., 5% x 20%) in NZ†Co. is not aggregated with its 9% direct interest in NZ†Co., so it doesn't breach the 10% threshold. In determining whether a non-resident investor's interest constitutes a less than 10% interest, the interests held by any persons associated with the investor are aggregated with the investorís interests. The associated person definition used for section 308A purposes is that contained in section 245B, which generally applies to the controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund regimes. This definition includes as associated persons companies that have a 50% or higher common ownership; it also includes a company and an individual who owns 50% or more of that company. Example: If Foreign Co.A and Foreign Co.B are owned by the same persons, and Foreign†Co.A owns 5% of NZ†Co. and Foreign†Co.B owns 6% of NZ†Co., neither company would qualify as a non-resident portfolio investor. Example: If Foreign†Co. owns 7% of NZ†Co. and a non- resident individual owns 50% of Foreign†Co. and 8% of NZ†Co., neither Foreign†Co. nor the non- resident individual would qualify as a non-resident portfolio investor. Availability of the tax credit The tax credit is available only: ï to the extent of imputation credits attached to divi- dends received by non-resident portfolio investors; and ï where the company has paid the non-resident portfo- lio investor a supplementary dividend equal to the amount of the tax credit. Only one supplementary dividend may be paid with each dividend. This is to prevent the foreign investor tax credit regime being used to reduce the total New Zealand tax imposed on income distributed to non- residents to less than 33%. While the supplementary dividend does not need to be paid by the company at the same time as the normal dividend, it does need to be paid in the same income year as the dividend to which it relates. Calculating the tax credit - section 308A(2) The foreign investor tax credit regime reduces the tax which is charged on income earned by a company to the extent it is distributed to (and therefore attributable to) non-resident portfolio investors. The regime uses the imputation credits already allocated (which were previously unusable) to dividends paid to non-resident portfolio investors to calculate the value of the tax credit received by the company. The company in turn passes these credits on to non-resident portfolio investors in the form of a supplementary dividend. The amount of the tax credit is limited to the level of imputation credits attached to the dividend that the non- resident portfolio investor receives. This is to ensure that a credit is available only to the extent that full company tax at a 33% rate has been paid. The tax credit received by a company is calculated by multiplying the amount of post-credit imputation credits attached to the dividend by 0.5583. This means the credit is set at 0.5583 cents for every dollar of post- credit imputation credits attached to dividends paid to non-resident portfolio investors. This formula reduces the company's tax so that the total New Zealand impost on company income distributed to non-resident portfolio investors is no more than 33%, provided the dividends are fully credited at a rate of 33 cents of imputation credits per 67 cents of cash dividend and the NRWT rate is 15%. The amount of tax credit a New Zealand company will receive can be calculated directly by multiplying the imputation credits it would normally distribute on dividends paid to non-resident portfolio shareholders by 0.358275 (i.e., 0.5583/1.5583). Thus, if a company distributed $33 of imputation credit to its non-resident portfolio investors in the absence of this tax relief, then the credit would be $11.82. Table 1 (on page 16) illustrates the calculations for a company that pays tax at 33% on $100 of profit which is fully distributed net of tax to shareholders. The table sets out the different treatments for a New Zealand investor, a non-resident investor before the foreign investor tax credit regime, and a non-resident portfolio investor under the new regime. In the last situation it is continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) seen that the total New Zealand tax take is reduced to the level applying to New Zealand shareholders (i.e., 33%). This table assumes that the foreign investor is resident in a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agree- ment (i.e., the NRWT rate is 15%). It can be seen that under the foreign investor tax credit regime the credit reduces the companyís tax bill by approximately $12. The dividend received by the non-resident investor is increased by the same amount (in the form of a supplementary dividend) from $67 to $79. The $12 tax credit is approximately equal to: ï 35.82% of the pre-credit $33 of imputation credits ï 55.83% of the post-credit $21 of imputation credits ï 15% of the post-credit $79 dividend.

The credit has been set so that the total New Zealand tax impost is 33% on distributed company income paid to non-resident portfolio investors where company tax and NRWT are 33% and 15% respectively. Thus, the total New Zealand tax charged on income earned by non-resident portfolio investors resident in non-treaty coun- tries will exceed 33%. However, such investors will still receive a similar amount of benefit under the regime as investors from treaty countries. This table also assumes that the dividends paid by the company are fully imputed.

It also illustrates the effect of the new regime on the home tax treatment of non-resident portfolio investors. In particular, it shows that the non- resident portfolio investor regime results in an increased tax take for the home country of the investor. It is assumed that the home country and New Zealand have a double tax agreement.

Dividend with- holding payment credits represent payments of FDWP, whereas normal imputation credits represent company income tax payments. A difference between imputation and DWP credits from a non-resident investor perspec- tive is that non-residents cannot use normal imputation credits, but they can use DWP credits to meet their NRWT liabilities, with any excess credits being re- funded. The objective of the foreign investor tax credit regime is to reduce company tax attributable to non-resident portfolio investors so that, in most cases, the total New Zealand tax impost (including NRWT) on those inves- tors is not higher than the 33% tax rate imposed on most New Zealand resident shareholders. Effectively, the objective is to remove, in most cases, New Zealand double tax (a combination of company tax and NRWT) on income attributable to non-resident portfolio inves- tors. Where these investors receive a dividend with DWP credits attached, they can use the DWP credits to meet their NRWT liabilities, with any excess credits being refunded. Because of this there is no New Zealand double tax requiring relief. It would therefore be inappropriate to give foreign investor tax credit tax relief and continue to allow DWP credits to meet NRWT liabilities or be refunded for the same dividend. The legislation deals with this issue by effectively splitting a dividend into two components: ï the component that is not subject to double tax because any NRWT liability is absorbed by DWP credits (the DWP portion); and ï the remaining component representing income subject to both company tax and NRWT (the remaining portion). The effect of the legislation is to exclude the DWP portion of the dividend (including normal imputation credits attributable to that portion) from non-resident portfolio investor tax relief and allow tax relief only for the remaining portion. This is achieved as follows: The DWP portion is calculated according to the defini- tion of that term in section 308A(1). This defines the DWP portion as a/b where a is the amount of DWP credits attached to the dividend and b is the applicable NRWT rate. This is the amount of the dividend for which DWP credits fully cover any NRWT liability. Thus, with a 15% NRWT rate, every $1 of DWP credits translates into $6.67 of DWP portion. With a 30% NRWT rate, every $1 of DWP credits translates into $3.33 of DWP portion. continued on page 18 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) might extinguish its New Zealand tax liability under the foreign investor tax credit regime, leaving no New Zealand tax liability against which it could offset any available foreign tax credits. Such credits are lost if they are not offset against New Zealand income tax payable on foreign income in the same income year that the foreign income is derived. The credit for company tax available under this regime is offset against income tax payable by a company before allowing for imputation credits available under section 394ZE which are attached to dividends received by the company. This ordering rule allows a company deriving fully imputed dividend income to still utilise the tax credit available under the foreign investor tax credit regime. Such a company can convert resulting excess imputation credits into a loss which can in turn be offset against the income of other companies in the same group or carried forward by the company (subject to normal shareholder continuity requirements). The company tax credit available under section 308A is also offset against income tax payable by a company before allowing for resident withholding tax credits available under section 327K. This ordering rule is of benefit to companies receiving income from which resident withholding tax has been deducted, as excess resident withholding tax credits are refundable. Resi- dent withholding tax credits are offset against income tax payable by a company after allowing for imputation credits (section 327K(3)). Application of credit mechanism to wholly-owned groups - section 308A(3) Under the regime the company paying the supplemen- tary dividend to a non-resident portfolio investor is entitled to the tax credit. However, in a group of compa- nies, the parent company paying a supplementary dividend to a non-resident portfolio investor may have no tax liability of its own that it can offset the tax credit against, as the subsidiaries themselves pay the tax within the group. This situation is addressed by allowing a tax credit received by a company to be claimed against the tax liability of another company in the same wholly-owned group. For this to happen, the company that receives the tax credit must elect to do so by filing a written notice with its tax return for the relevant year. The four year credit carry back rule also applies to a wholly-owned group; a company may use a tax credit it receives to reduce tax paid by another company in the same wholly-owned group in the four years preceding the income year in which the dividend is paid. Anti-avoidance rule - section 308A(4) There is a general anti-avoidance rule which provides that a person will not qualify as a non-resident portfolio investor if an arrangement has been entered into Non-resident portfolio investor tax relief is calculated on the basis of normal imputation credits attached to a dividend. This by itself excludes DWP credits from giving rise to relief under the new regime. However, this is not sufficient. The entire DWP portion, including normal imputation credits attributable to that part of the dividend, should be excluded from relief calculations. Normal imputation credits are apportioned between the DWP portion and the remainder of the dividend on the basis of the percentage of cash dividend each represents. Normal imputation credits thereby attributed to the DWP portion are subtracted from the total imputation credits giving rise to the tax relief. Legislatively, this is achieved by section 308A(2)(d). Note that where DWP credits fully meet any NRWT liability on a dividend, no non-resident portfolio investor tax relief is available. Credit against company tax payable - section 308A(2) The tax credit is available against payment of the companyís income tax payable. The companyís terminal tax payment is therefore reduced by the amount of the credit to which it is entitled. Under the provisional tax system, a company paying provisional tax on the estimation basis will reduce provisional tax by the amount of credit it estimates it will have by the end of its income year. There is no requirement for a company to have paid any provisional tax before it pays a supple- mentary dividend. The supplementary dividend will give rise to a tax credit reducing terminal tax payable which will flow through to lower provisional tax payments. Credit carry back - section 308A(3) When the tax credit is calculated, it produces a reduc- tion in the current year tax liability. However, there could be cases where a company pays dividends with imputation credits but has no current year tax liability. This is because the imputation credits attached to the dividend paid in the current year relate to the taxable profits of prior years. This situation is addressed by allowing the credit to be used to refund tax paid in any of the four immediately preceding income years. Only tax relating to the 1993- 94 or later income years is refundable in this way. Otherwise, there would in effect be a retrospective refund of income tax paid before the foreign investor tax credit regime started. Credit ordering rules - section 308A(2),(3) The credit for company tax available under the non- resident portfolio investor regime is offset against income tax payable by a company after allowing for foreign tax credits available under section 293. If that were not the case, it is conceivable that a company from page 17 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) concerning the shares of the relevant New Zealand company, which has the purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the non-resident portfolio investor regime. Safe harbour rule - section 308A(5) A company could pay a shareholder a supplementary dividend on the basis that it considered the shareholder to be a non-resident portfolio investor but, in the absence of any other rule, be denied a tax credit because it is later discovered that the shareholder did not in fact qualify as a non-resident portfolio investor (by virtue of not being a non-resident or not having a less than 10% interest in the company). Accordingly, there is a ìsafe harbourî rule which is designed to provide more security for companies paying supplementary dividends. This safe harbour rule deems a person to be a non- resident portfolio investor relative to the company if all of these conditions are met: ï The person has a less than 10% interest in the company or the person (including that personís nominee or agent) has given written notice to the company that it qualifies as a non-resident portfolio investor. ï The person is not associated with the company. ï The person is not deemed under the anti-avoidance rule not to be a non-resident portfolio investor by virtue of any arrangement to which the company or an associate of the company is a party. ï The company does not have reasonable grounds for believing that the shareholder is not a non-resident portfolio investor. If the above requirements are satisfied the company can treat the shareholder as qualifying for tax relief under the foreign investor tax credit regime. It will not face any penalty if the person turns out not to be a non- resident portfolio investor. Where the safe harbour rule has resulted in a share- holder being deemed to be a non-resident portfolio investor but the shareholder does not in fact have that status, the shareholder becomes liable for an amount of income tax equal to the tax credit received by the company, plus any penalties (section 308A(6)). A nominee company can give notice to an issuing company that an investor qualifies as a non-resident portfolio investor. This gives the issuing company protection under the safe harbour rule. Such a nominee company does not become liable under the deemed agency provisions of section 283 if it transpires that the investor did not in fact qualify as a non-resident portfo- lio investor, provided the nominee company did not have reasonable grounds for believing that the investor was not so qualified. The issuing company itself is also not liable under the deemed agency provisions of section†283 in a situation where the safe harbour rule applies. Application of benchmark dividend and anti-credit streaming rules - section 308A(7) Where a company receives a tax credit under the regime, the companyís tax payments are reduced; this in turn reduces the amount of imputation credits available for distribution with dividends. It would defeat the purpose of the regime if this reduction in tax (and corresponding reduction in available imputation credits) combined with the benchmark dividend and anti-credit streaming rules to prevent companies: ï distributing the normal amount of dividend with the normal amount of credits attached; or ï paying supplementary dividends. To deal with this, companies are relieved from the benchmark dividend and anti-credit streaming provi- sions in the imputation and FDWP regimes in relation to the payment of supplementary dividends. Conse- quently, supplementary dividends can have no imputa- tion credits attached even though the normal dividend will have credits attached. For the purposes of the imputation regime benchmark dividend and anti-credit streaming rules, a company is also deemed to have attached an imputation credit to the normal dividend it pays out equal to the amount of the tax credit. This deeming provision is necessary to enable a company to pay the same level of imputation credits to its domestic and foreign shareholders and thereby not contravene the anti-credit streaming rules. Just as importantly, the deeming provision also ensures that the benefit of the tax credit that a company receives under the regime is passed on to its non-resident portfolio investors because otherwise there would be a breach of the imputation credit rules. A company that paid normal fully credited dividends to non-resident portfolio investors and a supplementary dividend would be deemed to have attached to the normal dividend additional imputation credits equal to the supplementary dividend. This would result in a breach of both section 394G(1) (the maximum imputation credit rule) and section 394(G)(2) (the benchmark dividend rule). To avoid such a breach the company would need to reduce the supplementary dividend to zero. Only by reducing the level of normal imputation credits by the level of tax relief available can imputation credit streaming rules be complied with. This is the right policy result because the tax relief itself reduces corporate tax and should therefore reduce the normal level of imputation credits. Section 394D(1)(a)(iva) provides that income tax paid by way of crediting under section 308A does not give rise to a credit in a companyís imputation credit account. Ability to pay supplementary dividends and company law requirements - section 308A(8) The payment of a supplementary dividend by a company to a non-resident portfolio investor is specifically deemed not to contravene: continued on page 20 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) ï to remove any doubt that any provision of the Compa- nies Act 1955 or any other rule of law could prevent companies from paying supplementary dividends even if their articles of association or constitutions specifi- cally permit such payments. A company may still insert a provision in its articles of association or constitution which prohibits the payment of a supplementary dividend provided such provision expressly refers to section 308A(8) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Application date The company tax credit is available for dividends paid on or after 28†September 1993. General Insurance Companies (Non-Life Insurance) Sections 208-210, Income Tax Act 1976 Significant changes have been made to the taxation of general insurers: ï reinsurance premiums paid to foreign reinsurers will become deductible; ï claims received on those policies will become assess- able; ï reinsurance premiums paid to foreign reinsurers will be subject to tax in New Zealand at 3.8% of the gross premium; ï the off-shore insurance income of New Zealand insurance companies will become assessable in New Zealand. The changes take effect from 1 July 1993. Sections 208 to 210 have been repealed and replaced. The changes bring the tax rules governing non-life insurance business into line with those for other busi- nesses. The present tax of 10% on direct placement insurance premiums, levied under section 209, is a proxy for taxing the New Zealand sourced income of foreign insurers. Foreign insurers can often claim a credit for this tax against the tax levied on the New Zealand sourced premium income in their home coun- try. Section 209 has now been extended to cover reinsurance premiums. Background - the previous regime The previous regime for the taxation of insurance (other than life insurance) companies was contained in sections 208 to 210A inclusive. Section 210A relates to resident Lloydís names and has not been affected by any of the changes in this Act. Resident non-life insurers Resident general insurance companies were previously the one exception to the rule contained in section 242 that income derived by any person resident in New Zealand is assessable for income tax in New Zealand, whether the income is derived from New Zealand or elsewhere. Section 208(1)(a) excluded from the income of a resident insurance company, income derived from insurance business carried on outside New Zealand. This exclusion also applied to any item of income that was connected with the insurance business carried on outside New Zealand. The exclusion did not, however, extend to income of the classes referred to in paragraphs (e), (f), (g), (h), (k), (l) and (m) of section 242(2). Income of these classes (which was deemed to be derived from New Zealand) continued to be taxable in New Zealand, regardless of whether the income was derived in connection with the companyís insurance business carried on outside New Zealand. Section 208(1)(b) did not allow general insurance companies a deduction, in calculating their assessable income, for reinsurance premiums paid out of New Zealand. Claims and recoveries received for losses on risks reinsured outside New Zealand were also excluded from the assessable income of the New Zealand insurer. Apart from the exceptions contained in section 208, which are discussed above, general insurers were generally subject to tax in New Zealand in the same manner as any other company. ï any provision of the Companies Act 1955 or section 45 of the Companies Act 1993; or ï the companyís articles of association or constitution; or ï any other rule of law. The reasons for this provision are as follows: ï to relieve companies of the need and cost of changing their articles of association or constitutions to author- ise the payment of a supplementary dividend to their non-resident portfolio shareholders ï to override section 45 of the Companies Act 1993, which prohibits companies from having constitutions which permit differential dividends to be paid to shareholders of the same class from page 19 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) Non-resident non-life insurers Non-resident insurers were liable for tax in New Zealand on premium income derived from insuring New Zealand risk. Section 209 applied to non-life insurance business placed directly with an overseas insurer where the insurer did not carry on business in New Zealand, or the premium was not included in the foreign insurerís income derived from New Zealand. It deemed the foreign insurer to derive a profit equal to 10% of the premiums paid. By applying the 38% tax rate applicable to companies not resident in New Zealand to the deemed profit of 10% of the gross premium, a New Zealand tax liability of 3.8% on the gross premium income arose. The person paying the premium was deemed to be the agent of the foreign insurer and liable to file tax returns and pay the tax assessed on behalf of the foreign insurer. There was no dichotomy in taxing premiums derived by corporate and non-corporate insurers under this section, as was the case with section 210, which applied only to non-corporate underwriters. Section 209(1B) specifically excluded application of the section to reinsurance. Non-resident non-corporate underwriters Insurance premiums paid by an insured person through an agent to any non-corporate underwriter who was not resident in New Zealand were assessed under section 210. It applied to both direct insurance and reinsurance premiums. The section deemed the underwriter to derive taxable profits equal to 10% of the premium payable under the contract to which the section applied. It was designed primarily with Lloydís syndicate underwriters in mind and as a support to section 209. Where a non-resident, non-corporate underwriter had an agent (as defined in section 210) in New Zealand and entered into a contract of insurance with an insured person resident in New Zealand, the non-resident underwriter was deemed to be carrying on business in New Zealand and subject to tax on that premium income accordingly. Although the section applied to placements of both direct insurance and reinsurance, section 210(6) pro- vided that the section applied only to contracts of reinsurance that exhibited the following characteristics: The contract had to be between a non-resident, non- corporate underwriter and a person in New Zealand who carried on the business of insurance, and was reinsuring a risk of any kind (other than life insurance). It was also necessary that there was an agent of the underwriter in New Zealand. The New Zealand agent of the underwriter was liable to make returns and pay the tax assessed on behalf of the foreign underwriter. Key issues of new regime Sections 208, 209 and 210 have been repealed and replaced by new sections 208 and 209. From 1 July 1993 New Zealand general insurance companies will become liable for tax in New Zealand on all income derived from insurance business carried on both inside and out of New Zealand. Likewise reinsurance premiums paid to foreign reinsurers will be deductible and any recoveries received on those reinsurance contracts will be assessable. Transitional rules The new section 208 applies only for the transition to the new rules. Once the transitional period has elapsed section 208 will have little, if any, application. The transitional rules deal with bringing into the tax base the assets and liabilities that New Zealand insur- ance companies use for the purposes of insurance business carried on out of New Zealand. The rules also determine the treatment of premium income, reinsurance premiums, and claims. For the purpose of the transition from the old rules to the new, the change is regarded as occurring as at 1 July 1993. This date is referred to as the Transition Time in the legislation. Assets - section 208(2)(a) All assets of a company held for the purposes of an insurance business carried on out of New Zealand are deemed to have been disposed of to an unrelated third party and to have been reacquired immediately after- wards for a consideration equal to their market value at 1†July 1993. This provision allows values to be attributed to company assets that were used in an insurance business carried on out of New Zealand. The values will be used to determine the tax consequences attributable to these assets from 1 July 1993 onward; they will determine the acquisition value of investments and the depreciable value of depreciable assets and so forth. It also ensures that any income received from any asset connected with a companyís insurance business carried on out of New Zealand is attributed to the appropriate period to which it relates. The deemed sale and reacquisition excludes from the tax base any income that accrues from an asset in the period to 1 July 1993. For example, if a company held equity investments that would give rise to assessable income on sale under the new rules, the deemed sale as at 1 July 1993 ensures continued on page 22 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) ï the period of risk under the contract commences on or before 1 July 1993 and ends after that date. Where these conditions are satisfied the amount of the premium deemed to be derived by the insurance com- pany after 1 July 1993 is obtained by a simple formula which assumes that the premium income is derived evenly over the period of risk to which the contract relates. The formula used is: a x p b where - a is that part of the period of risk under the contract that falls after 1 July 1993 b is the total period of risk under the contract p is the amount of the premium. The amount determined by the formula will be the premium income that relates to the period of risk falling after the transition time. This amount is to be brought into account as assessable income. Example General Insurance Co operates a branch in Aus- tralia that is in the fire and general business. All General Insurance Coís contracts expire on the anniversary of the contract. Separate calculations will therefore need to be made for all contracts that extend beyond 1 July 1993. Assume for the purposes of this example that General Insurance Co has only one customer, Manufacturing Co. The insurance contract com- menced on 1 January 1993. Manufacturing Co. pays AUD 17,000 per annum for all its fire and general business. General Insurance Coís balance date for New Zealand tax purposes is 31 March. The assessable income arising from the insurance contract with Manufacturing Co for General Insurance Coís year ending 31 March 1994 will be: 183 x AUD 17,000 365 = AUD 8,523 This amount must to be brought to account as at 1†July 1993. Claims - section 208(2)(c) There are also rules to determine the deductibility of an amount payable by the New Zealand company on a claim where the period of risk under the contract to which the claim relates commenced on or before the transition time. that any income accrued to that date is excluded from the companyís assessable income for that income year. The same scenario applies to interest bearing securities and other forms of financial arrangements. Excluded from this provision is income deemed to be derived from New Zealand from: ï the ownership of any land; ï any mortgage of land; ï shares or debentures in any company, or local or public authority; ï debentures or other securities issued by the New Zealand Government; ï the sale of property in New Zealand; ï interest or a redemption payment derived from money lent in New Zealand; ï interest or a redemption payment derived from money lent outside New Zealand to: - any person resident in New Zealand except where the money lent is used by the resident for the purposes of a business carried on outside New Zealand through a permanent establish- ment; - any person not resident in New Zealand who uses the money lent in a business carried on in New Zealand through a permanent establishment. The classes of income referred to above were assessable in New Zealand under the previous rules. As their tax status has not changed it was not necessary to have the transitional rules apply to the assets underlying that income. Liabilities - section 208(2)(b) New Zealand general insurance companies with liabili- ties arising out of insurance business carried on out of New Zealand and outstanding as at the transition time are deemed to have been relieved by an unrelated third party and immediately thereafter paid to reassume the liability for a consideration equal to the market value for assuming such a liability at the time. The purpose of this provision is to separate out any expenditure incurred by an insurance company on a liability outstanding at the transition time. The expenditure will be allocated to the respective periods to which it relates, thus ensuring the appropriate deductibility rules are applied to that expense. Premium income - section 208(2)(c) Rules are set out for determining what portion of premium income is brought to account where the period of risk under the contract to which the premium relates commenced at or before the transition time. The rule applies where: ï the company as insurer has entered into an insurance contract for insurance business conducted out of New Zealand; and from page 21 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) Where the company pays an amount under such a claim, the company can only deduct the payment from its assessable income if the event that gave rise to the claim occurred after 1†July 1993. This makes it clear that only those claims payable after 1 July 1993 (for contracts where the period of risk includes 1 July 1993) will be deductible from the insurer's assessable income, where the actual event covered by the policy occurred after 1 July 1993, and that event is the dominant, effective or operative cause of the loss giving rise to the claim. Claims payable under an insurance policy that covers the transition time will not be deductible if the event giving rise to the claim occurred before the transition time, even though the loss may not have been incurred until after the transition time. Such situations could arise under contracts of professional indemnity, for example. Reinsurance premiums - section 208(2)(d) Deductions are now permitted for reinsurance premiums paid out of New Zealand. The new section 208(2)(d) provides rules for determin- ing the timing of the deduction of reinsurance premiums paid out of New Zealand, where the risk under the reinsurance contract covers the transition time. The premiums payable out of New Zealand under the reinsurance contracts are treated as having been paid evenly over the period of the contract. The formula used is: a x p b where - a is that part of the period of risk under the contract that falls after 1 July 1993; b is the total period of risk under the contract; and p is the amount of the premium. The amount determined by the formula will be the reinsurance premium that relates to the period of risk falling after the transition time. This amount will be deductible from the insurance company's assessable income for its income year that first ends after 1 July 1993. Example General Insurance Co. reinsures all its fire and general business with Reinsurance Co. of Woolongong Ltd. General Insurance Co. carries 40% of the risk under its insurance contracts with the balance reinsured. For its year ended 31 March 1994 General Insur- ance Co. paid AUD 6,000 in reinsurance premiums for its contract of insurance with Manufacturing Co. The period covered by the reinsurance contract is the same as the head contract, i.e., 1 January 1993 to 31 December 1993. The amount deductible from the assessable income derived during the income year ending 31 March 1994 will be: 183 x AUD 6,000 365 = AUD 3,008 Reinsurance recoveries - section 208(2)(d) Claims and recoveries received for losses under reinsurance contracts with non-resident insurers are now assessable. Where a New Zealand company receives an amount for a claim for a loss under a reinsurance contract (where the period of risk under that contract started before the transition time and ends after that time) section 208(2)(d) contains rules to determine how that amount is to be treated. Any amount derived by a New Zealand insurance company from any claim for a loss under a reinsurance contract is deemed to be assessable income of the company where the ìevent giving rise to the claimî occurs after the transition time. This amount is deemed to be assessable income derived by the company on 1 July 1993 or the date upon which the event giving rise to the claim occurs, which ever is the later. Again, as with an amount payable by the New Zealand insurer on a claim, the use of the words ìevent giving rise to the claimî make it clear that amounts received after 1†July 1993 (under the reinsurance contract where the period of risk covers 1 July 1993) will only be assessable if the actual event giving rise to the claim occurred after that date. The event occurring after 1 July 1993 must also be the dominant, effective or operative cause of the loss giving rise to the claim. It will be a question of fact as to what the dominant, effective of operative cause of the claim is and when it occurred. However, if it occurred before 1†July 1993, any amount received for that loss will not be assessable. This will be the case regardless of when the recovery is received. Application date of new section 208 The previous section 208 has been repealed with effect to income derived and any expenditure or loss incurred on or after 1 July 1993 The transitional provisions contained in the new section 208 apply to the tax on income derived in the 1993 and subsequent income years. Non-resident non-life insurers - new section 209 The new section 209 is intended to ensure that any insurer not carrying on business in New Zealand continued on page 24 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) Agency provisions - section 209 The new section contains more specific rules for treating certain New Zealand persons as agents of non- resident insurers. The section also contains rules to ensure that banks and other financial institutions are not deemed to be agents in certain circumstances. An objective of the agency rules is to treat the New Zealand resident person who actually pays the premium to the insurer, or to a non-resident agent of the insurer, as having the primary responsibility as agent of the insurer for New Zealand tax purposes. Although the primary responsibility of agency is assigned to the person who actually pays the premium to the insurer or non-resident agent, this does not preclude other people resident in New Zealand from also being regarded as agent. In fact, the agency rules are struc- tured in such a manner so as to ensure agency is concurrently applied, not only to the person paying the premium but, to any other person or the insured person. In practice this will mean that where the person with primary responsibility as agent of the insured fails to meet their obligations, Inland Revenue may still seek either the tax return or payment of income tax of the non-resident insurer from either of the two other persons identified in the section. Ultimately, however, it is the insured person that has liability to furnish returns and pay any tax assessed on behalf of the non-resident insurer. The general agency provisions of Part VII of the Act will continue to apply to section 209 agency. Section 269 allows a person who is an agent to recover any tax from the principal, by deducting it from any amount owing by the agent to the principal. Where a person has filed tax returns and paid tax as agent of the non-resident insurer, no other person will be liable as agent. Banks and other financial institutions who from time to time are required to make payments on behalf of their customers as part of their business, but who are not otherwise a party to the transaction, are excluded from the agency rules. Where a bank or other financial institution pays a premium to a non-resident insurer on behalf of another person, it is not regarded as the agent of the non- resident insurer. Instead, the person on whose account the funds are drawn to pay the premium will be re- garded as the agent, and become liable accordingly. The banks and financial institutions to which this exclusion applies are: (a) Any registered bank as defined in section 2 of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1964 and any person who is either referred to or within any of the categories of persons referred to in Part A of the First Schedule to that Act: through a fixed establishment in New Zealand, who derives premium income in respect of the business of insurance of New Zealand risk shall be assessable for income tax in New Zealand on the deemed taxable income. The new section applies both to direct placement insurance and reinsurance. It makes no distinction between corporate and non-corporate insurers. For the purposes of this section ìInsuranceî is defined as ìinsurance or guarantee against any loss, damage, event, happening, contingency, or risk of any kind, not being life insuranceî. This definition is intended to carry over the application of the previous section 209, i.e. the intention is neither to narrow nor broaden the concept of insurance to which the previous section applied. Section 209(2) is the primary taxing provision. It applies where: ï any insurer derives a premium which is deemed to be derived from New Zealand (a new source rule has been inserted in section 243(2)(ma) for this purpose); and ï at the time of derivation the insurer is not resident in New Zealand; and ï the premium is not attributable to any fixed establish- ment of the insurer in New Zealand. Where these conditions are satisfied the insurer is deemed to derive taxable income equal to 10% of the gross amount of the premium received. The applicable tax rate is that for companies not resident in New Zealand, which is presently 38%. This gives an effective tax rate of 3.8% of the gross premium income derived by the non-resident insurer to which the section applies. Where an insurer is subject to the 3.8% tax on the gross premiums under the new section 209(2): ï the amount of income tax for which the insurer is liable on the premium is determined solely by refer- ence to the provisions of that section; and ï that premium income is excluded from any other assessable income the insurer may derive from New Zealand. ï no deduction of any amount is permitted from the premium income, i.e., the premiums are assessed on a gross basis. These provisions ensure that New Zealand receives the correct amount of tax on the premium income, as levied by the section, and that the income is not offset against any losses the non-resident insurer may have in New Zealand from any other activities carried on in New Zealand. In cases where the 3.8% tax is deducted from the insurance premium or the insurance premium has been grossed up for the purposes of calculating the tax, the full amount will be deductible. from page 23 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) (b) Any building society as defined in section 2 of the Building Societies Act 1965: (c) Any company formed under section 4 of the Trustee Banks Restructuring Act 1988. Application date of new section 209 Except for reinsurance premiums paid before 1 July 1993, the section applies to any premium paid on or after 1 July 1993. For reinsurance premiums paid before 1 July 1993, the section will apply to the extent that they are deductible to the New Zealand insurer under section 208(2)(d). New source rule - section 243(2)(ma) The new section 209 applies to insurance premiums that are ìdeemed to be derived from New Zealandî. The new section 243(2)(ma) deems a premium to be derived from New Zealand where a contract of insur- ance: ï is offered or entered into in New Zealand; or ï is entered into by a person resident in New Zealand; or ï is entered into by a person not resident in New Zealand, for the purposes of a business carried on by the person in New Zealand through a fixed establish- ment in New Zealand. It contains a proviso to exclude premiums with a source in New Zealand where the premium relates exclusively to risks located outside New Zealand. The proviso does not apply where the insured person and the insurer are associated. The proviso is designed to treat foreign branches of New Zealand residents in the same manner as a foreign subsidiary. Application Date The application date is the same as that applying to the new section 209. Introduction Employer-provided clothing will now be specifically exempt from FBT if it meets certain criteria. This amendment applies from 1 April 1985. Background Although it isn't specifically mentioned, employer- provided clothing is a fringe benefit under section 336N(1)(e). Previously, the legislation contained two general exemptions from FBT that could be applied to employer-provided clothing. The first is the allowance exemption (336N(1)(j)(iv)). This exemption applies where the supply of clothing removes the need for the employer to pay an allowance under section 73 of the Act to the employee. For exam- ple, uniforms worn by nurses and protective clothing will not incur FBT because of this exemption. The allowances exemption has been retained. This will remove any burden for those who already qualify for this exemption to fulfil any new requirement. The second exemption is the premises exemption (336N(1)(n)). This section exempts from FBT all benefits enjoyed on the employerís premises, and benefits enjoyed while carrying out employment duties elsewhere (except at the employeeís place of residence). Therefore, clothing worn only on the employerís premises will not be subject to FBT. However, if the clothing is worn in travelling to and from work or off the employerís premises during work hours for any reason except to perform work duties the exemption may not apply. The amendment resolves this problem by removing clothing from the premises exemption from 1 October 1993, and introducing a new exemption specific to clothing. Key issues An exemption from the definition of ìfringe benefitî which is specific to clothing has been introduced and is contained in paragraph (p). This exemption is in addition to the allowances exemption discussed above. Any benefit consisting of the provision (whether by way of sale or otherwise) of distinctive work clothing to an employee by an employer is excluded from the defini- tion of a fringe benefit. This new exemption will allow employers to provide ìdistinctive work clothingî to employees without incurring FBT. The legislation contains this definition of the term ìdistinctive work clothingî: ìDistinctive work clothingî, in relation to an employer, means any clothing (which may be a single item of clothing) that forms part of or constitutes a uniform in relation to the employerís activity or undertaking, where the Commissioner is satisfied that: (a) The uniform is identifiable with the employer by virtue of: (i) A name, logo, or other similar identification regularly used by the employer in the carrying Employer-Provided Clothing and FBT Section 336N(1), Income Tax Act 1976 continued on page 26 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) by the employer and the Commissioner is satisfied that it is identifiable with the employer. What will be considered to be permanent? To be permanent the identification must be woven into, stitched or ironed onto the clothing or be permanent by some other similar means. What will be considered to be prominent? The Commissioner will consider identification to be prominent if it is of a reasonable size. For example, 3cm by 7cm or 4cm by 5cm would be large enough. Also, the colour of the identification should be distinguishable from the colour of the clothing. What does ìat all timesî mean? The definition does not require the identification to be displayed on every individual item of clothing. The uniform as a whole need only display the identification. However, the identification must be displayed ìat all timesî. For example, a jacket, shirt and trousers are supplied to an employee. The jacket has the identifica- tion on it but it is often removed during a working day. Therefore, the shirt would also need to have identifica- tion on it to satisfy the ìat all timesî criteria. However, if only a single item of clothing is provided by an employer, such as a jersey, only that item needs to display identification to be exempt. Do all uniforms need identification to be exempt? To be ìdistinctive work clothingî a uniform does not need an identification if the uniformís pattern, colour scheme or style is readily associated with the employer outside the workplace. When can distinctive work clothing be worn? Part (b) of the definition limits the use of distinctive work clothing to work use and use incidental to work. The definition does anticipate an element of private use. For example, attending a non work related meeting on the way home from work would not fall outside the bounds of the definition. Note that part (b) relates to ìclothingî rather than ìuniformî, so each item of clothing provided by an employer must meet the criteria established in part (b). Cases Stated - Modified Procedure Sections 33 and 34, Income Tax Act 1976 Sections 36 and 37, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Sections 90, 91 and 92, Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 Sections 72, 73 and 74, Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 Introduction There have been similar amendments to the case stated procedures in each of the Inland Revenue Acts. Objec- tions can now be referred directly to the High Court as cases stated. Regulations will be gazetted shortly to provide similar provisions for objections referred to the Taxation Review Authority for determination. Background Under the current provisions, a taxpayer who has objected to an assessment made under any of the principal Acts is only required to request that a case be stated. On many occasions the existing process does not cause the taxpayer and Inland Revenue to explain to each other their respective views of the facts and on of the employerís activity or undertaking being permanently and prominently displayed at all times; or (ii) The uniformís pattern, colour scheme, or style having ready association with the employer; and (b) The clothing is worn by employees in the course of or as an incidence of their employment by the employer and would not normally be worn by employees for private purposes. Application date The distinctive work clothing exemption will apply from 1 April 1985, the date the FBT regime began. Clothing will be specifically removed from the applica- tion of the premises exemption contained in paragraph 336N(1)(n) from 1 October 1993, which is the start of an FBT quarter. A taxpayer who has paid FBT on clothing provided to staff may be entitled to a refund if that clothing meets the definition of ìdistinctive work clothingî. Employers who think that they may be entitled to a refund should contact their local Inland Revenue office and ask for Taxpayer Services. Common questions about the new exemption Can a single item of clothing constitute a uniform? For the purposes of the definition a single item of clothing will constitute a uniform. Therefore, if a single jersey is provided which meets the criteria of the definition it will be exempt. Whose name, logo or similar identification needs to be displayed? The definition does not require the uniform to display the name, logo or similar identification of the employer; it only needs to display an identification regularly used by the employer. Therefore, a trade name, name of a franchise or a product will suffice if it is regularly used from page 25 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) analyses of the applicable law. Both the taxpayer and Inland Revenue often don't gain a full understanding of the opposing view until shortly before the hearing of the case, or sometimes even during the hearing. When Inland Revenue and the taxpayer fully understand each other's views, some issues or cases can be agreed. The new procedure ensures that this process of sharing information and analyses occurs during the stating of the case. Inland Revenue will actively seek to exchange this information earlier, preferably before the formal objection process begins. Key issues Under the amended provisions there are new obligations for both the taxpayer and Inland Revenue. This is to make sure both parties understand the substance of an objection before it reaches the Court for hearing, and to make sure disputes are referred to the Court promptly for hearing. Taxpayer’s obligations Within three months of requesting a case stated, the objector must give Inland Revenue a notice in the prescribed form which shows the objectorís points of objection. The prescribed form is printed by Inland Revenue (form IR†265). Objectors can use either the printed form, or a typed document in the same format. This notice must contain enough detail to give Inland Revenue and the Courts this information: ï the facts on which the objector relies in support of the objection ï the propositions of law (if any) on which the objector relies in support of the objection ï the issues which the objector wants the Court to determine. The objector must deliver this information to the Commissioner at Inland Revenue's Head Office in Wellington, or to some other address if Inland Revenue requests this in writing. The document can be delivered personally, posted, or sent by courier. The objector must send in with this document copies of any documents which will be used to support the objection. If there are a lot of documents, the objector can attach a list of them instead of sending individual copies. Note that if an objector doesn't send in this documenta- tion within the prescribed period, the objection is deemed to be withdrawn and Inland Revenue does not have to take any further action on the objection. The Court may grant further time to serve the points of objection and documents. Inland Revenue’s Obligations Within three months of when we receive the objector's points of objection, (or longer if the Court has allowed it), Inland Revenue must state and sign a case stated to the court. That case must include these items: ï particulars of the assessment to which the taxpayer is objecting ï the objector's stated grounds of objection ï the question for determination of the court ï the points of objection served by the objector ï a notice in the prescribed form stating any further facts which Inland Revenue thinks are relevant to the issues to be determined ï the issues which Inland Revenue claims need to be determined by the court. Inland Revenue must file these documents in the registry of the High Court specified in the objector's request for stating of a case. If the objector didn't specify a registry, Inland Revenue can choose one, taking into account the objector's convenience. Inland Revenue must serve a copy of this case stated on the objector, either personally or by sending it by registered post to the objector at the address for service specified in the objector's points of objection. Inland Revenue may apply to the High Court to extend the time limits for service of points of objection or filing the case stated. If Inland Revenue applies more than two months after the due date, the High Court will only grant an extension in exceptional circumstances. If Inland Revenue doesn't file a case stated within the time limit (or any further time allowed by the Court), the objector may apply to the Court for an order direct- ing Inland Revenue to allow the objection. The High Court must make such an order unless it is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the failure to file the case within the time limit. It may also refuse to make such an order and make such other orders as it thinks fit in the circumstances. At any time before the case stated is set down for hearing, Inland Revenue may file an amended case stated and the objector may serve amended points of objection on Inland Revenue. Application dates For each of the principal Acts referred to above, these changes apply to objections lodged on or after 1 April 1994. 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) Test Case Procedure Section 33A, Income Tax Act 1976 Section 36A, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Section 92A, Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 Section 74A, Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 Introduction There are now test case procedures in each of the Inland Revenue Acts. Each provision is expressed in similar terms. Background Before these amendments, it was not possible to resolve on a ìtest caseî basis groups of objections which involved substantially the same issue under one of the above Inland Revenue Acts. Inland Revenue had to prepare cases stated for hearing all objections by affected taxpayers on the point, even where the High Court's finding on an objection which was typical of that group of taxpayers might have effectively resolved the point in dispute for all objectors. Key issues Test cases may be commenced only in the High Court. An objection may be designated as a test case if Inland Revenue considers that determination of that objection (whether on a question of law or of law and fact) is likely to settle one or more issues involved in other objections. At any time after a taxpayer has lodged an objection but before the Taxation Review Authority or the High Court has determined it, Inland Revenue may notify the objector in writing that the objection will be stayed because there is a test case on a similar objection before the High Court. Such notifications effectively stay the objections of taxpayers so notified until the test case is determined. Where a test case is stated to the High Court, a stayed objector may notify Inland Revenue that the objector requires the objection to be heard and determined. If an objector does this, Inland Revenue has 14 days from receiving the notice to apply to the High Court for an order to stay the objection until the test case is deter- mined. Inland Revenue must also notify the stayed objector if we apply to the High Court. If we don't make this application within the 14 days the stay will lapse. The High Court may dismiss Inland Revenueís applica- tion to have the stay continued, cease the staying of an objection, or continue the stay. At any time where an objection has been stayed, Inland Revenue, an objector, or both may apply for an order lapsing the stay. A stay lapses when the test case is determined and all appeal rights on it have expired. All notices that must be served on Inland Revenue are to be delivered to Inland Revenue's Head Office in Wel- lington. For any notices that Inland Revenue must serve on the objector, we can serve them to the objector personally, or send them by registered post to the objector's usual or last known place of abode or business in New Zealand, or to an agent the objector has ap- pointed. Application date For the Income Tax Act 1976 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, objections made after 28†Sep- tember 1993 may be designated as test cases or stayed while a test case is determined. For the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 and the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, objections made on or after 1 April 1994 may be similarly designated or stayed. Forestry Changes Sections 74, 81A, 90, 91, and 197, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction A potential tax avoidance loophole which may have previously enabled forestry companies to avoid paying any tax on the transfer of forests has been closed. The general effect of the amendments is twofold: ï All dispositions of timber and timber rights are made taxable. ï Where the timber or timber rights are transferred for less than market value, the transfer is deemed to be a sale at market value. Anyone who disposes of timber or timber rights will be taxed on the market value ascribed to the transaction. However, the person who acquires the timber or timber rights will be able to deduct the cost of the acquisition (i.e., that market value) when the timber is harvested or the timber right is sold. 29 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) Background Where land is sold with standing timber, the value of the timber is taken into account in calculating assess- able income under section 74(5) and 74(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act. However, it may have been possible to structure dispositions of forestry blocks so that any gains derived from these dispositions were not taxable income. The loss to the revenue base would have been substan- tial if these practices had become widespread. A press statement announcing the Government's intention to amend the forestry provisions and provisions dealing with disposal of trading stock was made on 24 June 1993, with immediate application from that date. It was subsequently noted that the disposition of exist- ing forestry timber rights was not specifically included in section 74. The Government decided that dispositions of rights to take timber should be subject to the new rules from 5 August 1993, the date of introduction of the Taxation Reform Bill No 7. Generally these changes are designed to ensure that the tax treatment of timber and timber rights is consistent with the general tax treatment of dispositions of revenue assets. This corrects anomalies that existed between section 74 and the rest of the Act. Income from selling timber and timber rights Section 74 relates to assessable income from selling timber. It has been amended to: ï extend the section to cover all dispositions of timber; and ï specifically include within the ambit of the section rights to take timber. A right to take timber is defined to include any licence or easement or right of taking any profits or produce from the land to the extent that the licence, easement, or right relates to timber. In conjunction with the new treatment of timber as trading stock under sections 90, 91, and 197 of the Act, assessable income under section 74 also includes deemed profits or gains as well as actual profits or gains from sales or other dispositions of timber or rights to take timber. Spreading of income Assessable income from selling timber can be spread over three years preceding the sale. Section 81A has been amended to extend the spreading provision to include: ï income from dispositions other than sales of timber; and ï sales and other dispositions of timber rights. This reflects the amendments made to section 74. Income from disposal of trading stock The definition of trading stock in section 90 now includes timber and timber rights. The effect of this amendment is that: ï Inland Revenue can attribute a value to any timber or timber rights sold together with other assets of a business. ï For the purposes of this section, dispositions of timber and timber rights, (or any share or interest in this trading stock) will be treated as a sale at market value or other value as determined by the Commissioner. A further amendment has been made to ensure that the granting of a timber right such as a licence, easement, or forestry right is a disposition to which a deemed value can be applied. Selling trading stock for inadequate consideration The definition of trading stock in section 91 is amended to include timber and timber rights. This amendment will allow Inland Revenue to treat any disposal of timber, or a right to take timber for inadequate consid- eration, as a sale at market value or other value as determined by the Commissioner. The same result applies if any share or interest in this trading stock has been disposed of for inadequate consideration. A further amendment has been made to ensure that the granting of a timber right such as a licence, easement, or forestry right is a disposition to which a deemed value can be applied. The value attributed to the timber or timber rights will be taken into account in calculating the assessable income of the person disposing of the trading stock, and the cost of the timber to the person acquiring it. Distributing trading stock to shareholders Section 197 treats distributions of trading stock to shareholders as sales at market value. It has had these amendments: ï It now applies to distributions of timber or rights to take timber within the meaning of section 74. ï It includes distributions to persons associated with the shareholders. The value attributed to the timber or timber rights will be taken into account in calculating the assessable income of the person distributing the trading stock, and the cost of the timber to the person acquiring it. Although the application dates for amendments to this section will be the same as for the other forestry amend- ments, there is a special exception for liquidations. continued on page 30 30 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) Application dates The new tax treatment of rights to take timber generally applies from 5 August 1993. The treatment for all dispositions of timber applies from 24 June 1993; the date the Government announced its intention to amend the tax treatment of forestry. Double Deductions of Investment Losses Sections 64G, 106(1)(b), 106(1)(ba)204C and 191A, Income Tax Act 1976 The deductibility of bad debts from financial arrange- ments subject to the accrual rules is governed by section 64G. This means deductions for bad debts between associated persons are prohibited and will not be permitted under sections 104 and 106(1)(b) (using the argument that the debts are revenue in nature). This replaces Inland Revenueís policy statement on the treatment of bad debts under the accrual rules, which was set out in TIB Volume One, No.3 (September 1989). Inland Revenueís policy will cease to apply from the 1993-94 income year, being the application date of the amendments to section 64G and 106(1)(b). Example - Deduction for bad debts arising from loans between associated persons Lender Co is a banking corporate which owns 67 percent of the shares in Borrower Co (a property development company). Lender Co lent Borrower Co $1 million, which is written off as a bad debt when Borrower Co is put into liquidation. Lender Co is not permitted a deduction for the bad debt written off under the Act as Lender Co and Bor- rower Co are associated persons. A deduction is now not available under Sections 104 and 106(1)(b) for bad debts of a revenue nature. Double deductions of losses arising from bad debts are now prohibited under section 106(1)(b)(iv). The provi- sion applies in the context of corporate losses grouped under section 191A of the Act only. It will apply where money is lent by the lender and the borrowed funds are used as expenditure taken into account in calculating a loss incurred by the borrower or any other company in the group. If that loss is grouped against group income under section 191A of the Act, the prohibition in section 106(1)(b)(iv) applies to prevent the lender from later claiming a deduction for the bad debt (Ignoring for the moment that if the debt is a financial arrangement, the prohibition of deductions for bad debts between associated persons in section 64G will apply). Introduction New provisions amend the rules governing accrued income from financial arrangements written off, and the deductibility of bad debts and share losses. Background Before these amendments, deductions for bad debts and share losses were not subject to any prohibition on double deduction of losses. As a result, there was potential for tax avoidance by some corporate groups. In addition, the policy intention of section 64G, which is the prohibition of bad debt deductions arising from loans between associated persons, has not been achieved in practice. Key issues The amendments remove any potential for double deduction of losses arising from bad debts and share losses and also ensure that the original policy intention of section 64G is achieved. Section 64G is replaced with a new section 64G which makes these changes for financial arrangements: ï It clarifies that a deduction for certain bad debts (trade credits) is permitted. ï It prohibits double deductions of bad debt losses. A consequential amendment is made to section 65(2) of the Act (which lists items included in assessable income) as a result of the drafting changes to section 64G. Section 106(1)(b) (relating to bad debts) is rewritten and a new section 106(1)(ba) (relating to share losses) is inserted. These amendments make these changes: ï They clarify the inter-relationship between section 106(1)(b) and section 64G on bad debts from financial arrangements which are subject to the accrual rules. ï They prohibit double deductions for bad debts and share losses. Where a liquidator was formally appointed, in accord- ance with the Companies Act 1955, before 24 June 1993 (for timber), or 5 August 1993 (for timber rights), the sale will be deemed to take place at cost value of the trading stock . from page 29 31 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) Example - Prohibition on double deduc- tions In November 1993, Lender Co lends Borrower Co (in which Lender Co owns 67 percent of the shares) $2 million. Borrower Co uses the money in a high risk business venture. The venture fails. Borrower Co makes a business loss of $1 million from the investment for the 1993-94 income year. This loss is grouped against Lender Coís income for the 1994 income year. In May 1994, Lender Co decides to write off the $2 million debt owing as bad (Bor- rower Co being put into receivership). Lender Co is not allowed a deduction for $1 million of the bad debt written off as that sum has been deducted once earlier as a group loss against Lender Coís income in the prior income year (Ignoring for the moment that if the debt is a financial arrangement, the prohibition of deductions for bad debts between associated persons in section 64G will apply). Double deductions of losses from share investments is also prohibited under section 106(1)(ba), which is the equivalent of section 106(1)(b)(iv). It will apply where losses on shares held by the investor company are incurred (assuming the loss-producing activity or investment was funded by money from the equity holdings) because of losses incurred in a group com- pany. If the group loss is offset against group income under section 191A of the Act, the prohibition in section 106(1)(ba) applies to prevent the investor company from later claiming a deduction for any share loss incurred. Section 204C of the Act relates to profits and losses on the disposal of property by life insurers. It has been amended to prohibit deduction of a share loss that has already been deducted under the grouping provisions. For group loss offsets, a new provision in section 191(7A) prohibits double deductions of amounts which have earlier been claimed as a bad debt or share loss deduction. Thus, using the above example, if Borrower Co's loss had not been grouped for the 1994 income year, Lender Co could have deducted the $2 million lent as a bad debt in May 1994. Given the facts in that example, Borrower Co will not be able to group its loss in future income years; it may only carry that loss forward. Application date All the amendments apply from the 1993-94 income year. Part Year Loss Grouping Section 191A(5) of the Income Tax Act Introduction Part year losses which have been carried forward to a subsequent year can now be grouped. Background Section 191A(5) allowed a loss company's part year loss to be grouped against a profit company's income where these conditions were met in the loss company's year of offset: ï The profit company and the loss company are in the same group of companies. ï If the profit company has a later balance date than the loss company, the companies must also be in the same group for the profit company's year of offset. ï Continuity of ownership must be maintained. This section did not allow a part year loss offset where the companies were in the same group for part only of the loss company's preceding loss year. Key issues Section 191A(5) is rewritten to enable a part year loss offset where a group situation exists for part only of a preceding loss year. This is limited to losses incurred in the 1991-92 and subsequent income years. The old requirements for part year loss offset are largely re- peated. Example - Part year loss offset where group exists for part only of preceding loss year $500 loss $400 loss$400 loss carried forward to 1993 LOSS COMPANY PROFIT COMPAN Y $600 profit in 1993 31/3/9231/3/93 1/4/91 1/10/91 Group formed A part year group loss offset of $400 is permitted in 1993 income year, provided continuity and commonality requirements satisfied from 1/10/91 and adequate part year accounts furnished to Inland Revenue. Application date The amendment applies from the 1992-93 income year. 32 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) “Special Corporate Entity” - Meaning Extended Section 8B, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction The term ìspecial corporate entityî has been extended to include life insurance companies that do not issue shares. Background For life insurance companies, the old definition of the term meant: ï a life insurance fund within the meaning of section 204(1) of the Act; and ï a life insurance company which is a statutory body established by an Act of Parliament and that does not issue shares. The term did not include certain insurance companies that do not issue shares and which are not established by an Act of Parliament. Key issues The term ìspecial corporate entityî is extended in section 8B(f) to include life insurance companies (being entities engaged principally in the business of providing life insurance to the public) that do not issue shares. This means that for carrying forward or offsetting losses and for imputation credit account provisions, interests held in such life insurance companies do not have to be physically computed. Under sections 8C(3) and 8D(3) ownership interests held in a special corporate entity are deemed to be held by the same single person. Application date The amendment applies from the 1992-93 income year. Consolidation of Mineral Mining Companies Sections 191E and 191O, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction These amendments modify the way the consolidation regime applies to consolidated mineral mining groups. Key issues To maintain the integrity of the mineral mining provi- sions in the Act, section 191E is amended so that a mineral mining company to which section 216 of the Act applies may form a consolidated group only with other mineral mining companies. In addition, to preserve the ring-fencing of loss provisions that apply to mineral mining companies, section 191O is amended so it does not apply to mineral mining companies. Application date This amendment applies from the application date of the consolidation regime. This means that the change takes effect from the 1993-94 income year for compa- nies with standard or late balance dates, and from the 1994-95 income year for companies with early balance dates. No Deductions for Leased Personal Property Section 222E, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction Deductions can no longer be claimed for leases of private or domestic assets. Background Section 222E entitled lessees to claim deductions for certain lease payments in absolute terms. It had no limitations if the payments did not meet the normal criteria under section 104 (business criteria) or section 106(1)(j) (not private or domestic expenditure). This enabled deductions of private or domestic expenditure (such as rental of television sets) to be claimed on leased assets. Key features The amendment restricts deductions for lease payments under personal property leases to payments that meet the normal production of assessable income criteria under section 104, and which are not private or domes- tic expenditure. Application date The amendment is backdated to 1982 (the year the provision was enacted), but it will not apply to lease payments already claimed in a return furnished to Inland Revenue before 5†August 1993 (the introduction date of the amending legislation). 33 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) More than One Accrual Method Sections 64C and 64E, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction Amendments to the accrual rules will allow taxpayers to use any of the tax calculation methods in section 64C for the same class of financial arrangement, if they meet certain conditions. Background Before this amendment, taxpayers who used more than one method to calculate income or expenditure from a particular class of financial arrangement for financial reporting purposes could not take advantage of some of the tax calculation methods available in section 64C. For instance, a taxpayer who used mark to market for some swap contracts for financial reporting purposes, but yield to maturity for others, could not use mark to market at all for tax purposes. This change will enable taxpayers in this situation to use the tax calculation methods in section 64C. Tax law generally requires people who are not cash basis holders to calculate their income from financial arrangements using the yield to maturity method (if possible) or a method approved by a determination. Taxpayers may use an alternative method if (amongst other conditions) they use the same method for financial reporting purposes for all such financial arrangements. They may also use a mark to market method if (amongst other conditions) they use that method for financial reporting purposes for all such financial arrangements. However, financial reporting standards will often require that the same type of financial arrangement be treated differently, depending on the purpose for which it was entered into. As long as taxpayers meet the requirements of the new provision, using different accrual methods for accounting purposes will not prevent them from adopting the tax methods in section†64C. Key issues To meet the existing requirements in section 64C each method must continue to meet these conditions: ï It must have regard to the principles of accrual accounting. ï It must conform with commercially acceptable practice. ï If it is an alternative to yield to maturity or to a method in a determination, it must result in an allocation that is not materially different from yield to maturity or the method in the determination. ï It must be consistently applied for financial reporting purposes for all such financial arrangements. The method will be deemed to have complied with the last requirement for a particular financial arrangement if it meets these conditions: ï It reflects the dominant purposes for which the financial arrangement was acquired. ï It will be consistently applied to the financial arrange- ment for tax purposes. ï It is not adopted to avoid tax. ï Inland Revenue has approved it in the taxpayer's particular circumstances, either in writing or in a determination issued. The taxpayer would be expected to demonstrate that it has well developed internal controls that require the dominant purpose to be determined at the time the financial arrangement is entered into. This is likely to limit approval to a relatively small number of financial institutions. Example A bank invests in Government Stock securities as both a long term investor and as a trader. The investment portfolio would usually be accrued using the yield to maturity method, but the trading portfolio would usually be accrued using mark to market. Each deal ticket would identify the domi- nant purpose for entering into the financial arrange- ment. From this deal ticket the bankís financial records would be updated at the time the transaction is entered into. Provided the requirements of the new section 64C(4A) were complied with, Inland Revenue continued on page 34 Debt Forgiveness - Double Taxation under Section 188(6) Income Tax Act 1976 Section 188(6) operates to reduce the amount of losses that may be carried forward if a debt is forgiven. A potential double taxation situation arises where a shareholder's debt is forgiven. This is because the forgiveness may: ï constitute a deemed dividend taxed to the shareholder under section 4 of the Act; and ï reduce the amount of losses that the shareholder can carry forward because of section 188(6). The amendment to section 188 removes this potential for double taxation by ensuring that the losses that the shareholder can carry forward will not be reduced by any amount forgiven that is also taxed as a dividend. The amendment applies from the 1992-93 income year. 34 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) Application date The provisions will apply in the 1993-94 income year and subsequent years. First Year Depreciation Previous Section 112, Income Tax Act 1976 An amendment clarifies the now repealed section 112 of the Income Tax Act which dealt with the First Year Depreciation allowance. This amendment ensures that Energy Trading Operators, Harbour Boards and all other entities contained in sections 197A to 197J, which were exempt from tax at the time they acquired assets, do not claim first year depreciation on these assets. This amendment applies from 31 July 1986. Depreciation Sections 107A, 108D, 108G, 108I, 108O and 117, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction A number of minor changes have been made to the depreciation provisions. Some of these changes correct drafting errors in the original legislation, while others address concerns raised about the operation of the regime. Key issues ï The start dates of the various provisions of the original regime are rewritten to make it clear how they apply to early, standard, and late balance date taxpayers. ï The rule which sets the starting point for depreciation as the value at the end of the 1992-93 year is amended to make it clear that it does not apply to assets sold then reacquired. ï A ìlook-throughî rule is introduced for internation- ally mobile petroleum exploration assets. This is to remove an avoidance opportunity under which asset values could be manipulated to avoid New Zealand tax liability. ï The provision for calculating an asset's adjusted tax value is amended to make it clear when current year depreciation is to be deducted. ï An incorrect reference in the definition of ìdeprec- iable propertyî is corrected. ï The section which provides the two and three shift allowance is amended to make it clear when the allowance terminates. ï The provision which allows either straight line or diminishing value methods to be used is amended to make it clear that it applies to assets acquired from 1 April 1993 onwards. ï An incorrect reference to a Schedule is amended. ï The rule requiring general rates to be banded is extended to provisional rates. ï The facility for taxpayers to write off assets costing less than $200 is extended to self-created assets. ï The low-value asset write-off is also amended to allow taxpayers to write off goods taken into capital account which were originally purchased as trading stock. ï The apportionment provision for assets that are used partly for business and partly privately has been amended so it operates correctly. ï Inland Revenueís discretion to allow some assets to be disposed of other than for market value is removed. ï A Schedule which the amendment Act failed to include in the principal Act is inserted. Application dates All these amendments have the same application date as the provision being amended; either 1†April 1993 or the start of the 1994-95 income year. would allow the taxpayer to use the mark to market method for tax purposes, even though the taxpayer did not use it for financial reporting purposes for all Government Stock securities. from page 33 35 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) Disposal of Intangible Assets Section 117, Income Tax Act 1976 There are several minor amendments to section 117, to clarify how it applies to intangible assets and land improvements. ïSection 117 is now limited in its application to intangible assets which are not excluded depreciable property (as defined in section 107A). This means section 117 applies only to depreciable intangible assets purchased or first used after 31 March 1993. ïThe exception to the above rule is software, which (if it is not trading stock) is caught by section 117 on its sale if any deduction for its purchase or creation has been claimed. ï The adjusted tax value of such software is its cost less all deductions claimed for its purchase, creation and depreciation. ïSection 117 also applies to the sale of depreciable land improvements that are excluded depreciable property, provided the property was depreciable under the previous depreciation regime. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 1993. Livestock Valuation for Tax Purposes Sections 86, 86A-F, 86J, 175-177, 185A, Income Tax Act 1976 herd scheme at the beginning of the current income year as well. This was the original intention of the legisla- tion. (A new subsection 86D(3) confirms this). Ruling on election to use transitional provisions for bailed livestock Section (26) of the Amendment Act provides for elections furnished before this Amendment Act was enacted. Inland Revenue may extend the time for making elections to use the bailed livestock transitional provisions. Where an election is furnished to Inland Revenue before the day thirty days after this Amendment Act was enacted (i.e., furnished on or before 28†October), it may be revised at any time up until and including 31 March 1994. The thirty day period is so taxpayers and their tax advisers have time to become aware of the change. Where an election to use the transitional provisions is sent to Inland Revenue after 28†October 1993, it must be furnished with the taxpayer's tax return for the 1992/93 income year. There is a detailed description of the amendments made to the livestock valuation regime in TIB, Volume Five, No.2 (August 1993). The main points are: ï There are amended transitional provisions for bail- ments and leases in existence on or before 2 Septem- ber 1992. ï Livestock placed ìat use ofî a partnership by a partner may be valued at national standard cost by the partner where the partnership also uses national standard cost. ï The date on which livestock must be valued at for the purposes of calculating a differential herd ratio has been amended with effect from the 1993-94 income year. ï Some minor drafting errors have been corrected. Further clarification of legislation Where any herd livestock on hand at the beginning of an income year was valued under the herd scheme in the previous income year, it will be valued under the 36 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) Hire Purchase Agreements Sections 76A, 85, 222F, 222G, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction There have been some enhancements to the new hire purchase regime that was enacted earlier this year. These changes - ï clarify the treatment of transfers of hire purchase agreements where legal title in the asset changes hands; ï set out the tax treatment for repossessions or early terminations of hire purchase agreements; and ï provide for spreading excess income arising in one income year as a result of changes to the hire pur- chase legislation. Background A new tax treatment for hire purchase agreements entered into on or after 1 April 1993 was introduced earlier this year. Broadly, the new hire purchase regime made these changes: ï It brought hire purchase agreements within the accruals rules. This was achieved by amending section 64B of the Income Tax Act 1976 to remove hire purchase agreements from ìexcepted financial arrangementsî. (The accrual rules deal with the loan element of hire purchase arrangements.) ï It dealt with the deemed sale of hire purchase assets to the borrower under the agreement (referred to as the lessee), and deemed purchase by the lender (referred to as the lessor) at the termination of the agreement. These provisions are set out in sections 222F and 222G of the Act. The underlying objective of the hire purchase regime is to treat hire purchase arrangements as closely as possible to equivalent transactions involving the sale of an asset financed by a loan. To achieve that result, a hire purchase agreement is treated separately as: ï the sale of the asset at market value by the vendor; and ï the provision of a loan - equivalent to the proceeds of the sale - by the vendor to the purchaser. The loan component of the hire purchase agreement is subject to the accrual rules. Under those rules, taxpayers must generally account for interest income and expendi- ture as it accrues, not on a cash basis. Where a hire purchase agreement is terminated the vendor is deemed to reacquire ownership of the asset. Sections 222F and 222G determine the deemed price at which the asset is deemed to have been purchased and disposed of. Key changes These are the principal changes to the existing hire purchase regime: ï Where a hire purchase agreement is terminated and the lessee does not acquire ownership of the asset, the vendor (lessor) is deemed to acquire the asset at the ìlessor's outstanding balanceî at that time. ï If an asset reverts to the vendor, and it is a business asset of that vendor, s/he must treat it as trading stock under section 85. ï The definition of a hire purchase agreement is amended so that, where the agreement is assigned, a deemed sale of the asset is triggered only if the asset reverts to the assignee at the termination of the agreement. ï The definition of the ìcore acquisition priceî and the ìacquisition priceî of hire purchase arrangements in section 64BA(1) is only applied to the initial holder of the arrangement. If a hire purchase agreement is assigned, the core acquisition price would be deter- mined under general rules (generally the amount of consideration paid to acquire the agreement). ï There are technical changes to the definition of ìyear of adjustmentî in section 76A of the Act. This section governs the transition to the new tax treatment of hire purchase agreements. ï Section 76A has been modified to allow spreading of additional income that arises as a result of the legisla- tive changes in the income year in which 1 April 1993 falls. Deemed sales and purchases under hire purchase agreements Section 222G deems a lessor to have sold an asset for the lessor's disposition value (generally the cash price of the asset) at the start of a hire purchase agreement. Likewise, the lessee is deemed to have purchased the asset for the lessee's acquisition value (again, usually its cash price). There have been amendments to the provisions in section 222G that deal with situations where ownership of an asset is deemed to revert to the lessor at the expiry or termination of a hire purchase agreement. A hire purchase agreement might be terminated early because the lessee either defaults on or buys out of the contract. Where beneficial ownership reverts to the lessor at the termination of an agreement, sections 222F and 222G ensure that a lessee (borrower) always pays full consid- eration to a lessor (lender) for the amounts owed at that time, including accrued but unpaid interest. Accord- ingly, the borrower can never be taxed on any debt forgiveness income from a hire purchase agreement. The effect of these sections is that where there is a shortfall in the amount owed to a lessor under a hire purchase agreement after an asset has been repossessed and sold, the lessor can claim a deduction for the 37 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) shortfall as a loss on the sale of trading stock, or as a write-down of trading stock on hand at balance date to its market value. This result is equivalent to the treat- ment of a repossessed asset financed by a non-hire purchase loan. In the latter instance, the lender would also account for accrued but unpaid interest when determining income or expenditure in the year the asset is repossessed. The difference between the (higher) total amount paid and payable to the lender and the assetís market value would be deducted as a bad debt. Deemed acquisition and sale price of reacquired assets Under s.222G, a lessor is deemed to purchase a reacquired asset for an amount equal to the ìlessorís outstanding balanceî. The lessee is deemed to sell the asset for the ìlesseeís outstanding balanceî. Broadly, the intent of subsection 222G(2) to (3B) is to deem a lessor to purchase (and the lessee to sell) the asset for an amount equal to the outstanding balance of the loan at the time the agreement is terminated. The outstanding balance is the amount owed by the lessee at the time of termination. This amount is then decreased by any additional payments the lessee makes, or in- creased by any payments the lessor makes to the lessee at the termination of the hire purchase agreement. The central element of the lessorís and lessee's ìout- standing balanceî (defined in s.222F) is the amount of the net balance due (defined in section 22(3) of the Hire Purchase Act) at the termination or expiry of the agreement. However, storage, repossession and other costs and expenses associated with a breach of a hire purchase agreement by the lessee are excluded. The amount due under the Hire Purchase Act (exclud- ing any repossession and associated costs) is: The Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1993 introduced a new tax treatment for hire purchase agreements (HPs), and the recently enacted No.3 Act refined that treatment. The regime applies to HPs entered into on or after 1†April 1993 Entering an HP agreement is deemed to be a sale of an asset at its market price. The profit element of the sale is recognised in the year of sale and the purchaser is entitled to claim depreciation where appropriate. Such HPs are also financial arrangements which are subject to the accrual rules. This was achieved by removing HPs from excepted financial arrangements. The effect (depending upon the application of the accrual rules) is: ï the interest element is recognised as income/expenditure over the term of the agreement on an actuarial basis; and ï on termination and expiry there is a ìwrap upî operation (the base price adjustment - BPA) to ensure that all income and expenditure is recognised. Where the lessee does not complete the transaction it is necessary to deal with: ï the repossession and sale of the asset; ï any ìwash upî payments between the parties. Most of the amendments in the No 3 Act deal with the special provisions which cater for agreements that terminate before their full term. The rules ensure that there will be no adverse implications under the accruals rules for non-business lessees. Central to the scheme of things is the determination of an ìoutstanding balanceî for the lessor and lessee. The ìoutstanding balanceî is an amount equal to ï the net amount owing under the agreement (excluding repossession and associated charges): - less the amount the lessee (purchaser) pays to the lessor (vendor) where the sale proceeds are less than the amount owing; + plus the amount the lessor pays to the lessee where the sale proceeds exceed the amount owing. The outstanding balance is added to item ìaî of the BPA for both the lessor and lessee. In the operation of the BPA: ï ìwash upî payments cancel out and repossession and associated charges are excluded, so the BPA continues to be concerned only with principal and interest; and ï the full amount owing is deemed to have been paid. Without this the BPA would result in deemed assessable income to the lessee where the payments made are less than the acquisition price. The asset is deemed to be acquired by the lessor and disposed of by the lessee for the amount of the outstanding balance at the time the agreement is terminated. Assets which revert to the lessor on termination or expiry are deemed to be trading stock. The deemed acquisition of trading stock results in a deduction for the amount of the outstanding balance. This offsets the income of that amount which is deemed to be derived under the BPA. Depending on the amount of any sale proceeds or year-end stock valuation, the lessor may get a further deduction or have assessable income. Repossession and associated expenses and recoveries thereof are deductible and assessable according to ordinary principles. Where a deduction for deemed acquisition of trading stock has been taken there can be no bad debt deduction for amounts owing or to become owing under the agreement. Any payments that the lessee makes after the year of termination are income to the lessor. Any payments the lessor makes after the year of termination are expenditure incurred (if not previously included in the lessorís outstanding balance) and income to the lessee (if not previously included in the lesseeís outstanding bal- ance). The No. 3 Act also provides a spreading provision for excess income arising from the application of the new HP regime in the year of adjustment (the 1993/94 year for taxpayers with standard balance dates). The scheme at a glance continued in opposite columncontinued on page 38 38 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) sale of the asset (if sold during the year it is reacquired) or as a write-down of trading stock to market value (if the asset is still on hand at the end of the holderís income year). ï if an amount in excess of the outstanding balance is likely to be recovered (because the market value of the asset is higher than the outstanding balance) the lessor must return any amount received in excess of the outstanding balance in the income year in which the repossessed asset is sold. Examples These examples show how the hire purchase rules in sections 222F and 222G and the accrual rules apply to hire purchase agreements. They assume the sale and repossession of a hire purchase asset within a single income year. For an example of the accrual of income and expenditure between income years, see pages 41 and 42 of TIB Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) Example 1: Shortfall between recoveries and the amount due on termination Assume the following facts for a hire purchase transac- tion: Vendorís balance date:31 March Date hire purchase entered into:5 June 1993 Cash price of property:$1,000 Deposit paid by purchaser:$100 Amount loaned by way of HP agreement:$900 Term of agreement:24 months Interest rate on the loan: compound rate of 20% p.a. payable monthly in arrears Monthly instalments:$45.81 Total of seven instalments actually paid ($320.67) Last instalment paid on 5 January 1994 Termination of agreement completed on 5 March 1994 Repossession and associated costs:$100 Market value of recovered asset:$650 The amount due under s.22(3) of the Hire Purchase Act on the termination of the agreement is $795.87. (Under the Hire Purchase Act, a vendor must notify a defaulting purchaser of the balance owing and the date from which an agreement which has been breached is to be termi- nated.) Excluding repossession costs of $100 (which are deductible as current expenditure under ordinary rules) the amount due is $695.87. This amount includes accrued but unpaid interest of $22.63. Of the total amount, the lessor recovers $650 on the sale of the asset. The lessorís outstanding balance is calculated using the approach outlined above. Item ëaí of the formula in s.222F is $695.87 (the amount due less repossession and -reduced by payments the lessee makes to the lessor consequent upon the termination of the agreement, because these payments are consideration paid by the lessee (or derived by the lessor) under the base price adjustment in s 64F(2) of the accrual rules (or s.64F(3) if the lessor is a cash basis holder). Payments by the lessee reduce the amount owed by the lessee at the termination of the agreement, so they are excluded. These amounts are referred to in item ëbí of the formula for computing the outstanding balance in s.222F. +increased by payments the lessor makes to the lessee on the termination of the agreement, since the lessor and lessee must account for these payments in the base price adjustment under the accrual rules. (These amounts are referred to as item ëcí in the outstanding balance formula in s.222F.) Payments by the lessor to the lessee are likely to include amounts recovered on the sale of a hire purchase asset, if these exceed the amount the lessee owes. Such payments increase the lessor's deemed cost of reacquisition of the reacquired asset (and increase the lessee's deemed sale price). In s.222F, the ìlesseeís outstanding balanceî and the ìlessorís outstanding balanceî are defined separately. However, the two definitions are identical except for different references to the relevant base price adjustment provisions in items ëbí and ëcí of the formula. For lessors, items ëbí and ëcí refer to both sections 64F(2) and 64F(3) of the accrual rules to encompass cash basis holders of hire purchase agreements. By contrast, for lessees, items ëbí and ëcí refer only to s.64F(2) of the accrual rules. Section 85 has been amended to ensure that where the vendor holds repossessed assets (which are business assets) at the end of an income year, the vendor can claim a deduction for any difference between the ìoutstanding balanceî and the market value (if the market value is less than the outstanding balance). This will prevent any asset which might otherwise be treated as a fixed asset from having an unrealistic value because the outstanding balance at which it is reacquired includes an element of accrued but unpaid interest. Implications of the accrual rules The implications of s.222F and s.222G are that where a hire purchase asset is repossessed due to early termina- tion: ï interest, including accrued but unpaid interest up to the date of termination, that accrues in the year in which the agreement is terminated is returned in that year. The deemed reacquisition price produces this effect. This amount is computed under the accrual rules base price adjustment; ï if a shortfall arises because the value of the reacquired asset is less than the outstanding balance owing (including accrued and unpaid interest), and the lessee does not make a payment to satisfy the short- fall, that shortfall is effectively deductible as a loss on from page 37 39 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) associated costs). Items ëbí and ëcí of the formula are zero. The outstanding balance at which the lessor is deemed to acquire (and the lessee to sell) the hire purchase asset is $695.87. The lessor must calculate income or expenditure that arises: ï from the sale of the hire purchase asset (or on the write-down of reacquired assets held on balance date to market value, where applicable); and ï under the accrual rules. Income/loss on sale or under trading stock provisions The asset is deemed to be acquired by the lessor for the outstanding balance of $695.87. It is sold for $650, so the lessor has a loss on sale of $45.87 (the loss may also arise if the asset is held on balance date and its value is written down to market value). Income/expenditure under the accrual rules The lessor's income or expenditure is calculated under the base price adjustment in section 64F(2) of the accrual rules using the formula: a - b - c where: a is the amount of consideration paid or payable to the holder under the agreement. In the example this amount is $1,116.54 - the sum of the deposit initially paid ($100), instalments made until January ($320.67) and the outstanding balance calculated under sections 222F and 222G ($695.87); b is the acquisition price of the agreement ($1,000); and c is the net amount to which the holder has previously been subject to tax (in this example, item ëcí is zero). On this basis, a - b - c is $116.54 for both the lessor (being income) and the lessee (being expenditure). The overall income from the arrangement for the lessor is $116.54 less the loss on sale of $45.87 - giving net income of $70.67. Example 2: Lessee pays part of shortfall The facts in this example are the same as in Example 1 except that the lessee makes a payment of $20 on the termination of the agreement in partial satisfaction of the amount outstanding. Item ëaí of the formula in s.222F to calculate outstand- ing balance is $695.87, as in Example 1. From this amount, deduct the payment of $20 received by the lessor (represented by item ëbí of the formula). Item ëcí of the formula is zero (the lessor made no payments). Accordingly, the outstanding balance at which the asset is deemed to be purchased is $675.87. Income/loss on sale or under trading stock provisions The asset is deemed to be acquired by the lessor for the outstanding balance of $675.87. It is sold for $650, giving rise to a loss on sale of $25.87 to the lessor (as before, the loss may also arise if the asset is held on balance date and its value is written down to market value). Income/expenditure under the accrual rules Again, the lessor's income or expenditure is calculated under the base price adjustment in section 64F(2) of the accrual rules, using the following formula: a - b - c where: a is the amount of consideration paid or payable to the holder under the agreement. In the example that amount is $1,116.54 - the sum of the deposit initially paid ($100), instalments made until January ($320.67), the payment received by the lessor upon termination ($20) and the outstanding balance calculated under sections 222F and 222G ($675.87). (The total amount of consideration received by the lessor is unchanged from Example†1; changes to the composition of that amount from Example†1 are italicised for emphasis); b is the acquisition price of the agreement ($1,000); and c is the net amount to which the holder has previously been subject to tax (in this example, item ëcí is zero). On this basis, a - b - c is $116.54 for both the lessor (being income) and the lessee (being expenditure). This is unchanged from Example†1. The lessor's overall income from the arrangement is $116.54 less the loss on sale of $25.87 - giving net income of $90.67. Example 3: Asset sold for more than the outstanding balance Assume the same facts as in Example†1 except that the asset is sold for $850. The proceeds of that disposition are used as follows: $100 is retained by the lessor to offset repossession and associated costs incurred; $695.87 is used to satisfy the remaining balance of outstanding principal and interest owed at the termina- tion of the agreement; and $54.13, being the remainder, is paid to the lessee. As in Examples†1 and 2, item ëaí of the outstanding balance formula in s.222F is $695.87. Item ëbí is zero (no payment is made by the lessee). Item ëcí is $54.13; the amount the lessor paid to the lessee - this is added to the amount determined in item ëaí to calculate the outstanding balance. Accordingly, the outstanding balance at which the lessor is deemed to acquire the asset is $750. continued on page 40 40 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) Example 4 Assume the same facts as in Example 1 above. How- ever, the holder is a cash basis holder under s.64D of the Act. Accordingly, accrued but unpaid interest of $22.63 is deducted from the outstanding balance of $695.87 computed in example 1, as provided for in section 222F(3). The outstanding balance at which the lessor is deemed to acquire (and the lessee to sell) the asset is reduced to $673.24. Income/loss on sale or under trading stock provisions The lessor is deemed to have acquired the asset for the outstanding balance of $673.24. It is sold for $650, giving rise to a loss on sale of $23.24 to the lessor (as before, the loss may also arise if the asset is held on balance date and its value is written down to market value). Income/expenditure under the accrual rules The lessor's income or expenditure is calculated under the base price adjustment in section 64F(3) of the accrual rules using the following formula: a - b - c where: a is the amount of consideration the holder derives under the agreement. In the example that amount is $1,093.91, being the sum of the deposit initially paid ($100), instalments made until January ($320.67) and the outstanding balance calculated under sections 222F and 222G ($673.24); b is the acquisition price of the agreement ($1,000); and c is the net amount to which the holder has previously been subject to tax (in this example, item ëcí is zero). On this basis, a - b - c is $93.91, being income for the lessor. The lessor's overall income from the arrangement is $93.91 calculated under the base price adjustment, less the loss on sale of $23.24. This gives net income of $70.67 (the same as in Example 1 above). Subsequent recoveries or payments Paragraphs (c) and (d) of section 222G(3B) deal with recoveries of any amount that the lessee owes to the lessor, or the return to the lessee of any amount recov- ered in excess of amounts owed by the lessee, if these payments are made after the income year in which a hire purchase agreement is terminated or expires. Generally, amounts subsequently paid are taken into account as assessable income and expenditure incurred in the year they are paid, as follows: ï they are deemed to be expenditure of the lessor; and ï they are deemed to be income of the lessee if the lessee has claimed a deduction on the hire purchase asset (such as depreciation), or if the asset was a revenue asset. Income/loss on sale or under trading stock provisions The lessor is deemed to have acquired the asset for the outstanding balance of $750. It is sold for $850, giving rise to a profit on sale of $100 to the lessor. Income/expenditure under the accrual rules As in Examples†1 and 2, the lessor's income or expendi- ture is calculated under the base price adjustment in section 64F(2) of the accrual rules using the following formula: a - b - c where: a is the amount of consideration paid or payable to the holder under the agreement. In the example that amount is $1,170.67, which is the sum of the deposit initially paid ($100), instalments made until January ($320.67), and the outstanding balance calculated under sections 222F and 222G ($750); b is the acquisition price of the agreement (in this case $1,054.13 - the initial cash price of the asset plus the payment of $54.13 paid by the lessor upon the termi- nation of the agreement); and c is the net amount to which the holder has previously been subject to tax (in this example, item ëcí is zero). On this basis, a - b - c is $116.54 for both the lessor (being income) and the lessee (being expenditure). This is unchanged from Examples 1 and 2. (The additional amount of $54.13 recovered and returned to the lessor affects items ëaí and ëbí of the base price adjustment formula equally. It is specifically added in ëbí and is included in the calculation of the outstanding balance in ëaí, so it does not change the net result.). The lessor's overall income from the arrangement is $216.54, made up of accrual income of $116.54 and profit on sale of $100. The profit on sale effectively represents the recovery of deductible repossession and associated costs. Note that in all three examples, the lessor's accrual income is the same. Adjustments to reflect shortfalls in the amounts recovered compared to amounts owing, or amounts recovered in excess of amounts owing, are reflected in the loss or profit on the sale of reacquired assets. Cash Basis Holders Cash basis holders and lessees who aren't required to comply with section 64C of the accrual rules do not have to account for accrued but unpaid interest. Accord- ingly, for these taxpayers subsections 3 and 3A of s.222G exclude accrued but unpaid interest from the definition of outstanding balance. This ensures that income or expenditure that arises under the base price adjustment should normally be interest paid or received in the year of termination. from page 39 41 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) Example 5 Assume the facts in Example 2 above except that the lessee pays the $20 after the income year in which the hire purchase agreement is terminated, the asset sold, and the base price adjustment is calculated (with the lessor computing income in that year as described in Example 1). Under s.222G(3A)(c), the lessor returns the $20 in the year it is received. Example 6 Assume the facts in Example 3 above, except that the repossessed asset is sold and the $54.13 additional payment to the lessee is made in the income year following the year in which the agreement terminates. Since no amount had been paid to the lessor at the time the outstanding balance was computed, the outstanding balance in the year of termination would have been $695.87 (being the amount owed at termination by the lessee, excluding repossession costs). The repossessed asset would have been held on the balance date of the lessor and, it is assumed, would have been valued at cost ($695.87). Accordingly, the only income that arose in the year in which the agreement is terminated would have been calculated under the accrual rules. The base price adjustment would have resulted in the recognition of $116.54 of income to the lessor, with the same calculation as in Example 1 above. In the following year when the asset is sold for $850, the lessor would recognise $154.13 as profit on sale (being the difference between the sale proceeds and the deemed acquisition cost under s.222G of $695.87). Under s.222G(3A) the lessor would also be able to deduct in that year the payment of $54.13 to the lessee. The net result is assessable income to the lessor in that year of $100. Assignments and transfers of HP agreements The assignment of income from a hire purchase agree- ment is treated as an ordinary assignment if the original lessor retains legal ownership of the underlying asset but assigns the income stream. The lessor will remain the original holder for the purposes of s.222F and s.222G. Assignments of hire purchase agreements have been excluded from the definition of a hire purchase agreement in s.222F(2). The definition of a lessor in section 222F has been extended to include any assignee of a holder of an agreement. This means that where a hire purchase agreement and the legal title in the underlying asset are both transferred: ï The original hire purchase agreement is deemed to be terminated for the purposes of calculating the initial holder's income under the accrual rules. The initial holder would calculate a base price adjustment ï The new holder would calculate accrual income from the agreement by referring to the price actually paid for the agreement, not the initial acquisition price of the hire purchase agreement (which is generally the cash price of the hire purchase asset). This is achieved by an amendment to paragraph (ca) of s.64BA(1). The definition of the acquisition price of a hire purchase agreement in that paragraph applies only to the ìfirst holderî of the agreement. ï The new holder would be deemed to be the lessor for the purposes of applying s.222G on the termination of the agreement. The issuer of the agreement should be unaffected by the transfer. Example 7 ìRetailer Coî enters into a hire purchase agreement with an issuer on 5 June 1993. The cash price of the hire purchase asset (and hence, its core acquisition price under s.64BA((1)(ca) of the Act) is $1,000. The term of the agreement is 24 months with monthly instalments of $45.81 plus an initial deposit paid of $100. The total consideration payable over the term of the agreement is $1,199.44. Retailer Co decides to sell the agreement on 5 January 1994 to Finance Co for $670. Under the terms of the sale, Finance Co assumes legal ownership of the hire purchase asset. As the assignee of Retailer Co, Finance Co would be treated as the lessor under sections 222F and 222G if the beneficial ownership reverts to the lessor on the termination of expiry of the agreement. Retailer Co would calculate a base price adjustment to work out its income from the agreement for its 1993-94 income year. Income would be calculated by referring to the amount realised for the agreement ($670), instal- ments made to the time of sale ($320.67) and the acquisition price of the hire purchase agreement ($1,000). In the year the hire purchase agreement acquired by Finance Co matures or is terminated, a base price adjustment would be computed to determine income from the agreement for that year. In calculating the base price adjustment, the core acquisition price of the agreement would be the amount actually paid for the agreement, i.e., $670. Transitional relief for pre-April 1993 hire purchase assets Transitional rules in s.76A of the Act allow taxpayers to recognise the retail profit element of pre-April 1993 hire purchase agreements as hire purchase payments become due and receivable (provided the retail profit element which would otherwise be assessable from 1 April 1993 is more than $1,000). Those transitional rules are described on pages 38-39 of TIB Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993). In the absence of any other transi- tional relief, this means that for the income year in which 1†April 1993 falls (referred to as the ìyear of adjustmentî) the following amounts of income would have been returned: continued on page 42 42 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) purchase agreements on a due and receivable basis as outlined above. In addition, the profit element of pre- April 1993 hire purchase agreements that becomes assessable during Retailer Co's 1993-94 income year (the year in which 1 April 1993 falls) on a due and receivable basis can be spread evenly between that year and up to the three immediately succeeding income years. This is provided for in s.76A(4A). On that basis, Retailer Co is able to spread the $250,000 that arises in the 1993-94 income year as follows: 1993-94$62,500 1994-95$62,500 1995-96$62,500 1996-97$62,500 Under s.76A(5), Retailer Co must notify Inland Rev- enue in its 1993-94 income tax return of: ï the aggregate amount of unreturned retail profit required to be added to assessable income in the 1993- 94 and following income years (in this case, $400,000); and ï the amounts to be returned in the three immediately succeeding income years following the 1993-94 income year (which is the year of adjustment for Retailer Co). On this basis, Retailer Co would return $62,500 of previously unreturned retail profit in its 1993-94 income year in addition to the $300,000 profit on sale of assets sold subject to hire purchase agreements in that year. Retailer Co would notify in its 1993-94 return of income the allocation of the remaining unreturned profit element as follows: 1994-95$150,000 + $62,500 = $212,500 1995-96$62,500 1996-97$62,500 Application date The amendments in general apply to hire purchase agreements entered into on or after 1 April 1993. The amendment in section 85 (to include reacquired assets in trading stock) applies to assets reacquired after 1†April 1993. The spreading provisions apply to tax on income derived in the taxpayer's income year in which 1†April 1993 occurs. For standard balance date taxpayers this will be the 1993-94 income year. ï the appropriate share of the retail profit element of pre-April 1993 hire purchase agreements on a due and receivable basis; and ï the retail profit on assets sold since 1 April 1993. If there was no transitional relief, the result of returning a portion of ìprevious yearsí retail profitî as well as ìthis yearís retail profitî in the year of adjustment results in a ìbubbleî of doubled up assessable income. To alleviate the cash flow pressure that this would cause for taxpayers, s.76A has been amended to permit taxpayers to evenly spread the additional income that arises in the year of adjustment from pre-April 1993 hire purchase agreements between the year of adjust- ment and up to the following three income years. The year of adjustment is the taxpayer's income year in which 1 April 1993 falls. For taxpayers with standard balance dates the year of adjustment is the 1993-94 income year. This relief is provided under section 76A(4A) and is available where the additional income that arises from pre-April 1993 hire purchases on a due and receivable basis in the year of adjustment exceeds $1,000. Taxpayers must notify Inland Revenue in their income tax return for the year of adjustment: ï the total amount of unreturned profit element of pre- April 1993 hire purchase agreements; and ï the amounts of that profit which are to be returned in each of the three income years following the year of adjustment. Example 8 As at 31 March 1993, the unreturned profit element of all hire purchase agreements held by Retailer Co was $400,000. Retailer Co has a 31 March balance date. Allocated on a due and receivable basis, the allocation of that amount between Retailer Coís 1993-94 income year and the subsequent two income years is as follows: 1993-94$250,000 1994-95$150,000 1995-960 In the 1993-94 income year, Retailer Co also derives $300,000 as profit on the sale of assets subject to hire purchase agreements. Under s.222G, this income is assessable in that year. Under s.76A(4) Retailer Co is permitted to spread the unreturned profit element of pre-April 1993 hire from page 41 43 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) Retirement Income Policies The Retirement Income Bill was passed through its final stages on 29†September 1993, and became: ï The Retirement Income Act 1993; ï The Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Amend- ment Act (No.2) 1993; ï The Income Tax Amendment Act (No.4) 1993 and will apply from 1 April 1994. Background The Bill was an outcome of the Todd Task Force on Private Provision for Retirement. The leaders of the Alliance, Labour and National Parliamentary parties entered into an historic ìAccord on Retirement Income Policiesî on 25 August 1993. This accord is now incorporated as a schedule to the Retirement Income Act. Key issues The three Acts together provide for - ï the appointment of an independent Retirement Commissioner: ï periodic reports on retirement income policies being implemented by current Governments: ï a change of name of National Superannuation to New Zealand Superannuation: ï periodic adjustments to the level of New Zealand superannuation within a range of levels: ï a transitional retirement benefit for anyone adversely affected by the raising of the age of eligibility for New Zealand Superannuation. The Retirement Income Act sets out the role, functions and powers of a Retirement Commissioner and provides for periodic reports on the retirement income policies being implemented by the Government of New Zealand. The Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Amend- ment Act provides for a transitional retirement benefit which will be available (subject to an income test) to persons born between 1 July 1934 and 31 March 1939 (inclusive) for certain defined periods before they become eligible for New Zealand superannuation. That Act provides for adjustments to the amount of New Zealand superannuation and veteransí pensions in line with movements of the Consumer Price Index. It also sets limits for New Zealand superannuation and veter- ansí pensions; these will not be (for a married couple) less than 65 percent or more than 72.5 percent of the average ordinary time weekly earnings. (There are minor differences in line with other existing differences in criteria for payments.) Tax legislation issues The Income Tax Amendment Act (No 4) 1993 deals only with a series of minor technical amendments which provide that wherever the expressions ìnational super- annuationî, ìnational superannuitantî and ìnational superannuitant surchargeî appear they are replaced with new terms reflecting the agreement in the Accord. The new expressions are ìNew Zealand superannua- tionî, ìNew Zealand superannuitantî and ìNew Zea- land superannuitant surchargeî Application date All of the provisions in these Acts apply from 1 April 1993. National Superannuitant Surcharge - Specified Exemption Section 336, Income Tax Act 1976 From 1 July 1993 the Department of Social Welfare may means test people who receive residential care disability services (subsidised care). In these cases the spouse may be paid the unmarried rate of national superannuation. This change ensures that a spouse who receives the unmarried rate of national superannuation is allowed the unmarried specified exemption rate when calculat- ing any surcharge liability. The change applies from the 1993-94 income year. 44 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) Superannuation Tax Reform Sections 204Q and 228, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction There are two minor amendments to the superannuation provisions to correct existing technical problems. They do not make any policy changes. The double taxation of investment income earned by two of National Providentís superannuation schemes has been corrected. Also, it is clarified that tax cannot be avoided on interest where a superannuation fund either lends to, or invests in, another superannuation fund. Background These amendments were required because: ï double taxation would unfairly lower the post-tax returns of the two National Provident superannuation funds; and ï existing legislation might allow the avoidance of tax on interest payments and investment income distribu- tions between certain superannuation funds. Key issues The key legislative amendments make these things clear: ï Certain National Provident superannuation schemes are not subject to the life office tax regime (which, combined with the NPFís organisational structure, causes double taxation), even though there are a small number of employers who do not contribute to the schemes. ï Interest earned by a superannuation fund on a loan to another superannuation fund is taxable. The distribu- tion of investment income from a parent superannua- tion fund to a member fund is not deductible. Application dates The first amendment applies from the beginning of the 1991/92 income year, in order to remove any past double taxation. The second amendment applies from the beginning of the 1993/94 income year. “Income-Tested Benefit” and “New Zealand Superannuation” Definitions Section 2, Income Tax Act 1976 There have been minor amendments to the definitions of ìincome-tested benefitsî and ìNew Zealand Superan- nuationî, to reflect the recently-enacted accommodation supplement (which replaced the accommodation benefit) and tenure protection allowance (Social Security Act (No.3) 1993). These payments are excluded from the definition of income-tested benefits and national superannuation, so they are not assessable. Funeral grants paid to a surviving spouse are also included in the exceptions in both definitions. The reference to telephone allowances, has been re- moved, since these have been discontinued. The amendment applies to amounts paid on or after 1†July 1993. Increased Family Support Rates Section 374D, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction An amendment enacts the increased Family Support rates and new age structure which were announced in this yearís Budget. Background The Government considered that the current Family Support age structure did not adequately deal with the costs of teenage children, so it decided to increase the rate for additional children 13 and over from $22 per week to $35 per week. Further, the rate for additional children under 13 was increased from $22 per week to $24 per week. Key issues The following table shows the old and new rates and age structures: 45 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) Old maximumNew maximum weekly ratesweekly rates (Before 1/10/93)(After 1/10/93) Eldest Child$42.00$42.00 Each additional child 13 or over$22.00$35.00 Each additional child under 13 years $22.00$24.00 Those additional children who are 16 to 18 years of age before 1†October 1993 and who are entitled to receive the higher rate of $42.00 will continue to receive this rate until they cease being dependent or until the end of the calendar year in which they turn 18. Inland Revenue will automatically re-issue certificates of entitlement to ensure that families who have already applied for Family Support receive their increased entitlement from 1 October 1993. The new rates of Family Support for non-beneficiaries will be direct credited to their bank accounts on Tuesday 12†October 1993. Beneficiaries will receive their increases on the follow- ing dates: ï Domestic Purposes, Widows and Invalid Beneficiaries: 5 October 1993 ï Sickness, Unemployment and Training Beneficiaries: 14 October 1993 Application date The increased rates and new age structure apply from 1†October 1993. Disclosure of Information for Family Support - Double Payment Identification Section 13C, Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 Section 375(G)(13), the Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction An amendment will allow Inland Revenue to match information on Family Support recipients against information that the Department of Social Welfare (DSW) holds, to identify families who may be receiving Family Support from both departments. Social Welfare will also use the information to help identify whether benefit fraud is occurring. Background The purpose of this amendment is to maintain the integrity of the Governmentís social assistance pro- grammes (Family Support and benefits). At present Inland Revenue pays Family Support to non-beneficiar- ies and Social Welfare pays it to beneficiaries. Key issues The amendment allows information held by Inland Revenue about Family Support recipients to be trans- ferred to DSW. DSW will match that information with information they hold on beneficiaries who are receiv- ing Family Support. Where a match occurs and a family is identified as receiving Family Support from both Departments, the results of the match will be transferred back to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue will write to those families who are identified as receiving a double payment, and ask them to provide reasons why the Inland Revenue payment should not be ceased. The amendment to the Family Support legislation enables Inland Revenue to stop paying Family Support if the recipient does not reply, or doesn't give sufficient reason why it should not be cancelled. The provisions of the Privacy Act 1993 will apply to the notification process. DSW will retain a copy of the results of the information match to help identify whether benefit fraud has oc- curred. Application date This amendment applies from the 1993/94 income year onwards. 46 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) Birth Certificate Required if Family Support Paid During Year Section 374G, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction Family Support applicants must now supply birth certificates or other information to verify the existence of children when applying for Family Support. The reason for this requirement is to reduce the likelihood of fraud. It prevents Family Support claims for non- existent children. Key issues When a family applies for Family Support for 1994-95 and following years, they must provide childrenís birth certificates or other information acceptable to Inland Revenue which verifies the childrenís existence. Other acceptable information includes the childís IRD number, passport or driver's licence. Once a child's existence has been accepted, the family will not have to supply the same information again in following years. However, if a different applicant applies for Family Support in a later year for the same child, s/he will have to produce a birth certificate or other information with that application. If an applicant cannot provide the birth certificate or other information at the time of filing an application, Inland Revenue will still accept the application and pay the Family Support entitlement for a period of eight weeks. If the birth certificate or other information is not provided within the eight week period, the Family Support payment for the non-verified children will cease. The applicant can make a subsequent application for Family Support once the birth certificate or other information is available. Application date This amendment will apply to Family Support applica- tions from the 1994/95 income year onwards. Disclosure of Debtors' Address Information Section 13D, Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 Section 240, Child Support Act 1991 Introduction An amendment allows Inland Revenue to give the Department of Social Welfare (DSW) addresses of liable parents and past beneficiaries who owe money to DSW. Background Currently, the Child Support Act 1991 allows Inland Revenue to transfer address information to DSW to help recover unpaid liable parent contributions. The amendment extends the transfer of address infor- mation to cover debts owed by past beneficiaries (those who received benefit overpayments but are no longer receiving a benefit). Key issues Where liable parents and past beneficiaries (debtors) owe money to DSW, DSW will be able to access IRD address information on that debtor and the address of his or her last known employer. This information will help DSW to track the debtor and recover debts owed to the Crown. The provision in the Child Support Act is repealed, and included in the new section 13D of the Inland Revenue Department Act. The information match complies with the requirements of the Privacy Act 1993. Application date The amendments come into force on 1 June 1994. 47 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) GST on Motor Vehicle Registration Fees Section 5(6A), Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 An amendment provides that the Ministry of Transport will return the GST on motor vehicle registration fees from 1 April 1994. At present NZ Post is the sole collection agency for motor vehicle registration fees, and returns the GST. Tax Invoices- Keeping Records for Second-Hand Goods Section 24(7), Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Under section 24(7) of the GST Act, any registered person who acquires second-hand goods which are not a taxable supply must keep certain records. These records do not have to be kept if the consideration for the supply was under $20.00. The amendment raises this threshold to $50.00 for supplies made on or after 28†Sep- tember 1993. Unit Trusts - Tax Exemption for Dividends Section 63(2H), Income Tax Act 1976 The original extension of the inter-corporate dividend exemption was to 1 April 1993. This was later extended to 1 April 1994. Consultation with unit trust operators is continuing. The Government has not yet made any decision on this issue. It is therefore necessary to extend the inter-corporate dividend exemption to dividends derived from redemp- tion of units in a unit trust by that trustís corporate manager until 1 April 1995. When the inter-corporate dividend exemption was removed from 1 April 1992, corporate managers of unit trusts who act as intermediaries in buying and selling units in the unit trust would have been liable for tax on any dividend component of any redemption of trust units. The Government is considering how to deal with this situation. Section 63(2H) was put in place to ensure that the tax exemption for dividends arising when a unit trust's corporate manager redeems units remained intact. Dividends and Associated Persons Transactions - Definitions Section 4(13), Income Tax Act 1976 Section 4(13)(d) excludes from the dividend definition associated party transactions which satisfy certain criteria. It has been amended to correct a drafting oversight. There is a detailed explanation of the effect of section 4(13) in TIB Volume 4 No. 9 (May 1993); this item should be read in conjunction with that explana- tion. The amendment inserts a reference to ìnon-resident withholding incomeî in subparagraph (d)(i). This makes it clear that a dividend arises in the following circumstances: Example TUK Co NZ1 CoNZ2 Co 100%80% 20% UK Co owns 80% of NZ2 Co and 100% of NZ1 Co. Both NZ1 Co and NZ2 Co are resident in New Zealand. T has a minority interest in NZ2 Co. NZ1 transfers property to NZ2 for no consideration. The transfer of property from NZ1 Co to NZ2 Co is a dividend (derived by NZ2 Co) because the criteria in section 4(13) are not satisfied. The transaction breaches paragraph 4(13)(d) because if NZ1 Co had transferred the property to UK Co, the transfer would have given rise to a dividend which was non- resident withholding income of UK Co. (Had NZ2 been a wholly owned subsidiary of UK Co. an exempt dividend would have arisen to NZ2 Co under section 63(2K)). The amendment applies from 26 April 1993, which was when the Minister of Revenue announced the amend- ment. 48 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) FBT Paid in Foreign Jurisdictions Section 106(2)(b), Income Tax Act 1976. An amendment will allow a deduction against assessable income in New Zealand for FBT paid overseas. Previously, the definition of ìincome taxî in section 106(2)(b) included FBT paid overseas, so it couldn't be deducted from assessable income in this country. The amendment removes FBT paid in foreign jurisdictions from the definition of income tax. This amendment applies from 1 April 1994, to coincide with changes in the Australian FBT regime. One of these changes will allow Australian taxpayers a deduction for FBT paid in Australia. Twice-Monthly Tax Deductions - Groups of Companies Section 353(5A), Income Tax Act 1976 Section 353(5A) prevents employers from splitting into smaller units to avoid paying PAYE twice monthly (which is necessary where total deductions of PAYE, Specified Superannuation Contribution Withholding Tax and Earner Premium are more than $100,000 per annum). Paragraph (a) defines when two or more companies are deemed to be one employer. It has been replaced by a reference to the grouping provisions in section 191(3)(a) of the Income Tax Act. The percentage for determining whether two or more companies are a group is reduced from 66 2/3 percent to 66 percent, in line with sec- tion†191. The amendment applies to deductions made on or after 28†September 1993. Collection of PAYE and Earner Premium Sections 2, 353, 355, 365 to 373, Income Tax Act 1976 Sections 77, 115, 117 and 130, Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 Introduction Amendments enable PAYE and ACC earner premium to be collected and recovered as one sum. Background The amendments ensure the efficient collection and recovery of ACC earner premium. Employers deduct earner premium as part of PAYE. The amendments ensure that any collection and recovery action by Inland Revenue on unpaid PAYE includes the earner premium component. Penalties can also be imposed on the combined amount. This means the PAYE and earner premium do not need to be separated out before compli- ance action can be taken. Key issues In essence, the amendments make these changes: ï They insert a definition of ìcombined tax and earner premium deductionî into the Income Tax Act. ï They enable recovery action to be taken for the combined deduction. ï They make it an offence under the Income Tax Act to fail to account for the combined deduction. ï They impose penalties (penal and additional tax) on the amount of the combined deduction. ï They amend the Accident Rehabilitation and Com- pensation Insurance Act 1992 to ensure that action relating to the non-payment of earner premium cannot be taken under both the Income Tax and Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Acts. Application date The amendment applies from 28 September 1993, the date of assent of the Act. However, there is a provision so that Inland Revenue does not have to separate out PAYE and earner premium deductions for the purpose of collecting, recovering or imposing penalties on any such deductions made on or after 5 August 1993. 49 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) Crown Health Enterprises Not Allowed to Maintain Imputation Credit Accounts Section 394B(2), Income Tax Act 1976 Crown Health Enterprises have been added to the list of companies in section 394B(2) which are prohibited from maintaining imputation credit accounts. The amendment recognises that the Crown (the sole shareholder in the Crown Health Enterprises) cannot benefit from any imputation credit that may be attached to dividends it receives, because it is exempt from income tax. The amendment is also consistent with the recent amendment preventing Crown Research Insti- tutes from maintaining imputation credit accounts. The amendment applies from 11 May 1993, the general commencement date of the Health and Disability Services Act 1993 (under which Crown Health Enter- prises are established). Local Authority Trading Enterprise Definition Section 63(2K), Income Tax Act 1976. Introduction Airport companies, port companies and energy compa- nies have been included in the local authority trading enterprise (LATE) definition for the purposes of the wholly owned group intercorporate dividend exemption in section 63. Dividends derived by local authorities from these companies will therefore not qualify for this exemption. Background Local authorities are liable for tax on all income derived from LATEs. Following an amendment by the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1993, airport companies, port companies and energy companies are no longer excluded from the LATE definition for the purposes of the local authority income tax exemption in section 61(2A) of the Income Tax Act. The Income Tax Act uses the LATE definition con- tained in the Local Government Act 1974. A LATE is defined in section 594B of that Act to mean, in short, any entity which the local authority controls. This definition specifically excludes airport companies, port companies and energy companies. The reason for these exclusions is that the relevant companies would other- wise be subject to the LATE regulatory regime in addition to their own sector-specific regulatory regimes. Key issues Section 63(2K) of the Income Tax Act has been amended to include airport companies, port companies and energy companies in the LATE definition for the purposes of the wholly-owned group intercorporate dividend exemption. Consequently, dividends derived by local authorities from these companies will no longer qualify for this exemption. The amendment ensures that airport companies, port companies and energy companies are now included in the LATE definition for all income tax purposes. The policy reason for the non-application of the wholly owned group intercorporate dividend exemption to a local authority is that because a local authority has no shareholders itself it should be treated as an ultimate (i.e., natural person) shareholder. It should therefore not get the benefit of any intercorporate dividend exemp- tion. The amendment is consistent with the policy intention of the local authority income tax provisions, which is that local authorities should be liable for tax on income derived from all entities under their control, thereby ensuring that these entities operate on a competitively neutral basis. Application date The amendment applies to dividends derived by local authorities from airport companies and port companies on or after 28†September 1993. In the case of dividends derived by local authorities from energy companies, the amendment applies to dividends derived on or after 23 July 1993. 50 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) Gift Duty Exemption Restricted Section 75A(5), Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 Introduction There is a gift duty exemption for property transferred by Court order under section 25 of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976. This exemption is now limited to transfers of property between spouses or settlements solely for the benefit of minor or dependent children of the marriage. The exemption will therefore not apply to transfers of property made to discretionary family trusts. Background The gift duty exemption in section 75A(5) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 applying to Court-ordered property transfers under section 25 of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 was previously open-ended. The exemption had been applied by the Courts to transfers of property made to third parties such as discretionary family trusts. The application of the section 75A(5) gift duty exemption to property transfers made to family trusts had undesirable implications for creditor protec- tion, income splitting and avoidance of social assistance targeting purposes. Gift duty currently acts as one of the few barriers to people immediately transferring their assets by outright gift to associated parties such as family trusts in order to defeat creditors, allow income splitting and avoid social assistance targeting measures. Divestments of assets are often structured as sales (at market value) rather than outright gifts so as to not incur gift duty. The debts which are taken back from such sales are assets of the transferor which can be claimed by creditors and taken into account for social assistance targeting purposes until they have been extinguished by gifting pro- grammes. Such gifting programmes can take a consider- able time to complete. Key issues Section 75A(5) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 has been amended so that the gift duty exemption applying to Court-ordered property transfers under section 25 of the Matrimonial Property Act is limited to transfers of property between spouses, and settlements solely for the benefit of minor or dependent children of the marriage. The gift duty exemption applying to Court-ordered transfers of property under section 25 of the Matrimo- nial Property Act 1976 does not now apply to any other persons. In particular, the exemption will not apply to transfers of property made to discretionary family trusts (including trusts whose potential beneficiaries include minor or dependent children of the marriage). The exemption will only apply to trusts which are settled solely for the benefit of minor or dependent children of the marriage. Application date The amendment applies to Court orders which are made under section 25 of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 on or after 28†September 1993. No Student Loan Deductions from Income-Tested Benefits Section 98A, Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 The Department of Social Welfare has been granted an exemption from the requirement to make student loan repayment deductions from income tested benefits until 31 March 1994. Charitable Organisations - Change of Name Section 56A(2), Income Tax Act 1976 Amendments reflect the name changes of two organisations having charitable donee status: ï The former Lepers Trust Board Incorporated is now known as the Pacific Leprosy Foundation. ï New Zealand Catholic Overseas Aid has changed its name to Caritas Aotearoa - New Zealand. This amendment applies to gifts made during the 1992-93 income year and any subsequent year. Other Minor Corrections There have been minor drafting corrections to section 191N(6) and (7) of the consolidation regime, section 327M of the resident withholding tax regime and section 6(2) of the Finance Act 1987. Annual Tax Rates The income tax rates for the 1992-93 income year will continue to apply for the 1993-94 income year. 51 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) Petroleum Mining - Minor Amendments Sections 214D, 214F and 214L, Income Tax Act 1976 There have been a number of minor drafting amend- ments to sections 214D, 214F and 214L of the Act. With one exception all of these amendments are of a technical nature. The only substantive change has been to s214F(9). The previous wording did not achieve the intention of the legislation under all circumstances. It has now been adjusted to reflect the original intention. This section is a clawback provision which operates when a exploration well which has been abandoned and had its expenditure deducted is subsequently used for petroleum production. In this situation this clawback provision is activated. The tax burden of the clawback was always intended to be apportioned on the basis of the ownership of the well at the time the section is applied, not when the deduction was claimed. These modifications to the clawback provision apply from 16 December 1991. Restructured Income Tax Act Proposed Plans are under way to enact a restructured Income Tax Act early next year. On 21 September the Minister of Revenue tabled in Parliament the Second Report of the Working Party on the Reorganisation of the Income Tax Act 1976. A proposed new Income Tax Act was at- tached to this report. The tax policy in the new Act is identical to that contained in the Income Tax Act 1976. The differences are in these areas: ï the provisions have been arranged in a new and more logical order; ï minor drafting changes have been made to modernise the wording of the legislation. The re-organised legislation is not intended to make any change to existing law. A provision stating this is contained in the proposed Bill. Background The Income Tax Act is the largest and most extensively amended piece of legislation on the statute books. In its final report released in October 1992, the Con- sultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital recommended reorganising the Income Tax Act 1976 and the Inland Revenue Act 1974. In November 1992 the Government established a working party to do this. This working party's brief was to report to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue with detailed drafting instructions for reordering and reorganising the income tax legislation. The working party was to consult the Parliamentary Counsel Office, the Treasury, and the Inland Revenue Department during this process. Main changes A new structure has been adopted, dividing the new Act into the following 15 parts: A Application B Core Provisions C Income further Defined D Deductions further Defined E Timing of Income and Deductions F Apportionment and Recharacterised Transactions G Avoidance and Non-Market Transactions H Treatment of Net Income of Certain Entities I Assessment of Income and Treatment of Losses J Surcharges K Rebates L Credits M Tax Payments N Withholding Taxes and Taxes on Income of Others O Definitions A new numbering system is also proposed. Sections will now be identified by reference to the Part and Subpart in which they appear. For example, section 394ZZZJ becomes section MD 4. This reference indicates that the section appears in Part M - Tax Payments, Subpart D - Refunds. The language of the legislation has been modernised, although the changes have been restricted to those that do not change the meaning of the law. For example, a subsection which read ìA taxpayer shall pay tax pursuant to this section on all income deemed to be derived by him under section XX of this Act for the income year ending on the 31st day of March 1994.î continued on page 52 52 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) would become ìA taxpayer shall pay tax under this section on all income deemed to be derived by that taxpayer under section XX for the 1993-94 income year.î The proposed Act omits provisions of the 1976 Act which no longer have any practical effect, even though they are technically still in force. In almost all cases these are provisions with restricted application dates which have now passed. Two other proposed Acts are also included in this package. A new Tax Administration Act will combine the administrative provisions of the Income Tax Act 1976 and the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974. A new Taxation Review Authorities Act will contain the provisions which relate to those Authorities. Legislative process The proposed legislation has been referred to the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee, which has called for public submissions in much the same way as would normally be done for a Bill. The Minister of Revenue has said that the draft Bill will be able to be reported back to Parliament soon after the election. Copies of the Working Partyís report and the proposed legislation are available from usual legislation stockists. 53 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.4 (October 1993) Volume Five, No.4October 1993 This Tax Information Bulletin deals with recent tax legislation. It covers these Acts: • Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1993 • Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1993 • Estate and Gift Duties Amendment Act 1993 • Stamp and Cheque Duties Amendment Act 1993 • Inland Revenue Department Amendment Act (No 2) 1993 • Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Amendment Act (No 3) 1993 • Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act (No 2) 1993 There is a full list on Page 1 of the topics covered in this bulletin. We haven't included “Questions we've been asked” or “Case notes” in this TIB because there wasn't enough room. They will reappear in the next issue. This TIB has no appendix
1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.5 (October 1993) Energy Company Shares - First Sale not Taxable People who sell shares that they received recently from local energy companies will not have to pay tax on the sale. There has been some speculation about the tax status of these shares. Inland Revenue has looked into the issue, and we can confirm that proceeds from the first sale of these shares are not taxable. The law is very clear in this area; sale profits are only taxable if the shares were acquired for the purpose of resale. Inland Revenue accepts that people who were allocated shares by energy companies did not acquire the shares for resale. However, if a person buys further shares with the purpose of resale then any profit on the sale of those shares will be taxable. GST - Funding from Regional Health Authorities to Rest Homes and Private Hospitals Summary From 1†July 1993 rest homes and private hospitals have been receiving funding from Regional Health Authori- ties (RHAs). We've been asked to confirm the rate at which they should account for GST output tax on this funding. Rest homes and private hospitals which operate as residential establishments should continue to account for output tax at the current rates (10.25% and 10.75% respectively) on payments they receive from RHAs for supplying rest home and hospital care. Background From 1 July 1993, Area Health Boards have been replaced by four RHAs and the Crown Health Enter- prises (CHEs). The RHAs are now responsible for buying health services for the populations in their respective regions. This responsibility includes provid- ing funding for rest homes and hospitals. There is a special rule in section 10(6) of the GST Act for determining the value of domestic goods and services supplied in commercial dwellings, including rest homes and hospitals which operate as residential establishments. GST is only charged on 60% of the value of the supply of domestic goods and services covered by section 10(6). Before 1 July 1993, rest homes and private hospitals usually accounted for GST at the effective rates of 10.25% and 10.75% respectively. These rates are based on a standard apportionment between the supply of domestic goods and services (covered by section 10(6) of the GST Act), and other goods and services supplied by the rest home/hospital. Alternatively, the home or hospital may choose to make this apportionment on a factual basis. GST Treatment The change in the contractual arrangements under which rest homes and private hospitals receive their funding does not change the rate at which they should account for GST output tax. They should continue to apply the lower effective rates determined according to section 10(6) and the apportionment formula accepted by Inland Revenue. These lower effective rates will apply regardless of whether a resident partly or totally pays the rest home/hospital fees, or whether the RHA pays them. Overdue Tax Returns - Late Filers Reminded Inland Revenue reminded more than 300,000 people to file their overdue tax returns recently. This is the first step in Inland Revenue's ìchase-upî process. Approximately 130,000 salary and wage earners and 190,000 self-employed people, companies and partner- ships received reminders. If people don't respond to these reminders Inland Revenue will estimate the amount of tax they owe and send them a bill. People are legally required to pay such bills unless they file their returns. Anyone who has received a reminder should respond to it straight away, as Inland Revenue will chase up people who don't play fair. More than 1.8 million individual taxpayers have already filed their tax returns. These people have made sure they are on time, and that their tax affairs are in order, but there is a hard core who think they are above the system. Inland Revenue is not sending reminders to people who have their returns prepared by tax practitioners. People who aren't certain if they should file returns should contact their local Inland Revenue office. Our staff will be happy to help. 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.5 (October 1993) Distributions of Trading Stock at “Under Value” to Shareholders Summary This item explains how ìunder valueî distributions of trading stock to shareholders or shareholder-employees will be valued. The provisions in sections 91 and 197 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (ìthe Actî) will apply unless the distribution is a fringe benefit to a shareholder- employee. In this case the valuation provisions of the fringe benefit tax regime (section 336O(4) & (6)) will be used. ìUnder valueî distributions to shareholders will be non- cash dividends to them under section 4. A company will be liable for fringe benefit tax on any ìunder valueî distributions it makes to shareholder-employees. Legislation that applies The Act has two sets of valuation provisions that could apply if trading stock is distributed to shareholders or shareholder-employees for less than full consideration: ï sections 91 and 197 (distributions of trading stock) ï sections 336O(4) and 336O(6) (the provision of fringe benefits). Distribution of trading stock to shareholders For the purposes of sections 91 and 197, trading stock includes these items: ï anything produced or manufactured ï anything acquired or purchased for purposes of manufacture, sale, or exchange ï livestock ï timber within the meaning of section 74 of this Act ï any right to take timber within the meaning of section 74 of this Act ï any other real or personal property, if the person who sells or disposes of it - is in the business of dealing in such property, or - acquired the property for the purpose of sale or other disposal ï any land (within the meaning of section 67 of the Act), if any profit or gain from selling or disposing of it would be subject to section 67 ï anything on which expenditure is incurred after 31†July 1986 and which - if possession of that thing were taken - would be trading stock. Trading stock does not include any financial arrange- ment (as defined in section 64B of the Act) to which sections 64B to 64M of the Act apply. Under sections 91 and 197, if trading stock is disposed of for less than its true value it is deemed to be disposed of at market price (or at a price determined by Inland Revenue, if no market price can be ascertained). These sections will apply when trading stock is disposed of either for no consideration, or for consideration less than its true value. Section 91 applies generally when trading stock is distributed ìunder valueî to any person. Section 197 applies specifically to ìunder valueî distributions of trading stock by a company to its shareholders. Such a distribution will be a dividend for tax purposes. A non- cash dividend is defined in section 4(3); it includes distributions of property to shareholders if the market value is more than the consideration paid. This covers ìunder valueî distributions of trading stock. Fringe benefits to shareholder-employees If trading stock is distributed ìunder valueî to a share- holder in the context of his/her employment, it will be a fringe benefit. Section 336N(3B) states that a benefit to a shareholder-employee (including ex-employees) by an employer is deemed to be provided to that shareholder- employee in the course of employment (subject to section 336N(3C)). Section 336N(3C) deals with non-cash dividends provided to non-executive director/secretary-sharehold- ers. It provides that such transactions will be subject to the dividend rules. Sections 336O(4) and (6) outline four methods for valuing goods provided as fringe benefits (subject to the ìspecial goodsî exemption provided by section 336N(5) and 336N(6)): 1. If the employer produced or processed the goods - the lowest price at which the employer normally sells the goods on the open market (at the time the employee receives the goods). 2. If the employer acquired the goods at armís length - the cost to the employer. 3. If Inland Revenue believes the value determined by either of those two methods is higher than the retail price at which the goods would be offered to the public - an amount equal to the retail amount. 4. If the value cannot be determined as set out above, an amount determined by Inland Revenue, based upon the amount which we determine a member of the general public would normally pay on the open market. Which section will apply Part XB of the Act (FBT) applies to every employer who provides fringe benefits to employees, including share- holder-employees. It makes these benefits taxable as if they were supplied in the context of an employment relationship. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.5 (October 1993) On the other hand sections 91 and 197 are general; they are independent of any employment relationship and cover most sales or distributions of trading stock for less than true or market value. Inland Revenue's approach as to which valuation provisions apply to a situation is based on the general rule of statutory interpretation: if more than one provi- sion could apply to the same situation, a specific provision has precedence over any more general provi- sions. Policy If trading stock is distributed ìunder valueî to a share- holder and no shareholder-employee relationship exists, the distribution will be treated as a dividend and valued under section 197. If trading stock is distributed ìunder valueî to a share- holder-employee and a shareholder-employee relation- ship does exist, the distribution will be treated as a fringe benefit and valued under the fringe benefit regime. If the shareholder's only connection with the company is as a non-executive director or secretary, any ìunder valueî distribution will be treated as a dividend and valued under section 197. Determination E9: Persons not Required to Comply with Section 104A of the Income Tax Act 1976 Summary This determination sets out circumstances under which persons do not have to make accrual adjustments to deductible expenditure, as required by section 104A. Background Expenditure that is deductible under section 104 must be adjusted for accruals that exist at the end of the income year. This determination specifies the type of expenditure, amount, and the maximum period from balance date where accrual adjustments are not re- quired. The only difference from Determination E8 is that this determination applies to the income year commencing 1 April 1993. The determination was made under section 104A(5) of the Act. The Commissioner signed it on 19 October 1993. The full determination is printed in the appendix to this Tax Information Bulletin. Application date The determination applies to the income year commenc- ing 1 April 1993. Upcoming TIB Articles In the next few months we'll be releasing policy statements on these topics in the Tax Information Bulletin: ï Repairs and maintenance policy resulting from the new depreciation regime ï When Inland Revenue can grant relief from payment of tax in cases of financial hardship ï Tax implications of the benefits from belonging to a frequent flyer scheme ï Various qualifying company statements We'll publish these statements as soon as we've finished consulting with external commentators. 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.5 (October 1993) Questions We’ve Been Asked This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that we've received. We've published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1976 Taxation of pay received in addition to normal pay ............................................................................ 5 Qualifying tax in dispute - interest payable by Inland Revenue ........................................................ 5 Charitable status for non-resident organisation ................................................................................... 5 Sale of Debt - base price adjustment not required by unaffected party ........................................... 6 Non-resident withholding tax and approved issuer levy ................................................................... 6 Keeping resident withholding tax deduction certificates ................................................................... 7 Private domestic workers and PAYE ..................................................................................................... 7 Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Layby sales and retailers ........................................................................................................................... 7 GST on rental of farm cottages ................................................................................................................ 8 GST when materials bought before GST introduced ........................................................................... 8 Sale of land was part of taxable activity ................................................................................................ 8 GST on withholding payments ................................................................................................................ 9 Services to non-residents .......................................................................................................................... 9 Overseas-resident company registering for GST ..................................................................................9 Gaming Duties Act 1971 Remission of interest on gaming machine duty ................................................................................. 10 Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 Student loan repayment where borrower goes overseas ................................................................. 10 Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 Printing of cheque forms ....................................................................................................................... 10 Child Support Act 1991 Custodial parent residing in Australia ................................................................................................ 11 Breach of separation agreement ........................................................................................................... 11 Estimate of current year's income where income amount order in force ..................................... 12 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.5 (October 1993) Income Tax Act 1976 Taxation of Pay Received in Addition to Normal Pay Section 2 - “Extra Emolument” defined: A company asked what rate it should deduct tax at when it allowed employees to work through one week's holiday as permitted by their award. The company pays the extra pay separately from the holiday pay. Section 2 defines an “extra emolument” as a lump sum payment made as part of a person’s employment, which is not overtime and which is not regularly paid and included in the wages or salary for a period. The employees working this extra week would receive normal pay for working as well as holiday pay. Therefore, the extra pay they receive is an extra emolu- ment. It will be taxed at the extra emolument rate of 28 percent. The earner premium will take this to a rate of 28.8 percent. Qualifying Tax in Dispute - Interest Payable by Inland Revenue Section 34A - Interest on Tax in Dispute where Objection Lodged: A taxpayer asked whether Inland Revenue pays interest when we concede an objection. Under section 34A(2) the Commissioner must pay interest on the qualifying tax in dispute that the taxpayer paid before a final decision was made. Qualifying tax in dispute is the amount of tax that is the subject of a competent objection. Section 34A (3) provides a formula for calculating interest. The prescribed rate of interest is 10%, and the interest will be assessable to the recipient. Charitable Status for a Non-Resident Organisation Section 61(25) - Income Derived by a Charity: An overseas organisation had charitable status in England. It asked if Inland Revenue can refund the non- resident withholding tax that was deducted from dividends it received from New Zealand. The organisation also asked if it could be exempted in the future. If a body is established exclusively for charitable purposes and not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual, its income is exempt from income tax under section 61(25). Section 310(2) provides that non-resident withholding tax does not apply to income that is exempt from income tax. The charity should apply to Inland Revenue for approval of its charitable status. It must send in a copy of its constituting documents such as the trust deed or the memorandum and articles of association with the application. Once Inland Revenue has approved the body's charitable status, non-resident withholding tax will not have to be deducted. The charity can apply for a refund of the non-resident withholding tax under section 326A if it can show that it was a charity for tax purposes when the New Zealand company deducted non- resident withholding tax. The charity in this case was not carrying on a business so the restrictions in section 61(27) as to charitable purposes within New Zealand did not apply. 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.5 (October 1993) Sale of Debt - Base Price Adjustment not Required by Unaffected Party Section 64F - Income and Expenditure where Financial Arrangement Redeemed or Disposed of: A company (“the issuer”) owed a debt to a finance company. The finance company (“the holder”) sold the debt to a merchant bank. The issuer asked whether it had to make a base price adjustment when the finance company sold the debt to the merchant bank. Under section 64F(2) a person must calculate a base price adjustment when a financial arrangement matures, is remitted, sold, or otherwise transferred by that person in any income year. Where a holder sells a financial arrangement, that holder must make a base price adjustment. Where the financial arrangement remains the same for the party that has not sold its rights under the financial arrangement (the issuer this case), section 64F(2) does not require a base price adjustment. However, a new financial arrangement will exist where the terms have been renegotiated at the time of the sale of the financial arrangement. All the parties must then make a base price adjustment. In this case the holder merely sold the financial arrangement in its existing form to another party at a discounted rate. The terms and conditions of the financial arrangement remain the same for the issuer so no base price adjustment will be necessary for the issuer. Non-Resident Withholding Tax and Approved Issuer Levy Section 311B - Approval of Person as Approved Issuer: A partnership asked about payment of the two per cent approved issuer levy as an alternative to deducting non-resident withholding tax on interest paid to a non-resident. “Approved issuer levy” can only apply where the lender and borrower are not associated persons. To qualify for the levy instead of non-resident withholding tax the borrower must obtain Inland Revenue's approval that: • the interest is paid in respect of a “registered security”, and • an approved issuer pays the interest. Section 86 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 defines a “registered secu- rity” as: “...any transaction involving money lent to an approved issuer that is - (a) Registered by the Commissioner under section 86H of this Act on the applica- tion of the approved issuer; or (b) One of a class of transactions so registered”. To obtain approved issuer status under sections 311A and 311B of the Income Tax Act, a person must apply in writing to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue will grant approval if the applicants have shown no serious default or neglect in complying with their tax obligations under any of the Inland Revenue Acts during the specified period in section 311B. The specified period begins on 1 August 1991 or the date two years before the date of application (whichever is later), and ends with the date of application. In this situation the partnership had a two year compliance problem with fur- nishing GST returns. Because of this Inland Revenue declined the application for the approved issuer status. 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.5 (October 1993) Keeping Resident Withholding Tax Deduction Certificates Section 327H - Resident Withholding Tax Deduction Certificates: A taxpayer asked how long he should keep his withholding tax deduction certificates. Section 327H (8) requires the recipient of a resident withholding tax deduction certificate to retain it for three years after the end of the year to which it relates, unless Inland Revenue permits otherwise. Private Domestic Workers and PAYE Section 355 - Employee to pay deductions to Commissioner: A taxpayer who was employed as a private domestic worker asked about his responsibilities regarding payment of his PAYE. The general rule in any employment situation is that employers are responsible for deducting PAYE from their employees' earnings and paying it to Inland Revenue. There is an exception to this rule for payments made to private domes- tic workers. Section 355 requires private domestic workers to pay their own tax deductions to Inland Revenue, even though they are technically employees. Inland Revenue refers to these types of taxpayers as IR 56 taxpayers. IR 56 taxpayers must pay tax deductions on a monthly basis by the 20th day of the month following the month in which they receive the earnings. A private domestic worker is defined in section 2 of the Act as a person em- ployed by any other person, where the employer is an occupier of premises used exclusively for residential purposes and the employment is for work about the premises, garden, or grounds. The employment cannot be part of any business of the employer, nor can the employment be regular full-time employment. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Layby Sales and Retailers Section 5(5) - Supply of Services: A retailer registered for GST asked about the treatment of layby sales and why the laybys are not treated like normal sales for GST purposes. The general rule is that the time of supply is the earlier of- • the time the supplier issues an invoice to the recipient; or • the time the supplier receives any payment. There are certain circumstances where it is not appropriate to use the general rule and so the legislation provides rules for specific situations. Section 5(5) provides that the time of supply takes place for a layby sale when the goods are delivered and when title passes to the buyer. This is usually when the buyer makes the last payment and takes possession. A supply is also made if the buyer cancels the layby sale and the seller retains or recovers any amount under the Layby Sales Act 1971. The GST treatment of layby sales is consistent with the established rules in the Layby Sales Act 1971. This results in less confusion as both Acts give comparable treatment to layby sales. 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.5 (October 1993) GST on Rental of Farm Cottages Section 6 - Meaning of Term “Taxable Activity”: A farmer was renting out farm cottages on his property on a long term basis. He wanted to know whether this formed part of his taxable activity. Section 6 defines the term “taxable activity” and excludes from the definition “any activity to the extent to which the activity involves the making of exempt supplies”. Section 14 defines exempt supplies and this includes the supply of accommoda- tion in any dwelling by way of hire, a service occupancy agreement, or a licence to occupy. The renting of the cottages does not form part of the taxable activity for GST purposes. This is because the making of exempt supplies does not form part of a taxable activity. GST When Materials Bought Before GST Introduced Section 8 - Goods and Services Tax Act 1985: A builder purchased a section on which he intended to build four units. He built one unit on the section but the market became depressed. Instead of building the other three units he chose to build a house on the remainder of the section. The builder built the house over a period of two years. He had bought the mate- rials and built the house before GST came into force in 1986. By the time he sold the house in 1987 he had registered for GST. He asked why he had to pay GST on the sale, and why he could not claim GST on the materials purchased. Because the builder bought the materials before the introduction of GST he could not claim a GST input credit as no GST had been charged on the purchases. Although the builder could not claim GST on the purchases this did not mean that GST was not payable on the sale of the property. Where a registered person sells goods in the course of a taxable activity, that person must account for GST on the sale. Sale of Land was Part of Taxable Activity Section 8 - Imposition of Goods and Services Tax on Supply: A company owned a piece of land that was zoned residential. It decided that because of the zoning it could not use the land in the main taxable activity for which it had registered for GST. It sold the land and asked if it should account for GST on the sale. Under section 51 of the Act it is the company that registers for GST, not the activity that it is conducting. Where a registered person supplies goods or serv- ices in New Zealand in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, section 8 requires the registered person to charge GST. In this case, although the ownership of the land and subsequent sale were not part of the company's main activity, they were part of its taxable activity. The supply is in the course and furtherance of the company's taxable activity. Fur- ther, the zoning of the land is irrelevant for GST purposes. Accordingly, the company must account for GST on the sale of the land. 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.5 (October 1993) GST on Withholding Payments Section 10 - Value of Supply of Goods and Services: A company that engages labour only contractors asked whether it could calculate the GST on the gross income less the withholding payment for ease of accounting. The company was in a buyer-created invoice situation for GST. GST is calculated on the value of the supply. This must be the gross amount before any tax is deducted from the withholding payments. The Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 define “withholding payments” and the tax deductions required. Withholding payments are usually casual payments where the relationship of the parties is not that of employer-employee. Services to Non-Residents Section 11(2)(e) - Services Zero-Rated: A GST-registered company that produces a music publication in New Zealand asked whether it should charge GST to overseas agents who pay for advertising space. Section 11(2)(e) provides that services supplied for and to a person who is not resident in New Zealand and who is outside New Zealand at the time the serv- ices are performed are zero-rated. The advertisements will be zero-rated if: • the advertisement is placed by a non-resident of New Zealand, • the person is not in New Zealand at the time the service is performed, and • the advertisement does not relate to land (or any building) or moveable per- sonal property in New Zealand. In this situation, the supply meets all the criteria. The supply of advertising space to the non-resident will be zero-rated. Overseas-Resident Company Registering for GST Section 51 - Persons Making Supplies in Course of Taxable Activity to be Registered: A company that is not resident for income tax purposes asked whether it could still be resident for GST purposes. The company is a non- resident importer making supplies in New Zealand. It operates a warehouse in New Zealand for the purpose of distributing its product to New Zealand retail- ers. Under section 51(1) a taxpayer must register for GST if the total value of supplies it made in New Zealand in that month and the previous 11 months has exceeded $30,000, or if supplies it makes in that month and the next 11 months are likely to exceed $30,000. For a non-resident supplier the key issue must be whether the goods or services are supplied in New Zealand. Section 8 of the Act deems, among other things, that goods and services are supplied in New Zealand if the supplier is resident in New Zealand. Goods and services shall be deemed to be supplied outside New Zealand if the supplier is not resident in New Zealand. It is important to know whether a person is resident in New Zealand for GST purposes when applying these tests. The GST definition of a resident is the same as for income tax, with one additional proviso. The proviso deems a person to be resident in new Zealand to the extent that the person carries on any taxable activity or any other activity in New Zealand, while having any fixed or perma- nent place in New Zealand relating to that taxable or other activity. continued on page 10 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.5 (October 1993) The company has the warehouse in New Zealand. This is a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to the taxable activity, so the company is resident in New Zealand for GST purposes. The Act deems the supplies to be made in New Zealand. These taxable supplies exceed $30,000 per annum, so the com- pany must register for GST. This may be to the company’s advantage as it will be able to claim input tax credits. Gaming Duties Act 1971 Remission of Interest on Gaming Machine Duty Section 12F - Interest on Unpaid Gaming Machine Duty: A club that operates gaming machines asked whether Inland Revenue could remit the interest charged on overdue gaming duty on the grounds that the club had suffered additional administrative pressures because it had relocated. Inland Revenue has no discretion under the Gaming Duties Act to remit or cancel interest on unpaid gaming machine duty. If Inland Revenue does not receive payment on or before the 20th of the month following the return period, interest will be charged on the duty outstanding at the rate of 5% for every month or part month. Section 12FA of the Act does provide that where duty remaining unpaid at its due date is $5 or less then no interest is payable. The duty remaining unpaid by the club at its due date was more than $5. Ac- cordingly, Inland Revenue had correctly imposed interest on the overdue gam- ing machine duty and could not remit it. Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 Student Loan Repayment where Borrower goes Overseas Section 32 - Repayment to be Made by Instalments: A student who went to live overseas permanently in February 1993 asked whether he had to repay his student loan balance of $3,000 in the 1994 income year. Under section 32(a), in any income year where a student has a loan balance of less than $15,000, the borrower’s loan repayment obligation will be the smaller of: • the current loan balance; or • $1,000 plus any estimated interest chargeable on the loan balance for that income year. Section 34 provides that a non-resident borrower’s repayment obligation calcu- lated under section 32 is payable in four equal instalments in the income year, due on the last days of June, September December and March. In this case the legislation requires the student to pay $250 plus the loan balance interest on each instalment date during the 1994 income year. Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 Printing of Cheque Forms Sections 82 and 83 - Cheque duty payable by Licensed Printers An overseas printing company had clients who wished to pay their quarterly dividends with cheques drawn on New Zealand banks and prepaid with cheque duty. The company wanted to know the procedure for obtaining a licence to print these cheques. from page 9 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.5 (October 1993) Most cheque printing is done by the relatively few printers that have been licensed under section 82 to pay commuted duty monthly instead of having to get individual special licences before printing. The granting of licences under section 82 is confined to printing firms engaged extensively in the printing of cheques, who would otherwise have to make numerous applications for li- cences, and the subsequent authority to print. It is intended to license only those firms dealing with a large number of cheques per month. Apart from these licensed printers, in some cases other persons and firms may pay the duty before the cheque forms are printed and put into use. The duty sections of Inland Revenue's Palmerston North, Christchurch and Auckland offices may issue licences for cheque forms and send authorities to print at the same time to the printer of the forms. Inland Revenue issues these licences under the provisions of section 83. Before we will consider an application under section 83 we need this informa- tion: • where the cheques will be produced • the expected volume of cheques and numbers of printing orders • the approximate number of cheques to be produced per month • the number, if any, of “special licences” or extensions of licences in the previ- ous 12 months • the number of cheques involved in such licences Child Support Act 1991 Custodial Parent Residing in Australia Section 5 - Children Who Qualify for Child Support: A liable parent asked whether he was liable to pay child support while his former wife (the custodial parent) was living in Australia. Section 5 sets out the circumstances in which a child qualifies for child support. Children may be qualifying children if they are New Zealand citizens or ordinar- ily resident in New Zealand. Sections 8(1) and (2) provide the criteria used in determining an eligible custodian. Provided that the custodian seeks payment for a qualifying child, and meets the conditions in section 8(2), his/her country of residence will not affect child support eligibility. In this case the liable parent must continue paying child support while the custodial parent and his children are in Australia as the children are New Zea- land citizens. Breach of Separation Agreement Section 6 - Parents by Whom Child Support Payable: A liable parent asked whether he was still liable to pay child support even though his former wife had breached their separation agreement. Section 6 of the Act sets out the circumstances in which child support may be sought from a person. This section does not take into account any breach of a separation agreement that may have occurred. The Act requires that the two matters be considered separately. The liable person must continue to pay child support while disputes of this nature are resolved. 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.5 (October 1993) Estimate of Current Year's Income Where Income Amount Order in Force Section 40 - Election Where Taxable Income for Child Support Purposes is Estimated to Have Fallen at Least 15 Per Cent: A liable parent asked if he could re-estimate his current year’s income as his income had recently dropped more than 15%. He was paying child support based on an income amount order applied for earlier in the income year. Section 40 allows a liable parent whose income has dropped by at least 15% from the last income year to elect to pay reduced child support, based on the lower income amount. Section 40(3)(b) states that a liable parent cannot make an elec- tion where an income amount order is in force for any month for which the election is to apply. An income amount order is an order made by a court to vary the liable parent's child support income amount or to change the calculation of that amount. In this case there was such an income amount order in force following a judg- ment of the Family Court. Therefore, the liable parent was not able to re-estimate his income in this income year. 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.5 (October 1993) Legal Decisions - Case Notes This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

CIR, HC M.53/87 Act:Land and Income Tax Act 1954 - Section 88AA Keywords:Land subdivision, undertaking or scheme, sale or other disposition. Summary:This case dealt with the sale of sections in a subdivision following a change in the law. Profits on sections sold after the change were subject to income tax despite a ruling given before the law change that the subdivision profits would not be taxable. continued on page 14 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.5 (October 1993) from page 13 Facts:Before he subdivided land in 1973, the objector sought an Inland Revenue ruling as to whether profits for the land would be subject to income tax. On the basis of the law existing at that time the taxpayer was informed that the profits would not be taxable. After the introduction of section 88AA (1)(e), which dealt with profits and gains from the subdivision of land, Inland Revenue assessed the profits arising from the sale of any sections after 10 August 1973 - the date of the public announce- ment of the intended legislation. Decision:The objector argued that the legislation should only apply to undertakings or schemes started after the date of the public announcement. Judge Cullen did not agree, citing the decision in Aubrey v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1984) 6 NZTC 61,765. The amendment applied to profits and gains from the sale of sections after the application date of the new legislation. The fact that Inland Revenue had previously confirmed that the subdivisional proposal was not taxable does not affect the situation. Inland Revenue’s assessments of the profits were confirmed. Comment:The taxpayer is appealing this decision Whether Trees are Included in the Definition of Land Rating:•• Case:Windermere Forests Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue M No 4/93 Act:Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, sections 2, 10, 15, 40, 41, 42 Keywords:Land, improvements, trees. Summary:The Authority found that “land” as defined in the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 includes trees. Inland Revenue is satisfied that this decision recognises the common law position stated in Kauri Timber (1840-1932) NZPCC 636; that trees are part of the land and this remains applicable today. The value of the land is the property conveyed and it includes trees. Facts:The objector purchased land for $195,000. The price was to be apportioned as to the value of the trees on the land being $150,000 and the value of the land at $45,000. Inland Revenue assessed stamp duty on the value of the land and trees together. The objector claimed that the value of stamp (conveyance) duty should be computed on the value of the bare land. Decision:The definition of “land” includes the value of trees on the property conveyed. Inland Revenue’s assessment which included the value of the trees was correct. Judge Greig also held that “improvements” include all trees and timber. Comment:We do not know whether the taxpayer will be appealing this decision. Resident Status when NZ Home Rented out on Long Term Basis Case:TRA No 93/35 Rating:•• Act:Income Tax Act 1976, section 241 Keywords:Residency, permanent place of abode. Summary:The enduring relationship a taxpayer has with New Zealand determines whether that person has a permanent place of abode in this country for the purposes of determining residency. 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.5 (October 1993) Facts:The taxpayer was continuously absent from New Zealand for 368 days. During his absence he let out his house on a long term basis. He sought relief from paying tax in New Zealand on his New Zealand-sourced salary and other overseas income. Decision:The main issue was whether a house let on a long term basis can be a person’s permanent place of abode. Under section 241(1), the taxpayer’s home does not have to be readily available to him during his period of absence overseas. The house was available to him when he returned to New Zealand. He had and continued to have an enduring relationship with New Zealand in many areas. Judge Barber decided that during the taxpayer’s absence overseas his permanent place of abode continued to be in New Zealand. The taxpayer was a New Zea- land resident under the Act. Comments:We do not know whether the taxpayer will appeal this decision. Application to have Proceedings Struck Out Denied Rating:• Case:Canterbury Frozen Meat Company Ltd v. CIR Act:Judicature Amendment Act 1972 and Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Judicial Review, reassessment, protective assessment Summary:Inland Revenue applied to the High Court to strike out judicial review proceed- ings brought by Canterbury. The Court rejected Inland Revenue’s application. Judge Gallen determined that it was inappropriate for the proceedings to be struck out as Canterbury had an arguable case. Facts:Due to subsequent developments in the related Thomas Borthwick and Sons case (\[1992\] 14 NZTC 9101), Inland Revenue issued a “protective” amended assess- ment to Canterbury some years after the original return and assessment had been accepted. The taxpayer sought judicial review of the amended assessment. They sought a declaration that Inland Revenue had acted “ultra vires” (beyond its powers) in issuing the amended assessment and that both the decision to issue the assessment and the assessment itself were invalid. Inland Revenue applied to have the proceedings struck out, arguing that the Court had no jurisdiction to hear the proceedings. We submitted that objections to assessments are dealt with by Part III of the Income Tax Act. Decision:Judge Gallen dismissed Inland Revenue’s application. He said that as Canter- bury had an arguable case, it was not appropriate for the proceedings to be struck out. Comments:Inland Revenue is appealing this decision. GST Registration not to be Cancelled before Date of Farm Sale Rating:• Case:TRA No 90/68 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, sections 11(1)(c) and 52 Keywords:Going Concern , inclusive of GST Summary:The vendors of a farm were liable for GST. They requested that Inland Revenue cancel their registration from a date before they sold the property, as they had purportedly relied on advice from Inland Revenue that the sale was zero rated. Inland Revenue declined their request and a case was stated to the Taxation continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.5 (October 1993) from page 15 Review Authority. Judge Barber issued an interim decision in favour of Inland Revenue. Facts:The objectors sold their farm on 11 October 1986 for $287,500 “inclusive of GST”. At the time of the sale the vendors and the purchasers believed that the sale of the farm was that of a going concern. They allegedly based this belief upon verbal advice from the local branch of Inland Revenue. The purchasers later claimed an input tax credit for the purchase of the farm. Consequently, Inland Revenue assessed the vendors for GST on the sale of the farm. All parties now agree that the sale of the farm was not a sale of a going concern. The vendors objected to the assessment in the belief that they had been unjustly treated. They had requested Inland Revenue exercise its discretionary powers under section 52 to cancel their registration from the date that they had been registered for GST. Inland Revenue declined to exercise this discretionary power to cancel the registration. Decision:Judge Barber found that the vendors were liable for GST on the sale of the farm. He assumed that Inland Revenue had refused to exercise its discretion on the basis that the objector had never been liable to be registered and that the objector had carried on the taxable activity of farming up to the time of supply. He also assumed that Inland Revenue had considered that it was inappropriate in this case to provide relief to the objector. Judge Barber granted leave to either party to complete the hearing or develop it further. Any application had to be made within 28 days or the decision would become final. Comments:We are unaware of any decision to make further submissions on the issues raised by Judge Barber, or whether the taxpayer is appealing the decision. Trader Assessed on Profit from Share Sales Rating:••• Case:TRA No. 91/128 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, sections 65(2)(a) and 65(2)(e) Keywords:Purpose, investment. Summary:Profit from the purchase and sale of shares was held to be assessable income. Facts:The objector, a sharemarket trader, purchased shares as an “investment”. Sharebrokers who dealt with the taxpayer's employer offered the shares to the taxpayer at a reduced rate as a goodwill gesture. The offer was on the under- standing that the taxpayer would retain the shares as an investment, rather than selling them within a short time of acquisition. The objector’s subsequent actions show that the shares were purchased with the intention of disposing of them at a profit as soon as it was appropriate to do so. It was found that the shares were not purchased as a long term investment. The share transaction was found to be part of the objector’s trading activity. Decision:The Authority’s decision was that the profit from the sale of the shares was assessable income under section 65(2)(a) and (e) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Comment:We do not know whether the taxpayer is appealing this decision 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Five, No.5 (October 1993) November 5 PAYE deductions and deduction schedules for last 16 days of October 1993 due - ìlargeî employers only. 7 First instalment of 1994 Provisional Tax due for taxpayers with July balance dates.
