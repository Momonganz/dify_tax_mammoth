Why New Zealand needs a Comprehensive Income Tax The dictionary definition of “income” is “the amount of monetary or other returns, either earned or unearned, accruing over a given period of time” (Collins). For tax purposes the “given period of time” is 12 months ending on the 31 st of March each year. If you were to put that definition in front of the average person and ask them whether income tax should be applied first to earned income or to unearned income (often, but somewhat inaccurately, referred to as “capital gains”), most would chose the latter. They would agree with me that it is not fair that nurses for example, must pay taxes on their earnings, while those who add greatly to their wealth simply by owning assets, pay nothing! Yet that is exactly the position in New Zealand. Many New Zealanders will be surprised to learn that in Australia and other developed nations, people do pay tax on unearned income. We are the outliers. Not only do people in New Zealand not pay tax on unearned income, but that income is also passed on untaxed to their descendants as well, since we haves no estate tax. In short unearned income is passed on from one generation to another tax free! This is wrong and it needs to change. If it does not, then the inequality in this nation, which is growing rapidly, will continue for all time. We will increasingly be a nation of the haves and have- nots. Already the fast shrinking decline in home ownership rates means that a growing number of people will rent their home for their entire lives; experience hardship in retirement and leave little or nothing to their children. This is not the New Zealand I want and is not what our ancestors longed for. Many of them left Britain for New Zealand because they despised the class system. Their philosophy was that “Jack is as good as his master” and they wanted to live that out in an egalitarian society. People like Kate Sheppard and Michael Joseph Savage would be staggered to learn that their egalitarian dream is no more and that our beloved county is now divided, like the old world class system, between the rich and the poor. Prime Minister Savage’s policy was “from each according to their means, to each according to their need”. He described this as “practical Christianity” and it is (see St Paul 2 Corinthians 8:12-15). Interestingly the social justice teaching of the Church places income from work (labour), ahead of earnings from capital gains; because it is through work that the great majority of us support ourselves and our families. The reality in New Zealand however is precisely the other way around. Here income from work is taxed and unearned income is exempt. We have it 100% wrong! In 1988 the Royal Commission on Social Policy, chaired by the late Judge Sir Ivor Richardson (President of the Court of Appeal and one of New Zealand’s greatest experts on taxation), heard my submissions on this issue. When the Commission reported back to the then Labour Government, they concluded that “viewed in terms of fairness (and economic efficiency) the argument for taxing capital gains is overwhelming” Their reference to fairness I have mentioned, but they also spoke of “economic efficiency” as a second reason for such a tax. That is because, if one source of income (earned) is taxed and the other (unearned) is exempt, the whole economy is skewed towards the latter, since people are then incentivised to maximise their after tax income by seeking unearned income. An efficient economy with a level playing field, will tax both earned and unearned income at exactly the same rate and ensure that any tax owing (since unearned income is taxed only on realisation) is collected on death. So why do those who have unearned income continue to pocket that wealth tax free? The answer is “because we elect parties that let them!” In 1990 for example, the Labour Party’s policy was to introduce legislation to tax unearned income, but a group of well funded millionaires campaigned vigorously against it and National, who then and now seeks to preserve “no tax on unearned income”, was narrowly elected. We must not let that continue to happen. It is estimated that there are 100,000 or so millionaires in New Zealand (many just because they own a freehold house in Auckland), but there are about 3.2 million people on the electoral roll, so the numbers are there to change the current law if we want to. Are we going to allow the 10% of voters who already own 60% of the nation’s wealth (source: Statistics New Zealand), to continue to call the shots, or do we want a fair tax regime for all?

A Tax on Unearned Income (Capital Gains) In 1988 I made a submission to the Royal Commission on Social Policy in relation to the untaxed income derived from capital. The Commission was chaired by eminent lawyer and President of the Court of Appeal, Judge Sir Ivor Richardson who has also made an enormous contribution to the tax laws of New Zealand. I first became aware of the economic distortions which result from the absence of a general tax on income from increases in the capital value of land, while involved in a Northland Resource Study for then Minister of National Development Bill Birch, during my days as a self employed Business Consultant in the early 1980’s. I was the economic consultant in a group of three which included a PH.D in geography and a senior Government official. We modelled the economic and productivity gains which would result from building an irrigation scheme in a dairy farming area of Northland. Clearly such a scheme would allow the dairy farmers involved to increase grass growth and herd size by eliminating or reducing the risk of drought. This would increase the productivity of the farms involved, boost profitability, reduce debt and create new jobs; all positive outcomes. However our modelling also showed that it would immediately increase significantly the value of the land, creating a significant tax free income for the owners. For that reason, as soon as the irrigation scheme was announced, many of the struggling dairy farmers involved would sell their farms to what, in those days, were called “Queen Street Farmers” i.e. millionaires, looking to make tax free capital gains! This is hardly what the Minister of National Development had in mind! Had the Government funded an irrigation scheme from taxpayers money they would have immediately created tax free capital income for both the farmer’s involved and a group of already rich Queen Street Farmers. That coupled with the resultant economic inefficiency, put paid to an irrigation scheme. The focus for those involved would have shifted from increasing the productivity of the land – the goal of the study – to the value of the land itself. I saw immediately that the absence of a capital income tax in New Zealand was both unfair from a social policy point of view and economically inefficient. Australia, the UK, Canada, India the USA and many other counties all have capital income taxes, so why is New Zealand any different? Is the lack of such a tax one of the reasons that our per capita productivity lags behind these countries? When the Royal Commission came along I therefore decided to make a submission, since the absence of a capital income tax on land is also a question of basic fairness. Income from capital such as interest and company dividends is taxed just like any other income so why should income gains from the capital itself not be taxed? It is an important question with a very simple answer “there is no reason and it should be”. Obviously if income from those sources is not taxed but income from all other sources is, then simple logic will ensure that people will put the ownership of land and businesses ahead of other assets shares and that is exactly what has happened in New Zealand for many years. In essence the absence of such a tax skews our economy from productivity to capital gains. The result is that although we probably have more land per capita than most nations on earth the price of land in New Zealand (be it for housing, farming or industry) is very expensive. Economically this is huge negative. When land prices are forced up because the income gain is untaxed, then buyers are forced to borrow heavily or be shut out of the market completely. It is also a magnet for overseas buyers many of whom cannot believe that the income they derive from their land will not be taxed, when it most certainly is in their homeland! It is interesting to note that in its social teaching the Catholic Church places earnings from work ahead of earnings from capital gains, because it is through work that the great majority of us support ourselves and our families. A moral issue is therefore also involved. My presentation to the Royal Commission was followed with fierce interest by Sir Ivor Richardson, who asked a number of important questions and then thanked me for my submission. I gained the impression that he was agreeably surprised to receive a submission on a land income tax. I began by setting out the definition of “income” as if is defined by economists; namely “the increase in a person’s wealth between two points in time” or “the amount of monetary or other returns, either earned or unearned, accruing over a given period of time”(Collins Dictionary). I will use the Collins definition in this submission since is more readily understood by the man and woman in the street, who are sometimes bewildered at terms like “capital gains” let alone “rent seeking”. No distinction should be made between earnings from labour and an increase in wealth by other means. Against that background the taxation of earned income in New Zealand (e.g. the nurse’s who work in intensive care) coupled with the total exemption of unearned income which flows from the ownership of capital assets (e. g. land and business owners), is a grave economic and social distortion. These realities encourage and indeed provide a State subsidy to people to invest heavily in projects which exhibit capital growth such as investment in industrial properties, farms and rental housing. They boost the price of such assets compared with other asset classes such as investments in the financial markets or starting a new business (the source of growth in jobs and the economy), because any increase in their value (a near certainty because God is not making any more land!), is tax free. If much of the available capital is monopolised for new office blocks, endless takeover activity, rental housing and the purchase of land, then it is not available for investment in small businesses, manufacturing and high tech start ups. Yet it is the investment in new plant and machinery and new technology which, drives economic growth, productivity and employment. In earlier years an argument used against a capital gains tax was that it did not allow for the effects of inflation. That is a valid argument but it is offset by the fact that most capital gains are “locked in” (sometimes for decades) until realised in cash i.e. when the property is sold, whereas the tax on income from labour is mainly PAYE. A problem does arise however in endeavouring to collect capital income taxes yearly, since unless the assets are sold within a year of purchase, no funds have been realised with which to pay the tax. For that reason the tax on income from capital should not be levied until the assets are realised by sale or gift (gifts are in the category of unearned income so they need to be taxed), transferred to a different entity, or death. (I note that heritage tax is outside of the Working Groups terms of reference, but I am not talking about that. Rather I am referring to the final tax return of a diseased person. This must happen since otherwise unearned income, sometimes in the millions, can be passed from one generation to the next without ever being taxed. I believe that is fundamentally unjust). However this in turn creates a problem since the owner of the assets then has an incentive not to sell or otherwise dispose of them for as long as possible. It is called “lock in”. Logically therefore the unearned income from capital that is not already taxed, should be: 1. adjusted for the effects of inflation (which decreases the amount to be taxed) and, 2. subject to compound interest as say the Official Cash Rate (OCR) as it accumulates year by year, until it is realised. Since inflation and the OCR move in sequence (because OCR movements by the Reserve Bank are adjusted up or down by reference to inflation), then these two elements effectively cancel each other out. Therefore, to avoid the complications which would arise, the pragmatic thing to do is simply to tax unearned income in the year it is realised and becomes payable. Logically unearned income from all sources must be taxed even if it belongs to trusts including family trusts (I appreciate that your terms of reference exclude unearned income from the family home; for pragmatic reasons). So what income from assets should be taxed? The simply answer is everything else! That includes, land (depreciation could then be reintroduced for rental properties), buildings, shares, farms, art works, precious metals, antique cars, aeroplanes and anything else which gives rise to capital gains, although for ease of administration art and jewellery costing less than $3,000 or so could be exempt. There should be no exceptions and the rate of tax should the same as that on earned income. In due course the Royal Commission reported back to Government on this issue. They favoured a realisations basis for the tax and accepted that this would mean “some erosion of the tax goals of equity, efficiency and neutrality until the actual realisation where the tax is deferred until actual realisation\*. They nevertheless found that “viewed in terms of fairness (and economic efficiency) the argument for taxing capital gains is overwhelming” Strong words indeed from Sir Ivor Richardson. The positive scope for such a policy is obvious when the demographics are considered. A comprehensive capital income tax would impact on only that fraction of New Zealanders who own significant and valuable assets; a group which is a minority of the voting public. I believe the vast majority of New Zealander’s would support this tax because they would benefit from it. They could buy houses and farms more cheaply and more capital would be made available to job creating businesses through the capital markets as people moved capital from land to shares and bonds. Above all it would be fair and just and would be totally consistent with our egalitarian heritage and inbred sense of fair play/social justice. One of reasons our ancestors left the old world (particularly the UK) was to escape the hated class system. But, because unearned income is not taxed, the wealth inequalities in New Zealand mean that we now have a class system i.e. the difference between the rich and the poor! The children of the rich will live in mansions and go to the best schools and inherit huge amounts of money from their parents. Those from poorer families will live in rented accommodation and go to the local schools while their parents will leave them nothing! This is what Sir Ivor Richardson was saying in supporting a tax on unearned income on the grounds of “equity” and “fairness”. Over time a tax on unearned income will reduce the wealth gap between rich and poor whilst, through the resultant increase in economic efficiency creating much needed new wealth for the Nation.

SUBMISSION TO TAX WORKING GROUP I am a buy and hold property investor of 35 years experience. Currently my wife and I own 15 rental residential properties through the medium of a Family Trust. We have owned 13 of these properties for over 10 years and the other 2 for 9 and 7 years. We have been paying tax on the profit from these properties for 13 years. Initially, they made a loss but over time became profitable and then taxable once the losses were absorbed, a normal situation in property investment. There are a number of types of property investor, a fact many people including the media overlook, but the great majority are buy and hold as over time wealth is built through inflation and more recently, a shortage of accommodation throughout New Zealand. Many people think that property investors are favoured by the current tax structure, but in fact compared to other businesses which are able to claim all expenses, depreciation etc, residential property investors are restricted on what they can claim. A previous IRD director has stated this to be true publically. As there 581,000 rental properties compared to 1,735,000 owner occupied homes you can see approx. 1/3 of homes are rental properties. Any changes to the current tax structure will have a big impact on peoples housing, especially if there are negative changes. As of now the tax law regarding the sale of residential rental properties states that it is the intention of purchasing the property at the time of purchase, that determines if tax is paid on the capital gain at the time of sale. The brightline test, currently 2 years although will almost certainly be 5 years if a new bill becomes law, overrides the initial intention clause. Tax on the capital gain within the brightline test time frame has to be paid. The third capital gain tax practise is that if the property is sold after 10 years, no tax is payable on the gain. It is my submission that all of the above paragraph is rather unsatisfactory to all parties and difficult for the IRD to administer. I therefore ask you to consider the following idea- That there be no capital gains tax per say but that any capital gain on rental properties be taxed by treating the gain as income and added to the normal income of the taxable structure. However, there is a sliding scale in applying the above. If the property is sold in the first year of ownership, then the full amount of the gain is taxable. In the second year 90% of the gain is taxable, in the third year 80% is taxable and so it continues until after 10 years no tax is payable. This will eliminate any of the messy current legislation and still retain the incentive to hold properties for the long term as is necessary to retain investment in the sector so 1/3 of the population can be housed. A hardship clause would be part of the legislation allowing genuine cases to have some relief upon application to, say the Tenancy Tribunal. If a Capital Gains tax is to be implemented it is imperative that a Capital gains tax be applied to all forms of capital gain, not just property. I have no ideas for other forms of capital gain tax, other than to say that our tax system seems to penalise investment, even down to tax on interest on savings, which seems to be very short sighted, given that, as a country we are short of capital investment.

Dear Tax Working Group (TWG) Personal preamble: I’m a little bit peeved to be writing this because I am currently in Buenos Aires, it is a lovely day outside and I’m sure there is something better I could be doing with my time. However, I want to make sure these views are expressed. My submission is entirely personal and does not represent the views of The Opportunities Party nor Dr Gareth Morgan. I am pretty sure he would say similar things in terms of substance, though the tone would no doubt be a bit less polite than mine. Last time I spoke to Gareth he wasn’t making a submission because he is pissed off about the Terms of Reference. I’ve decided to make a submission anyway, because I realise that isn’t your fault. And yes, you can contact me if you want to discuss any of the points raised. Summary of Key Points and Recommendations 1. The future of tax is reducing the tax on labour and paying for it by increasing the taxes on capital, resources (environmental taxation) and bads (alcohol, junk food and other legalised and regulated drugs). 2. The purpose of tax is to collect the money we need to pay for a civilised society in the most efficient and fair way possible. 3. We aren’t taxing the right things – see 1 above and 5 below. 4. Tax can make housing more affordable. However, the exemption on owner occupied housing is complete tosh. 5. What matters to me is both fairness and efficiency. We can’t have both with an exemption on owner occupied housing. Instead I am suggesting a form of asset taxation with a tax free threshold high enough to exclude most Kiwi families (and therefore their homes). This tax-free threshold must also apply to Kiwisaver, and ideally include shares and bank deposits. Submission First up, I think we all agree that the purpose of a tax system is to gather the revenue required to pay for a civilised society; I. in the most efficient (least distortionary) manner possible; and II. in the fairest way possible – meaning people with similar means are treated equally and people with more means pay more. Our current tax system is failing on both these counts, as this analysis shows. There is a growing gap between rich and poor, and our tax system has a massive distortion towards housing and away from productive investment. How can we solve these problems? A Capital Gains Tax is Not the Answer Let’s get this out of the way. Simply put, a Capital Gains Tax (CGT) applied on a realised (cash rather than accrued) basis is distortionary. It discourages selling of assets in order to avoid the tax. This reduces turnover of assets, resulting in sub-optimal allocation of assets in the economy. Houses would get held on to by baby boomers even longer. Succession of family businesses would get delayed even more. This is before we even start to contemplate the distortions added by an exemption on owner occupied housing. This really makes a CGT a total waste of time because it encourages all sort of gaming of the system, as Morgan Foundation found in our review of what works in taxing wealth and property. Less distortionary alternatives include a Land Tax and the Comprehensive Capital Income Tax (CCIT) as designed by the Morgan Foundation and advanced by The Opportunities Party at the last election. A Land Tax is no doubt simpler than the CCIT. However, realistically a Land Tax will result in (accurate) cries from farmers about double taxation. After all, they are already paying income tax on their profits (if they make a profit). In my view the result of this process would be a Land Tax that looks surprisingly like the CCIT. Of course, this quickly takes us to the issue of how to deal with the exemption on owner occupied housing. A Fair Tax System. An Efficient Tax System. An Exemption on Owner Occupied Housing. Choose Two. First up, let’s be clear: one simply can’t achieve fairness and efficiency with an exemption on owner-occupied housing as per the Tax Working Group’s Terms of Reference. Let’s put to one side the difficulty of even applying such an exemption in reality, as I have discussed previously. The central problem is that you can’t have all three of these things: a fair tax system, an efficient tax system and an exemption on owner occupied housing. You have to choose two. I realise this issue is outside the Terms of Reference of the Tax Working Group (TWG) but I believe the Number One finding of the TWG should be to reiterate this point, at the very least to help educate Kiwis. As Bernard Hickey pointed out (with the Tax Working Group’s own analysis) the tax break on owner occupied housing is the largest distortion in the New Zealand tax system, both in relative and absolute terms. Much maligned ‘speculators’ are merely capitalising on this addiction at the fringes. By ignoring this distortion in the tax system, it means that any money raised by a tax change has to be spent either reducing the resulting inequality or improving efficiency of the tax system. You can’t do both. Reducing inequality requires money to make the tax system more progressive, either by reducing GST or dropping the tax rates applied to lower incomes. The alternative is to reform the welfare system, which also costs money and is sadly also outside the Terms of Reference of the TWG. Assuming the distortion on owner-occupied housing remains, improving the efficiency of the tax system could also be achieved by reducing the tax applied to other investments. This happens in some European countries, such as tax-free savings accounts or tax exemptions on retirement savings. This would not improve equity one iota, because such exemptions benefit the rich most. Dr Cullen knows about all this, it is why he designed the Kiwisaver incentives the way he did; on a dollar for dollar basis up to a cap. The trouble is that there would not be enough money from a tax reform to pay for both a fair and efficient tax system. We see this in those countries with exemptions on owner occupied housing and incentives on other forms of investing. They don’t have fair tax systems, resulting in a growing gap between rich and poor. Those that act to reduce inequality generally do so through steeply progressive income tax systems which reduce inequality in income – not wealth – but also the harm the efficiency of the tax system. A CCIT or land tax (including the family home) would remove the key distortion in the tax system, allowing the money raised to be pumped into reducing inequality. It is a win/win solution. On a personal note, if the exemption on owner occupied housing is applied, my intention is to pour all my wealth into buying a really really big house. Maybe the one next door too, and knock through. Then I will live in it, allow my friends to live there too rent free in return for in-kind services such as maintenance, buying and cooking food, paying the electricity bills and rates. This seems like the rational way to minimise the tax bill on my wealth going forward, as well as appealing to my slightly hippy dippy tendencies toward communal living. Managing the Politics of Taxing the Family Home How do we manage the politics of taxing the family home or family farm? In my view the best way to do this is not by excluding the family home, but by implementing the CCIT and putting in place a tax-free threshold. The level of such a threshold is a political question, although the higher the level means less tax is gathered. A tax free threshold is less distortionary because it is blind to which assets an individual invests in. If they want to invest their tax free assets in a lifestyle business or farm, so be it. The money need not go into the family home. To make the system truly neutral the money raised could be applied to making sure people have a similar exemption threshold on the earnings from bank accounts and shares. At the very least any earnings from investments in Kiwisaver should be included in the exemption threshold. The average Kiwi family would probably not balk at an individual threshold of $500,000. Aucklanders might, but we care about regional development now, right? Such a threshold might finally give people like my parents a reason to cash up and leave central Auckland, freeing up housing for people that actually work there (sorry Mum and Dad). If you really want to be politically safe, have a personal threshold of $1m – that would be $2m for a couple. Most Auckland houses would still be exempt, except maybe in Epsom. Beyond that level, the CCIT would apply. Of course, this does nothing to help the 40% of New Zealanders that have no assets at all. That is why any exemption - including the family home - is ultimately middle class welfare. In my view it is vital that we have an efficient and fair tax system. I have only been in Argentina a matter of days but the gap between rich and poor is stark, and it seems to feed into the massive political instability the country suffers from. Attempts to reduce inequality by populist governments are usually poorly implemented and end up damaging the economy, fuelling neoliberal reforms which favour the rich (and so the cycle repeats). New Zealand must avoid this fate, and tax reform is central to doing so. Environmental Taxation A final thought on environmental taxation. The usual economist view is that the double dividend from environmental taxation is only possible if it can reduce distortions in the tax system. New Zealand is generally seen as having a non- distortionary tax system (apart from housing as discussed above), hence the double dividend isn’t possible. I disagree. There is a new school of thought on this which points out that any taxation on labour favours the linear economy over the circular economy. The circular economy is labour intensive, and the linear economy is capital intensive, and our current tax system incentivises people to replace labour with capital. To incentivise people to reduce, reuse and recycle we need to shift the basis of taxation to environmental or resource taxes and use the revenue to reduce taxes on labour. This will encourage the use of labour for reusing and recycling resources. So should we have environmental taxes? Hell yeah. If I were boss, there would be a carbon price of at least $50 per tonne of CO 2 , and a price on water for commercial users. All commercial ocean users would pay a resource rental too. All money would either go into either improving the environment or lowering the tax burden on labour. The Golden Thread The golden thread to all of this is the need to future proof our tax system. The economic changes starting to take place are large and rapid. Jobs are being replaced by robots and artificial intelligence. The need to retrain is increasing. Technology is not only taking the jobs from the poor, but also the middle class. To keep up with these changes we need to shift of taxation from labour to taxing capital, environmental taxes/ resource taxes and taxing “bads” including alcohol, junk food and other legalised drugs. I have not discussed the last concept in this submission but it is at least as important in terms of improving wellbeing in the long term.

Deemed Rate of Return on Income from Rental Property This submission is a suggestion for taxing rental property which at present enjoys a preferred status compared to other investments, and produces an advantage to rental property owners over owner occupiers. The preferred status and advantage comes about through a. the use of leverage (driven by RBNZ Bank capital adequacy rules) at a higher level than alternative investments b. returns being mainly through untaxed capital gains and not taxable income. This provides an advantage over shares, bonds and other traditional investment classes c. A rental property owner being able to offset the costs of ownership against income, and in particular being able to deduct interest payments from the rental income. This provides a pricing advantage to a rental property owner over an owner-occupier, and could be a factor in increasing house prices. While house price inflation is justifiably a hot topic, given the potential impact on the wider economy, the. right solution in the long term is to increase housing supply, but it is a slow process. On the other hand, measures to reduce demand could be introduced much more quickly. One focus of any new measure would be to reduce the incentives of investing in rental properties vs other investment alternatives. The measure most commentators focus on is the introduction of a Capital Gains Tax (CGT) to help mute demand and level the playing field between asset classes. This tax is seen as complex, administratively inefficient and politically difficult for those who introduce it. In addition, given that it is generally levied at the time gains are realised, it may not do much to curb investor behavior in the short term. An alternative that I have not seen discussed is to change the way income on rental properties is assessed, which I’ve called a deemed rate of return for rental properties. In concept, it is identical to the Deemed Dividend regime (Fair Dividend Rate) applying to overseas shares, which was introduced because such shares often have low dividend returns and the majority of their value lies in capital appreciation. It would seek to address both the issue of over-investment in residential real estate( driven at least in part by tax free capital gains), and create a level playing field between property investors who can deduct interest (and other property costs) and home owners who cannot. A Deemed Rate of return solution offers  Expected capital gains taxed on an ongoing (annual) basis  Impact on investment behavior occurs in the short term  A simple and easily administered calculation and collection of tax  A tax revenue stream that occurs immediately, and does not require the sale of a property to ascertain taxation liability and payment  The creation of a level playing field between property investors and home owners (neither can deduct interest or other property related expenses) How does it would work? A deemed rate of return would be set annually for residential property investment – this could be done by reference to an observed market return (eg the gross dividend yield return from listed property shares) or by adding an amount to the govt bond rate (eg 5 year Govt bond rate plus x%). It would reflect the expected net return from property investment before tax (made up of both expected capital gains, and a net return from renting) This rate would be applied to the property value (which would be the higher of latest Council valuation or last sale price) to obtain a deemed income for the property. For example, assuming a 5% deemed return rate, the deemed income on a $600,000 investment property would be $30,000 p.a. The deemed income would be adjusted to take into account occupancy – eg if a property was only rented for 48 weeks of the year, the deemed income would be 48/52nds of the annual deemed income. This deemed income would be added to the income of the entity owning the property. Tax would be collected on this deemed income at the marginal tax rate of the owning entity. So if a property was owned by a Trust, that rate would be 33%, a company 28% or by an individual, that individuals marginal tax rate. For a trust owning the property in the example above, the method would result in tax payable of $30,000 x 0.33 = $9,900 annually on the deemed rental income. The actual income from the property would be tax exempt – ie there would be no requirement to declare the actual rental income. However, no expenses relating to the property (interest, rates, repairs, etc) would be able to be claimed as the deemed income is set on the basis of a net return. The combination of removing deductibility of interest, and paying tax on expected gains on an annual basis would be expected to act as a significant curb on investment in residential property. It would also mean that aggressive gearing of property would have a lesser financial advantage as the interest costs of doing so would no longer be deductible. What would this deemed return apply to This method of determining income would only apply to residential rental property. It would not apply to owner occupied houses, commercial property, apartments leased to hotel chains, employer supplied housing, etc. A test of whether it would apply could be whether there is an obligation to pay a bond under the Residential Tenancy Act. The bond database held by MBIE would also provide a check that tax was being paid on a rental property. I would suggest that there be a number of exemptions from the regime. In particular, providers of social housing (such as HNZC and Community Housing Associations) could qualify for an exemption Summary A deemed rental income would be relatively easy to legislate for (it is not a new tax, just a method of calculating income), very simple to administer for both investors and the IRD, and could be implemented quickly. As an alternative to a CGT, it is specifically targeted at residential property investment, and would have a more immediate impact on investor behavior.

New Zealand’s current tax system is fit for purpose in today’s world. Should the world continue to develop as it has in the past, then it is capable of remaining relevant with mere tweaking at the fringes. However it is highly unlikely that things will continue as they have in the past. With the advent of emerging digital financial technologies such as crypto- currencies, we run the risk of becoming fatally out-dated. The Banks understand this and are frantically buying up every crypto-currency patent that they can get their hands on, in an attempt to stay relevant. If state institutions are unwilling to adapt, there is the potential for them to lose all relevancy in what some have described as the 4 th industrial revolution. Crypto-currencies are already moving quickly beyond the decentralised payment block-chain that is BitCoin. In fact, the block-chain is already dated technology as new alternatives emerge that are less costly to operate, but far more scalable than BitCoin. This emerging technology brings with it the possibility of a commercialised ‘Internet of Things’. Meaning billions of micro or even nano smart contracts happening every minute. These smart contracts could form the basis for new automated companies that operate on a decentralised currency with a transaction network so vast that it would be nearly impossible to regulate or police. The current system has to rely on the conversion of crypto-currency into fiat before taxation can be policed. If users are no longer required to transfer in and out of these new currencies, then the current system will become irrelevant in this field. Further, with stabilised crypto-currencies, and more user friendly digital interfaces, there is the possibility for a large scale uptake in use of crypto- currencies as payment methods within our economy. This also brings about the possibility of a dramatic increase in non-disclosed income. The more widespread that this becomes, the further crown tax revenue will fall. \[1\] 4 If we were ever to reach a point where crypto-currencies became the preferred method of payment, Inland Revenue would have to revert to a single land tax (or similar), as it would be highly likely that they would not have the resources to police a decentralised payment system. Therefore, I submit that in order to retain a functioning national revenue gathering system, we need to get ahead of the curve regarding emerging financial technologies. Fortunately, the current structure of Reserve Bank payment clearance systems lends itself well for a near seamless shift to a comprehensive single tax that has effectively zero compliance costs and is practically unavoidable. Proposal That New Zealand remove all taxes (save for excise or behavioural based taxes) and adopt a single infrastructure tax, in the form of a flat rate transaction tax administered by the Reserve Bank of NZ. I submit that doing so, at a rate of 1%, will gather over 30% of GDP in revenue, and greatly reduce the cost of administration of the IRD, and compliance costs on individuals, companies and corporations alike. \[1\] 5 How Would Such a System Work? The Reserve Bank of NZ operates the Exchange Settlement Account System, and High value clearance system NZClear. Together with SWIFT, Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) at the Reserve Bank clears on average $29 Billion a day. Multiplied by 250 business days per year, that would give us an annual clearance value of $7.25 Trillion. At 1% of just those clearance payments, NZ could raise $72.5 Billion in tax revenue. To date I have been unable to get an estimate of the relative size of intra-bank transactions. However, conservatively estimating that intra-bank transactions would value around 25% of the value of total inter-bank transactions. This tax system levying 1% of the above mentioned transactions and intra-bank transactions via digital collection (Programed into the processing software and transferring the revenue gathered directly to the Crown Settlement Account), would raise over $90 Billion in revenue. Approximately 32% of GDP @ a GDP of $280 Billion. Additionally, The Continuous Linked Settlement system works on the ESAS- SWIFT interface. Settling an average daily exchange of $60 Billion, there is the potential to gather up to $150 Billion per annum. However, this would need to be weighed in order to assess whether it would have any negative effects in international payments. It could, however, be a valuable tool in decreasing high frequency trading and speculation in the NZD, therefore increasing the stability of our currency and reducing the likelihood of a speculative attack. If this tax were implemented, and the entire settlement amounts above were available to be taxed, then it would be possible to raise approximately 40% of GDP (GDP @ Approx. $280 Billion) with a tax of 0.5%. This philosophy of this tax is to remove the focus from income, and place it on transactions. In other words: “In order for you to facilitate this transaction, you must use public infrastructure, therefore, you must pay a levy of 1% (for example) of the transaction to the State to maintain and improve that infrastructure.” \[1\] 6 The Future Environment What do you see as the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system over the medium- to long-term? Which of these are most important? As mentioned above, technology will usher in many difficulties. There is an on going shift in consumer behaviour that is only increasing. For example, traditional brick and mortar retail outlets have to compete with the likes of Amazon, Wish, and AliExpress. With international shipping becoming more and more effective, and the quality of cheep goods slowly closing the gap with more expensive alternatives, consumers are purchasing international goods with ever increasing ease. Further, the increase in emerging alternative and decentralized payment methods such as crypto-currencies is creating a growing field of potential alternatives to traditional currencies. Though currently volatile, relatively un- scalable and at times costly to operate, this emerging tech is adapting quickly and overcoming many of the hurdles preventing it from becoming a preferred payment method. I submit that it is not a matter of if, but when, will these technologies displace sovereign fiat currency. What do you see as the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system over the medium- to long-term? Which of these are most important? \[1\] 7 Purposes and Principles for a Good Tax System Principles for assessment What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? A tax system must be fair, and raise enough revenue to maintain and expand the countries infrastructure to support sustainable growth. It is important for a tax system not to dis-incentivise earning more, and it should be simple enough, yet comprehensive to prevent taxpayers from avoiding or evading the payment of tax. Defining ‘fairness’ How would you define ‘fairness’ in the context of the tax system? What would a fair tax system look like? A fair tax system encompasses principles that enable it to levy taxes in relation to someone’s ability to pay, while taking into account the level of benefit a taxpayer receives from the use of our collective infrastructure. For example, The person who uses our roads, energy grid, education system and health services should have a lower tax burden than the person or company that requires vast infrastructure usage to facilitate large volumes of sales to generate profit. By taxing transactions rather than incomes, and removing the ability to avoid payments based on overspending or using loopholes, we further widen our tax base and remove the ability to avoid paying. The larger a transaction, the larger the overall revenue gathered. \[1\] 8 The Current New Zealand Tax System Frameworks New Zealand’s ‘broad-based, low-rate’ system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. Looking to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? If not, what approach should replace it? As noted above, with the rapid development of emerging financial technologies, the current tax system may no longer be the best approach. It is important to shift to a simplified and non-invasive system to mitigate the incentives of a wide-scale adoption of alternative payment systems that will likely erode tax revenue. Taxes and behaviour Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes? Taxes can be a valuable tool for effecting behaviour. However, such taxes should be used only to help the damage caused by the behaviour the government seeks to modify (i.e Hypothecated). The current regime of excise taxes is separated from the three primary tax revenue sources, and therefore could remain in place during a shift to the new tax system. It should be used rarely, as the advantage of the above-proposed single tax is for simplicity and reduced/eliminated compliance cost. Adding more taxes for the purpose of behaviour modification will undermine its simplicity. \[1\] 9 Retirement savings Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? Any encouragement of retirement savings must be applauded, however, adding complexity to a tax system for the sake of encouraging savings is counter-productive. The above noted revenue gathering potential shows that there is the possibility to greatly increase government revenue. Therefore, rather than complicating a streamlined tax system, it would be better to invest part of that additional income for direct incentives such as dollar for dollar retirement saving incentive schemes. \[1\] 10 The Result of the Current Tax System Fairness and balance Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? No, particularly around speculating with the NZ Dollar. Also we see the damage caused by speculation in the housing markets. Though lauded for its simplicity, New Zealand’s tax system is still sufficiently complicated to allow individuals and companies to limit, avoid or outright evade tax liability through the use of various financial instruments. Such evasion results in reduced tax revenue and deteriorations of the standards of infrastructure causing a detrimental affect to our supporting infrastructure, and therefore the productive economy. Further, the average individual or small business does not have the same resources to limit or avoid tax liability, meaning that a large sector of our economy is disadvantaged. This disadvantage limits healthy free market competition that promotes progress by empowering an effective monopoly of large companies. The above-proposed system is so comprehensive that settlement cannot occur without the attached tax liabilities being satisfied. There are no loopholes for transactions settled in NZ with the NZD. Tax and business Does the tax system do enough to minimise costs on business? No, the system outlined in this submission shows that compliance costs on business can be greatly reduced. Further, the lack of compliance and elimination of large seasonal outgoings would greatly assists many of the business start-ups that currently fail in NZ. \[1\] 11 Does the tax system do enough to maintain natural capital? Are there types of businesses benefiting from low effective tax rates because of excessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income? No, the ability of some individuals and companies to avoid taxes does not necessarily mean retention of natural capital. In fact, there is very little to support that the use of trusts for example is used to reinvest into the growth of the company. Meanwhile, companies in early stages can struggle with the seasonal nature of outgoings. Provisional tax and lump sum tax payments can put undue stress on small businesses unnecessarily, leaving them with reduced working capital. A transaction tax at the reserve bank level means that tax obligations are satisfied at the time of the transaction taking place. The result is zero compliance costs and a practically unavoidable/evadable tax system. \[1\] 12 Thinking Outside the Current System What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? Which of these inconsistencies are most important to address? Companies purposely running at losses or specifically spending in ways to avoid tax obligations are inconsistent with the concept of income tax. Companies with charitable trust shareholders have the ability to avoid paying tax even in situations where it may not be that all the income is directed towards charitable purposes. By shifting the rational for the tax away from being based on income, and instead base it on use of infrastructure; transactions are taxed for the purpose of maintaining the underlying infrastructure, rather than levying a portion of income to support services. This removes the ability to redefine income as something else to avoid the attached tax liability. Further, it means that charities will have to prove that funds were spent on charitable uses to obtain a cash tax rebate, rather than to claim that it was used for such purposes in the hope it will never be investigated. Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? No, additional taxes mean additional compliance and administration costs. The more complicated a system is, the greater the opportunity to avoid obligations. Moreover, the more intrusive a tax system is, the greater the incentive is to avoid it. As repeatedly mentioned in this submission, if there is a strong incentive to avoid tax obligations, then there is a higher possibility of a large- scale uptake in emerging disruptive financial technology. If anything, the tax system should be greatly simplified. \[1\] 13 Specific Challenges Housing affordability How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? Again, by complicating the tax system, the possibility of unintentional tax loopholes increases. That being said, tax can be a valuable tool for affecting behaviour. By implementing the proposed tax system in this submission, there arises a possibility to establish a tax rebate on the family home, as well as a percentage based rebate on tax liabilities arising as part of a new home build. Capital gains tax Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have? Capital gains taxes are another way of further complicating our tax system that is currently praised for its broad base and simplicity. However, the proposed tax system acts in place of a capital gains tax. For example, if there is a capital gain in the value of property, and that capital gain is extracted and spent; the arising transaction subjugates the gain to the same flat rate tax applied elsewhere. Even though the system is simplified further than current, it also broadens the tax base. Land tax Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? As mentioned above, introducing more taxes increases compliance and administration. Further, by levying taxes on a single group of people, there is an increase in risk of how those taxes will be mitigated by the landowners. There is little control over where the ultimate liability will lay. For example; a land tax on an investment property will likely end up being paid by the tenants. \[1\] 14 Instead, we have the opportunity to simplify the tax system and place the liability on those who are using public infrastructure. Meaning that everyone that participates in a transaction will pay the same. Those who financially use the infrastructure more will pay more with zero compliance cost, and very little administrative cost. Environmental taxation What are the main opportunities for effective environmental taxation? Environmental taxes are one of the exceptions where I see a valid argument for hypothecated excise taxes. Particularly around importation of plastic, and plastic packaged products, and high pollution industries. Any such tax should be strictly hypothecated, with all revenue raised being invested in preventing further environmental damage and repairing previously damages ecosystems. Progressive company tax Should the tax system do more to support small businesses? In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax? Any action to support small business is to be commended. There are also instances of provisional taxes hurting small business and the self-employed with varied incomes year to year. Though a progressive company tax may go someway to supporting small business, compliance is also problematic, and some small start-ups can get themselves into trouble where they are unaware of their complete tax liabilities. A flat rate transactional tax such as the one proposed in this submission removes all compliance costs on small businesses. Further, there is an element of progressivism in that the rates paid by larger businesses are proportionately higher given that more transactions tend to occur during typical business of a large company in comparison to a small company. \[1\] 15 GST exemptions for particular goods Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from GST? If so, what should be excluded? What else should be taxed to make up for the lost revenue? The calculations used in establishing the viability of the proposed system in this submission took into account revenue raised via GST. The system proposed would remove GST altogether while increasing total tax revenue. Summary As the world enters the next stage in financial technology, New Zealand has the opportunity to ride the waves of development and bring all of its people along for the ride. We can do away with costly administration, and compliance costs, freeing up the resources of hard working New Zealanders to produce more, relax more, or spend more time with loved-ones. We can be world leaders in embracing the change and investing in our people and our infrastructure. We can increase spending on education, transport, health, environmental issues, and research and development. We can do all of this while operating a relatively non-invasive tax system. All with an automated flat rate transactional tax that is administered by systems that we already operate. Please feel free to contact me if you require any further information or source material from which my calculations have been made. Josh Hubbard L.L.B \[1\]

Where information has been withheld, a numbered reference to the applicable section of the Official Information Act has been made, as listed above. For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 1 from Jenny Kirk, Submission to the Tax Working Group. The Tax Working Group has raised five main issues for New Zealanders to discuss : the future of tax, The purpose of tax, Are we taxing the right things, Can tax make housing more affordable, and What tax issues do we think are important. I will try to answer these queries, through the following comments. 1. We need a taxation system which enables everyone to share the cost of the country’s infrastructure (transportation, sewerage, water, public health and education systems, housing, protection of the environment and so on), and we need a tax system which is reasonable and fair to everyone. 2. We need to keep NZ's tax system as simple as possible. 3. As a member of the NZ Labour Party, I have always believed that NZ’s tax system should be progressive, and fair. “Progressive” in that the more you earn, the more you pay. And “fair” in that it is a reasonable system which everyone who pays tax feels comfortable with, and thinks it is relatively equitable. But over recent decades, it seems to me that our tax system has become inequitable, and is not fair, and that low income people who use all their funds on basic living costs, are paying a disproportionate amount of tax on the income they earn. And that to a large extent, this is because everyone is taxed – whether they’re on a benefit or NZ superannuation or are in some sort of paid employment – through GST, and also through the PAYE scheme. It is unfair in that some wealthy people have their income assets in trusts which allows them to avoid paying tax on a considerable portion of their income. It is unfair in that people who have a “portfolio” of jobs are taxed at a secondary (higher) rate on their 2 nd / 3 rd jobs when in fact their total income is probably only at an average level. It is unfair when the people on low incomes spend all their funds on goods and services which are taxed at 15% - on top of their basic income tax rate, and quite often on top of a secondary tax as well. And it is unfair when specific charitable organisations and churches do not pay tax on the earnings of their “business”. There are a number of other “unfair” aspects about our current taxation system – but these ones are fairly basic, and need remediation as soon as is possible. \[1\] 2 So it seems to me that the Tax Working Group needs to have a good look at what is fair and equitable, and how to counter the many loopholes that wealthy people manage to find, to avoid paying their share of our taxation system. 4. I would like to see a way to tax the trusts which wealthy people set up to avoid paying taxes on their assets and income. 5. I would like to see the removal of secondary tax from wage and salary earners. Removing secondary tax will allow those in 2 or 3 part-time jobs to pay the same amount of tax as if they were in one job only. This would be fair. 6. I query whether it is fair that CEOs and senior executives of large companies should be earning millions of dollars as salary, and paying only 33% of this in taxation – when those on the absolute minimum of benefits are paying at least 10% of their benefits in taxation. 7. I would like to see the removal of GST on specific goods. (a) GST is at 15% on all goods and services - which means everyone who buys something, or uses a service, is taxed on that activity - as well as their income tax. Those who are on low to lower-middle incomes spend most of their income on foods, goods and services – so they are probably paying relatively a higher rate of taxation, than do wealthy people who can also travel overseas to buy their goods and services. Is it fair that girls and women HAVE to buy sanitary products regularly which have a 15% gst tax on them, which is something boys and men do not have to do. i (b) I would like to see GST removed from female sanitary products, nappies for babies/toddlers, and the adult nappies which older people sometimes need to wear on a regular basis. These are all essential hygiene items for a specific class of people – often people at the lower end of income availability. (c ) I would also like to see GST removed from all raw fruits, grains, nuts, meats and vegetables - this could encourage healthier eating by some people, reduce obesity and the illnesses which result from obesity. I would not include milk or dairy products or fruit juices in having GST removed. These are mostly processed products, and are not entirely raw, or have additives of some sort added. I am aware, of course, that some fresh milk is sold as organic – but there still remains a degree of processing with this milk. Ditto processed meats such as sausages, salami, etc. Breads are also processed foods. NB – I am not saying fresh foods. I am saying raw foods. 8. Sugar tax? NZ apparently has a very high rate of sugar in a large number of products. Apparently higher than many other countries. How easy, or complicated, would it be to introduce an extra tax for high sugar content of individual products? I think we could do this. And it 3 could be an important step towards solving some of NZ’s obesity and diabetic health problems. And it would be an incentive to the companies producing the goods with high sugar content, to lower the sugar content. 9. As far as I am aware Churches and a number of charities do not currently pay tax on their business activities. They rely on their business activities (often with volunteer help) to provide their services. However, I think the actual business activity (whatever it is) should be paying a business tax on their net profits. People will argue that this will reduce some of their services. On the other hand it is known that some churches and so-called charities make enormous profits from their businesses, which do not necessarily go on charitable or community services for the good of all peoples. Examples which spring to mind are Destiny Church, GloriaVale, etc. 10. Fuel Tax. I agree with the need to have fuel tax to provide funds for the transportation infrastructure. NZ has been under-taxed in this area for a long time, and the transportation infrastructure needs major repair, upgrade, and our public transport system needs to be properly funded. I would also like to see the trucking industry paying its fair share for road repairs. Road user charges come nowhere near enough to pay for the amount of damage heavy trucks do continuously all the time on our roading system. 11. Property tax. Negative gearing can mean the property owner can offset "losses" in rental properties against their other earned income. Owning a rental property needs to be regarded as a "business" activity, and as such, needs to be kept as a separate entity from other earned income. This raises questions for me : Should we, the taxpayer and the government, assist the property owner if they make a loss on their rental business? Do other business owners who have suffered a loss have the same access to reduction in taxation on their personal earned income? Case study Penny, a property investor, buys a unit for $300,000, putting in $50,000 of her own money and borrowing the remaining $250,000. The interest of 7% each year is $17,500 and the weekly rent is $300 or $15,600 a year. Ongoing costs including rates, water, insurance, maintenance and depreciation allowance are $2600 each year. After expenses, income for the year will be $13,000 ($15,600 minus $2600), equivalent to a net rental yield of 4.3%. However, annual interest repayments are $17,500, so she has actually lost $4500 during the year ($17,500 minus $13,000 = $4500). The result is that Penny is eligible to receive a tax deduction of the loss accrued. But should we, the taxpayer, help Penny out to cover this loss? Why didn’t she factor in sufficient income from rent to cover her basic costs, including the interest on her mortgage? 4 12. Capital Gains Tax (a) I personally think that people who own property other than their family home or business, should be paying some extra tax if they sell that other property or business at a profit within five years of buying it. Having this profit taxed will help reduce the enormous amount of property speculation currently happening in NZ – which has resulted in rising house and land costs to such an extent that people who are on wages or fixed salaries are unable to afford to house themselves and their families. It might also reduce the asset-stripping which goes on when NZ business is sold. ie might help stop business speculation, and might encourage proper investment into NZ businesses. (b) There may be a need for some discretion in applying such a tax – for example, a family home purchased in one town, might need to be sold within a couple of years if the home owner gets a job in another town, or is made redundant and needs to downsize to a smaller home within that five year period. These types of exemptions could be built into the requirements of such a CGT. (c ) I don’t think you can put a CGT onto people’s personal collections of art, jewellery, etc. Some rich people donate their collections to their local communities, others leave them to future family members, and it could be a costly exercise trying to calculate what these assets are worth – possibly more costly than the actual tax achieved. 13. Water. Throughout the country, various regional councils have approved resource consent applications for the “take” of freshwater to be bottled and sold either overseas, or by overseas companies. Examples of this include the Poroti Springs Northland, Wiakoporupu Springs Takaka, Selwyn-Waimakiriri and Selwyn-Rakaia areas, the Bay of Plenty, etc. The sale of these waters competes with the actual needs of the local community which also uses these waters for their own personal and domestic use. And it could lead to the possibility of a “drought” being experienced by that local community, while the sale of bottled water continues to occur. It could also lead to the possibility of an overseas company such as Nestles taking over the entire water supply of a local community as has happened near Aberfoyle, Ontario, Canada in leaving the locals without an adequate water supply. I do think there needs to be some sort of taxation on the profit of the sale of these waters. It could be called a Royalty. And it needs to be substantial so it provides a disincentive to overseas interests who are seeking to sell NZ’s freshwater supplies for their own private profit. 5 14. Cost of infrastructure – transportation, sewerage, flood protection, domestic water supply. (a) There are different ways of paying for these things – some through rates on properties to local authorities, some via special taxes like a fuel tax, and some via charges like registration of cars and other road charges. Sewerage is a big item for smaller local authorities to get right (and even for large local authorities – eg Auckland City does not have it right, throughout the whole city – part of this is historical, part of this is sudden rapid population growth). (b) Because of the problems caused by this rapid population growth, and with changing climatic conditions causing more infrastructure problems, perhaps it is time the government set up an experts division which could provide advice, technical support to local authorities, and expertise in doing some of the work necessary to fix things. Maybe we could go back to having a Ministry of Works-type of govt department – but we could call it Ministry of Infrastructure, and the cost of doing this would come out of our basic taxation system. Thank you for the opportunity to put forward my ideas and comments on NZ’s taxation system.

It was suggested then that a 3% GST would help reduce the high cost of these products.

Dear Sirs Please accept this submission in abbreviated form. Time precludes a more eloquent form. For each question I list elements for consideration during policy formation. My special area of expertise and experience is personal financial planning with experience of long term savings infrastructures in UK and NZ with familiarity of the Aussie system. 1. Productivity - Medium and long term R&D fiscal settings for NZ organisations; - Reliable Govt spend as % of GDP on “long term science”; - Co-ordination of linkages with overseas R&D to assist collaboration; - Education; - Health; - Infrastructure. 2. Globalisation - Keep NZ relevant, connected; - Trade agreements with compatible countries based on ‘Values’ not population; 3. Changing Demographics - Start debate of population control; - Health spend and National Superannuation. Long term both cannot exist ‘as is’ – John Key was wrong. See attached Word Doc submission. Demonstrates how lessons may be learned from NZ’s past, UK and Aussie present to form a New Zealand Superannuation Infrastructure that: a) delivers integrity of financial security for future NZ retirees while even tually allowing for the eventual redirection of the bulk of the current cost of National Superannuation into the public health sector. This document lacks polish but I’m happy to contribute to the discussion further; 4. Te Maori & Future Role - Finality of settlement process essential; - Charitable/tax free status of Maori Trusts/corps to be phased out over time; 5. Inequality - Equality of opportunity (public education and public health essential contributiors) vital; - Capitalism and entrepreneurial drivers vital BUT regulations required to counter greed. Regulation to apply ratio of remuneration of top execs to that of average employee in Co (eg. Band of 10 to 15x with these a requirement of accounts; - Remove tax loopholes, specifically, multinationals to be taxed on NZ revenue with strict limits on offshore IP deductions, preferably in harmony with OECD-wide approach; - Superannuation outcomes for parents (predominantly women to date) or disabled – covered in attached submission; - NZ retailers that employ NZ citizens and residents to experience equal or better GST treatment than offshore Online retailers. 6. Changing Nature of Work - Employment is a vital source of self-esteem and social interaction – must flow through to policy settings; \[1\] 2 - Per above, NZ retailers to be favoured relative to offshore online retailers via GST. Employment opportunities in NZ vital; - NZ Agriculture and employment to be future orientated, Eg. Threat of factory meat and milk production a reality in short to medium term. Govt to lead research and collaboration with selected overseas countries (compatible values) to seize the opportunity to harness NZ’s ‘Clean green’ brand and identify alternative agri crops/products; 7. Environment - Exploration permits for fossil fuels a thing of the past; - Electric vehicle infrastructure to be rolled out quickly via public/private partnerships; - Fiscal settings to get NZ to 100% renewable energy production by 2030 – A Govt Plan. Inclusion of Tidal power in the mix; - NZ transport, local and national to become electric eg. Light rail, rail and EVs. Incentives and disincentives required; - Per 6 above, shift away from reliance on milk and meat towards crops reduces methane production; 8. Technology - International linkages for education and R&D to keep NZ at the cutting edge; - CO2 and Methane production to be reduced via policy settings (above) and adoption of technology. Summary: NZ needs to be a bastion of fair play with its treatment of tax that respects equality, opportunity and the inevitable negative outcomes from capitalism – greed. Eg. Multinationals exploiting IP loopholes and technology’s challenge to NZ jobs eg GST on overseas online retailers at higher rate. Thank you for the opportunity to share these thoughts.

New Zealand Superannuation – Public Provision – Decency, Dignity and Affordability This submission is made by a retired financial planning adviser who has worked in two jurisdictions, the UK and New Zealand, and is familiar with the Australian retirement planning framework. My CV is available upon request. The “Superannuation Regimes” in all three of the above jurisdictions have pros and cons. The outgoing National Government demonstrated little grasp of retirement planning. NZ First has always had a better understanding. This “summary submission” sets out a public retirement planning framework that is substantially pros, no cons and offers the newly minted New Zealand coalition the benefit of an experienced practitioner’s insight into what will work while providing future generations of kiwis dignity and financial security in retirement. I invite you to read on and then preferably, respond with an invitation to discuss the matter further. New Zealand’s National Superannuation: - Is adequate, must not be deferred beyond age 65 but must be rendered affordable to future generations of tax-payers. UK: - Tax-led savings into pension plans; - Pros of pensions: accumulated retirement fund cannot be squandered, provides income security for life; - Cons: accumulated fund is not inheritable; Australia: - Pros: Compulsory retirement saving and stable legislation. Accumulated fund inheritable. No cost of tax incentives; - Cons: No income security, accumulated fund may be squandered due to unlimited capital access/draw-down at retirement. New Zealand’s retirement provisioning should learn from these models and adopt the pros while avoiding the cons. Here’s a blend of “pros” I have not seen raised anywhere else: The Fundamentals: 1. Build on the KiwiSaver infrastructure framework by making contributions compulsory, increasing the percentage contribution over 10 years to 10% of earned income as a minimum; 2. Introduce a limit on the portion of capital that can be drawn down at retirement to 10% of total. The balance of the accumulated KiwiSaver kitty has to be retained in a registered, professionally managed fund, but is transferable between such funds; 3. Introduce a range of “percentage income options” and “risk-return investment options” that set the level of regular “income payments” for the retiring saver. The highest % level allowable must offer a high probability that the accumulated capital sum, after any capital draw down, is not totally exhausted before the likely age of death of the retiree. For example, with an accumulated fund of NZ$1 million, a maximum % income level of 5% net, the retirement ‘income’ is NZ$50,000 per annum, payable fortnightly in arears. Subject to professional investment management being mandated with a ‘moderate to high’ or ‘high’ risk-return investment strategy, then over the multi-decade retirement timeframe, this superannuitant’s KiwiSaver retirement kitty is highly likely to last intact or only modestly depleted; 4. With a higher level of ‘income’ level, the accumulated fund is likely to reduce over time but the level of depletion should be limited by the 2 variables in 5 below so as to ensure with a high probability, that the retiree’s retirement kitty lasts most of their expected lifespan; 5. The 2 variables are therefore (i) % rate of drawdown and (ii) level of risk/return investment strategy; 6. The accumulated fund is inheritable. Complimentary Refinements: 1. Provided that the legislation is stable, after 30 years of this retirement provisioning framework, a means test should be introduced for National Superannuation as the state’s retirement pension is known. By then, this would be fair. Before then, it would not be defendable. 2. The vital benefit of the long-term introduction of a means test for National Super is the substantial reduction in cost to the Government of this benefit that then facilitates increased funding of the public health system which by then, will be stretched due to the bay-boomers. 3. Debate and devise a way to top up the retirement contributions of those taking time out of the work force for parenting reasons so that women (predominantly) are not financially penalised for the vital role of parenting. This “evening up” might occur via the eventual means test but would be fairer and more secure if achieved at the “savings side” of the timeline. 4. Actuarial inputs should help define the range of: - Risk-return options; - % income options; - Combinations thereof; - Be reviewed on a 5-yearly basis. Long Term Benefits: These are: - National Superannuation entitlement age not deferred beyond 65; - Financial security throughout retirement; - Inheritable retirement fund balance aids those left behind, not pension providers (e.g. Insurance companies providing pensions per UK model); - Cost of National Super reduced without age of eligibility deferral. Thank you for reading this far. Jeremy Thompson BSc

The implication may be that a tax on carbon emissions (ETS or similar) is required to reduce the heating effect of CO2 in the atmosphere and hence ‘save the world’. Nothing could be further from the truth, or the scientific and political reality. University of London professor emeritus Philip Stott: “Climate change is governed by hundreds of factors, or variables, and the very idea that we can manage climate change TAX WORKING GROUP SUBMISSION K.M HEARLE predictably by understanding and manipulating at the margins one politically selected factor (CO2) is as misguided as it gets. It’s scientific nonsense.” The practical reality of New Zealand, through any tax policy, to support our share of the Paris Accord, if successful, would be to change the temperature of the earth by an unmeasurable 5/10,000 of a degree C, 100 years from now. This is how laughable such a tax would be. We can’t even distribute an energy subsidy through policy to people in need of it without giving it to those who don’t need it when we have all the information to be selective. How then do we propose to use tax to control the temperature of the earth when we don’t have control of any of the climate variables “It doesn't make a difference how beautiful your guess is. It doesn't make a difference how smart you are, who made the guess, or what his name is. If it disagrees with experiment, it's wrong.” Richard Feynman To understand this submission, it is necessary to delve into the history of both the science and the politics of so called Global Warming and the politics of the UNFCCC/IPCC. The graphic above is illustrative of some of the issues, it should be on every consultant, politician and bureaucrats desk as a reminder of reality vs politics and pseudoscience. The scientific hypothesis as stated by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(UNIPCC) is that increased levels of Anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide (CO2 that colourless, odourless gas, naturally occurring in the atmosphere that is essential for all life on earth) will cause Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming (CAGW). The operative word here is “Catastrophic”. Natural and Anthropogenic CO2 (the molecules of CO2 have no preference as to where they come from) has the potential to heat the atmosphere. CO2 is rising, currently 400+ppm in the atmosphere. The amount of heating is the issue. The hypothesis dates back to the UNIPCC foundation documents in the early 90’s. There is no dispute among scientists that CO2 in the atmosphere has the potential to increase the temperature of the atmosphere. Let’s see what the IPCC model warming looks like when it is plotted as a cumulative bar graph: Commented \[K1\]: The natural heating effect of carbon dioxide is the blue bars and the IPCC projected (modelled) anthropogenic effect is the red bars. Each 20 ppm increment above 280 ppm provides about 0.03° C of naturally occurring warming and 0.43° C of anthropogenic warming. That is a multiplier effect of over thirteen times. This is the leap of faith required to believe in IPCC global warming. The whole AGW belief system is based upon positive water vapour feedback starting from the pre-industrial level of 280 ppm and not before. To paraphrase George Orwell, anthropogenic carbon dioxide molecules are more equal than the naturally occurring ones. Much, much more equal -really! The signature of this heating effect of CO2 on the climate is a hot spot in the tropical upper- troposphere 7 to 13 km above the surface 20N to 20S in latitude. Scientist, after 30 years effort, have failed to detect any signature hot spot in the tropical upper troposphere. For further reading go here http://www.drroyspencer.com/2015/05/new-satellite-upper- troposphere-product-still-no-tropical-hotspot/ This lack of identification of the signature heating proposed in the IPCC hypothesis is the first of many concerns that the hypothesis fails to demonstrate fundamental scientific proof. CO2 is not the control knob of our climate; it might be a transient bit player. The IPCC ‘catastrophic’ hypothesis relies on the fundamental issue of positive water vapour feedback essentially cloud feedback, a multiplier effect that would increase any CO2 effect by a multiple of 2 or 3 times. After 30 years this effect has failed to materialize yet another cause for concern about the UNIPPC hypothesis. To be fair the cloud effect is hard to model and although we are getting a better understanding after 30 years, we still can’t model it to a level that is appropriate for inclusion in climate modelling, due to the uncertainties and scale, and spatial issues. Recent research indicates that the IPCC’s proposed positive water vapour feedback is, in fact, negative. Go here for a non technical discussion of the issue https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/09/11/feedback-on-feedbacks/ but note that this explanation is dated, as the science moves on, and it has. If the IPCC hypotheses are correct, new evidence should coalesces with nature and experimental results, thus adding proof to the IPCC hypothesis, the opposite is true. Over the years of its existence the UNIPCC have literally spent Billions of dollars on global climate modelling(GCM’s). It is fair to say that these efforts have failed to produce forecasts reliable enough to base policy on. The reasons are many and varied, to name but a few of the important ones- • The models have never been validated • Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity(ECS) to forcing by CO2 has been over estimated by a factor of approximately 3 • Parameterizations have been inadequate as estimates of variables that affect the climate. The graphic on the cover of this submission is repeated here in simplified form to emphasize the failure of IPCC models as a metric on which to base policy. As a result the IPCC Models (GCM’s) are not fit for policy formation. They do not model reality. A very readable explanation of the ECS issue is provided by Dr Judith Curry, she explains the situation here https://judithcurry.com/2015/12/17/climate-models-versus-climate-reality/ The current ETS (environment tax) is based on failed climate models. The science used to initiate the legislation in the 1990’s is now severely dated. It would not be unfair to say that the ETS legislation was more based on environmental socialist dogma than on an understanding of real climate science. It is also fair to say that climate science was immature and not well understood. Even the IPCC stated at the time - “ In climate research and modelling, we should recognize that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore that the long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible” Having said this the ETS was based on the IPCC ECS of 3.3 instead of the real value that is emerging in the science of a maximum of 1.2 that should be used in calculating the effect of doubling CO2 from 280ppm in 1850 to 560ppm in the future. This means that the effect of additional CO2 in the atmosphere will be benign and net beneficial to humanity. No tipping points, no catastrophes, just global greening (below) and slightly warmer temperatures in which humanity will thrive and prosper in the future, as humanity has experienced in slightly higher temperatures than now in the past. Matt Ridley in his 2016 lecture at the Royal Society London showed this slide from the research of Ranga Myneni of Boston University Ranga Myneni of Boston University. This translates to- • 31% of the global vegetated area greened. • Greening translates to a 14% increase in productivity • The greening is seen in all vegetative types. The source is worth reading https://www.thegwpf.org/matt-ridley-global-warming-versus-global-greening/ Without any help from taxes, politicians, green NGO’s or alarmist scientists CO2 did this for our benefit. So what is the value of the Social cost of Carbon (SCC) if the greening effect is included. A greening of the magnitude seen here is worth Trillions of dollars. A reason for environmental taxation might be that we are about to suffer a worsening climate due to increased CO2 and hence weather related disasters, requiring a pool of funding such as our EQC to fund the resulting damage. Nothing could be further from the truth. The STATEMENT OF DR. ROGER PIELKE, JR. to the COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE, SPACE, AND TECHNOLOGY of the UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HEARING on Climate Science: Assumptions, Policy Implications, and the Scientific Method is pertinent in this regard, scroll down to appendix B for an analysis of what the reality is regarding the weather- related disasters. https://science.house.gov/sites/republicans.science.house.gov/files/documents/HHRG-115-SY- WState-RPielke-20170329.pdf What this shows, is that the disaster rhetoric is not matched by reality. No need to tax the poor and middle class on climate/weather environment grounds. What good news. The Politics The Left and Green agenda aligned with the UN wish to centrally control the economies of the developed world through taxing CO2 emission; thus taking away our sovereignty and redistributing the wealth we created and putting it in the hands of underdeveloped country dictatorships through the Green Climate Fund. This is an outrage. It is economic war perpetrated on the UN’s own membership and on the very member nations that fund its existence. This strategy by the UN must be resisted as a priority for the new Government before it destroys any hope of dealing with the real problems of our nation such as poverty, housing, infrastructure, health and education. Wasting funding on the now obvious non-problem of climate change would be a travesty. The graphic on the front page of this submission is revealing on the political front. As the modeled temperature (spaghetti of coloured lines and modeled average, bold black line) departs further and further from the real temperature (nature the experiment) the IPCC becomes more confident that the models are correct (see text in red boxes), How perverse is that? It borders on fraud, it is propaganda, to achieve a stated political end. It is corruption on a grand scale. There can be no excuse for such a stand by the UN . From its inception the IPCC slanted its consideration of the CO2 question to the anthropogenic component that supported its agenda. The elephant in the room when you consider climate is of course the Sun. The IPCC dismissed the Sun as an unimportant variable, in terms of Total Solar Irradiance(TSI) that is a reasonable stand, but TSI is not the only solar variable that affects our climate. Galactic Cosmic Rays(GCR) also affect cloud nucleation that has a marked effect on climate much larger than CO2. The Svensmark theory is an important addition to the science of climate (not available in the 90’s) when our ETS was formulated. Effectively a weak sun magnetically, a lack of solar wind, allows more GCR to enter the atmosphere that causes more clouds to form thus reducing the temperature of the earth. The opposite is also true when the solar magnetic field is strong the earth warms as there are less clouds to reflect incoming solar radiation. Why this is important is that it gives a rationale for the heating during the 80’s and 90’s therefore providing an alternative to the IPCC CO2 theory of CAGW. Nikolov and Zeller 2017 proposed a new theory for working out the temperature of rocky planets such as ours, proposing a new physical law for working out the surface temperature of planets using NASA data that is independent of the gas composition of a planet, dependent only on the pressure, again a refutation of the IPCC CO2 theory. The IPCC alarmist community suppressed these papers due to the negative effect they would have on the UNFCCC agenda. If you follow the development of this political gambit from the beginning it is no wonder that Trump pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord, we as a nation should do likewise. Whatever we may think about Americas choice of President his decision to deactivate the climate establishment is founded in good science. A good short readable history of the UNFCC / IPCC is to be found here https://wattsupwiththat.com/2014/04/09/climate-alarmism-of-course-the-ipcc-was-designed-to- create-and-promote-it/ As I wrote this submission watching the ‘Global Warming’ snow fall on the hills around Wanaka in March, Viscount Monckton of Brenchley et al was delivering an amicus brief to a Judge IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA The Judge had asked for a tutorial on a number of question put to the plaintiff and defendant. What follows is the non-scientific component of the press release of the scientific paper supporting the amicus brief for your information. The paper is with a journal yet to go through peer review. “ New scientific paper proves global warming fears unfounded After correcting a large error of physics, global warming will be just 1.2 C°, not 3.3 C° Global warming will be small, slow, harmless and beneficial. A new scientific paper, On an error in applying feedback theory to climate, published after 12 years’ research by an international team, reveals a grave, long-standing and strikingly elementary error of physics inbuilt in current climate models. The paper provides definitive scientific proof that fears of rapid, catastrophic global warming arose solely from that error. Such fears are now proven unfounded. Global-warming mitigation was and is entirely unnecessary. Instead of the 3.3 C° man made warming per CO2 doubling predicted by IPCC in 1990 and 2007 and by the fifth generation (CMIP5) computer models in 2013, we will cause a small, slow, harmless and beneficial ૚.૛ ۱° warming. This new result, obtained by a theoretical method, was confirmed by several empirical methods whose results agreed with it. Further confirmation came in experimental tests first by the researchers and then at a government laboratory. The news will come as a relief to those who had feared that our impact on the climate would be dangerous and even catastrophic. Governments worldwide have already spent trillions trying to solve what turns out to be a non-problem. For four decades since 1979, when Dr Jule Charney wrote a report for the U.S. National Research Council predicting that for every doubling of CO2 concentration there would be 1.5 to 4.5 C° global warming with a best estimate of 3 C°, the error of physics exposed by the new paper, unwittingly incorporated five generations of general-circulation computer models of the climate, had misled scientists into exaggerating all their predictions of global warming. The error of physics arose when climate scientists borrowed feedback methods and mathematics from control theory, originally developed to calculate feedbacks in analog telephone circuits, and then misapplied them. Inconsistently, they had imagined that without any greenhouse gases the Earth’s emission temperature of 255 K ( −18 C°) would induce no knock -on feedback response at all, while the 8 C° warming from the naturally-occurring greenhouse gases would induce a very large feedback response of 24 C°. For they had mistakenly added the 23.4 C° feedback response induced by the 255 K emission temperature to the tiny 0.7 C° feedback response to the natural greenhouse gases. Scientists had thus erroneously imagined the pre-industrial feedback fraction was 24 / (8 + 24) = 0.75, when in reality it is only 0.7/(8 + 0.7) = 0.08. Similarly, the industrial-era feedback fraction, based on IPCC’s official estimate of 2.29 W m–2 net manmade forcing to 2011, implying manmade warming of 0.72 C° before accounting for feedback and the HadCRUT4 measured warming of 0.76 C° from 1850-2011, is 1 − 0.72/0.76 = 0.05, not 0.75. AŌer correction, feedbacks (though mentioned 1000 times in IPCC’s 2013 Fifth Assessment Report) will not add more than about a tenth of a degree to the 1.1 C° global warming directly caused by doubling CO2 concentration. Lord Monckton, the author of many peer-reviewed papers on climate sensitivity and mitigation economics and lead author of the new paper, said: “Climate science had illogically assumed that the Earth’s 255 K emission temperature would induce no feedbacks at all, but that the far smaller direct warming of about 8 K driven by the natural greenhouse gases would suddenly induce a very large feedback response, as if by magic. We don’t believe in magic.” “What this means,” said Dr Willie Soon, a co-author of the new paper, “is that official climatology has long been at odds with mainstream science. Lord Stern’s 2006 government review of climate economics estimated a 1 in 10 chance that global warming would end the world by 2100. We have now proven that global warming is not a threat to our planet. The unjustifiable cost of mitigating it harms poor people, who need affordable electricity from coal, which is cheaper than other methods of generation and provides clean, reliable, continuous, lowish-tech, base-load power. Fixing this serious error of physics means international action to mitigate global warming is simply unnecessary.” Co-authors were Dr Soon, an award-winning solar physicist from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics; Dr David Legates, Professor of Climatology at the University of Delaware; Dr William Briggs, a statistician from Cornell University; Dipl-Ing. Michael Limburg, an electronics engineer from the European Institute for Climate and Energy; Dr Dietrich Jeschke, professor of control theory at the Flensburg University of Applied Sciences; Mr Alex Henney, an expert on the U.K. electricity supply industry; Mr John Whitfield, an electronics engineer, who built a test circuit to verify the team’s results; and Mr James Morrison, a university undergraduate in environmental sciences. Funding was not required for this research because all authors generously gave their time for science without charge. ” The amicus brief and full summary is an attachment to this paper This scientific paper completely destroys the UNIPCC ‘Catastrophe’ rhetoric to support its political agenda. Another amicus brief from Lindzen, Happer and Koonin addressing directly the questions put by the Judge is also attached for your information. After hearing the tutorial and considering the amicus briefs the Judge through the case out of court. Where has the real science been going since the 90’s advent of UN perpetrated CAGW hypothesis? In the opposite direction to the IPCC hypothesis of CO2 induced CAGW. The rhetoric has been maintained by fanatic attempts to put more scarier stories of disasters coming down the track, they have not (as Pielke demonstrated) and will not occur for sound scientific reasons. Nature will drive climate not CO2, it is a bit player in the game not the control knob. Summary 1 The need for an environmental tax to combat CO2 induced global warming is unnecessary. 2 The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is at worst 1.2C for a doubling of CO2 to 560ppm in the atmosphere not 3.3 as stated by the IPCC and used in their Climate Models. 3 Global Warming will be small, slow, harmless and beneficial to humanity. 4 The UNIPCC and the NZ Govt basis for the ETS tax is without scientific merit therefore the entire legislation should be rescinded and the bureaucratic establishment that has grown as a consequence of the ETS be disestablished. The funding saved redirected to solving real environmental problems in NZ eg river and lake pollution , farm run-off etc 5 The IPCC ‘Catastrophe’ agenda of climate disasters has no basis in the data. 6 There is no basis for a tax of any sort for environmental damage as a result of increasing CO2. 7 The Government should withdraw all funding for the UNFCCC, UNIPCC and withdraw from membership from both organizations. 8 The Government should withdraw New Zealand from participation in the Paris Climate Accord. Footnote- Not discussed in this paper but of relevance is the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) the inevitable outcome of an ECS of 1.2C and or the positive effect of a greening earth via increased CO2 is that the SCC will surely be negative, hence we should be subsidizing the use of fossil fuels, how ironic is that.

I would like to comment on several of the sources of taxation by separate headings. Goods and Services Tax New Zealand’s GST is one of the simplest and most comprehensive in the world. There are two main exemptions – for financial services, and for low value imported goods. These exemptions reflect past judgements that it would be too administratively complex to include financial services and low-value imported goods in the tax. I am opposed to any further exemptions as it is a very simple tax to collect and reflects costs on the consumer without any exemptions. It is far better to target welfare directly to those who demonstrate the need. Circumstances change and so can the targeted welfare. If there are GST exemptions then those who do not need welfare benefit when it is not required. Our simple GST system requiring very little bureaucracy, administration, and compliance monitoring, must be the envy of many other countries. Land Tax I oppose the introduction of a land tax as it is unfair. It taxes one component of wealth. The impact on land values would be borne only by those who are unfortunate enough to hold wealth in one particular form. Retirees, farmers would be particularly affected. Tax bases that use broader measures of wealth, income or consumption better meet social conceptions of horizontal equity. A land tax would also be expected to cause an immediate fall in the value of land by the net present value of the future land tax liabilities (and so constitutes a lump-sum tax on those who own land at the date of its introduction). An calculation suggests that the introduction of a 1% land tax should result in a 16.7% fall in land values. But greater falls are likely if there is some ongoing real increase in land rents. The expected fall in land values is very sensitive to the rate of tax introduced and to assumptions made in modelling. In particular, it will tend to be larger the greater is the expected real rate of growth in land rents. A deductible land tax of 1% in conjunction with a 1% annual growth in rents, a 30% marginal tax rate for investors but other assumptions modelled by Inland Revenue, produces a 26.4% drop in land values. Such falls in land values would have significant effect on existing land owners and others, such as investors and lenders. It might mean that people who currently have heavily geared land end up with negative net equity. This could in turn impact on the balance sheets of mortgage lenders, particularly banks. \[1\] 2 It would cause cash flow issues In its simplest form, land tax would be payable on an annual basis. However, land tax does not relate to a flow of income (e.g. income tax) or a transaction (GST). Consequently, payment of land tax may give rise to cash flow issues for some landowners, particularly those who have significant land holdings but lower income levels, such as retired people. Progressive company tax I am opposed to the introduction of a progressive company tax. Progressive tax systems make you pay more as you earn more, and such systems punish success, which leads to undesirable consequences. For instance progressive taxes can create a disincentive to grow the business and look to relocate to more tax friendly environments. It also reduces the investment in productivity initiatives. Punishing success also has the potential to hurt innovation, since people are less likely to take risks on new ideas if the government takes larger amounts of new profits. Growing companies are vital to the economy because they create the businesses and make the investments necessary to create jobs. Taxing companies at high rates leaves them with less cash left over to put into their businesses and other investments, so they create fewer jobs. Fewer jobs means there are fewer workers earning income that the government can collect taxes from, which ultimately reduces tax revenue. A common argument is that reducing taxes will increase hiring and economic growth, creating more income that the government can tax, which makes up for the revenue lost by lowering tax rates in the first place. Capital gains tax I am opposed to the introduction of a capital gains tax. Capital gains taxes reduce the return that entrepreneurs and investors receive from the sale of a business. This diminishes the reward for entrepreneurial risk-taking and reduces the number of entrepreneurs and the investors that support them. The result is lower levels of economic growth and job creation. Capital gains are taxed on a realization basis. This means that the tax is only imposed when an investor opts to withdraw his or her investment from the market and realize the capital gain. One of the most significant economic effects is the incentive this creates for owners of capital to retain their current investments even if more profitable and productive opportunities are available. Economists refer to this result as the "lock-in" effect. Capital that is locked into suboptimal investments and not reallocated to more profitable opportunities hinders economic output. Loss ring-fencing I support the removal of the ability to offset investment losses against other income earnings tax. If a loss ring-fencing policy was introduced , a property investor will no longer be able to use tax losses on rental properties to offset their tax on other income. This is in my opinion one of the contributing reasons for the rapid increase in house prices over the past few years. Multinational companies operating in New Zealand I support the New Zealand authorities implementing a suite of measures – developed in cooperation with other OECD countries – that will further strengthen the rules for taxing income from investment and commercial activities in New Zealand. I agree that Multinational Corporations should be paying the appropriate level of tax for any commercial activity. I would 3 support legislation to satisfy commercial competitors and the public concerns about the tax practices of some multinational corporations, which exploit inconsistencies and mismatches in domestic tax rules in order pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. The digital economy The companies who derive income and profits in New Zealand from the digital economy need to pay tax on the same basis as other New Zealand based companies. Internet-based firms can trade with customers over the internet without having a physical presence here in New Zealand and can get away with paying no income tax under present rules. This issue is will become increasingly important as the digital economy accounts for a greater proportion of business activity Maori and the tax system. You ask How could tikanga Māori (in particular manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, and kaitiakitanga) help create a more future-focussed tax system? Quite simply by treating them the same as all other tax paying citizens. This is a great Segway into my next submission point. Charitable trusts tax exemptions on commercial activities I am opposed to the current legislation that allows charities to set up structures to achieve a lower rate of tax (or in some cases an effectively no tax) exemption for income and profits derived from commercial operations, compared to other companies carrying out similar businesses. It does not meet the test of equity and fairness: The current legislation allowing these exemptions: • Allows a competitive advantage to the entity in that less tax or no tax is paid. • Provides significant cash flow advantages to the entity, so allowing a reduced cost of funding. • Means the entity is effectively subsidised by all other tax payers, as it is able to make use of the infrastructure and other assets and benefits provided by those paying full tax. • Allows the entity the opportunity to grow its business base, knowing the lower taxes and cost of capital can be factored in to any new business start-up or acquisition purchase price. • Means the entity does not have to use the funds from its commercial activity and lower taxation advantage to provide charitable services for everyone in the community. • Results in the Government having reduced taxation income and the foregone opportunity to provide services and assets for the wider community. “\[I\]f a business was being taxed at a lower rate on profits that it had retained, \[or not at all\], it had a competitive advantage in being able to invest more money in the future. It paid a lower tax on profits, had more money to invest, and therefore was at a competitive advantage.” • - Dr the Hon Lockwood Smith • Hansard 27 February 2003 • 606:3891 A discussion on charitable organisations undertaking commercial activity would not be complete without mentioning Maori/iwi based commercial organisations. They have organised themselves under the Charities Act 2005 1 and its recognition of blood relationships, making it unique in the 1 Charities Act 2005, (20 April 2005) No. 39. 4 world of charity law. Section 5 (2) Meaning of charitable purposes states that the public benefit requirement will apply in the situation where “the beneficiaries of the trust, or members of the society or institution, are related by blood.” Such a provision rectified the consequences arising from Arawa Maori Trust Board v CIR 2 in 1961 in which Donne SM had ruled that “\[t\]he trust failed the public benefit test because it was for the benefit of a group of people determined by their bloodline or whakapapa,” 3 and the narrow concept of public benefit applied in Oppenheim v Tobacco Securities Trust Co Ltd 4 “that the beneficiaries of a charitable trust must not be linked by blood in order to satisfy the public benefit requirement.” 5 All charitable entities whether they be religious or iwi based, should be taxed equitably with all other commercial enterprises, and I am asking the Tax Working Group to recommend the removal of the competitive advantage they currently enjoy. During the debates in Parliament in 2003 prior the Charities act legislation in 2005, members of the opposition were against such a proposal for Maori Authorities as is evident in the comments by Dr the Hon Lockwood Smith that: 6 “.............this will be very divisive. It is not good for New Zealand’s future. It will result in disharmony. It does confirm privilege under our tax laws, purely on the basis of race. We reject that, and I think most sensible, right-thinking New Zealanders will reject that. The Government should go back to the drawing board and remedy the problem around the taxation of Maori authorities with new legislation that does not confer privilege on the basis of race. It is morally wrong to do that.” And the Hon David Carter was also concerned: 7 “..........about the special rate that has been created for Maori organisations. It does mean that there is a competitive advantage. People in business will now have the ability, if they are a Maori authority, to pay tax at a lower rate than a business operating right next door that is carrying out exactly the same business activity.” Thank you for the opportunity to submit on the taxation issues.

Yours faithfully R M (Murray) Gough OBE \[1\] \[1\] SUBMISSION TO THE TAX WORKING GROUP from Murray Gough 10 April 2018 Introduction The fundamental aim of this submission is to highlight the practical difficulties of designing and implementing a Capital Gains Tax that could be accepted as fair by most New Zealanders. As the Working Group has identified, New Zealand enjoys a tax system that is broad-based and widely supported - as well as being coherent and efficient. It is, in fact, remarkable how few issues of real concern are identified in the Background Paper. Maintaining the existing level of acceptance is important. Any changes to the current tax system should be for clear reasons, and implemented in a manner that has wide public endorsement. This submission considers what such reasons might be, and comments on options for addressing them. Reasons for Change The Background Paper, explicitly or implicitly, indicates the following main reasons for significant change – 1. Additional tax revenue may be needed 2. Fairness requires a Capital Gains Tax 3. Wealth inequality is too great, and can be reduced by a suitable tax. Comments 1. Additional tax revenue may be needed – The broad numbers (Table 1, Page 10) suggest that over coming decades New Zealand will need to either reduce Government Expenditure as a proportion of GDP, or increase taxes. The changes required are not particularly substantial and do not appear to be urgent. Both alternatives can be reasonably easily accommodated – a) Reduce Government Expenditure - obviously there are many ways to reduce expenditure, but the least disruptive way to make a significant difference is a progressive extension of the qualifying age for National Superannuation. Life expectancy is increasing by 3 months or so every year, and rather than an increased period of old age and ill health this is resulting in an extended healthy life. There is accordingly an increasing ability (and indeed, for many people, desire) to work longer. Pushing out the qualifying age for National Superannuation will almost certainly become increasingly acceptable. b) Increase Taxes – if future governments find it impossible to curtail expenditure, the best way to increase revenue will be to increase expenditure-linked taxes, particularly GST. GST is widely regarded by New Zealanders as unobjectionable, and the VAT table (Figure 9, Page 30) shows that our rate is well below that of most other developed countries. The main concern with GST is regressivity, but that can be largely addressed by transfer payments. Expenditure-linked taxes also have the desirable outcome of causing tourists to contribute to tax revenue. Any proposal to introduce new taxes, or increase income tax rates, should have merits that are clearly greater than these relatively straightforward alternatives. 2. Fairness requires a Capital Gains Tax – The Background Paper makes the point that “What is fair to one person might not seem fair to another”. It may accordingly be seen to be just as fair to tax Capital Gains as to tax income and expenditure. To gain widespread acceptance, however, a Capital Gains Tax (CGT) would need to be seen as unquestionably fair. The experiences of other countries, and previous reviews of our own tax system, highlight just how difficult – if not impossible - that is to achieve. To be fair, a Capital Gains Tax would have to include the following provisions - 1) inflation would need to be allowed for when measuring gains and losses – otherwise CGT would be applied to partially fictitious value movements; 2) a carry-forward CGT credit would be needed for losses (asset values go down as well as up, and it would be unfair to apply CGT only to gains); 3) CGT would need to apply to all sales and transfers of assets - including gifts to family members and trusts, and assets transferred or sold from a deceased estate; 4) both realised and unrealised gains would need to be taxed because – a. it would be unfair that a taxpayer was subject to CGT because he had to (or decided to) sell, while his neighbour avoided CGT by continuing to hold; b. taxing only realised gains would result in substantial economic inefficiency by discouraging sales that would otherwise be made – such as a farmer selling to move to a larger property, or a particular share being replaced with a better investment in an investment portfolio; allowing a non-taxable rollover for reinvestment in similar assets may appear a simple solution, but would greatly reduce the CGT tax base (and unless gifts and transfer on death were treated as sales - or Gift and Estate Duties reintroduced - rollover would result in increasingly valuable portfolios being passed on with no CGT being paid); however, taxing unrealised gains raises complex and difficult issues, such as how to value assets without a public market (shares in unlisted companies, small businesses, professional and other partnerships) and how to manage the cash impact on taxpayers with substantial assets but restricted cashflow. A fair Capital Gains Tax system would also need to have found satisfactory solutions to the following issues - 1) while a New Zealand-domiciled investment fund would (presumably) be subject to CGT when any of the fund’s investments were sold, overseas-domiciled funds in non-CGT jurisdictions would not (including ones investing in New Zealand shares and property); owning units or shares in such overseas funds would need to be prohibited as taxpayers would otherwise simply move their investments into them (avoiding CGT, and reducing New Zealand’s CGT tax base); 2) funds that support final-salary-related pensions would be underfunded if CGT applied to sales of their investments, yet it would be inequitable for such funds not to be subject to CGT while defined-contribution plans (and private investment accumulations) were; it would also be inequitable if superannuitants whose payments were not drawn from an identified fund retained existing benefits while the funds supporting others became subject to CGT; 3) there would be a strong temptation to fail to report the existence of (and gains on) offshore assets, particularly non-income-producing assets; 4) significant valuation difficulties would arise (for gifts and estate transfers) for assets without a public market such as small businesses, professional and other partnerships, and shares in unlisted companies; 5) severe cash flow difficulties would arise for taxpayers selling one investment to reinvest in another (unless a rollover is permitted for reinvestment of funds into a replacement asset). In summary, designing a fair Capital Gains Tax is a hugely daunting task. And if family homes are largely or wholly exempt, offset is allowed for capital losses, allowance is made for inflation, and reinvestment rollover is permitted, net tax raised is unlikely to be substantial. 3. Wealth inequality is too great, and can be reduced by a suitable tax – There is only limited data on wealth inequality in the Background Paper and it is difficult to know to what degree this is a problem – and importantly, how rapidly wealth inequality has been/still is growing. If the political judgement is that wealth inequality needs to be addressed, it is unlikely (given the concerns set out above) that a Capital Gains Tax will have much effect. While a Wealth Tax may be considered, the experiences of countries that have experimented with this are not encouraging. The valuation and cash flow issues with a Capital Gains Tax, as well as many of the other difficulties, also apply to a Wealth Tax. If it is considered that wealth inequality needs to be addressed, the simplest and most effective way to do so is likely to be reintroduction of Estate and Gift Duties. Response to Appendix 2 Questions on CGT Design Issues • Should CGT be a separate tax? Yes. Otherwise the huge swings that can occur in asset values (such as the 1987 and 2008 share market falls) would result in a substantial drop in income tax receipts as CGT losses offset taxable income. • Accrual or realised basis? Accrual – for the reasons outlined in the submission above. • Matrimonial settlements and disposal of assets on death? There is no obvious reason why these should be treated any differently from when an asset is sold. The question does not arise if the accrual option is used. • What assets should be covered? Assets of an enduring investment nature should be covered; for administrative simplicity defined assets that have a limited life and declining value (such as ordinary cars and household goods) should be excluded. • Should assets held by Kiwisaver and other savings schemes be taxed? Yes. To do otherwise will distort investment decisions. • Should assets held offshore be subject to tax? Yes. Excluding such assets will distort investment decisions (please also note the comments in the submission above). • How would CGT integrate with current tax laws? CGT paid by a company should be able to be passed down to its shareholders as a CGT imputation credit, able to be used by each shareholder to offset any CGT the shareholder becomes liable for. Otherwise a capital gain is likely to be taxed twice. • When should non-residents be subject to tax? All property owned by non-residents but physically located in New Zealand should be subject to CGT. To do otherwise would give residents in non-CGT jurisdictions a greater financial return than that available to local residents – with obvious implications for foreign ownership of houses and farms. • Should capital losses be ring fenced? Yes (per comments against the first question above). • Should there be a rollover relief? Yes. This isn’t an issue if CGT is applied on an accrual basis – which, for the reasons in the submission above, is the fairest basis for such a tax. • How should death, emigration, and immigration be handled? There is no reason why death should be treated any differently from when an asset is sold. Emigration and immigration are essentially questions of when a person becomes (or ceases to be) a New Zealand resident – assets should be valued as at the relevant dates, with CGT payable for emigrants based on asset values at the date the person ceases to be a resident. The question does not arise if the accrual option is used. • How should gifts and gambling winnings be taxed? Gifts and gambling winnings (and prizes) should be treated as having been purchased by the recipient at market value, and disposed of by the giver at the same value. • Rate of CGT? There is no strong pointer to any particular rate. • Should there be an allowance for inflation? Yes. Gains and losses can only be measured fairly after making an allowance for inflation. • Should there be a de minimis rule? Yes. • What administrative implications? Some of the more difficult implications are how to ensure all gains are properly reported (particularly overseas assets); and how to value assets without a public market (shares in unlisted companies, small businesses, professional and other partnerships). • Transition rules? Opening values for assets should be their value at the date of formal commitment to CGT introduction. It would be extremely unfair to retrospectively tax past gains - taxpayers may well have made different acquisition or sale decisions if they had known that CGT would be payable. It would also be unfair if existing assets were never subject to CGT. The accrual approach makes this issue irrelevant – assets would simply be valued at a CGT commencement date with CGT applicable to annually updated values from then on. • Family trusts? Assets held in family trusts should be subject to CGT on exactly the same basis as assets owned by individuals and companies. Gifts to (and from) a trust should be valued at market value at the date of gift.

Tax Working Group submission Dear Dr Cullen I’d like to speak specifically to “Defining Fairness” Preamble Firstly, I believe we now accept that Government has obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi. And - It is well-demonstrated that Maori life & financial outcomes are much worse than those for Pakeha/other. Therefore, I submit that we must consider the impacts on “fairness” of any proposed new tax structures - specifically as they apply to New Zealanders “at the bottom of the heap” – since most of those are Maori. I wish to make a submission, therefore, on the philosophical underpinnings to our tax structure in areas where tax tools can improve outcomes for the poor; but also where they can make changes where the rich and privileged are being either over-paid, under-taxed, or often both – and where, in consequence, the tax take is unfairly reduced. In considering issues such as these, I further submit the Tax Working Group must cast its net widely. I submit that the Group must consider areas such as (to give just one example) - Health outcomes – where current financial structures work to limit the access of poorer working families to warm, dry, safe, secure housing; and to timely, affordable & compassionately-delivered medical care. And in which area it is (fiscally) well-demonstrated and accepted that – to employ a couple of familiar clichés - “prevention is better than cure” and the “fence at the top of the cliff is cheaper and more effective than the ambulance at the bottom”. Thus, I submit that the Tax Working Group ask itself: “Are there changes we can make to improve life for our fellow Kiwis ‘at the bottom of the heap?’” “Do not the Treaty, common humanity, & the principle of equity oblige us to consider such changes?” “And, when considering future taxes, should we be constrained by narrow-focussed models of the past?” Background to my thoughts: I submit that two incremental changes have, over time, diluted the “fairness” of our tax system Firstly: One could argue, Dr Cullen, that our Welfare State has its origins in the Waitaki/Nordmeyer era. You will recall the operating principle was very simple: a modest tax from all who earned, accumulated in a fund, and available to those in need. There was, then, no sense of “entitlement” such as has crept in as the generations have passed An example: the superannuation “pension”, now paid to anyone 65-plus, & largely regardless of circumstance. This is a very different animal to the rigorously means-tested Old Age Pension of 120 years ago. Re entitlement: I believe a feeling of entitlement has crept into benefits, subsidies and tax-breaks. The late (and lamented only by landlords) LAQC might be an example. This mindset has become enshrined over time; and tackling it is now a recognised “election-loser”. I submit that this works to progressively dilute “fairness” - a core value of our society. On its own this is potentially manageable. But, secondly: The political influence of the rich has been allowed to grow - incrementally and almost invisibly. Thus, now, the tools which allow those rich to accumulate further wealth, demonstrably at the expense of the poor, are embedded in society. Just one example – housing & rent: For many years now a worker on the average wage cannot provide for their family without government assistance – unless perhaps they live in the provinces and are unusually resourceful. (This is fundamentally wrong in itself, but is probably a topic for another day) One result of this is the ubiquitous accommodation allowance/supplement – in its various forms. The availability of this - effectively a government supplement paid directly to landlords – contributes to spiralling rents; especially in the cities. A larger consequence is the affect that constantly- rising rental incomes have on house prices and housing affordability – that well-recognised spiral. Governments address this at their political peril. As is widely commented-upon, one of the worst aspects of our three-year version of Westminster Democracy is that it is almost impossible for government to tackle large issues like these without cross-party support. Hence the (independent) Tax Working Group. I submit that many things have combined to make New Zealand no longer the “fair” society we once valued. But I believe we can lump these into two broad categories; and I submit that these are issues the Working Group is conscience-bound to consider: (one) The financial burden of creeping entitlement - especially in the superannuation area. A looming disaster for a country with an aging population. And (two) the inability of government to make the structural changes that are needed - Needed, firstly, in the balance between income and the affordability of family essentials such as good quality housing and affordable, available health care And needed, secondly, in addressing the “capture” of political parties by the rich and influential That is background, then Now that we have established “background”, my thoughts around Fairness, are simple: ONE Benefits – and this includes “super” – are about need, but are not about entitlement. No millionaire or “rich” person should ever receive any benefit. TWO The idea that “I have worked and paid taxes all my life, so I am entitled to a pension/benefit” or to “get my taxes back” is just fundamentally wrong. Tax (personal or business) is one cost of a fair and decent society, in which all New Zealanders can live and enjoy the opportunity to do basic things: raise a family & benefit from the fruits of their endeavours. THREE Although there are many issues around benefits for sole or low incomes parents, dealing with these should not punish a child, or result in it being deprived of basic rights (food, shelter, health care, love, education) because of the actions of parents. FOUR It should be recognised that the process of the accumulation of wealth has increasingly become one which benefits the few at the expense of the many. I submit that the question “What is good for our society?” should be asked alongside “What is good for promoting a sustainable business or trading environment?” when tax structures are being designed. Five Within sane and fair limits, the idea that residential property over and above the family home, or farm property, or business property, or real- estate or assets held in trusts, is sacrosanct and cannot be considered an asset subject to tax, or subject to being broken up or sold off - rather than remaining available to be handed on, complete, to the inheriting generation - should be considered. If a recipient of “National Super” or other benefit has no liquid assets but holds, say, some $$ millions of farm or real estate; or, perhaps, pays “rent” to a family trust or the like; and may even be receiving some form of accommodation allowance, then I submit that is a “lifestyle choice” at the expense of other taxpayers. Such persons should not receive a benefit. In conclusion A courageous government – represented by the Tax Working Group - should be asking itself a common- sense “Is this fair?” question whenever it considers: Trust legislation and taxation Capital gains tax Taxation of the fruits of “land banking” Universal entitlement The “real” level of income of working families The actual purchasing power of that income, and the measures we use in calculating that The influence which the rich and established financial interests have on tax legislation Other financial aspects of New Zealand life which do not pass a “fairness” test and the equitability of which could be improved by changes to tax structure Then: If it is not “fair”, and does not promote future equity, then government (which may need to be reminded it is still in loco parentis) must act. Those are my thoughts Thanks for the opportunity to make a submission I am happy to be contacted or to enter into a dialogue Mike Nash (Michael John Nash, \[1\] \[1\]

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 1 To the Tax Working Group (submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz). Please find below a copy of the scholarly blog we recently published at a University of Otago blogsite: https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/pubhealthexpert/2018/04/16/a-public-health-perspective- on-taxing-harmful-products/ It details our arguments around the value of taxing products that are harmful to health. In particular we recommend that the Tax Working Group consider recommending that the NZ Government increase taxes on products that harm health (specifically: carbon, tobacco, alcohol and soft drinks via a “soft drink industry levy”). We also note that it is fine for the Tax Working Group and the Secretariat to contact us to discuss any of the points raised (Prof Nick Wilson:, University of Otago, Wellington). A public health perspective on taxing harmful products Prof Nick Wilson, Prof Tony Blakely, Dr Amanda Jones, Dr Linda Cobiac, Dr Nhung Nghiem, Dr Anja Mizdrak, Dr Cristina Cleghorn The New Zealand Government has set up a Tax Working Group to consider reforms of the tax system. In this blog we briefly discuss some of the opportunities for tax reform that will potentially improve health and lower health costs, reduce health inequalities and enhance environmental sustainability. Regular reviews of the tax system are important given that taxation has a large impact on human well-being, the economy and the environment. In the past, NZ has been smart from a health perspective in using taxes to ensure relatively high tobacco prices to reduce this important risk factor (NZ is one of the world leaders in terms of high tobacco prices). But in other ways NZ Governments have acted sub-optimally eg, this country’s carbon pricing mechanism has been widely criticised \[1-4\], and compares poorly to a well-designed carbon tax. Yet as a small and relatively non-corrupt \[1\] 2 country \[5\], NZ is well placed for enacting reforms in the direction of a better tax system. Such a tax system should balance efficiency, incentivising innovation and rewarding effort, and also work as an instrument to improve health, increase social cohesion and reduce inequalities where possible. In this blog we just focus on health- related taxes and their potential impact on health and health inequalities. Rationale for taxes on products that harm health The first justification for taxes is that civil society, through government, needs to raise revenue to fund government programmes and infrastructure (from education to roading). Those taxes may be placed on income, assets/land, and general goods and services (ie, GST). However, some potential targets for taxation have the extra justification of “negative externalities”. That is, additional taxes may be warranted where consumption of a good places additional (often future) costs on society that are not covered in the sales price or by the seller of the product. For example, alcohol imposes additional costs to the health system that taxpayers have to fund and it causes direct harm to others (eg, via alcohol-related vehicle crashes that kill others). Alcohol taxation therefore helps to address these “negative externalities” by better aligning the consumer price with the true social cost of the product. However, another principle (we call it the “tax as a tool” principle) can also be relevant, such as when a government uses tax as an instrument to achieve a societal goal. NZ did this when a differential tax was used to help phase-out leaded petrol in NZ in the 1990s. Tobacco taxes in NZ have also recently been used in this way to achieve a Smokefree NZ by 2025 (a government goal \[6\] and one with majority public support \[7\]). The government is effectively saying that they consider the “tool of tax increases” is more effective and cost-effective than some other possible interventions (eg, more investment in mass media campaigns to reduce smoking). This approach is argued for internationally eg, “taxes are an underused instrument for the prevention of premature death and disease...” \[8\]. From both the negative externalities and “tax as a tool” principles, many other products warrant consideration for tax over and above any blanket GST type tax, including those already with special excise taxes in NZ (alcohol, tobacco) and those not yet taxed (eg, sugary drinks that harm health). Carbon tax to protect planetary health Climate change is a major threat to the planet and even an existential threat to human civilisation. Climate change is also a threat to health and therefore carbon taxes are in scope from a health perspective. NZ, as a rich country, is far from playing an adequate role in responding to this major threat. In particular, NZ’s current pricing system for carbon NZ (an Emissions Trading Scheme \[ETS\]) has numerous design problem including its strange hybrid structure and exclusion of the important agricultural sector \[1-4\]. As such it urgently needs major reform, possibly by replacing it entirely with a carbon tax (an issue for the new Climate Commission to consider, as well as the Tax Working Group). If a carbon tax was adopted, then consideration could be given to fully recycling the carbon charges to the community. Eg, the province of 3 British Columbia in Canada adopted this approach by returning all tax revenue to BC’s taxpayers and businesses through tax cuts \[9\]. This revenue-neutral approach is one reason for the majority public support of this tax (ie, it “now funds more than a billion dollars a year in other tax cuts” \[9\]). Revenue from a carbon tax could also be used for promoting lower carbon lifestyles (eg, better walkways and cycle-ways for commuting) and promoting carbon sequestration (eg, better incentives for allowing native forest regeneration). Tobacco tax As recently summarised: “tobacco tax increases are the most effective and inexpensive way of reducing tobacco smoking prevalence, consumption, initiation and inequalities in smoking” \[10\]. In NZ, tobacco tax can be justified in terms of both the negative externalities from smoking and for the “tax as tool” principle to achieve a societal goal (see above). NZ’s recent period of regular tax increases, smoking prevalence has further declined along with tobacco sales (see here: \[11\] and this graph of declining sales data: \[12\]), albeit other tobacco control interventions will also have played a role. Further increases in tobacco tax are also very likely to produce further health gain, reduce health inequalities and generate cost-savings for the NZ health system (see these NZ studies: \[13-16\]). High tobacco prices will also encourage those who can’t easily quit nicotine to switch to vaping (e-cigarette use), which is likely to be much less hazardous to health than tobacco smoking \[17\]. For this reason it is important that the government does not place an excise tax on e-cigarettes at this stage – so that the current large price differential strongly encourages smokers to switch to vaping if they don’t quit. We address the financial hardship and illicit market issues around high tobacco prices in the Appendix below. Alcohol tax Drinking alcohol is a popular activity in NZ with around four out of five adults choosing to drink alcohol on at least one occasion during the year \[18\]. However, hazardous patterns of drinking are having a major impact on our health and society. In the short-term, alcohol is associated with increased rates of injury and criminal offending \[19, 20\]. Longer-term alcohol consumption increases risk of chronic diseases, such as liver cirrhosis, cancer and alcohol dependence \[21\]. While there is some evidence that low-level drinking may have a protective effect against non-fatal heart attacks \[22\], the risk for other cardiovascular diseases (eg, stroke) is increased \[22\], and the total net harm to health is increased above 100 grams of alcohol per week \[23\]. Indeed, there is six months life expectancy loss estimated for consumption at only >100 to ≤200 g of alcohol per week \[22\], or 10 to 20 standard drinks per week in NZ. In addition to harms for the drinker, various NZ studies show how important harm to others from alcohol is in this country \[24-26\]. Some of the worst examples are where alcohol is a component of road traffic deaths involving others, violent crime against others, and lifetime harm to others via fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and child neglect. The total health harm from alcohol use makes it the fifth most important risk factor (albeit with other drugs) for health loss in NZ \[27\]. As such, alcohol use is 4 a major contributor to health costs, to lost productivity for NZ businesses (and therefore tax revenue to the government) and to financial costs to society associated with crime, including property damage, police and court time, and incarceration. All these problems help justify relatively high alcohol taxes on negative externality grounds. Raising the tax on alcohol would provide a price incentive to reduce consumption, and therefore reduce the harm and associated health and societal costs. Increasing alcohol tax has been widely recommended by health experts in NZ and also in a thorough Law Commission Report \[28\]. Increasing alcohol tax is very likely to produce health gain, particularly by reducing injuries (see these 2 systematic reviews: \[29, 30\]). Higher alcohol taxes are also likely to save health system costs eg, according to Australian modelling work \[31\]. There is also scope to more closely align the level of tax to the alcohol content of beverages rather than to the type of drink (eg, for wine). This could help to simplify the current tax structure, reduce administrative burden, and align the taxation regime with public health. Alcohol tax does not appear to be regressive in the NZ setting (albeit based on relatively old data \[32\]) and it may actually be a progressive policy if it particularly helps prevent hazardous drinking in those NZ in deprived areas. This is because “adult drinkers in the most deprived areas were 1.7 times more likely to be hazardous drinkers than adult drinkers in the least deprived areas, after adjusting for age, sex and ethnic differences” \[33\]. In NZ, a very small proportion of alcohol tax goes to the Health Promotion Agency for alcohol-related health promotion. But this level of earmarked tax revenue should be increased to help address substantive knowledge deficits among NZ citizens (eg, the warning information on alcoholic beverages is severely limited and it seems few NZ adults understand that alcohol is associated with increased cancer risk or how alcohol contributes to excessive calorie intake). A UK style “soft drink industry levy” To address the epidemics of obesity and diabetes, there are a growing number of countries and American cities that are adopting taxes on sugary drinks \[34\]. From some of these settings there is supportive evaluation data showing the effectiveness of these taxes (eg, for Mexico \[35, 36\], Berkeley California \[37-39\] and Philadelphia, USA \[40\]). There are also real world studies providing evidence for health benefits from such taxes (eg, for health-favouring associations for BMI/obesity \[41-43\] and for reduced cardiovascular disease \[44\]). The research evidence in favour of sugary drink taxes grows increasingly stronger, and supports calls for NZ to implement such a tax. Possibly of most relevance to NZ is the UK “soft drink industry levy” which appears to have resulted in a reported 10% reduction in the average sugar content of energy drinks in the UK – prior to the levy even coming into force \[45\]. One of us (TB) has published on this UK levy \[46\], and it is probably the best designed one in current use given its impact on encouraging product reformulation to reduce sugar levels as well as delivering price signals to consumers \[47\]. 5 There appears to be majority public support for a sugary drinks tax in NZ according to a 2015 survey \[48\], as has been reported in other jurisdictions \[49-51\]. It is likely that additional public support would be further strengthened if revenue from a sugary drinks tax was used as per the UK levy to fund sport facilities at schools \[52\]. Alternatives might be to fund an expansion of NZ’s “fruit in schools” programme to all schools, provide healthy school lunches, or to fund school dental services. Other potential health-justified taxes Mexico has a “junk food” tax which appears to be working \[53, 54\] and some European countries tax salty products \[55\]. Favourable results are also reported in modelling studies of a potential salt tax in NZ \[56\], a salt tax in the USA \[57\], and a range of food taxes modelled for Australia (on saturated fat, salt, sugar, and sugar- sweetened beverages) \[58\]. We expect that these types of taxes on such foods and key ingredients will have merit at some point in the future for NZ. But a detailed discussion of these taxes may be premature until a UK style “soft drinks industry levy” is introduced to NZ and evaluated. The latter should probably be the first food/drink tax in NZ since it has: (i) the strongest evidence base; (ii) is focused on protecting children (from dental decay, obesity and diabetes in adolescence); (iii) is on a product with zero nutritional value; and (iv) the levy can be targeted at the industry, thereby promoting reformulation as in the UK. We lack the space to discuss other taxes in detail here, but there is also probably a case for the Tax Review Group to consider the following taxes that relate to some aspect of protecting health: higher gambling taxes, taxes on the advertising of junk food/sugary drinks advertising, taxes on fertiliser (to reduce nitrogen pollution of waterways), and taxes on pesticides (to reduce non-essential usage). But in some cases we acknowledge that regulation (or a mix of regulation and tax) may be more optimal than using pricing instruments. The Tax Working Group, should also recommend to Government the inclusion of a health impact evaluation on all aspects of tax reform (including equity impact evaluation) of any tax proposals. How selected taxes could actually reduce the total tax level required (by saving health costs) Finally, we note that the health sector accounts for $15.6 billion of government expenditure (the second largest expenditure source after Social Security and Welfare). Using the tax system to prevent disease has the potential to reduce the tax take needed to maintain current provision of services, or to provide additional government services within the existing revenue collected. For example, our modelling work shows that a strategy of future tobacco tax increases would save NZ$ 1.1 billion in future health system costs (over the lifetimes of New Zealanders alive in 2011) \[15\] – in addition to the additional tax revenue raised \[13\]. Similarly, a salt tax could save NZ$ 1.0 billion in health system costs (as well as raising $452 million in revenue per year) \[56\]. Conclusions 6 In this blog we briefly discuss some of the opportunities for taxing harmful products which will potentially protect health and lower health costs, reduce health inequalities and enhance environmental sustainability. Although New Zealand has taken this approach historically (eg, taxes on tobacco and alcohol), there remains substantial scope for improvements in these areas along with new taxes (eg, a carbon tax and a soft drink industry levy). Appendix: Extra notes on tobacco tax issues (illicit market and financial harm) A small risk from high tobacco prices is the potential growth of the illegal tobacco market. However, existing NZ research is reassuring that this is a minor issue \[59\] and will probably remain so even with higher prices \[13\]. There has also been recent media coverage of dairy robberies for tobacco. However, this robbery problem can be dealt with by: • Prohibiting tobacco sales from outlets such as dairies and petrol stations (possibly by restricting sales to venues such as supermarkets, which haven’t had such robbery problems, or to pharmacies \[60\] that have far better security). • Phasing down the number of all tobacco outlets in the country, as per the tobacco control strategy details in these NZ studies: \[15, 61, 62\]. Policy-makers may also be concerned about the financial harm for smokers who don’t respond to tobacco tax increases. However, there is modelling evidence that such financial harm to health is small relative to the high level of harm from smoking \[63\]. Also there are studies showing that tobacco tax increases are likely to be a pro-health equity strategy in NZ, ie, greater per capita health gains for Māori \[14, 15\]. But there is also a very strong case for more tobacco tax revenue to go for quitting support and other tobacco control measures to help low-income smokers (as argued in a recent Action Plan \[64\] on reaching the Smokefree 2025 goal and elsewhere \[65\]). Indeed, NZ smokers themselves have voiced support for tobacco tax increases – if some of the tax revenue is dedicated to helping them quit \[66\]. Other measures to reduce the risk of financial harm to low-income smokers who don’t quit, or who don’t shift to vaping, include welfare reform to increase financial support for low-income New Zealanders.

Certain information in this document has been withheld under one or more of the following sections of the Official Information Act, as applicable: \[1\] 9(2)(a) - to protect the privacy of natural persons, including deceased people; \[2\] 9(2)(k) - to prevent the disclosure of official information for improper gain or improper advantage. Where information has been withheld, a numbered reference to the applicable section of the Official Information Act has been made, as listed above. For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Nearly Everyone in Town Benefits from Tourism All goods and services traders in tourist hotspots like Queenstown benefit from tourism. Tourism has massively increased demand for bars, restaurants, activity operators, taxis, accountants, electricians, plumbers, builders, law enforcement, developers, planners, long haul transport operators and everyone else. Every sub sector of the local economy and most residents benefit from tourism. In Queenstown, the big players - Real Journeys, Skyline Enterprises, Ngai Tahu and NZSki - receive almost all their revenue from tourism. Tax Equity Must Remain a Key Principle of Fiscal Policy If every business in a region benefits, the cost of the supporting infrastructure should be borne by all those beneficiaries, or at least apply equally across the local economy. Most definitely it should not be imposed on just one subsector of the local economy – the formal accommodation sector. Don’t Favour the Informal Sector and Other Destinations Adding a new layer of tax only to the formal accommodation sector will raise prices and drive yet more tourists away from regulated accommodation. It will push more visitors into private holiday homes and into the freedom camping market. New taxes on formal accommodation in Queenstown will increase the price differential between Queenstown and nearby alternative accommodation centers, diverting overnight stays away from Queenstown to alternative places. Tourists Spend Only 14% on Accommodation Tourists spend only 14% of their NZ holiday money on accommodation. Taxing 14% of the spend is missing a much wider opportunity. There is much more to be got from tourism revenue. Taxing accommodation is the wrong target. The GST Take is Enormous - Returning More To Regions Makes Sense With international visitor expenditure to the year ended September 2017 at $10.4 billion per annum, the GST take is $1.56 billion. 1 Queenstown alone has a tourist expenditure of $2.2 billion which generates around $332.4 million every year in GST receipts for central government. Regions should receive a central government credit which should be structured as a guaranteed share of their GST earnings. That way funding for infrastructure 1 MBIE: Key Tourism Statistics, 22 November 2017. would be put in synch with demand for infrastructure and services in any given region, whether it goes up or down. Note that this approach was endorsed by one of the coalition partners of the current government. The Very Best Option is “Local Taxes Extra” If central government resists handing back a defined portion of GST then regional councils should appeal for a right to raise more of their own taxes. It is common in many offshore jurisdictions to allow regional governing bodies the right to raise transaction taxes – hence the “Local Taxes Extra” line that appears on sales dockets in many federated states. Allowing regions to generate their own transaction taxes would however be a significant development in NZ fiscal policy. It is likely to be resisted by central government and the major political parties. It does however offer the greatest freedom and certainty in both revenue generation at the local level and expenditure on things that matter to locals. If a region-wide ability to tax transactions was established and applied across all subsectors of the local economy, then it need not be anything more than a marginal charge. Around 1% would generate plenty of additional annual revenue off international visitor expenditure in Queenstown alone.
Tax Working Group Public Submissions Information Release Release Document September 2018 taxworkingroup.govt.nz/key-documents Key to sections of the Official Information Act 1982 under which information has been withheld. Certain information in this document has been withheld under one or more of the following sections of the Official Information Act, as applicable: \[1\] 9(2)(a) - to protect the privacy of natural persons, including deceased people; \[2\] 9(2)(k) - to prevent the disclosure of official information for improper gain or improper advantage. Where information has been withheld, a numbered reference to the applicable section of the Official Information Act has been made, as listed above. For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Submission on Tax General principles: 1...All benefits that are individualized (ie can only be accessed by the individual eg not public health care or public education) should be completely taxed incl those provided by a trust or company. 2...all tax systems should be transparent and completely without exemption or loopholes (as these enable entities with resources to exploit to minimize their tax). 3...the tax take should reflect the amount of wealth accrued to the individuals in that cohort ie if the top 1% have 25% of the wealth, then they should shoulder 25% of the tax burden. 4...all persons or entities who earn their wealth from the country should pay tax. That MUST include overseas entities who currently do not pay sufficient NZ tax, and overseas online retailers. 5...it is legitimate to use tax as a way of curbing negative behaviour and rewarding positive behaviour. In detail. 1...All people who reside in NZ and those who make their money in NZ (overseas registered companies) should shoulder the tax burden according to their wealth in NZ (or generated in NZ for overseas companies). If the top 1% of entities (people and overseas companies) have 25% of all the wealth of NZ, the tax structure should ensure that they collectively pay 25% of the total tax take. 2...to have tax that reflects the wealth of the cohort, we need a Capital Gains Tax as a complement to the highly regressive GST. The CGT should be on all items including the family home. However, to make it practical, the tax due can be suspended until the death of the owner or when ownership changes hands. We should also have a Financial Transaction Tax, again as a counter-weight to GST. If one or both of CGT and FFT are enacted, then GST can be lowered – perhaps back down to 10%. Or the proportion of tax currently taken by GST should be split 33:33:33 by GST, CGT and FFT. 3...Company tax needs to be reformed in 2 particular areas. The first is that companies should be treated like individuals and taxed on their income and no exemption for their expenditures. If it is sufficiently fair that individuals are taxed solely on their income and no account is taken with regards to expenditure in general, then that should be the defacto standard method for companies. Like individuals, there should be a sliding scale for company tax, depending on their income. If deemed beneficial, companies could have a tax holiday for a few years while they start up. They may also get a reduction if they take on new staff. If this was adopted, then we would have a problem with overseas companies re-arranging their books to incur all the costs here and send all their profits overseas. This method of taxing on income must be mandatory for overseas companies. Even if the principle of taxing companies by income is not acceptable (ie tax is still calculated on profit), it can still be far more transparent such that taxes cannot be reduced because of losses. Losses may result in no tax but cannot be used to write-off future tax take. Also there should be no exemptions of any sort for capital depreciation or any thing else. The second area that company tax needs to be tightened is where long-term (eg greater than 1 month continuously) fringe benefits are accrued to particular individuals. The use of a company car or phone with no costs accrued to the individual must be fully taxed. Similarly the ability to tack on a holiday after doing some company travel (often for highly dubious reasons). The current FBT regime isn’t sufficient. 4...we should be taxing activities that have a negative externality eg carbon emissions, phosphate load on the land. We should also reward positive externalities like perhaps having no GST on fresh vegetables. Such taxes should be able to be changed relatively easily, depending on what behaviour needs changing. Deriving wealth from non-productive activities is also a behaviour that is negative. The tax structure should reward productive investment and penalize activities that derive wealth by driving up price (just like a Ponzi scheme). Another reason for making FBT punitive is that it probably encourages ‘negative’ behaviour eg excessive use of the company car, or unnecessary travel. Making FBT punitive and making the individual gaining the benefit liable for the tax (as opposed to the company) will also help reduce the “agency theory” problem here – as I’m sure it is not in the interest of the company per se for private car use or private holidays. 5...As all tax calculation is now electronically done with computers, it is unnecessary to have “hard, fixed” rates of taxation. Instead it is now feasible to have sliding tax rates. For instance, where the tax rate is now 10.5% for income of 0-$14k, and then a tax rate of 17.5% for income between $14k- $48k, you could have a sliding tax rate of 0-15% for income between $0-$48k. This would reduce to incentive to earn just below the threshold or some similar behaviour. It may also reduce the sometimes very high marginal tax rates suffered by some welfare beneficiaries when they exceed their income limits and MSD starts clawing back their benefits.

Submission to Tax Working Group – Oliver Sangster What should New Zealand be taxing, but is currently not taxing? Non-productive assets should have capital gains tax. Some items are taxable under section CB4 of the Income Tax Act 1 , although this is difficult to enforce and I doubt it is applied in New Zealand as it should, and there is the brightline test for sales of houses within 2 years. It is arguable that so-called “investment property” (i.e. a property that I purchase for the purpose of selling for a profit in the future) could be captured under section CB4 in the same way that the IRD has considered gold bullion now is. However it would be very hard to enforce, and difficult to prove in any given case given it relies on determining the owner’s motive (which they could just lie about) therefore a separate CGT is necessary to clear up the matter. People who make money (generate income) off speculation on non-productive assets still get to have the social benefits that taxpayers have provided for them (roads, hospitals, schools etc) without having put in a cent towards them. It is fundamentally unfair for the system to make productive workers pay for things that are funded by the Government while enabling those who profit off speculation to enjoy their free ride. The current system also incentivises people into speculative industries rather than productive industries (quit their job in the service industry for example) and start gambling through property speculation or currency trading. Who generate profit from simply buying and selling assets, without actually producing any value-add themselves, should have to pay tax on that profit (arguably more tax than those who are producing a good or service, as the Government should encourage people to spend their time doing productive work or investing in productive industries (e.g. start-up businesses), rather than speculating on non-productive assets where no real “good” is produced). Capital Gains Tax should apply to all non-productive assets equally as part of a person’s income tax. It should cover interest earned on savings (as in the status quo), but also profits gained from selling real estate, precious metals (e.g. gold or silver bullion), and currency (including traditional currencies and crypto-currencies). On the “family home” exclusion, I understand that the Labour Party in its pre-election campaigning bowed to public pressure to limit the ToR of this Tax Working Group to exclude “the family home”, so the report sadly cannot include that. For what it’s worth, excluding “the family home” still provides an added (unnecessary) incentive for people to purchase their own home rather than continue renting. Continuing the income tax distortion of excluding one type of non-productive asset still disadvantages families who will never be in a position to purchase their own home. Excluding “the family home” is a populist move on the part of the Labour Party in an effort to not lose votes from homeowners, and it should be labelled as such. 1 http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2007/0097/latest/DLM1512409.html What is New Zealand not taxing and should continue not taxing? Rent. As noted on page 6 of the Future of Tax document, “applying GST to rent would raise various practical and fairness issues”. I agree. Taxing landlords’ rental income would instantly result in rents being increased, i.e. the tax would be passed on to the tenants making it regressive. The perverse outcomes of such a tax is that it means it takes longer for tenants to save for a house deposit, exacerbating the growing inequality between landlords and tenants that already exists in New Zealand (at an unacceptable level in my opinion). Sales of second-hand goods should stay GST excluded given the goods in theory should have already had GST paid on them when they were first sold in NZ (or if they were bought from overseas and were are subject to customs duty) / had spare parts added or other modifications made to them GST gets added then. Adding GST onto the sale of a second hand car, for example, therefore equates to double- taxing (which should be avoided in principle), is regressive (given people who purchase second hand goods are likely to be less “well off” than those who purchase new), and would be an administrative nightmare (e.g. every individual selling a second hand item on TradeMe would need to get GST registered). I am however open to the idea of adding excise tax onto the sale of certain second-hand items that we need to phase out (e.g. non-electric vehicles, as discussed later) Chapter 2: The future environment What do you see as the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system over the medium- to long-term? Which of these are most important? How should the tax system change in response to the risks, challenges, and opportunities you have identified? The two biggest risks I see to the New Zealand economy over the medium-long term are climate change (over the next few decades) and our aging population (as the Baby Boomer generation continues into retirement over the next 10 years). The tax system will need to adjust to these realities sooner rather than later (e.g. taxes will be needed for greater Government spending to protect New Zealand’s society and environment as it adapts to climate change – resilient infrastructure will be incredibly expensive and many councils are struggling to maintain their existing infrastructure let alone develop it in response to population growth and climate change adaptation needs). More health budget will be needed to account for added pressures on the health system as New Zealand’s population continues to age. More taxes are needed to pay for this, unless we start borrowing more or increasing the Superannuation age (which I am in favour of but is out of scope of this Tax Working Group exercise). Another big risk is that typical New Zealanders are incentivized to put their life savings into a single asset (the house), rather than spread their wealth around into a portfolio of assets (which spreads economic risk around). This is in part (but not fully 2 ) influenced by the fact that people need to pay tax on the interest on savings/investments, but not on capital gains generated from buying and selling assets. The upshot of this is that we are in a situation where New Zealand society is divided between landowners and non-landowners. Landowners will do all they can to protect their ‘nest egg’ (property value). This fear reared its head in the most nasty way during the recent debates on Auckland’s Unitary Plan, where the Generation Zero advocacy group who supported residential intensification in areas across Auckland was verbally abused and shouted down by a group of landowners who wanted to preserve the status quo in their neighborhoods for fear that intensification would reduce their property values. Growing resentment between the ‘haves’ and the ‘want to haves’ is not the future I want to see for New Zealand – it is elitist rather than egalitarian. This could risk reducing social integrity and creating division in New Zealand. The tax system should play its part to prevent this, by introducing capital gains tax to level the playing field and encourage people to distribute their financial assets and risks across different investments. Another big challenge is dealing with globalization, particularly global companies that operate in New Zealand but avoid paying tax (e.g. due to being set up in tax havens like Ireland and/or the British Virgin Islands). If these companies compete with local companies New Zealand who don’t have that luxury, this creates an uneven playing field which has problems for the New Zealand economy (small businesses can’t compete). I don’t have any answers here I’m afraid, hopefully the IRD will work it out. How could tikanga Māori (in particular manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, and kaitiakitanga) help create a more future-focussed tax system? I am not Maori, so not entirely sure. But from my (possibly naïve) perspective, I think these principles would be well shared across the Government system as a whole (not just the tax system). At a principle level, I think taxation for the purpose of wealth distribution (welfare) and environmental protection is fully consistent with these tikanga principles, which as I understand relating to looking after family and others, and looking after the environment). Iwi trusts, Maori health organizations that are not for profit but are acting for the good of their people should have tax exemptions, as do other types of charitable trusts. Chapter 3: Purposes and principles of a good tax system 2 There are also cultural factors which influence this – i.e. buying a house as the “kiwi dream”, and weak residential tenancy laws that favour landlords over tenants which encourage people to get out of renting and buy a house as soon as they can Principles for assessment What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? The criteria on page 19 look good to me. Defining ‘fairness’ How would you define ‘fairness’ in the context of the tax system? What would a fair tax system look like? As an advocate for egalitarianism, I would define fairness as a tax system which: - Enables wealth generated to be taxed in order for redistribution to benefit those who are least well off, particularly to ensure their peoples fundamental human rights are met (articulated in the UN Declaration of Human Rights, of which New Zealand is a signatory), - Applies the ‘polluter pays’ principle to ensure individuals responsible for environmental harm/damage are accountable for their actions. A fair tax system would therefore need to include - A progressive income tax system (i.e. not a system of ‘flat’ or ‘regressive’ taxes) - Taxation as a means to offset any residual damage caused by polluting industries that are not addressed by regulation / control under the RMA Separate excise taxes may be suitable to encourage good behavior (e.g. the current annual rebate available to individuals who donate to non-profit organizations which deliver social benefits) and discourage bad behavior (e.g. excise tax on cigarettes). Classical economics generally presumes people will always act in their own best interest. However behavioural economics demonstrates that people tend to make “irrational” decisions, and often don’t act in their own best interest, and therefore need to be “nudged”, and taxation is one way of doing that. I do think using taxes to nudge people’s behavior is fair provided it is evidence based and coupled with public education. The introduction of taxes designed to change people’s behavior should be evidence-based, carefully considered and open to feedback from the public. Tax on tax is unfair and should stop in New Zealand. There is no moral justification to charge a person tax simply for the fact that they’ve had to pay tax. While excise duties in themselves may be justified (to nudge behavior and/or pay for particular public goods that the tax relates to e.g. roads), having to then pay GST on top of those excise duties is not justified and in fact a devious method of generating revenue by the Government. An example of current tax on tax in New Zealand is the way GST is added to the price of petrol. Firstly, the price of petrol is calculated to include all excise taxes required. Then GST is added on top of the total price including the excise taxes. The AA calculated the GST on the excise portion of the price of petrol as amounting to a ‘10 cents per litre “tax on taxes”’ 3 . I have not seen any information about how this applies to other goods that are subject to excise duties (e.g. alcohol and cigarettes) however I would presume the same method of calculation applies. The ‘Future of Tax’ report seems to make no mention of this. GST should not be charged on excise taxes as those taxes are neither a “good” nor a “service” – they are a tax. GST should only be charged on the actual cost of the product (incorporating the both the “good” and “service” elements), not on the excise tax added to the cost of that product. Chapter 4: The current New Zealand tax system Frameworks New Zealand’s ‘broad-based, low-rate’ system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. Looking to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? If not, what approach should replace it? Generally a broad-based, low rate is preferable to minimize deadweight loss and administrative costs of a more complex system. I see an argument for allowing community service card holders to pay a lower rate of GST for all goods and services (say 10%, or even 0%), given those at the ‘bottom end’ of the income inequality spectrum will need to spend a higher proportion of their income on the basic necessities of life than those at the top. For those who do not have a CSC, they would pay a higher rate to offset the lost revenue (say 18% - not sure if this is the right number, but just for example). This is slightly more complex than the current broad-based, low rate approach, but could be argued to be more progressive as those at the bottom do not have to pay the tax. In saying that, low income earners have a lower income tax rate already, so this disparity may already be taken into account by New Zealand’s progressive income tax system. I still support whatever minimizes deadweight loss, provided the broader system goes back into distribution of services to benefit those who are least well off. I am neutral as to whether that is GST exemptions for certain types of people, or income redistribution (leaning towards the latter due to the deadweight loss problem) As stated above, the method of calculating GST should change so that GST is not charged on the excise taxes that apply to particular products (e.g. petrol, alcohol, tobacco) as “tax on tax” is not justified. Taxes and behaviour Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes? Yes. If bad behavior carries social and/or environmental costs, then taxes to discourage that bad behavior and encourage good behavior should absolutely be considered alongside other policy options. In some cases, taxes will be more appropriate than an outright ban, because taxation has some more ‘respect’ for human freedom and reduces unintended consequences (e.g. there would be uproar if New 3 www.aa.co.nz/cars/owning-a-car/fuel-prices-and-types/petrol/ Zealand banned cigarettes completely, and tobacco would just go into the black market because people are addicted). Taxes to encourage behavior change should be used carefully, as like all policy options they might not work on their own and/or might carry perverse incentives. For example, if the tobacco tax rate is set too high, that could make tobacco unaffordable and push tobacco into the black market or people might choose to steal it (a perverse outcome). Similarly if tax was the only tool used to encourage people to quit smoking (e.g. no public education took place), this is unlikely to achieve the goal of reducing smoking as smoking is addictive, so the tax should be used alongside other interventions e.g. public education campaigns, images on cigarette packets etc. For example, electric vehicles in New Zealand currently do not have to pay road user charges, unlike diesel vehicles. This is essentially a tax exemption for electric vehicles (as petrol cars have these charges incorporated into the price of petrol, while diesel cars must purchase ‘miles’). This is part of a suite of policy interventions to encourage more people to purchase electric vehicles, change peoples’ behavior away from the habit of buying petrol or diesel cars. In my personal opinion, progress in response to climate change is not occurring quickly enough, and more of these types of behavior change taxes should be put in place to promote a quicker transition to a low carbon economy for New Zealand. E.g. - introducing new excise taxes on companies for the generation of electricity using non-renewable resources (e.g. coal, gas or diesel) to encourage electricity generators to convert to renewable sources – e.g. a company pays a tax for each unit of electricity it generates through non-renewable sources. This could be in addition to, or instead of, or adaption of, participation in the current ETS which in my view is inadequate - increase road user charges on diesel trucks used for freight in the effort to encourage freight companies to use more rail - increase petrol and diesel excise tax to reflect the true cost of CO 2 emissions generated, and use that tax to offset CO 2 emissions (e.g. by funding the Government’s billion trees planting programme). Although the transport sector has been part of the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme since its establishment, climate emissions generated from the energy sector have continued to increase. A reason for this could be that because the amount people pay into the ETS is so minimal that it is unnoticeable (within the typical margin of a change in petrol price) 4 , that it is insufficient to effect any positive behavior change. I discuss CO 2 taxation further in a later section on environment taxes. I do not think excluding GST from fresh fruit and vegetables will be effective given seasonal differences in price happen anyway, so the tax is unlikely to affect consumer behavior. Taxing sugary drinks may be more justified, given the price of those products is less subject to fluctuation. The purpose of that tax 4 The Automobile Association calculates the ETS component of fuel prices at just under 5 cents per litre for petrol, and 5.5 cents per litre for diesel. https://www.aa.co.nz/cars/motoring-blog/january-2018-petrol- and-diesel-prices/ would be to encourage greater health, and reduce costs on the healthcare system (particularly dental health and diabetes). The tax would need to be at a high enough level to make people notice, and this would need to be coupled with a public education campaign about the tax itself, its purpose, and healthy alternatives. Again, the pros, cons and alternatives should always be considered before introducing a tax designed to change peoples’ behavior, and there needs to be a strong evidence base. However, sometimes a ban would be more appropriate than taxation if the damage caused by that activity is too great to justify its continuation (e.g. in my personal opinion, plastic shopping bags should be completely banned rather than taxed, because the environmental damage they cause is unlikely to be offset by taxation. Retirement savings Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? Yes. In today’s New Zealand culture, people need to be nudged in order to save for their retirement. There is plenty of research in behavioral economics demonstrating that people are more inclined to make decisions in favour of short term pleasure (spending money on stuff I want now) to the detriment of saving towards retirement. This is a market failure of sorts as I don’t know what’s best for my future. There is a strong case for government to intervene to encourage people to save for their retirement. Most people don’t think that hard about retirement savings until its far too late (usually when their body starts to creak when they get out of bed). As a 29 year old, I rarely, if ever think about my retirement. Its just depressing to think of myself getting old, and there are far more “important” things like travel to think about (that was sarcasm, but this attitude is definitely common among millennial-age New Zealanders). Kiwisaver is great. The Government should jump in and do whatever will make more money for Kiwisaver investors over the long run. The report talks about most OECD countries having an E-E-T system, while NZ has a T-T-E system. If evidence suggests that more people will be encouraged to save more for retirement if we switch to an E-E-T system, or something else, we should do that. What about: E-E-E? A bold move, and would require increases in taxes elsewhere to offset lost revenue, but if the Government really wants people to put away as much as possible for retirement, why tax Kiwisaver savings/investment interest at all? As a side note, I also think the Government needs to start making some bold policy moves to face the reality of our aging population problem and begin raising the age of entitlement for Superannuation to where we can afford it, and/or introduce means testing so that only the people who truly need Superannuation are eligible for it. I realize this is outside of the scope of the Tax Working Group TOR, but it needs to be raised with the Government as much as possible. If we do not start transitioning now, we are going to be in for a really big shock in the next 10 years. The increase in healthcare and palliative care costs is going to be enormous. The current ‘head in the sand’ approach might be politically safe (for now) but very soon this is going to hit us, and the next generation, like a freight train and whoever’s in Government will have nowhere to hide. Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system Fairness and balance Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? No. The balance is too far weighted towards the speculative economy. A broad capital gains tax on profits generated from the sale of non-productive assets. The revenue generated from the new capital gains tax can be offset by cutting tax rates for PAYE earners across the spectrum and small businesses. Tax and business Does the tax system do enough to minimise costs on business? Not sure – I think small businesses with PAYE staff could use a tax break, particularly as the minimum wage is increasing. A progressive tax rate for businesses would be useful here. It might even help small businesses compete with the tax-avoiding global corporates who are effectively stealing our money. Does the tax system do enough to maintain natural capital? I presume natural capital here is in reference to the instrumental value of natural resources. I don’t think the tax system currently does anything to maintain natural capital. I do think that the only way we can convince people to spend money on saving ecosystems is to show them how much it will hurt them (their business) and us (the NZ economy) in quantifiable dollar terms if we lose these natural resources. Most people have no idea how reliant our agricultural economy is on ecosystem services from creatures like bees for example. If we ruin their habitat we are shooting ourselves in the foot economically. Often the costs of environmentally damaging behavior are not adequately accounted for in RMA decisions. RMA struggles to deal with “cumulative effects” well (e.g. synergistic additional impacts of multiple activities operating in the same area). The only resources that are taxed in New Zealand currently are petroleum and minerals under the Crown Minerals Act, and Sand/Shingle under the RMA. There is a royalty regime for taking geothermal water (heat) under the RMA, but I understand the royalty is not collected and application of this has been put on hold pending the ongoing Waitangi Tribunal WAI262 claim. There is scope to tax use of other public resources used for private gain, with the aim of maintaining and enhancing natural capital. The RMA deliberately excludes minerals (including petroleum) as it recognizes that as non-renewable resources they cannot be “maintained”, only exploited if they are to be used. As noted further below, I consider that taxes for the purpose of maintaining natural capital should only be applied if the impacts on the environment cannot be adequately managed under the RMA. There is scope for taxes to apply to things like freshwater pollution, soil loss through erosion, biodiversity loss. This would be extremely hard to set I am guessing, but warrants consideration. Are there types of businesses benefiting from low effective tax rates because of excessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income? Unsure. But it wouldn’t surprise me. There are plenty of smart people working in the various accounting firms around town. I saw a recent news article suggesting self employed individuals are underreporting their income tax and not paying their fair share. The IRD needs to sort this out. Chapter 6: Thinking outside the current system What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? Which of these inconsistencies are most important to address? Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? As noted earlier, I think it is inconsistent and immoral that people working in productive industries should be taxed (e.g. through PAYE), while people speculating in non-productive assets are not (other than houses that fall within the bright line test, and taxing sale of investments that are purchased with the intent of disposal under the Income Tax Act (which is likely a difficult test to determine)). This is contributing to New Zealand’s growing levels of income inequality as savvy investors tend to be more wealthy already, while PAYE earners are less so. The Government must introduce a broad Capital Gains Tax to end this distortion. As noted above, tax rates for PAYE earners and small businesses could be reduced accordingly to offset revenue gains from CGT (tax cuts for PAYE earners has the added benefit of making it easier for people to save towards buying a house for example). Chapter 7: Specific challenges Housing affordability How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? Many factors have contributed to the growing levels of housing unaffordability in New Zealand, and the lack of a capital gains tax is a significant one as it incentivizes speculation in housing rather than shares in businesses for example. Introduce capital gains tax on property to work towards reducing speculative investment that has seen dramatic increase in the average cost of a house in New Zealand, and back towards investment in productive industries where we can actually generate real wealth for the country. Housing affordability is getting worse, and the ‘goalpost’ of the house deposit needed for a person to get on the ladder grows at a faster rate than people are able to save to catch up to it. It’s a complete mess, and if current trends continue there will be an ever increasing proportion of New Zealander who will never be able to afford to buy a house. Capital gains tax Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have? Absolutely, for the reasons outlined above. A broad based capital gains tax on the sales of all non- productive assets (including land, housing, gold, bitcoin, you name it). Capital Gains Tax should only apply when people sell a house for profit. If the “family home” is excluded from CGT, I do not think that investors should be eligible for tax deductions if the house loses value (they took a risk in making the investment, without intending to use the property for its main purpose which is to be lived in). If the Government changes its mind and includes “the family home” in a CGT system, then a tax deduction for a capital loss on sales if the price goes down would be appropriate for that type of asset. Re housing, measures would need to be in place to ensure renters are not “footing the bill” for the property owner’s capital gains tax. It would be unethical for a landlord to pass on that cost to renters (i.e. by increasing the rent to offset their perceived “loss” of a capital gains tax), given the CTG has to do with the value gain of the property over time, and has nothing to do with the tenants, but rather external market forces. Rent control should be brought in to ensure landlords do not increase rents on the basis of new Capital Gains Tax. Land tax Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? Yes, as above. Should be treated the same as all other non-productive assets to ensure a level playing field. Environmental taxation What are the main opportunities for effective environmental taxation? Environmental taxes should ascribe to the “polluter pays” principle. If the polluter has already “paid” through other means (e.g. worked with a council to account for the environmental impacts of their activities under the RMA), then additional environmental taxes should not be applied to that person. Revenues generated from taxes on environmentally harmful activities should be put back towards positive environmental activities, ideally as close to the area where the tax came from as possible. There are many options for how “environmental” taxes might be applied in New Zealand, such as: • Enable local councils to taxes all visitors using ‘bed tax’ so that councils with a low ratepayer base but a high tourist volumes can pay for the infrastructure needed to support the growing tourism industry. Bed taxes are used in many cities around the world for this very purpose. New Zealand’s environment is one of the main tourism drawcards for New Zealand, so those coming to use it for their enjoyment (tourists) should pay something towards its protection. Central government can set out the parameters but local authorities should be allowed to set their own tax (the actual tax rate could vary from council to council). Bed tax will need to cover all forms of paid accommodation (including non-traditional hospitality sector such as “Bookabach” and “AirBnB”, as well as the more traditional hotels, campgrounds etc) to be comprehensive and avoid perverse outcomes for the hospitality industry. The bed tax should apply equally to international and domestic tourists as it makes no difference from an infrastructure management point of view where the tourists have come from. • Enable district and city councils to put in place traffic congestion charging in areas of their district–apply to the use of private motor vehicles in built up urban areas (e.g. especially Auckland CBD where congestion is horrendous), as per other cities such as London and Sydney. Purpose of the tax (charge) is to reduce congestion, encourage people to take alternative transport modes e.g. public transport, cycling, walking. Revenue generated from the tax should be ring fenced to go towards funding improvements to public transport infrastructure/cycleways/pedestrian infrastructure in the area (district or city) where the congestion charge exists, to give those affected by the tax a more attractive alternative (i.e. more regular buses, light rail etc). • Enable DOC to charge fees to enter national parks to add to government financing on DOC’s activities (e.g. pest control/track maintenance etc). This is also done in most countries around the world – New Zealand is unusual in this sense. Not so much a tax as a fee, but this is still in line with the polluter pays principle. There might be some backlash from local New Zealanders who believe it is their entitlement to access the National Parks for free – this should be consulted on (i.e. should the fee apply to all users or just people who cannot produce an official NZ ID (passport, driver license etc) as per fees to enter the Treaty Grounds at Waitangi?). • Waste management – taxes can be used to encourage recycling, e.g. landfill levy under the Waste Minimization Act could be increased significantly (currently $10/tonne which is a lot lower than other countries such as the UK). Revenues generated from an increased levy could go towards more local recycling schemes. • CO 2 emissions. The current ETS is not a sufficient to be considered a “polluter pays” system. The big problem with the current ETS is that the price of a NZ Unit is based on the price of carbon which is subject to global price fluctuations, rather than the actual cost of offsetting emissions. A true polluter pays carbon tax should reflect the actual cost of offsetting the emissions generated, not be based on the price of carbon which is arbitrary and is not effective enough in reducing emissions. I.e. how much does it cost to plant the number of trees required to offset the emission you have produced = level of the tax. Otherwise the tax does not pay for the damage caused, and CO 2 emitters are still free-riding and creating costs to be borne by future generations. • Water tax – water is becoming scarcer in particular areas of New Zealand, and will continue to as the impacts of climate change get more prevelant over the next few decades. A water tax could be used to applied to ensure water is being used for the most efficient purpose. This is a public good that is currently free for consent holders to use, but consent holders have exclusive right to use the water (which currently locks in permits for up to 35 years on a first-in-first- served basis, which can lead to inefficient resource use outcomes). Taxing water provides consent holders and additional incentive to conserve water that they don’t need to use, even if they have consent from the regional council to use it. Water tax should not apply to use of water for purposes that are clearly in the public good (e.g. public drinking water supplies, use in wastewater treatment plants, firefighting etc). The water tax should only apply to for-profit industrial users of water (e.g. private water bottling plants, breweries, farms for irrigation, factories for industrial processing etc) as these private companies are currently using a “free” public resource for private economic gain, tax free. Electricity generation is a tough one given the ‘mixed-ownership model’ in New Zealand implies a mix of public and private benefit, however on balance I would not apply a water tax to the use of water for electricity generation given the public ‘need’ for electricity in a modern society, the need to promote renewable electricity (including hydro) rather than non-renewable, and the fact that the water itself doesn’t get “sold” for a profit (only “released” through the dams to generate power and sent downstream) • Biodiversity loss – I do not think a tax is the right mechanism to ‘pay’ for damage caused by loss of habitat from particular industries. Rather, I believe that the RMA process of requiring project proponents to do the work themselves to offset their biodiversity destruction, and/or pay a bond to the local council to ensure the work gets done, to offset the environmental damage, is the correct way to deal with this. If the applicant can’t show that it internalize the externalities it causes by avoiding, remedying or mitigating (or offsetting) the damage it cases to biodiversity, it shouldn’t be allowed to undertake the activity (i.e. consent should be declined under the RMA) Progressive company tax Should the tax system do more to support small businesses? In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax? Yes, tax rates should be lower for small businesses to encourage entrepreneurs (new start ups) and associated job growth. Large established companies can afford to pay higher levels of tax given they would tend to have higher revenues and less ongoing risk. An alternative to progressive company tax could be the Government providing financial grants to assist new small businesses to get up and running. GST exemptions for particular goods Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from GST? If so, what should be excluded? What else should be taxed to make up for the lost revenue? One good that I would support removing GST on is electric vehicles, given new electric vehicles are more expensive upfront for an individual buyer than petrol or diesel vehicles of equivalent sizes, but there are wider social and environmental benefits in promoting a fast transition to electric vehicles. The upfront cost difference is currently one of the barriers to uptake. An excise tax could be placed on the sales of non-electric vehicles to offset the lost revenue from GST on electric vehicles, and reduce the upfront cost difference between electric and non-electric vehicles even further. The excise tax on non- electric vehicles should be applied after GST has been added (to avoid the current ‘tax-on-tax’ situation that applies to petrol for example) A second item is feminine hygiene products (pads, tampons etc), which are necessary goods for women but not for men. Given men do not need those items, they are excluded from paying a particular tax (GST on those items) solely because of the arbitrary fact that they are male. Given I do not get to choose my gender, taxing these items which are only necessary for half the population is unfair and regressive against women, so the Government should remove GST on those products to make them more accessible (on human rights grounds). I cannot think of an equivalent item to tax to make up for the lost revenue, but I think the Government taking a (relatively small) financial hit is ethical due to the arbitrary nature of the need between women and men. I do not think that GST exemptions should apply to the cost of fresh fruit and vegetables, because the seasonal fluctuations in prices across individual types of fruit and vegetables often provide a larger variation than the GST rate throughout the year (15%), and the price of fruit and vegetables can vary from store to store on any given day at a higher rate than 15%, so I do not think such an exemption would be noticeable or likely to lead to any change consumer behavior, and is not justified due to the deadweight loss such an exemption would generate.

Submission to Tax Working Group - Dated 12 April 2018 Submitters: Kath & Pat Blewman --------------------------------------------- Background We are a retired couple in our seventies. We own our home which is mortgage free. We have income from NZ Superannuation and investments from savings. These savings have been accumulated during our working life and from a payout of an employer superannuation fund. (I (Pat), as the breadwinner of the family, belonged to a defined benefit superannuation scheme which my employer wound up, after my retirement, with a lump-sum payment to all beneficiaries.) Our income has reduced over the last ten years due to interest rates significantly reducing and inflation which fortunately has been reasonably low. We have been married for over fifty years, have three adult children and eight grand-children. We would consider ourselves a traditional family of our generation. I (Pat) retired as a business executive for a global corporation and experienced redundancy once in my working life. Kath was the homemaker and nurturer of the family until our children left home. She studied for a business diploma and worked for some years before we both retired. (We have been retired for fifteen years.) Summary 1. we support the introduction of a comprehensive capital gains tax excluding the family home. The calculation of capital gains tax to be made and paid on the realisation of assets. 2. we do not support the introduction of a wealth tax paid annually. 3. we support retaining no exemptions to GST ie keep it simple. 4. we support the charging of GST for all purchases of goods and services off-shore. 5. we support the taxing of all the commercial activities of charitable organisations. 6. we don't understand why Maori Corporations/Trusts have a more favourable tax rate than others. If it was some incentive to build such enterprises, then maybe the time has come to review whether the need still exists. (Maybe this is covered by our view that all commercial activities of charitable organisations should be taxed.) Commentary 1. Capital Gains Tax - we feel a comprehensive capital gains tax on the realisation of all assets excluding the family home is a better arrangement than today where gains on the sale of assets depend on your intention at the time of purchasing the asset. We realise it will be difficult to \[1\] implement but once established, coverage of unintended consequences and/or work-arounds can be implemented later. 2. Wealth Tax - we realise there are several forms of wealth tax but assume the favoured one being considered would be an annual tax on assets. We think there are several problems with this form of taxation. It seems to us to be a disincentive to save for retirement. Also, it erodes the asset base for retirees on which they depend to earn income. There may be difficulties paying such a tax annually as some elderly are asset rich but cash poor. Currently, some aged people have difficulty paying Local Body rates because they are cash poor. Additionally, it seems unfair as it seems like a double tax ie paying tax on the income earned and on the value of the assets used to earn the income or paying tax on income used to accumulate savings. 3. GST - as per point 3 in our Summary. 4. GST - as per point 4 in our Summary. 5. Commercial Activities of Charitable Organisations - we suspect many of our small business organisations and maybe even bigger ones, find it difficult to compete with charitable organisations who undertake commercial activities as they have a taxation advantage. Maybe they should pay full tax and get an exemption for profits expended on charitable activities. 6. Maori Corporations/ Trusts - as per point 6 in our Summary. Kath & Pat Blewman

Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Proposal to amend the existing tax brackets. 11 April 2018 Executive Summary: Taxation is a tool that can influence behaviour and provide the correct conditions within the economy for growth and productivity. The existing broad base system in relation to tax on earnings from salary and wages is excellent. With a slight tweak it would deliver a higher economic output and reduced negative behaviour of individuals within the system due to the current tax brackets and treatment at Work and Income NZ. This would include introducing a zero tax brackets for individuals to encourage low income earners and recipients of government transfers to productively join the workforce. This band would exclude income received from governmental transfers and income from business (e.g. self-employment, shareholders salaries with deductions). This in turn would lead to better short-term employment solutions for both individuals and businesses, increasing productivity within the economy and developing skills for future employment opportunities for these individuals. Secondary benefits in provide employment experience to new and returning workers would also improve outcomes. The Problem: The existing broad base tax system is international recognised as being ‘fair’ when it is applied to income that is tax at source (PAYE, RWT and scheduler payments). This is then influenced negatively when it includs other sources of income which allows a higher level of deductibility and assessability issues, like the capital gain on a rental property. This is a problem which is NOT being addressed in this paper. The problem I wish to address is that of the unproductive workforce that chose not to engage within the labour market due to their perception of their value in the market place or situations that will be detrimental to them in the long term. In this paper I will use three examples: 1. Qualified professional (accountant/ lawyer) who has had a break from their professional to have and/or raise children. Married with a good family income so does not need to immediately return to the workforce. This person was earning significant income prior to exiting the workforce and would happily work part time but not for the money that is on offer from employers for part time roles. They have a huge amount of skill and expertise that would benefit business in both productivity, management and growth. 2. Retired individuals who have good mobility and skills that would work in part time employment to supplement their retirement savings and/or government transfer (superannuation). This person would have great skills to cover shortages or seasonal work but chooses not to work or re-enter the workforce due to the value of their earning with the implementation of secondary taxation and the level of earnings they will receive (minimum wage). 3. Individual receiving the unemployment benefit (government transfer) who is actively looking for full time employment. This individual would happily work part time or seasonally while looking for full time employment but cannot accept those positions as they will then have a six week stand down on their benefit. They require this money and are forced into the position of not being able to work productively within the economy due to the stand down. These three examples are all people whom would actively participate in the workforce, adding value to the economy should the value of their contribution be more fairly taxed. The Solution: The proposed solution to get individuals to enter the workforce is to amend the existing tax brackets for income from employment. The existing tax brackets are: The proposed tax brackets: For employment income The proposed tax bracket will be for employment income that has deduction at source. Other income (governmental transfers, self-employment, investment, business etc.) will be taxed in full at the lowest tax rate of 12%. 0 14,000 10.5% 14,000 48,000 17.5% 48,000 70,000 30.0% 70,000 + 33.0% 0 5,000 0.0% 5,000 14,000 12.0% 14,000 48,000 20.0% 48,000 70,000 25.0% 70,000 150,000 33.0% 150,000 + 35.0% This tax free employment income would also not be treated as income for the entitlements that individuals would receive from Work and Income New Zealand. This proposal is to encourage those not engaged in the workforce to enter the market and productively contribute to the economy. If we use the examples as provided we can see the additional benefit. Example 1: The person is happy to work for a business knowing that the hourly rate for the first $5,000 is exactly what they will earn. They feel better rewarded for their contribution and have a vast amount of skill and experience that will benefit the business. This is a hugely under-utilized section of the workforce that are not included in the unemployment numbers as they are not actively seeking employment. They would work and this proposal will help achieve that. Example 2: As noted above the individual have skills and experience that is desirable but due to the inconvenience of the existing taxation system (secondary tax) and tax brackets they do not feel that the earnings are worth the effort. This segment is perfect for seasonal work and part time employment. They would be able to full regional shortfalls e.g. driving school buses due and provide depth for employers e.g. filling in for staff on holiday which remains an issue for employers. Example 3: This person wants to work and would happily take short term rolls if it did not impact the benefits that they are entitled to. In this case the individual would be able to undertake an activity like fruit picking for the six week season without the concern that it would impact their benefit. They also know that the income will not be taxed at source and the income they receive will be fully theirs, therefore encouraging them to seek these opportunities. In these three examples people whom would not normally engage in the workforce would be able to undertake part time or seasonal employment. They would contribute to the economy and provide valuable resources to businesses. As the unemployment rate continues to drop will be essential for productivity. It will also improve their perception on the fairness of the tax system. The added benefit is that these segments as identified (specifically example 1 and 3) would be gaining valuable experience and could be encouraged to return to the workforce or secure permanent jobs. Therefore, the taxation system at this level would be seen to be fairer and encourage productivity within the economy of those people whom currently feel excluded. The Numbers: The impact of the changes in taxable revenue in gross terms is minor. Using the 2016 data from Inland Revenue (1) we can determine this as detailed below. We are unable to calculate the impact of the other assessable income from governmental transfers ($20 + billion) and business income on the non-taxable tax bracket as these will still be taxed. Currently there are 579,000 (2) individuals receiving benefits and 514,276 (3) receiving super. This conservatively that would be an additional $864m of taxation collected which is excluded from the below calculations. Current State: From the below table we can see that the 2016 individual tax assessed was $31.226 billion. 2016 Individual Taxation Tax Brackets Rate No. Taxpayers Tax Assessed Average Average Average % $ (M) % Tax Assessed Income Rate - - 10.5% 98,000 2.7% - 0.0% - - - 14,000 10.5% 698,340 18.9% 505.7 1.6% 724 6,897 10.5% 14,000 48,000 17.5% 1,693,560 45.9% 6,311.9 20.1% 3,727 26,897 13.9% 48,000 70,000 30.0% 581,140 15.8% 6,056.4 19.3% 10,422 58,005 18.0% 70,000 + 33.0% 616,050 16.7% 18,462.5 58.9% 29,969 118,331 25.3% 3,687,090 31,336.5 70,000 150,000 522,380 14.2% 11,354.8 36.2% 21,737 93,384 23.3% 150,000 + 93,670 2.5% 7,107.7 22.7% 75,880 257,455 29.5% Proposed State: The table reflects a drop in the taxation assessed by $586 million, but this as explained above does not include government transfers that would have an additional $1,080 tax assessed on those individuals receiving them. This is estimated at least $864 million. Nor does it seek to quantify the business income that would also be tax fully therefore the government would actually see a minor tax increase from this. Tax Brackets Rate No. Taxpayers Tax Assessed Average Average Average % $ (M) % Tax Assessed Income Rate - 5,000 0.0% 364,840 9.9% - 0.0% - - 5,000 14,000 12.0% 431,500 11.7% 250.5 0.8% 581 9,838 5.9% 14,000 48,000 20.0% 1,693,560 45.9% 6,197.5 20.2% 3,659 26,897 13.6% 48,000 70,000 25.0% 581,140 15.8% 6,033.0 19.6% 10,381 58,005 17.9% 70,000 150,000 33.0% 522,380 14.2% 11,020.5 35.8% 21,097 93,384 22.6% 150,000 + 35.0% 93,670 2.5% 7,249.1 23.6% 77,389 257,455 30.1% 3,687,090 30,750.5 It would increase the burden for the top tax bracket which already carry the highest contribution, which may be seen as unfair by some. Although under the existing political environment this may be seen as desirable. Conclusion: The existing broad based taxation system is working and delivers into the government 40.2% of its revenue from individual taxation. A tax system should also be a tool to influence productivity within an economy. This in turn will delivery greater revenue from business activities (company tax) and consumption tax (GST) for the government. The existing taxation brackets limit the productivity from a number of segments in the workforce due to the taxation effect on their perceived value and the impact on benefits at WINZ. This could be removed with providing a tax-free level of income (proposed $5,000) that would encourage people to join the workforce. The benefits for the examples as noted above together with other segments e.g. students would provide a resource for business and add additional people into the workforce. Some of which has great skills and experience and others that can provide the necessary short-term labour for tasks such as fruit picking that is required. This will bring other benefits such as an employee being recognised as a “keeper” and retaining a full-time position and provided valuable experience for those entering or returning to the work force. This will lead to a fairer tax system and increase productivity with in the New Zealand economy. Philip Rance About the author: I hold a B.com in accounting and finance and am a Charted Accountant.

TAX WORKING GROUP SUBMISSION Subject : Superannuation (SUPER) Entitlements and taxation. There has been much political discussion on STATE pensions and eligibility. I believe that the WINZ (MSD) organisation on this hugely expensive benefit is rort with inconsistencies, & the tax collected is much less than it should be. The recent report from OECD on NZ being least generous for pensioners is obvious with a universal simple entitlement. Some of the issues I believe exist are: •Initial entitlement for SUPER The local MSD branches seem only capable of explaining and action the basic SUPER benefit. They do not go into a person's other pension details both private & overseas that make up their total pension income. The Wellington MSD International from my experience dealing with foreign state pensions are incapable of proper administration. They are administratively inefficient and start to action penalty notices on the assumptions that Foreign pensions are not paid into their Westpac Bank account. They later on profusely apologise for their errors! My wife ( a Kiwi) was charged for non-payment penalty well over $1000 to be paid within 10 days in the new year. I wrote to them explaining both our British pensions were in my Westpac account, but they didn't take any notice of it before charging for the non-payment! They took 3 months to sort out their errors. I can provide our Client Nos. •New Immigrants over age 65 Immigrants arriving over age 65 should not be allowed SUPER or trade-in from foreign pensions. They have to be individually dealt with separately as to their income & assets from overseas and what their family here are contributing. •Non Residents Persons living permanently abroad should NOT be entitled to any SUPER. If they are TAX residents of a country abroad they also should not be entitled to NZ SUPER. Only tax residents of NZ should receive SUPER. •Deceased persons Deceased persons over a reasonable time say 4 weeks since their passing have their SUPER ceased. Penalties apply from then on. It's up to their next of kin to inform WINZ/MSD. •Pro-rata entitlement The policy of British & commonwealth country pensions NHI paying for their SUPER should be urgently reviewed. The fact is the NHI pension is made up of a basic pay ( equivalent to SUPER) and contributions made ( similar to KiwiSaver). MSD do not recognise this breakdown. It is all taxed 100% and not recognised money received from abroad by IRD! It is separately transferred to a secret Westpac account – why? British born & Kiwis worked abroad in the UK are unhappy about this policy. No wonder many do not declare this which is widespread. Instead, the TOTAL of all income such as kiwisave pensions (private & SUPER) & foreign pensions(currently taxed 100% in return to receive SUPER) should all be paid to MSD into their Westpac account and taxed before distributing to the individuals.(PAYE). That will ensure it is taxed for all SUPER entitlements including foreign and private pension & annuities correctly for everyone. Superannuitants should NOT have to record payment by payment & exchange rate which MSD deduct currently from NZ SUPER when opted-out. •Possible Solutions for discussion SUPER eligibility should be longer periods and pro-rated e.g. in Britain the full entitlement is 42 years. Ours is 10 years ( or less). It could increase gradually to 25+ years and pro-rated. •Checks on SUPER residents are in NZ All super residents should receive a letter with a stamped address return envelope from MSD checking ( say every 2 years ) that they live at that NZ address entitles them continue with SUPER. MSD has them a resident here, asking for a reply and confirmation of their address. If there is no reply then another follow-up and if no reply to that reminder letter then SUPER ceases. They can reapply in person or their power of Attorney is asked to reapply to MSD. Many of them may have deceased and the money is unaccounted in various bank accounts which should be claimed back. Residents absent for being abroad on holiday with a permanent residence in NZ should not affect their SUPER, if they are away up to one year, as the checks above will be effective. If they move abroad then SUPER ceases. •Tax only in NZ Where people have lived and been taxed abroad, but are now a resident in NZ, then they should be applying for taxed only in NZ (e.g. HMRC Double Taxation UK/NZ ). IRD should advise and insist on this to enable NZ to get the benefit. Other country immigrants need to comply to paying tax only in NZ and if receiving a foreign pension are treated in the same way. •Simplify Tax returns (IR3) Retirees are mainly on fixed incomes and should not need to fill in tax returns, even though it's an obligation to do so. Mostly they are incapable of understanding it and cannot afford to employ Accountants. The information is all available for IRD/MSD to automate it. All other pension incomes should separately be shown on MyIRD if it was collected and recorded by MSD together with PAYE taxation deducted. Each person should be asked by MSD of changes to their income annually, such as dividends & rentals etc. so it can simply be adjusted where necessary, and a recalculation for auto-refunds for overpaid tax, as well as adjusting the PAYE system to claim back underpayments. •RECOMMENATION I believe the pension entitlement should be much fairer than the current system. The tax collection on Pensions & annuities needs to be automated. The politicians must decide collectively the affordability of SUPER and the retirement age. The Tax Working Group needs to make many of these issues happen for a satisfactory change! I would appreciate their time on these matters. Dated 16 th April, 2018

I spent over half my working life as a Probation Officer. I also worked for 10 years in the Disability Sector as a Support Worker primarily with people who have an intellectual disability, just before retiring. Currently I am active as volunteer in the Voluntary Sector, helping out at a Forest& Bird reserve and also at an organic garden based in the Porirua area that provides opportunities for young people with learning disabilities to do some voluntary work. I have observed in my work how our present tax system unfairly penalizes low paid people. Also I have observed how the Benefit System leaves people feeling under valued and victimized because of issues they have little control over. My Primary Recommendations in terms of future tax policies are as follows: A Universal Basic Income that is given tax free A tax on wealth (or assets) A removal of the tax free status of Family Trusts GST changes Universal Basic Income: This would benefit primarily low income people and would be a good strategy for the Government to tackle the poverty issue. The present Benefit system creates barriers to people moving between paid work and the benefit system. Much paid work currently is short term and poorly paid. There is no security of tenure for those taking up a new position or even those who have been in a job for a longish time. You never know when you are likely to be made redundant. Applying for a benefit is a humiliating process, but once a person is on it, it provides more security for many than jobs that are for offer. The UBI provides a seamless transition between paid work and reliance on the State for one’s income. It also provides an opportunity for people to undertake voluntary work without a likely threat to have to look for work. It is non-judgmental of people’s choices of lifestyle but values everybody’s contribution. The present Benefit system and how it leaves people feeling about themselves is a major contributing factor to many addiction problems our society is faced with. Long term unemployment has a devastating effect on families and individuals struggling with it. As a probation officer I noticed the quick rise in the crime rate during and after the 1980s and the prevalence of multiple drug addictions affecting people’s lives. If we don’t address the present system in positive ways we are sitting on a time bomb that one day is likely to go off \[1\] Tax on Wealth(assets): Gareth Morgan advocates this. As he has often said in the past the nature of his income has meant that he had to pay little or no tax, which he agrees is hardly fair. Alongside this he advocates reducing income tax by as much as 30%. He believes and I agree that this would benefit as much as 80% of people and place the burden of tax where it belongs. We hear about bludgers in society, and it is usually the poor on benefits who receive this title. I believe the wealthy are the real bludgers. They get lots of handouts from Government and try as hard as they can to avoid paying tax. A wealth tax would ensure that they don’t get such an easy ride. Family Trusts and other such mechanisms: This is where the wealthy hide their wealth from the tax man. This practice needs to stop and what is placed in trusts needs to be taxed the same as the rest of our income and assets. GST GST is a tax that disadvantages people on low incomes, because none of their income is not impacted by it. They don’t have any excess each pay period. Currently businesses are able to claim back much of the GST they pay on their expenses. If this ability was removed the level at which GST is imposed could be lowered. If this was to happen low income people could in effect receive a tax cut, which would be fairer for all. It may be that some of my proposals are too much for the present Government to tackle. Feedback from the greedy during the election campaign frightened this Government from making this review as wide reaching as was originally envisaged. I believe that the people of New Zealand are looking for a new vision from their political leaders, something that will excite them as we have seen in our past. Have the courage to step forward and lead us into a new and better way than we have at the moment.

For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Five key questions for you to consider Bullet Points.  “Tax” in this document includes national government revenue and local government rates.  Currently wrong generic approach to tax – it should be “tax what you don’t want and don’t tax what you want”.  Basically one form of taxation, resource rentals, with land as the central resource, along with ecosystem services and universal basic income, and essentially no other taxes.  Full cost accounting  Common resources to be communal, with rewards from personal and business use of them to be shared equally.  Sustainable resource use.  Increasing user-pays above a basic as-of-right level of necessities of life.  Simple, automatically self-regulating, socially, environmentally and economically enhancing – a very much simplified tax and benefit system.  Capital Gains Tax is a flawed approach – it’s “push-pull”.  Those who profit monetarily from community investment in infrastructure should pay the most tax. What does the future of tax look like to you? Our world is changing. So how can we pass on a tax system that will continue to support future generations? The most sensible tax basic is that you tax what you don’t want (pollution, abusive resource use, social degradation, economic manipulation, etc) and don’t tax what you want (work, productive activity, investment, improvements, etc). I contend that there are continual problems with taxation from one government to the next over many decades, because the approach to tax, economics, social structures and the environment have been fundamentally flawed and captured by big business for their own purposes. The approach suggested below is a joining of three separate strands: Resource rentals with land as the central resource, ecosystem services and universal basic income. These have all been known about for a long time – Henry George and others – but aren’t usually seen as a complete combined approach. The resources of the world are not limitless, so renewable resource use must only be at sustainable levels, including full cost accounting and no externalization, or very carefully used and recycled where possible with non-renewable resources. Common resources need to be the property of the whole community, not of individuals or businesses. (Land, water, radio frequencies, fisheries, etc.) Overall tax burden to be as fair as possible in that, within sustainable limits, those who use more of our common resources for their own personal or business use pay the actual value of that use back to the community. Those who lessen their use of common resources pay less. Resource rentals for revenue would replace local body rates and national taxes. Everyone has a right to a living amount of basic resources at a very low price (such as power and water). All use of resources beyond the basic level needs to be taxed at an increasing rate to discourage overuse and encourage sustainable and innovative use of resources. This is a major way that people and businesses can choose to reduce their tax, automatically reducing the impacts of costs on the economy, society and the environment. “You pay for what you take, not what you make.” “In Progress and Poverty, George examines various proposed strategies to prevent business depressions, unemployment and poverty, but finds them unsatisfactory. As an alternative he proposes his own solution: a single tax on land values. George defines land as "all natural materials, forces, and opportunities," as everything "that is freely supplied by nature." George's primary fiscal tool was a land value tax on the annual value of land held as private property. It would be high enough to end other taxes, especially upon labor and production, to provide limitless beneficial public investment in services such as transportation, since public investment is reflected in land value, and to provide social services such as a basic income. George argued that a land value tax would give landowners an incentive to use well located land in a productive way, thereby increasing demand for labor and creating wealth. This shift in the bargaining balance between resource owners and laborers would raise the general level of wages and ensure no one need suffer poverty. A land value tax would, among other things, also end urban sprawl, tenant farming, homelessness, and the cultivation of low value monoculture on high value land.” (Wikipedia) It also means that those who most profit from infrastructure improvements, paid for by the community through rates and general taxation, pay a higher location value tax, which in turn pays for the infrastructure. Much of the government’s need for tax is to pay for wanted or desirable activities and to mitigate costs and damage to society, environment and the economy, so, a tax approach which embodies both true cost accounting and self-modified behavior (by individuals and businesses) that automatically reduces damaging impacts on resources, society and economy must be a simpler and better way of doing things. Some form of embodiment of ecosystem services (where improvements to environmental quality bring a reduction in tax to pay) to encourage active enhancement of the environment and renewable resources beyond the effect of resource rentals. Another way costs to society are lowered and people can actively reduce the tax they pay. Capital Gains tax doesn’t work because it has a push-pull nature – besides taxing increase in the value of the land, it also taxes increase in quality of improvements, having a discouraging effect on investing in improvements. There should be just a land (location) value tax which encourages proper use. The ongoing, day-to-day nature of a tax on location value of land gives a continual signal to the market to invest productively rather than speculatively. All of this would in general put New Zealand businesses ahead of the coming need internationally for just these approaches, while actually increasing their profits currently. Universal basic income for all as a part of the resource rentals approach – a direct dividend to each person from the personal and business use of our common resources. Reduces social welfare administration hugely, with just a “modification” function left, such things as accommodation supplements and special needs, and it decreases the whole stigma and stress involved with benefits. While overall tax take would be set to cover governmental needs, in this approach, most people would pay less tax than they pay now, and the super wealthy, who essentially pay no tax relative to their earnings would have to pay their fair share of tax, or lessen their impact on resources. Tax administration would be very simple and tax avoidance and resource speculation and hoarding would essentially be impossible, because the resources are in plain sight (especially land) and it would be virtually impossible to “play” the tax system and avoid paying your fair share, while building-in the encouragement for legally minimizing tax owed in ways that have automatically good outcomes for the economy, society and environment. There would be less cost to running government as people would be healthier, there would be more productivity, there would be much less crime and much less environmental costs, along with a drastically reduced tax and social welfare infrastructure. What is the purpose of tax? Fair and equitable use of and access to all the elements of life and a sharing in the fruits of participating in society and the use of our common resources, in ways that sustain and enhance the common physical, social and economic resources and discouraging economic hoarding of resources. In New Zealand we like to keep tax simple. But should we be asking more of tax? A resource rentals approach can be as simple as focusing just on the location value of land, along with other resource rentals – no income tax, no business tax, no GST, no complex exceptions, etc, etc, just sustainable resource rentals with location value of land at the centre. This much simpler approach can be shown to bring most of the economy into an easier, fairer and more environmentally friendly state. Are we taxing the right things? Around 30 cents in every dollar made in New Zealand goes on tax. Is it going on the right things? See other responses. Can tax make housing more affordable? Making housing affordable is one of the biggest challenges we face. Does tax have a role to play? With resource rentals there would be an inbuilt, automatic encouragement to downsize dwellings and land use (to self-reduce resource tax to pay), and a discouraging of price-increasing speculation, along with location value of land providing the funds for the infrastructure of developments and incentives to live in less high location-value regions (that is, live and work more regionally). What tax issues matter most to you? Whether you are doing your weekly shop, checking out your bank balance or making future plans - tax affects you. Fair and equitable and environmentally protective and enhancing. There is much detailed information on land value taxation and related issues at www.prosper.org.au/ and other places. The Tax Working Group's paper calling for submissions explicitly seeks views on whether there could be items exempt from GST in order to benefit low income people If the current tax system is in operation, yes, GST needs to be exempt from GST in order to benefit low income people.

For example, it justifies taxing products purchased overseas on the internet. It justifies taxing multinationals in relation to their in- country earnings. But such a concept can only be taken so far. Fairness lies in the eyes of the beholder. What is fair to one tax payer is not necessarily fair to another. But I do think that a critical aspect of fairness is to ask whether, from the point of view of an individual tax payer, the amount of tax they are paying is perceived by them to be fair. That is particularly the case if that tax payer already is part of the minority who pays the majority of the tax (as I am). 2 The paper notes (page 20) that a progressive tax system is perceived to be fair in New Zealand. I agree - but it would be wrong to think that is a perception without limit. As things presently stand, a minority pays the majority of tax. Increasing the burden on that minority is not necessarily fair. 3 I oppose a wealth tax. It is no coincidence that such taxes are disappearing around the world. Issues with a wealth tax include: • What assets are to be taxed? If it is a wide range including collectables then there will be high transaction costs (e.g. valuations) associated with this. • Conversely, if certain asset groups are excluded then this will be distortionary and create perverse incentives. • How do you determine ownership of the relevant wealth particularly when assets are held in discretionary trusts? • What do you do about the wealth represented in Iwi settlements and holdings? • Such a tax would penalise asset-rich/cash-poor individuals particularly the recently retired. It will act as a disincentive to saving for retirement. • We already have a wealth tax in the form of local authority rates based on land values. 4 A land tax is a more focused form of wealth tax. Similar problems arise as above. Two extra points: • The use of bright line tests in relation to land speculation is likely to capture most land speculation. • Land may be held (e.g. land banked) for a variety of reasons and not necessarily for speculation. For example, land may be held within a family for historical/sentimental reasons (analogous to the holding of Maori land). 5 I am opposed to extending a capital gains tax beyond the bright-line tests already in existence. Some of the problems with a wealth tax also apply to a capital gains tax. For example: • What assets do you include in the taxable pool? \[1\] 2 • What assets should be included/excluded? Paintings, stamp collections, antiques present numerous definitional problems. At what point is someone’s furniture to be classified as an antique if antiques are to be included in the pool? 6 Excluding the family home and land from a capital gains tax is extremely distortionary. • It favours those who own their family house in a city such as Auckland. A family who owns a $3m house in Herne Bay is better off, from a tax point of view, than a family in Christchurch who owns three separate properties each worth $1m. • How do you define the land upon which a house sits? In the case of a lifestyle block which is at the minimum sub-divisible size, does that include all of the land or some notional area? If the latter, how do you value the rest of the land when it cannot, as a matter of law, be sold? • The distortionary effect created by the exception means there can be no fair CGT on land generally (as opposed to the bright-line tests already in existence). • The proposals do not address land held through family trusts including the primary residential house if held in a family trust. 7 I believe that charities should, as a default rule, pay tax. In particular, religious charities should pay tax. There is no conceivable benefit in commercial operations (e.g. Sanitarium) being tax exempt. 8 There should be no exemptions for GST. Creating exemptions is entirely distortionary with the costs outweighing any benefits. 9 Superannuation paid in the Cook Islands and Niue should be taxed in New Zealand. As a concession to those two countries the Government has waived the payment of tax in New Zealand and, as I understand it, tax is not paid on these pensions in the country of receipt. This results in substantial transfers off-shore. 10 I support the removal of secondary tax for those working at two or more jobs (particularly where the nature of primary and secondary employment no longer seems valid). 11 I support environmental taxes. Those creating the externality should pay to remedy it. Tom Weston \[1\]

The Council supports a first principles approach to the review of New Zealand’s tax however is disappointed that local authority property rates has been excluded from the tax review. Local authority property rates are used to fund critical community infrastructure that has a direct impact on fiscal adequacy for local government; the effective tax rates of individuals and businesses; the disposable income for households (particularly low income households); housing affordability; and the coherence of the wider tax system. Purposes and principles of a good tax system Council supports the use of efficiency, equity and fairness, revenue integrity, fiscal adequacy, compliance administration costs and coherence as the core principles for assessing the performance of the New Zealand’s tax system. However, the exclusion of local authority rates from consideration within the wider tax system has significant implications for both equity and fairness, fiscal adequacy and the wider coherence of the tax system. Land tax Local authority property rates are a land tax rather than fee for service in that there is not a direct linkage between the level of rates and benefits accrued to the owner. In 1996 the Court of Appeal considered that the then rating system was “primarily a taxation system and not a system inherently based on a principle of user-pays” 1 . The Local Government (Rating) Act 2002 largely maintained the existing principles of rating found in earlier legislation. Local authority land taxes fund a significant proportion (58%, $5.5 billion) of local communities’ critical infrastructure and services. While central government is not currently directly funded by land taxes 2 , local authority land taxes equate to approximately 6% of the combined taxation at both national and local government level. Council considers that the exclusion of local authority land taxes from the Tax Working Group’s wider consideration of tax significantly undermines the consideration of the coherence and equity and fairness of the wider New Zealand tax system and the effective implementation of central government’s social policies. 1 pg 12, Woolworths New Zealand Ltd (No 2) \[1996\] 2 NZLR 537 (CA) 2 Councils are required to charge GST on property rates which is a goods and services tax on a land tax. 2 In 2010, the Victoria University Tax Working Group 3 considered the use of land taxes at a central government level. While a land tax has benefits around ease of administration and compliance, a land tax disproportionately affects some groups of people, including retirees, Māori authorities and farmers who have a disproportionate asset to income ratio. An example of where excluding local authority land taxes distorts the coherence, equity and fairness of the wider tax system are the tax obligations for property owners on low and fixed incomes such as those on the New Zealand superannuation scheme. The superannuation scheme is predicated on a universal income based on the minimum wage and minus mortgage repayments as it generally assumes that superannuitants are freehold property owners 4 . This income is then taxed by central government on the basis that it constitutes an income. While central government income taxes equate to approximately 13% for single income households and 12% for dual income households – when considering local authority land taxes, the effective tax rate for those superannuitants owning a home rises to approximately 21% and 17% respectively (see Table 1). Table 1 – Effective Rate of Tax for Superannuitants for Central Government Income and Local Government Property Taxes Superannuation – 2017/18 Single (Living alone) Couple Amount Effective Tax Rate (Gross income) Amount Effective Tax Rate (Gross income) Income (Gross) $23,405.20 $35,443.20 Central Government - Income Tax $3,115.91 13.31% $4,227.60 11.93% Local Government - Land Tax (Property Rates 5 ) $2,514 10.74% $2,514 7.09% Rates Rebate Scheme 6 $620 -2.65% $620 -1.75% Total Income and Property Tax $5,009.91 21.41% $6,121.60 17.27% In considering ways to mitigate the adverse impact of land taxes on land owners, the Victoria University Tax Working Group identified three options: the deferment of taxes until the sale of the property or death; reducing the burden of a land tax on extensive land intensive activities; and the ability to offset land taxes against other taxes 7 . Local authorities have already implemented the first two options in various ways, however, the third option requires central government action. 3 Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group.

Retrieved from https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/centres-and-institutes/cagtr/pdf/tax-report-website.pdf 4 Based on 2013 census, superannuitants have a higher proportion of home ownership (76%) compared to the wider population (50%). 5 Based on ‘average’ property rates for Whanganui District contained within the 2017/18 Annual Plan and excludes regional property rates. 6 Rates rebate applies to total local body rates which includes territorial and regional council property rates. 7 pg 45, Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group. (2010) A tax system for New Zealand’s Future. Retrieved from https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/centres-and-institutes/cagtr/pdf/tax-report-website.pdf 3 Council recommends that the tax working group consider the implementation of the Victoria University Tax Working Group to allow local authority land taxes to be off-set against other forms of tax liabilities. These could initially be trialled to target low income households and replace the existing rates rebate scheme. This would effectively maintain the total level of taxation for both central and local government at the level set by central government. Fiscal adequacy for Local Government Council considers that the inclusion of the funding of local government through property tax in the Tax Working Group’s work programme would allow further discussion around alternative or supplementary funding of local government activities through a portion of central government income tax, GST, or bespoke levies such as a regional fuel tax or visitor tax. A discussion on land tax would have allowed a discussion on the non-rateable land contained in Schedule 1 Part 1 of the Act and land partially exempt from rates contained in Part 2. Council considers that the exemption from rates for Crown land should be discussed, as while the principle of a subsidiary body not being able to tax a higher body is long-standing and accepted, this can and does create anomalies for territorial authorities with a significant percentage of Crown land holdings within their boundaries. Council suggests this could be addressed by employing a “PILOT” scheme (Payment In Lieu of Taxes) which operates in Canada and the United States. Under these PILOT schemes the federal government makes payments in lieu of taxes to local governmental entities where the federal government owns land or buildings and this reflects the overlying federal-state- municipal stratifications of government. It is Council’s understanding that within New Zealand a version of a PILOT scheme operated until as late as the 1960s. Other matters As part of the wider consideration of local government taxes, and the adequacy of funding for local authorities, the Tax Working Group should also consider:  A higher hypothecated tax for logging trucks and other vehicles which have a disproportionate impact on local council roads over short periods of time;  The inclusion of volumetric charging for wastewater as a local authority rate in the same way that volumetric charging for potable water is provided for to ensure greater consistency of the application of local taxation; and  Changes to the rates rebate scheme to increase the maximum quantum of rate rebate available to low income property owners and to align the annual increase of the rates rebate to the rise in local authority costs 8 .  The imposition of GST on property rates which is a good and services tax on a land tax.  Allowing the cost of strengthening heritage buildings be to be treated as an expense in the year in which it occurred but with the deduction being ring fenced against rental income. 8 Average increases in Council’s Index of Costs of the last 10 years has been 2.32% (Berl) which is higher than the general rate of CPI increases of 1.87% (Stats NZ). 4 Conclusion Overall Council supports the work of the Tax Working Group and the wider taxation principles. However, Council considers than an opportunity has been missed not to include local government land tax to achieve a comprehensive examination of New Zealand’s tax system and recommends that local authority property rates be considered as part of the discussion on land taxes. Council appreciates the opportunity to provide feedback and would welcome appearing before the tax working group and being part of any ongoing discussion.

NZ Tax review – March 2018 Context: This is a personal submission. I am a Husband, Dad, home owner in Whakatāne, family income around $130 p/a. Just want Whakatāne and New Zealand to fizz, to be awesome, to have opportunities for everyone to access a good quality of life. New Zealand needs more government resource to meet challenges like housing crisis, alcohol and drug harm, climate challenge, health and aging challenges etc. Resource needs to come from somewhere – sausage sizzles won’t cut it. A principled approach: Lets be honest, nobody really likes paying tax. But tax is needed to pay for important services that we all benefit from. I think that Government services need to be improved, to help strengthen and improve outcomes for our communities. Capitalism has no inherent morality beyond profit, sure some level of altruism exists, but we cannot expect trickle-down-economics and the free-market solutions to meet many of the challenges facing New Zealand. Particularly this is the case when many challenges are systemically rooted in our economic system (wealth and wage disparity for example). We need a strong economy to ensure NZ has wealth, we need strong government policy to ensure healthy distribution of that wealth. New Zealand’s taxation review should be considered within the context of overarching principles, and these should be community centric with stronger links to Government’s broader policy agenda and future societal challenges. E.g. think about taxation beyond ‘a means to fund’ and increasingly also as ‘a mechanism to achieve outcomes’. In this way the practice of taxation itself can become even more so a tool towards achieving outcomes directly, as well as being a funding mechanism. Low hanging fruit could provide instant opportunities. This includes looking at the potential of existing tax structures which are already in place and therefore would have lower administrative costs to implement (in particular alcohol and petrol tax – see below). I encourage you to be bold, observe what our nation needs to be stronger, listen to your heart, and be critical of the underlying principles of those that oppose taxation increase (i.e. generally this relates to their own pocket). Redistribution of tax liability towards where the wealth is: The maturity of capitalism is producing an ever-growing wealth divide, with far more concentration of wealth to a very small portion of society. This will become increasingly unsustainable. Tax changes can help to redistribute benefits just a little bit more evenly across society. I am not sure what this could look like - maybe not UBI, the world is not ready for this, but changing the tax brackets would be a good start including less tax at the low end (or stretch the 10.5% tax bracket out to say $20,000) and more tax at the higher end. In particular increase the 33% tax and introduce a new tax bracket at for the $120,000 plus. I understand we also need more discipline towards corporate tax – but I don’t have any understanding or insight into this. I am sure it is something you will be considering. While not a taxation related comment, this suggestion also comes with the need for a perception shift towards the value of work versus the value of time contributed e.g. why is one persons 40 hour work week worth so much more or less than that of another person? Everyone works hard and wants to provide for their families. Each commit the same unit of their time for a job that needs to be done. I am not suggesting equalisation, simply looking for ways to redistribute wealth from the top, to where it is needed. A rebalance, for a healthier society. E.g. is the contribution of the CE and the shareholders really worth so much more than the factory workers and shop assistants? Market based salaries appear to perpetuate the problem because those in power – the higher paid positions are ultimate responsible for setting the balance of remuneration. Consider for example a flat percentage based increase across all salaries in a company – say 10%. That seems fair, everyone gets ten percent... but in dollar terms 10% is much more for someone who is already on $150,000 a year compared to someone on minimum wage, and who actually needs the money more (why not a dollar based increase so that everyone goes up at the same rate in real terms and the wealth gap stays the same). The same principle applies to taxation – yes look at percentages but remember to look at the dollar impact too. Specific taxation opportunities: Alcohol tax: I strongly believe this should be increased. I enjoy a drink, who doesn’t, well Mormons I guess. But extra tax on alcohol is an absolute must. Alcohol has such a huge cost (social and monetary) in our society. I understand that there are arguments that taxation increases don’t necessarily make big inroads to changing consumption behaviour, but if not, at least it raises revenue that can be used to combat the impacts of alcohol. The revenue would easily have direct linkages back into many government departments – health, road safety, crime, education etc. Do it now - leave the tax at lower rates for consumption of alcohol at bars and pubs where policies and standards are in place to help manage consumption behaviours. Petrol tax: I see you have already signalled an increase in petrol tax. Well done! Totally agree – again, potentially an incentive to support increase in alternative transport modes (hybrid, electric, public transport, walking, cycling). Also the same point that this raises much needed revenue in the transport, road safety, and alternative transport space. Sugar tax: I am not sure whether this would be administratively possible. Sugar tax could change consumption patterns, it could also change production patterns with companies working to keep sugar levels under certain taxation thresholds. Again, it would increase government revenue to tackle related health issues. Capital gains tax: No capital gains tax on your principle property (family home). Otherwise get on with it already . Thanks, that’s all. Be Brave! Regards, Wouter Vullings \[1\]

Submission to the Tax Working Group by Hon David Butcher Responses to the Working Group Background Paper \[1\] Introduction Thank you for the opportunity to make a submission on the best tax regime for New Zealand. The Tax Working Group Background paper analyses the merits and gaps remaining in New Zealand’s approach to raising government revenue. Past governments have bequeathed New Zealand with one of the best taxation systems in the world from the points of view of fairness, simplicity, efficiency, but it is capable of improvement, particularly in spreading the base of taxation to include wealth and property. My submission follows the layout of the background paper. My intention is to draw attention to the major issues and to recommend more detailed studies where my personal experience cannot offer an informed opinion. Future environment This section seeks comments on the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system, how the system should evolve to address them and how tikanga Māori could help create a more future focussed tax system? The background paper lists perceived risks to the system from changing demographics and fiscal pressures, the changing nature of work, the growth of self-employment, the threat to the tax bases, from technology, company tax pressures, environmental challenges, concerns about inequality, and changing patterns of globalisation. Other issues that need to be considered include: the effectiveness of taxes on income on the one hand and the lack of attention to inheritance and gratuitous wealth accumulation on the other. The last thirty years has seen many tax expenditures (or deductions against tax liability) removed from the tax law, but bids to reintroduce new ones remain a threat to the tax base. The most disappointing aspect of the system is that some of the nation’s poorest citizens pay the highest effective marginal tax rates, particularly when incomes are a mixture of tax and benefit. If there are moves to increase the taxation of wealth, including land, the unique problems associated with collectively owned, usually Maori land need to be addressed. ‘ Overall, the working group should be aware of the need to ensure the various taxation methods are mutually reinforcing and minimise opportunities for arbitrage, i.e. moving income from a company to private taxation streams. Purposes and principles of a good tax system This section seeks comments on principles used to assess the performance of the tax system and comment on the definition of ‘fairness’ in the context of the tax system? What would a fair tax system look like? Good System The background paper provides the standard test for the quality of a tax system: • Efficiency: Taxes should minimise their cost on society, be neutral among investments options, unless justifiable. • Equity and fairness: Horizontally: treat equally taxpayers in similar circumstances and Vertically equity (fair treatment of those with differing abilities to pay tax). • Revenue integrity: Taxes should minimise tax avoidance and tax arbitrage and provide a sustainable revenue base for the government; • Fiscal adequacy: Sufficient revenue should be raised to meet government expenditure. • Costs: Costs of complying with the system and administering it should be kept to a minimum. • Certainty: taxpayers should know the tax due. • Coherence: Individual tax measures should reinforce the effectiveness of the whole system. Ramsey Pricing The issue is how can taxes be extracted from the economy with efficiency, equity, integrity, adequacy, certainty and coherently at the lowest possible cost. Similar issues are raised in regulatory economics. RAMSEY PRICING states that for any monopoly, the price mark-up should be inverse to the price elasticity of demand: the more elastic demand for the product, the smaller the price mark-up. This principle was originally recognized by Frank P. Ramsey who maintained that the efficiency of taxation is increased by adopting a similar rule for taxation: the tax collector is the monopoly collector and citizens are the consumers. The principle is that taxes are most efficient when taxpayers have a limited ability to avoid tax by switching purchases to alternatives. Ease of administration and simplicity of definition of the tax base are critical elements of a good system. The Working-group will recall the derision heaped upon the opposition’s X-tax proposal at the 1987 election. The principal reason was the potential it offered to complicate collection, increase cost of collection and create definition problems: e.g. cake is tax free (food), chocolate is not (confectionary); what about a chocolate cake?). In those parts of the World where similar sales taxes remain in place and in India where a more complex system has recently been agreed, they are essentially the system New Zealand abolished in 1986. In those days when ever New Zealanders bought something a “helpful” friend would say: “You should have told me, I could have got it for you at the wholesale price!” New Zealand’s ‘broad-based, low-rate’ system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, is widely regarded as a system that is probably as close as any others to exhibiting the characteristics of a good system. For this reason, it is difficult to increase efficiency, or fairness. The current mix of direct and indirect taxation has been in place for over thirty years and few practical alternatives have ever been suggested. Accordingly, much attention should be focused on improving compliance and coverage. However, while New Zealand’s mix of taxes is one of the best it can be added to. Below are suggestions regarding taxation of wealth and property and ensuring the system is progressive. Looking to the future, it is my submission that our current mix of indirect and direct taxes remains the approach that best achieves efficiency, equity, integrity, adequacy, certainty and coherence at the lowest possible cost, although it could be enhanced further by taxation of large accumulations of wealth and property, thereby ensuring the whole system is progressive. Behaviour Modification Taxes that intentionally modify behaviour, whether it be discouraging the use of tobacco, sugary drinks, alcohol or even petrol for cars are best applied as excise duties (so-called “sin” taxes). Duties are separate from the Pay as you earn (PAYE) aspects of the system. Their base is clear, the revenue collected can be counted easily and increasing them (or decreasing) them can be debated sensibly without undermining other aspects of the system. Similarly, in 1989 New Zealand moved to a system of TTE for long-term savings: savings are made from Tax-paid income; savings and investment funds are Taxed as they earn profits as are other businesses; the proceeds of the fund are tax Exempt when withdraw as are other business sales. Some recent research 1 has linked TTE to New Zealanders’ fondness for investment in housing rather than other forms of saving and have maintained that this is behind the rapid increase in house prices. It is shown that other countries use an EET (Exempt, Exempt, Taxed) system and New Zealand is unusual. The evidence for this claim weak is weak as many of the nations with EET systems have also suffered rapid price increases for housing although those in New Zealand have been larger. My recommendation would be that the research be examined, maybe in conversation with its author and if considered worthy of further investigation, additional research should be commissioned. 1 Tax reform and the housing market - Andrew Coleman – presentation to Law and Economics Meetings in Auckland and Wellington, March 2018 Results of the current system This section asks if the current system strikes the right balance between productive and speculative activities and if not, what changes should happen? It also refers to the costs on business and the maintenance of natural capital. It further goes on to ask if there are businesses benefiting from low effective tax rates because of excessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income? False Distinction There are many issues involved in this section. My first comment is that the distinction between “productive and speculative” is unhelpful. It is reminiscent of a comment by a member of Parliament in 1989 “If it is tangible and essential we should produce it.” His statement overlooked the necessity for any unsubsidised business activity to make a profit. A focus on TANGIBILITY was the attitude that led to butter mountains in Europe, freezing chambers full of sheep meat that could not be sold and subsidising the conversion of excess supplies of meat into blood and bone fertiliser in the early 1980s. All these items met the test of tangibility and essential, but many were far from profitable or sensible to produce in the quantities achieved. Similarly, talking about “productive” creates a bias in favour of tangible production and manufacturing activities as opposed after sale services and ongoing consumables. The trend in manufacturing is for production of tangible goods, e.g. printers to be a commodity and the associated maintenance, updating, training and other services to be the principal revenue stream 2 . Arbitrage There are many people who would regard any “arbitrage” buying items or properties cheap and selling them on at a profit as speculative and believe all such speculation should be discouraged. This language carries an implicit assumption that anyone selling an item that someone else can sell for a higher price is being “ripped off”. There are of course examples of people lacking market information making unwise decisions to sell below what something is worth to some other party. By contrast, there are billions of day-to-day examples of people trading, for example, currencies, where both parties are reasonably well-informed, and transactions only take place where both parties believe the transaction will meet their immediate needs and make each of them better off from their own perspective. Taxation of Trading Furthermore, it is important to realise that in the mind of the buyer what they intend to do with an item is an important consideration when deciding to buy it. An example is when Post Bank was sold for NZ$600 million in 1988. The bank had been all-but bankrupt, had lost market share and but corporatization was gradually halting the decline. However, Ministers were told that the purchaser, ANZ Bank had recently installed a new computer system and it had extensive spare capacity. By offering a higher price for Post Bank, ANZ immediately transferred all customers to the one system and made better use of its own system with very little capital expenditure. All other bidders would have had to invest in a whole new system, so it was a commercial decision to bid more to win the company and increase the use of the new system. There is no conceivable policy to ensure that nobody ever makes and mistake and there is little or no way the tax system can improved that situation 3 . What the question should be focusing is: how to ensure that all profits from trading activities are within the taxation net. If the issue is put in this way, then it may be possible for the experts in collecting taxes to identify ways of improving the current 2 In 1990, my first laser printer cost me $4000. Recently, a Canon Printer with far greater capacity and flexibility cost $69! However, the cartridges for the printer cost $50 each, which is where the manufacturer makes money. 3 The prize must go to the Antiques Roadshow case of a person who gifted a plant in an old vase to a charity shop, which a lucky buyer bought for £1, the new owner had the vase assessed and it sold at auction for £26,000! collection system. The various devices being proposed for collecting GST from internet purchases are examples using modern technology to broaden the base of the system. The government should be encouraged to ask officials and expert to research the taxation of trading (including houses, foreign exchange and other traded items) and report back. Tax Expenditures My first experience with tax expenditures was when I took out an endowment policy in 1974 as part of my retirement plan. I obtained a tax deduction, part paying for the policy premiums. Colleagues at the meat works could not afford an endowment policy and consequently got no support at all for their retirement plans. Using a tax deduction to subsidise the retirement plans of the rich was contrary to an equitable tax system. The deduction for insurance premiums was abolished in by the Lange Government in 1984-5. The obscenest example of this approach is in the USA today. Thanks to long-standing tax deductions for interest paid on mortgages, Hollywood Millionaires get deductions against their tax liability for the interest they pay. This encourages them to buy fabulous mansions, utilising hundreds of thousands of $ of tax deduction subsidy to do so. The people on benefits who got housing mortgages to buy their humble 2-bedroom homes, before the GFC, would have smaller mortgages, relatively smaller interest payments and got next to nothing. The most recent tax changes have eliminated subsidies for public housing. Tax relief for the interest the rich pay on borrowed money to buy their homes remains in place. Rebates not Deductions This unfair result is an argument for any “assistance” to be paid as a REBATE. A rebate is a defined amount paid to parties that qualify. To quote the first example, with a DEDUCTION the taxpayer with superannuation or insurance of $000’s would get far more support than my former colleagues who had either a tiny retirement superannuation fund or none. With a cash REBATE, the assistance to both parties would have been identical and proportionately more beneficial to the poor. Public understanding of this effect is very low. I recall reading a letter to the editor in which an elderly couple promised to vote against the Kirk government because the first Rowling Budget changed their “spouse” deduction (then about $280 against tax). They claimed it had been “reduced” to a $150 rebate. In fact, of course they were much better off with the rebate as it is probable their tax would have been at the low end of the scale and they would have got the full benefit of the rebate. Any switch to rebates of this kind would need to be associated with a wide public information programme. Rebates can also be a precursor of a Universal Basic Income (UBI). I am aware that a UBI is beyond the scope of the working-group’s mission. However, it is a clear example of ensuring that the system is coherent, and all aspects point in the direction of confining assistance to those who need it most. Business Deductions A further example of the same principle is the raft of incentives and deductions that existed in the Muldoon era before 1984. Until 1984, there was little, or no attention focused on the issue of tax expenditure. The 1984, budget was the first to address the issue and provided a table with estimates of the revenue lost for each deduction, many of them related to farm land. They were significant contributors to the rapid increase in the value of farm land in the early 1980s. In the period 1984 to 1990 many of the tax expenditures, including most of those for farming, were removed. This was an important reform and was widely ignored by academic studies and pro-poor commentators. The importance of it can be seen from the experience of a relative who worked as a recruiter for the Statistics Household Expenditure Survey. In the Rodney district of Auckland, she visited house after house with large rooms on two or more floors, Range Rovers and Jaguars in the garage next to the tennis court and swimming pool. By claiming all the above items as business expenses (e.g. the pool was described as a reservoir in case of fire) at that time the taxpayer received 66 cents in the dollar deduction against their normal professional income for every $1 spent. The owners of the Range Rovers did have taxable incomes, most less than $1000, and at that time managed to qualify for low income assistance. One famous commentator claimed they were living in poverty because of their low taxable incomes. Rich and Influential One of the remaining threats to the tax base, is that the rich and the influential will lobby strongly to have deductions reintroduced. The rich and influential can afford to hire lawyers, accountants and lobbyists. The representatives of the poor cannot. Relatively low rates of tax and equality of tax rates between businesses and private individuals made the benefits of lobbying relatively low and much tax evasion though business expense deductions ceased to be a worthwhile activity. Unfortunately, when the personal maximum tax rate was raised to 39%, with the intention of increasing the progressivity of the system, the evasion business was resurrected, and the outcome was the opposite of the one intended. It increased the value of many deductions. My suggestion is that further work be commissioned to narrow the scope of the remaining tax expenditures and where assistance is to be delivered it should be by way of rebate so that all taxpayers qualify. Thinking outside the current system This section focuses on inconsistencies with the current tax system and seeks advice on how the priority to address them. Apart from the issues addressed above the main inconsistencies in the current tax system are three and it is important to address all three: (1) There is a major disparity between the effectiveness of taxes on income on the one hand and lack of attention to total wealth, inheritance and gratuitous wealth accumulation on the other; (2) Effective marginal tax rates: some of the poorest citizens in New Zealand pay the highest effective marginal tax rates. (3) The various methods of taxation need to be mutually reinforcing to minimise opportunities for arbitrage, i.e. moving income from a company to private taxation streams. Taxes on Wealth Until 1991, New Zealand had a Land Tax System. The scope of the tax was expanded in 1989, as the 1987 international crash had caused a revenue shortfall, although the abolition of the system was promised for 1991. The “new” taxpayers, people who had never been asked to pay it previously were generally outraged as the government had been focusing on reducing direct tax rates for the reasons outlined above and saw the sudden new tax invoice as backtracking on the previous policy. For this reason, while the case to address the taxation of wealth accumulation is strong it is something that must be carefully managed. The case for such taxes is set out very clearly in Fabian Tract 388 4 and there is good reason to anticipate that the situation in the United Kingdom in 1968 was worse than it is in New Zealand today and is probably worse than that now in the United Kingdom. Essentially, the case made is that much wealth is stored in assets that are underused, paintings, jewels, mansions and elaborate vehicles and leisure goods. It proposed a very low tax on such property, starting at per annum levy of 1 percent on wealth of exceeding approximately $2 million in today’s money, rising to a maximum of 5 percent for accumulations of wealth above $ 20 million. This would be combined with a presumption that any asset not declared is not owned and would be returned to the revenue authorities. To ensure widespread acceptance of the tax the individual exemption would be sufficiently high to exclude the entire middle class and focus on the small group of owners of wealth, often inherited through no effort of the current owner. It would not raise much revenue initially, but every year that passes would increase the number of people affected. It would encourage those affected to dispose of property they under-use, which in turn would be acquired by others who will make better use of it. 4 The case for Capital Taxes; Fabian Tract 388 (1968) by Oliver Stutchbury https://digital.library.lse.ac.uk/objects/lse:rof509gen accessed 19-04-2018 In my view such a tax would be easier to administer, easier to calculate and be more certain in application that a capital gains tax. As a further part of the implementation package there could be pledge not to introduce a capital gains tax. A further step to win acceptance of a wealth tax would be a further a reduction in company tax to the level of our trading partners would also be welcomed widely. Should the government at some stage open the possibility of moving from taxation of income to assets, the existence of a wealth tax would make the adjustment easier. The practicality of the proposed wealth tax would need further study, but would score very highly in improving the coherence of the system. High Marginal Tax Rates One impediment for people moving from a benefit to paid work is the fact that some beneficiaries with housing allowances, can soon be in the position of paying an effective tax rate of more than 100% of any additional earnings. If a taxpayer is simultaneously paying ordinary taxes and losing the whole or part of a current benefit it is inevitable that the effective tax rate will be higher than any taxpayer earning the same amount from employment alone or on a benefit alone. A standard rebate is one way to address this problem. The UBI simply takes the concept much further. It is not an easy problem to address, but our experience with Working for Families is instructive. A Family tax credit (FTC) is paid regardless of the source of income. In-work tax credit (IWTC) is an additional payment for families who normally work a minimum number of hours each week for salary and wages but are still on very low incomes. Detailed research is required into how a system based on standard rebates can be improved to ensure that families receive sufficient incomes and have sufficient incentives to undertaken paid when it is available. Progressive Income Taxes In the mid-1960 and 1970s the author worked in the Tomoana Freezing Works in his summer holidays. His father worked in the same shed and managed to persuade the leading hands to find places for him in the midday gang (to clean after the morning’s work) and the late gang (to clean after the day’s work concluded). In the 1975 Budget the Minister of Finance, the late Bob Tizard put in place a multiple step scale of taxes on income, collected through the PAYE system. The PAYE assesses each week’s pay as though the amount earned that week would be representative of every working week of the year. His colleagues, whose main employment was the meat works, complained incessantly of the “Tax on Overtime”. Many of those who grumbled about overtime tax took off to Australia. However, there was no specific tax on overtime. Should the amount of PAYE tax collected amount to more than the taxpayer’s total liability, the person affected should submit a return and receive a refund. But, some of the workers were there were illiterate or had no access to anyone who could help them fill out their return. Consequently, many lost any interest in the midday gang and the late gang. What this showed me was that using the PAYE scale to create a progressive system could be counter- productive for the poor or people uneducated in the finer points of tax returns. What is important is for the tax system as whole to be progressive. The number of steps in the scale should be few and the top rate should be internationally competitive. All people able to work for a living should be encouraged to do so and penalised as little as possible by high rates on increments. By contrast, tax “perks” and deductions described above should be the tools to make the system progressive. Specific challenges Submissions have been asked to include responses to certain specific challenges. The following table sets out the specific questions asked and my responses. Question Response How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? Traditionally, the tax system has treated investment in housing as a normal investment. Given the limited opportunities to invest in near sovereign quality investments housing is one of the few options available to savers. Allowing savers to invest in harbours, roads and local power companies will create other investment options Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have? A capital gains tax is not supported because it will generate little revenue and is very complex for taxpayers and advisers. It is also easy to avoid. A wealth tax would be more effective. Combined with a generous exemption for all taxpayers, would ensure that the super-rich, particularly those with inherited wealth are the principal payers Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? Land should be one of the aspects of wealth included in the wealth tax proposed above. As noted above the introduction of a wealth tax would need to be managed very carefully and as far as possible should be revenue neutral. This means that an important function of the wealth tax would be spreading wealth more evenly rather than revenue collection alone. What are the main opportunities for effective environmental taxation? The guiding principle should be that parties that pollute pay sufficient penalties to clean up the mess, or preferably that an arrangement beforehand ensures that pollution does not occur: an example all water intakes for industry should be located downstream of effluent outfalls. Should the tax system do more to support small businesses? Is there a case for a progressive company tax? Until 1967 this was the case. The arguments for its elimination were strong then and remain strong now. A better alternative would be a limited tax credit or rebate for new business ventures, available to people moving into the private sector. Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from GST? If so, what should be excluded? What else should be taxed to make up for the lost revenue? Exclusions add cost, inconvenience, administration and definitional problems: cake is tax free (food), chocolate is not (confectionary); what about a chocolate cake? One of the benefits of the current system is that we do not have these problems Conclusion This submission has addressed both the merits and gaps remaining in New Zealand’s approach to raising government revenue. Past governments have left us with one of the simplest and best taxation systems in the world from the points of view of fairness, simplicity, efficiency. Some improvements have been suggested and some suggestions have been criticised. The system is capable of improvement, particularly in spreading the base of taxation to include wealth and property. However, consistency greatly eases the administration of the system. My intention has been to draw attention to the major issues and to recommend more detailed studies where my personal experience cannot offer an informed opinion. Hon David Butcher \[1\]
Tax Working Group Public Submissions Information Release Release Document September 2018 taxworkingroup.govt.nz/key-documents Key to sections of the Official Information Act 1982 under which information has been withheld. Certain information in this document has been withheld under one or more of the following sections of the Official Information Act, as applicable: \[1\] 9(2)(a) - to protect the privacy of natural persons, including deceased people; \[2\] 9(2)(k) - to prevent the disclosure of official information for improper gain or improper advantage. Where information has been withheld, a numbered reference to the applicable section of the Official Information Act has been made, as listed above. For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. An Interim Prescription There is a long explanation, but a precis of the conclusion I reach needs to be here at the outset or the submission is apt to be misunderstood. I am available in Wellington and would be pleased to speak with the tax working group on this subject if that is requested. I have previously discussed housing with Dr Cullen in correspondence and am content to offer written responses to questions as well. Within the terms of reference: 1.Employ a Land Tax and Capital Gains tax for revenue and to encourage local investment. 2.Reduce or remove GST to the extent possible. Differentiate between necessary and optional expenses. This has proven to work in other countries, we should not have to debate whether or not it will. 3.Use a system of Fee and Rebate to replace the Carbon Credits market system and make the cost of CO2 an inescapable consequence of emissions. Use the border adjustment to encourage local production. 4.Allow the farmers who are working hard to mitigate their impact and planting trees on riverbanks to count those trees in consideration of their tax liabilities 5.Use tax policy to encourage desirable behaviour and discourage undesirable practices. 6.Look to the Scandinavian countries for examples, not to Great Britain and the USA. Outside the terms of reference additional tax rates/tiers/brackets and a more progressive income tax arrangement are required to complete the removal of the GST. The arrangements we currently have are extremely flawed in this respect and people are attempting to lock in their advantages. Self- interest is a poor basis for any cohesive civilized society. What follows is a reasoning of the basis of these recommendations. It is as short as I can make and still have it make sense. I will happily respond to written questions as well. The current externality, the long emergency In the period between now and 2030 the single most important change in our economy will not be our economy (unless we foul up by the numbers) but the environment that supports it. Increasing climate instability will hit every nation on the planet and a significant price will be applied to the global emissions of CO2. The probability of this approaches unity. At even $100 per tonne emitted this will cut our trade with the rest of the world in half. This externality needs to be considered as we contemplate changes to encourage growth in different sectors and the financial future of this nation. The clear implication is that we as a nation need to guide investment in and development of, sectors that are NOT currently economical where trade is currently easy. In addition our sources of computer chips, bearings, electric motors, disk drives, power supplies and the rest of the hardware and infrastructure supporting our current civilization, are in countries that are at risk of becoming failed states when the full effects of climate change (the full risk of this is considerable but impossible to quantify) arrive. Sea level rise is accelerating. Temperature changes may be accelerating. Emissions are still accelerating. Nearly every road we have hugs our coastline. Much of our infrastructure is at risk. We cannot afford to build everything here, but we would be wise to arrange to have the ability to bootstrap anything here. Research facilities for Universities are suggested as a means to have abilities that are not commercially viable otherwise. The current system rewards speculation in land, penalizes (relatively) investment in locally productive enterprises and encourages ever increasing wealth inequality. It is a pattern common in the English Speaking members of the OECD and it is particularly disadvantageous to New Zealand owing to our distance from other markets and any rational expectation of global reactions to the changed climate. The section that follows this is background information that explains the underlying philosophy and understanding. I feel it useful to include it. Dr Cullen once asked me about details of it before it had been fully formed (a submission on some other issue), and I feel I owe him the more complete answer. Real Money represents Work Done That’s a heading, a thesis and the topic of a book. It explains much, defines money for economists, cures physics envy by making economics a science and defines what taxes we ought to be paying on what and to whom. If taken on fully, the only reason to have taxes would be to discourage bad behaviour, but as the man advised - “well if I wanted to be going there I wouldn’t be starting from here”. Mainstream economists and in particular those of the Chicago school, will be appalled. Economists like Steve Keen will (one hopes) be delighted. Why is Real Money related to Physics Every human is born with a potential for work that is defined by every single chance and choice made being optimal for them alone. This is diminished throughout life as sub-optimal choices are made and chances are taken. It never increases. If you are hungry at 3 you suffer that diminished potential. The work that we ourselves do is the fundamental source of our individual understanding of value. You are the only one who can decide the value of doing work, and you are the only one directly affected by the weariness, hunger and fatigue that ensues. This is the work that underlies the concept of money, and “Real Money” represents it. It is real work done and the laws of physics are brought to bear. A Fisherman and a Baker meet. They exchange goods directly, five loaves and two fish. How did they know it was 2 fish, not 3 or 1 and how did they determine it was 5 loaves, not 4 or 6? There is neither a market nor societal money (“coin of the realm”) involved here. Barter is the most fundamental form of trade and it underlies all trade. They evaluated what things were worth to them without either the market or the money. The loaves and fish are products of “Work Done”. When they trade directly because of a coincidence of wants, they are in the very purest sense exchanging their work for someone else’s work. The subjective value of the fish and the loaves, is understood in terms of their own real work. This is the underlying form that “Real Money” must represent. This work that we as humans have in only limited and ever diminishing supply as individuals, is the basis of real money. Societal money (the “coin of the realm”) when it is done correctly, is an abstraction of real work done that is not dependent on who does the work. It is based on a trust that it can always be exchanged for the real work of individuals. It is an abstraction of work that has to follow the same laws of physics that all work must follow. Debt backed money is an abstraction of a promise of real work done (with interest). Promises are not limited by the same rules that apply to work, and not bound to the laws of physics. The debt backed money is almost right, but in the words of Henry Ward Beecher “Whatever is almost true is quite false and among the most dangerous of errors, because being so near truth, it is more likely to lead astray” Every dollar in every wallet in every pocket of every person in every city in every country on the planet represents debt. That debt attracts interest, which is money that can only be created as additional debt, borrowed to fund additional consumption. The global economy is now roughly Two Hundred Fifty TRILLION dollars astray, and a the inequality in wealth is such that fewer than a hundred individuals possess the same amount of wealth than the lesser half of all of humanity, while the promises are made to be broken and the environmental damage of unlimited consumption it theoretically creates is a debt our children cannot default on. To say that this is broken is almost unnecessary but I will say it. This is broken. Some folks think it is OK of course, they would be the ones who have control of that money right now. A revolting situation which explains why so many people are revolting (Trump, Brexit). Where does Societal money need to come from and what it needs to do and be It comes from the society of course. It is Fiat currency and there’s not a blessed thing wrong with that if it is made to represent real money and the rules of physics are made to apply. For a society the work done by the society in every form that work is done or collected, is a target for the amount of money to be kept in circulation for the society to function. More yields inflation, less yields deflation. We can ask engineers to come up with an appropriate number. Do not ask mainstream economists. It has to be issued into circulation in some manner. Some would be Universal Basic Income, the rest would be loans at no interest. This alters the way business is done and investments are made immensely. As a side note: In respect to Cryptocurrency this entails a limitation, that the government may define and use a form of currency resembling Bitcoin but it can never actually accept an international unit as part of its currency system. It is a store of value in the same way a block of gold or sack of diamonds can be a store of value but its availability is unrelated to work done. If it comes from the society and it is not debt backed it still may or may not be redeemable. A redeemable currency enhances trust but redeemable in what? I suggest that the KwH is an appropriate commodity if only because it provides us with many tools for analysis and understanding directly and because it is, literally, a physical definition of work and something anyone can produce. However, if one imagines the KwH in place of money there are a couple of interesting issues that have to be obvious to the engineers. 10 KwH won’t produce an eleventh KwH. Not ever. The implication of this reaches very deep into our economics. We do not make money by owning things. We cannot make money from money. The money we create has to reduce in value over time, rather than attracting interest. The laws and taxes that we implement, have to all work together to discourage making money from ownership. Making money by having money may be “the way the world works”, but it is quite recent in our evolution, and it ignores the theft from future generations that is inherent in the process. You can’t actually break the laws of physics, all you can do is break everything else. What will happen if you try to store that 100 KwH is interesting too. You will never get back the 100, you may get 99.9 or 99, or 90 but you never, ever, break even, over a long time you may simply get back nothing at all. Finally, money has a very definite amount that can be supported. If it comes from private banks a very different scheme is necessary, as the bank’s current use of interest is impossible and unsupportable. So our basic form of development changes from private borrowing that profits the bankers, to an interest free loan system that allows the maintenance and improvement of infrastructure. The government (society) has to have control over how much money is in circulation (and in this a block-chain currency might well prove useful, but it would be New Zealand’s own and the technology to do THAT hasn’t been developed). Summary: •Money representing physical work done and subject to the laws of physics. •Money issuance controlled by government. •Money quantity controlled by government according to work done in/by New Zealand. •Zero interest loans as part of the issuing scheme. •Universal Basic Income as part of the issuing scheme •Banks unable to print money on demand. •No requirement for tax. Government spending is taken out before the issuance of money in loans or UBI. •An argument for a nationally based block-chain currency. •Limitations on the ability to make money from owning things. That’s a bit too much in one bite for any government to do. It surely cannot happen without substantial changes to the information environment of a population where the Overton window has been purposely and maliciously dragged over to the vacant lot to the right of our real home. The implication for tax Since we bit off a very very big bite we are going to have to chew ferociously if we are to gain traction for the current questions. It is not after all, in the terms of reference to change the entire economic system of the planet. The purpose of taxes is to support the Society. The purpose of Society is properly to enable the people to do collectively what they cannot do as individuals. The Society itself decides those goals and I submit here that the model of minimizing the State while supporting free-market based self- interested competition for everything, is an error for any Society. We humans are social animals. We do not survive best in groups of one. We in fact have evolved for millions of years as cooperative groups and that is how we best manage ourselves as we politically and socially exceed the limitations of Dunbar’s number to form larger (a survival positive consideration) social groups. The cooperative model (Swedish) rather than the competitive model (American) leads to the happiest outcomes in human societies. The confused model (New Zealanders aping American mistakes), is not something we should be continuing. A tax system that does not overtly incentivise good behaviour, tacitly supports misbehaviour. Our tax system should in fact support more and better services for our citizens and be a larger percentage of our Gross Distorted Product. When people feel that they are getting value for money, they do not mind a fair tax. The current system provides extreme levels of tax advantage to ownership of capital and land rather than actual labour. In this respect and in consideration of the externalities, we need both a government and a tax system that encourages local investments in an independent, long-term-sustainable, and technologically competent society. THIS government needs to work to prepare the nation for a very ominous worst case climate disruption, and a tripling of the effective distance to foreign markets. New Zealand cannot afford to be dependent on single product exports OR on imports, a fact that has been demonstrated numerous times in our history. It will soon be necessary to again have an independent economy ( or permit nuclear powered ships to dock here). The emphasis on “free trade” as the answer our problems is an error. Ricardo, with his implicit assumption that a wine press could become a textile mill simply by changing its name made it first. Reaganomics and Rogernomics merely repeated it. There is no “free”. The costs become debts paid by future generations, effectively an immoral (Jefferson) obligation to force on them. Normal debts can be defaulted, but the environmental debts resulting from our current behaviour are governed by the implacable laws of physics. Our supermarkets stock Applesauce from Holland and Denmark and China but not from NZ? Our tax system enables this tacitly by not heavily taxing CO2, including imports. We are not prepared. Our tax system must be part of the larger process by which government addresses all these issues. As shown earlier, if money is properly defined only the behaviour modifying taxes remain and they should form no part of the government revenue stream. We haven’t fixed the monetary system though, so our taxes need to reflect the same requirements and values as closely as we can manage. Land Tax and Capital Gains To reduce the advantages of ownership, we should aim to discourage investment/speculation in property and encourage investment and development of supporting industrial capability here in NZ. This is a familiar story for both the Greens and NZ First. Both Land and Capital Gains taxes help to encourage local production. Local production! This leads to the specific recommendation that we adopt a Land Tax. Both Land Tax and Capital Gains taxes are welcome but the Land Value Tax is preferred. We may have to exclude the “family home” to be make it palatable, but it was recommended by the LAST tax commission and ignored by government then. If this examination also recommends it we may, finally, obtain some relief from Real Estate lobbyists and the addiction to this mal-investment. Detailed discussions of how a Land Tax can be fairly implemented and the impact on the nation’s “retiree landlords” mitigated are not part of this presentation. There are many sources of such information from Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Henry George through to the present day and I expect that the details are better left to people who spend their lives on this sort of thing. According to Wiki there are forms of LVT in Denmark, Estonia, Lithuania, Russia, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. My personal view is that the notion of MY owning something that existed a million years before my birth and which will consume my mortal remains and digest them unnoticed over the next million, is a nonsense. I am at best a steward of this place while I am here. It is all any of us really are, and on current form we are failing miserably at that job. Put another way, the Society owns the land, and while I may obtain a lifetime lease I still have to pay the rent myself and I have to keep it in good condition for the next tenant. Why reduce or modify GST There is always some fool who will assert that GST is not regressive. This is offensive in the extreme to those of us who pay it on every cent we earn because we have to spend every cent we earn, while we watch as others bank and invest their surplus to obtain even more dosh without working at all (see the discussion of the applicability of the laws of thermodynamics above). It is not enough to force a revolution, but it is definitely enough to cause revulsion. With our 15% flat rate we have a higher tax on books and food and culture than Sweden, which applies 25% on other things but drops it to the lower rates on things that are necessary to its people. It is thus already quite high but it is even higher when the tax MIX is considered. Sweden has an actually progressive income tax system. The top income tax rate is effectively over 56% so the GST as a percentage of the overall take is smaller. Their Tax-to-GDP ratio is 44% while ours is 32% and falling. We are still heading in the direction of being “Mexicans with Cellphones” with deteriorating infrastructure while systems in Sweden actually work and people like the result. Here we’ve attempted to follow the US model, to cut both taxes and government, “starve the beast” and follow the societally suicidal neoliberal prescriptions of the 1980’s. The result of that is a deteriorating and inadequate infrastructure, poorly supported education and health systems, desperately inadequate provisions of services for the poorest among us and ever widening social division. The breakup of the state into smaller units is still a distant future, but for us “Wealth transfer” is “bad” and in some significant subset of the population “Greed is good” and that breakup is inevitable if we continue to follow the US model that says “Greed is Good”. It isn’t. It is still one of the seven deadly sins and the USA is about ready now, to demonstrate just how bad it is. Another decade, not more than two, for the unthinkable. Carbon Taxes Rather than continuing and struggling to understand the carbon credits and the market built around them which permits companies to attempt to offset their emissions by purchasing credits and by the way giving the people running the markets to punch the tickets and collect fees, the simpler and more direct imposition of a CO2 emission tax which is directly rebated to the residents and citizens of New Zealand. Note too how this works into the local consumption and production needs. We should not have any government revenue be dependent on the CO2 tax as it is intentionally expected to be a diminishing amount over time. We want it to go to zero. Because New Zealand must count up the CO2 absorbed by its agricultural sector, the planting of trees and maintenance of forests is work we have to be willing to pay for. The current arrangement of Carbon Credits and counting does not correctly appreciate the work done by farmers. Direct payment for long term sequestration of Carbon is an alternative which could be developed. The proposals of the Citizen’s Climate Lobby with respect to this type of taxation is recommended. https://citizensclimatelobby.org/basics-carbon-fee-dividend/ 1. Place a steadily rising fee on fossil fuels To account for the cost of burning fossil fuels, we propose an initial fee of $15/ton on the CO2equivalent emissions of fossil fuels, escalating $10/ton/year, imposed upstream at the mine, well or port of entry. Accounting for the true cost of fossil fuel emissions not only creates a level- playing field for all sources of energy, but also informs consumers of the true cost comparison of various fuels when making purchase decisions. 2. Give 100% of the fees minus administrative costs back to households each month. 100% of the net fees from the carbon fee are held in a Carbon Fees Trust fund and returned directly to households as a monthly dividend. About two-thirds of households will break even or receive more than they would pay in higher prices. This feature will inject billions into the economy, protect family budgets, free households to make independent choices about their energy usage, spur innovation and build aggregate demand for low-carbon products at the consumer level. 3. Use a border adjustment to stop business relocation. Import fees on products imported from countries without a carbon fee, along with rebates to NZ industries exporting to those countries , will discourage businesses from relocating where they can emit more CO2 and motivate other countries to adopt similar carbon pricing policies. Building upon existing tax and trade systems will avoid complex new institutional arrangements. Firms seeking to escape higher energy costs will be discouraged from relocating to non-compliant nations (“leakage”), as their products will be subject to import fees. Conclusion Within the terms of reference: 1.Employ a Land Tax and Capital Gains tax for revenue and to encourage local investment. 2.Reduce or remove GST to the extent possible. Differentiate between necessary and optional expenses. This has proven to work in other countries, we should not have to debate whether or not it will. 3.Use a system of Fee and Rebate to replace the Carbon Credits market system and make the cost of CO2 an inescapable consequence of emissions. Use the border adjustment to encourage local production. 4.Allow the farmers who are working hard to mitigate their impact and planting trees on riverbanks to count those trees in consideration of their tax liabilities 5.Use tax policy to encourage desirable behaviour and discourage undesirable practices. 6.Look to the Scandinavian countries for examples, not to Great Britain and the USA.

Conclusion (page 21) Appendix 1: Capital Adequacy Model Appendix 2: Capital Gains Tax paper (Willy/De Reeper) 2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This submission considers concepts of wealth and capital adequacy from the perspective of retirees who have saved for retirement under the 1988 TTE tax regime (rationalised as the ‘level playing field ‘) which has resulted in dismal levels of savings for retirees basically dependent on Universal National Superannuation that is pitched on an OECD scale as ‘poverty alleviation’. Concepts of capital adequacy are considered and a model used to examine in particular the effects of currency depreciation even at the ‘benign’ inflation targets imposed by government policy on the Reserve Bank, over long timeframes such as working lives and retirement. The submission questions whether it is appropriate to consider retirement savings of TTE regime workers that are clearly inadequate to generate sufficient income for well-being (OECD concept) in retirement, as ‘wealth’ that should be subject to further tax attack under any newly imposed superstructure of ‘wealth’ taxes including capital gains taxes. While Kiwisaver is a nod in the right direction, the government has a responsibility to try harder to encourage and give hope that saving for retirement is a worthwhile goal. Further ‘wealth’ taxes by whatever name, most certainly will not achieve that. 3 INTRODUCTION: 1. Tax and fairness are mutually exclusive concepts: Every one of us has a position on tax swayed by ideology, income, wealth, age, and circumstances, including economists and academics massaging some favoured economic theory , and no doubt those on the Tax Review Group who will protest their determination to strive for equity or fairness. There is nothing ‘fair’ about tax 1 – it is possible to rationalise all final solutions (which simply represent another view on how to pluck the goose so as to obtain the largest amount of feathers with the smallest possible amount of hissing) and in the process, scratch whatever personal itches need soothing. Whether the selected “solution” is acceptable is finally an issue for the electorate. 2. Credibility of the Tax Working Group: Sir Michael Cullen has taken broad measures to promote the review and encourage the widest possible participation, and has 1 The IRD discontinued its slogan “we aim to be fair” when this anomaly was clarified by Judge Anthony Willy who argued there is no equity or fairness about a tax which the government ordains shall be levied on the subject. The IRD conceded the point and discontinued the promotion. 4 taken care in his 2 nd March 2018 overview to the NZ IFA conference in Queenstown and the 14 th March 2018 Submissions Background Paper to outline a wide ranging framework of imperatives, theory, principles and issues, intended to enhance confidence in the process, add legitimacy to the review, and credibility to the Group’s final report, but the process is tainted by his appointment as Chairman of the Group, as The Press editorial 25/11/17 (and other editorials) so succinctly point out. 2 DECLARATION OF INTEREST: 1. Pre-retirement status: With the above allusions to integrity, it is clearly necessary for me to state my position and perspective: I held a management position with a NZ-based private manufacturing and importing company for most of my working life and saved over that time to provide a supplementary income 2 The Christchurch Press editorial in the 25 th November 2017 edition of the paper made a number of points such as “Cullen is many things but a politically independent voice on taxation policy he is not.....so the tax working group will no doubt deliver what the Labour-led Government wants....The tax working group will not be seen to be and independent group of experts...it will be seen to be an in-house Labour-led think tank – regardless of who the other appointees are...The chairman is decisive... terms of reference are selective’ and so forth. This damning indictment makes a charade of the whole exercise, yet in hope, I offer this submission. 5 base to augment National Superannuation (clearly necessary to provide any realistic prospect of reasonable comfort and well- being in retirement years). On that basis I believe the case I make to be representative of a large group of retirees and those who will retire over the next few years. 2. Pre-retirement tax regime: With the more recent exception of Kiwisaver, and some tax tinkering, for example with PIE entities, saving for retirement since the Labour Government taxation review of 1988 has attracted no tax concessions (in contrast with every other OECD country) with the ‘level playing field’ rationale promoted as the justification. So for some thirty years, the only tax incentive workers saving for retirement have had to look forward to was the quid pro quo that the accumulated capital (wealth) would be tax exempt in retirement. Until retirement, tax has been paid at marginal rates on the income from which the savings were derived, and tax has been paid and continues to be paid on the 6 income from those savings - including capital gains taxes at income tax rates if taxpayers are deemed to be traders or tax on deemed dividends from certain investments whether such dividends are declared, paid or not, and we pay GST and other taxes (e.g. petrol/road user, and local body taxes that escalate outrageously every year – all with another dollop of GST on top) on much of whatever we spend from those savings, including spending from the ‘exempt’ tax-paid capital sum. 3. Scope of submission: The emphasis and scope of this submission is therefore to review the tax environment for retirement savings (wealth) and the plight of the retirement sector. ADEQUATE LEVELS OF SAVINGS FOR RETIREMENT: 1. Concepts of capital adequacy: It is a fundamental concept of finance that capital should be nurtured. Capital is the goose that lays the golden eggs. In today’s parlance it should be ‘sustainable’. To draw down on it to meet or help meet living expenses in retirement will diminish it at an increasing rate as its income earning base depletes. Perhaps that is OK if you know how long you are going to live, but 7 otherwise it represents a financial stress not conducive to comfort and well-being, a situation I am sure none of the Tax Working Group would like to contemplate personally. Sustainability of capital requires that it generate sufficient surplus to meet required (living) expenses while maintaining the purchasing power of the capital sum. Reference to statistics of household net worth in NZ makes clear that only a relatively small proportion of households could realistically claim at the date of retirement to have that scale of capital, but it should be a valid parameter in deciding at what level and to what extent the goose might be plucked. 2. Model to test capital adequacy: (i) Assumptions and rationale for displayed iteration: Appendix 1 displays a model that examines capital adequacy in relation to a selection of variables and illustrates important issues impacting on retirees. The model takes a selected level of investable funds at retirement for a couple who own their own home without debt ( a relatively representative situation), and adjusts that sum each year by 8 adding the gross return it achieves to gross income from Universal National Superannuation (less tax on that combined income) and deducts the post-tax scale of living expenses required to meet a standard of comfort and well-being that is related in an internationally relevant way to the pre-retirement income of the couple. The example shown in appendix 1 depicts savings of $500,000 each available to a couple to start a retirement investment fund of $1m. This sum is statistically high when compared with NZ household wealth data and indeed in relation to the preretirement salaries (and potential to save therefrom) attributed to the couple in the displayed iteration, but serves to reinforce the point very clearly that further taxes on ‘wealth’ will not be well received by a large number of taxpayers since a considerable amount of it is required to realistically provide for a morally acceptable level of comfort and security in retirement. The example in the displayed iteration assumes that couple were each earning $60,000pa prior to retirement (a figure around the national average for wages and salaries) and in accordance with conventional financial advice that an income of 70% of 9 preretirement earnings should be sufficient in retirement to provide for a comparable level of comfort and well-being, they set a budget for drawings in the first year of retirement of $70,000, being the tax-paid equivalent of 70% of their preretirement pre-tax salaries. Their budget includes allowance for the essentials – food, clothing, dentist and medical, power and energy costs, fuel and travel costs, rates, property insurance, medical insurance, property and vehicle maintenance, provision for periodic home and property renovation maintenance and periodic vehicle replacement, TV and internet, pets, etc. plus entertainment, holiday costs, and so forth - provided the $70,000 proves sufficient. Rate of Return selected in the displayed model iteration is based on conventional financial wisdom that people in retirement should have a high proportion of investment in monetary assets for reasons of liquidity and risk, etc. (one such criterion, for example, suggests that the age of the retirees indicates the percentage of their retirement fund that should be held in monetary assets but many retirees feel more secure without the risk of holding equities real estate or other ‘risk’ assets). An 10 examination of bank term deposits over the last five years shows averages like 3.58%pa 3 . for 6-month terms, 3.75%pa 4 . for 1-year terms, and 4.17%pa. 5 for 2-year terms. The displayed iteration takes the 3.75% rate. The opening value of Universal Superannuation in the model is the current published pre-tax rate paid to a married couple i.e. $35,443. The sum is CPI inflation adjusted (as a simplified expedient) in subsequent years. The CPI rate of inflation has run at historic lows over the last 5- year period, but official government policy has required the Reserve Bank to engineer monetary policy so as to generate an inflation rate between 1 and 3%pa.- ideally an average of 2.0%pa. For modelling purposes, this iteration gives the bank credit for succeeding in the years to come. Assuming the Reserve Bank does succeed in maintaining the average required inflation rate, the displayed iteration adds a margin to that rate to recognise that the basket of outlays facing retirees is subject to more pronounced price rises than the basket 3 This figure is the an average of the monthly averages in Table B3 RBNZ statistics over the last 5 years to March 2018 4 Figure derived from historical chart over a 5-year timeframe to March 2018 from Interest.co.nz web-site 5 Figure derived from historical chart over a 5-year timeframe to march 2018 from interest.co.nz web-site 11 that comprises the general CPI. This delightful refinement is taken directly from our city council that claims its annual rate increases of several times the inflation rate are caused by this problem 6 , and of course, things like rates, energy, insurance, travel, and medical costs that form a comparatively large component of retirees’ expenses, typically escalate at rates higher than the CPI. You might want to test that assumption but I am sure you will acknowledge in principle the inconvenient rationale for such an adjustment. (ii) Results: The values selected for this iteration of the model result in the capital sum being exhausted within 26 years, so our retirees will be in trouble if they live beyond 90 years of age. You can muck around with changes to the variables (sensitivity testing) but the guts of the problem here is the impact of inflation (even at very low rates) on monetary assets. 6 Average weekly residential rate increases for Christchurch ratepayers have increased by 39.3% over the last five years in comparison to CPI increases of 5.9% over the same period. 12 Inflation has not been tamed but the ability of central banks to control it is limited. We have become complacent about inflation in recent years. In my early working career, a senior manager retired in 1974 after a 40-year lifetime of diligently saving for retirement –including up to 15% of salary into a fixed contribution superannuation scheme after that facility was introduced by the company. The sacrifices made to accumulate this nest-egg made him risk adverse, so his savings including the lump-sum pay-out from the superannuation scheme were invested in bank term-deposits. In the first five years of his retirement, inflation ran at an average 15%pa. On a compound basis, the effect of that inflation was to halve the buying power of 40 years of his saving. Another five years down the track his retirement dollars (if anything was left of them) would buy only 29% of what they could buy at the time of his retirement because the value of the legal tender of the Crown had been depreciated by that extent over that timeframe. The reality was that the viability of his retirement fund had long been decimated. On the other hand, borrowers at the time of his retirement, including the government, had the value of their debts 13 effectively discounted to 29% of their opening value. Depreciation of the nation’s currency is effectively a redistribution of wealth from savers to borrowers without invoking the taxation system. The responsibility for managing the value of the nation’s legal currency rests with the government, though its agent the Reserve Bank. I resolved never to forget that lesson nor underestimate the insidious effects of even modest levels of inflation over longer timeframes. Neither should the Tax Working Group. Real assets on the other hand, in contrast to monetary assets, usually increase in value (as measured by the official legal tender of the realm) so some further discussion of inflation will continue in the following sections of this submission dealing with capital gains and wealth taxes. ‘WEALTH’ AND CAPITAL TAXES OF SPECIAL CONCERN FOR RETIREES: 1. Capital Gains Taxes: Capital gains are an anathema to those of socialist persuasion who would rather see such gains redistributed to labour, and they present an opportunity for economists and academics to argue 14 that prices on assets with untaxed capital-gain potential will be bid higher than for (productive) assets that generate taxable returns. Nowhere does the capital gains tax debate become more inflamed than with the issue of property, where gains on sale seem to be regarded as fortuitous and not the result of honest endeavour (although the property may well have been purchased with the savings from tax-paid income). Both parties are happy to claim that property booms are stimulated by the absence of capital gains taxes. Both positions are overexposed and overrated. Of course, those bleating about the theory of tax advantage wouldn’t utilise that insight for altruistic reasons, but to my knowledge, many retirees prefer property investment to other options simply because it is a tangible investment they feel more familiar with than they do the capital markets where interest returns are too low and equity investment too risky given their comparative lack of expertise in those areas. The reality is that property booms are basically driven by population growth and demand for property exceeding the available supply on the market at that time, driving prices up. 15 There is no evidence that in jurisdictions with capital gains tax regimes, property booms are avoided. There are a lot of administrative and technical difficulties in implementing a capital gains tax regime and to date, thankfully, common sense has prevailed in New Zealand by not introducing such a tax. The ‘pros and cons’ have been rehearsed in many forums over the years and summarised in what is clearly intended to be a ‘definitive’ paper published by the Policy Advice Division of the IRD in conjunction with the New Zealand Treasury, in September 2009. This paper affects an impartial stance but the ‘cons’ are disingenuously tossed off. The issue of the impact of inflation over time on asset prices, for example, which is absolutely at the core of the credibility of a capital gains tax, is accorded half a page in a document of 58 pages:-the difficulties of indexing inflation are noted, some red herrings thrown in, the practical suggestion of some sort of arbitrary exemption offered as a palliative if indeed it was considered necessary to recognise inflation at all. That report (like the current review) was written during a time of relatively benign inflation, and no doubt there would have been 16 moral outrage at that time to discover a property selling for, say, $2,350,000 that had been purchased only five years earlier for $2,000,000, generating a tax-free realised gain of $350,000 without a stitch of honest work having been done for it. An examination of the facts might tell another story. Most important, the “benign’ annual inflation rate over that timeframe nevertheless cumulated to 15.6%, so $312,000 of the $350,000 capital ‘gain’ is solely down to a depreciation in the value of the legal tender of the realm - required by law to be used as a measure of value and exchange - and is not a real gain at all. It would be dishonest and morally reprehensible to tax it as though it was. The responsibility for managing the value of the legal tender of the realm as previously noted, rests with the government through its agent the Reserve Bank. A more wide-ranging and instructive assessment on the merits or otherwise of a capital gains tax is set out in a paper first published in September 2014, written by Judge Anthony Willy and Anthony De Reeper, both eminently qualified to do so, and I have included that paper as part of this submission: refer to Appendix 2. 17 2. Other ‘wealth’ taxes: Wealth (property, retirement savings, etc.) is accumulated by most people over their working life and determines the level of comfort and wellbeing they are able to experience in retirement. Most OECD countries provide tax incentives to encourage saving for retirement. As noted in the ‘Future of Tax’ submissions paper issued by the Tax Working Group, taxation on savings for retirement is considered under three headings: contributions, investment earnings, and withdrawals. These components are accorded the symbols ‘T’ for fully taxed, ‘t’ for concessional tax, ‘E’ for exempt. Twelve OECD nations have an EEt regime; ten have an EET regime; three have an ETT regime; Australia has a ttE regime and New Zealand has a TTE regime. Australian retirement policy has as its aims firstly ensuring all Australians have an adequate and secure income in retirement and secondly, encouraging those in the workforce to save for their retirement to have a higher standard of living than that which would be achieved on the state provided age pension alone. The second objective, while having moved away from ‘income maintenance’ continues to emphasise the importance of ensuring 18 an adequate standard of living in retirement. However, ‘it appears from policy tools adopted since 1988 (the absence of tax incentives together with a universal pension) that the primary object pursued in New Zealand is that of poverty alleviation. 7 There is no doubt that the Australian policy approach has increased household wealth 8 New Zealand’s retirement savings figures and participation in occupational superannuation are among the lowest in the OECD. Australian retirees can expect to have an income of 70 – 80% of their final retirement income, after 40 years of Superannuation Guarantee participation. New Zealand retirees will, assuming National Superannuation continues unchallenged, at a minimum receive 60 – 65% of the average wage. The difference in the standard of living that these amounts will support is significant. Australian retirees will be advantaged with some relationship between their pre-retirement and retirement income, a benefit which retirees in New Zealand will not have. What also cannot be ignored are the economic impacts that are likely to result from 7 Extract from a doctoral thesis by Lisa Marriott entitled ‘The Politics of Retirement Savings Taxation: A Trans- Tasman Comparison’ Victoria University, Wellington, 2008. 8 ibid 19 this, such as the impact of reduced consumption on economic growth, and greater reliance on the state in such areas as health and housing’. 9 So much for the ‘level playing field’ rationale! The absence of tax concessions on retirements savings that 25 other OECD have considered good policy, will of course have increased tax available to NZ governments in the short-term to meet other priorities over most of the three decades that New Zealand has taken advantage of this rationale, while deferring a moral dilemma about its responsibility to facilitate what most advanced economies would consider reasonable levels of comfort and dignity for its retired community. Little wonder, then, that in spite of demographic statistics forecasting an increase in the number of retirees per worker, some politicians retain sufficient embarrassment about that history to insist that the Universal Superannuation entitlement policy not be ambushed, and since its funding has been assisted by the absence of tax concession on the marginal income of all workers but particularly higher paid workers, and its value is 9 Ibid. 20 judged to be at ‘poverty alleviation’ level, it is little wonder there is also a reluctance by those politicians to consider removing its universality. This is particularly pertinent when the dismal statistics of the median level of personal net worth of the 55 to 64 year age group (i.e. those about to start their retirement years) shows a median couple to have a wealth of $556,000 (including the family home) 10 . The 65+ group is higher at $576,000 and since this is a group that would include many who exhaust their savings, it is fair to acknowledge that the median wealth of people age 64 and about to retire at 65 would be considerably higher, but the model results shown in Appendix. 1 suggest that even a starting retirement fund of $1m for a couple (above the value of the family home) may well not be sufficient to support an annual draw-down that provides for a standard of living that relates in any accepted way to the level of income earned prior to retirement. It should be no surprise then, that those employees who saved under the TTE savings regime who consider the ‘exempt’ promise to be a social contract that requires now to be honoured, will not expect to see a superstructure of tax caveats (wealth taxes by 10 Fig.18 page 37 ‘The Future of Tax’ Submission background paper. 21 whatever name) superimposed by the government on their retirement savings - and rightly so, whatever the definition of ‘exempt’ is argued to be. Chairman Cullen raises the spectre of wealth taxes in his Queenstown speech 11 but clearly there is an issue as to whether a fund of savings at retirement that is arguably insufficient to support a standard of living at 70% of pre-retirement income (that includes the universal superannuation entitlement) should be referred to as ‘wealth’. Perhaps the Working Group might agree that wealth is a concept best associated with.....well, rich people. CONCLUSION: The heavily prescribed terms of reference to be considered by the Tax Working Group nevertheless leaves a wide range of issues to consider and this submission deals with only a small though exceptionally important part of that. 11 See for example, ‘Thinking outside our current system’ last para p.9 22 What it seeks to do is to ensure the Tax Working Group is reminded of important considerations that relate to retirement savings and assessment of wealth. In particular, it seeks to remind the Group, with examples, of the enormous impact that even benign rates of inflation (including government policy to change the value of the realm’s currency) have over long timeframes such as retirement. It further questions concepts of wealth and the dismal results generated by the ‘level playing field’ retirement savings regime. Compared with almost every other OECD country where parameters for retirement are considered a priority responsibility of government facilitated through tax policy, in New Zealand, governments since 1988 (with a nod to Kiwisaver and a bit of tax tweaking at the edges) have been satisfied with a policy of poverty alleviation. It raises concern about any proposal to impose further tax drain on retirement capital including capital gains tax and other wealth taxes by whatever name, where that capital is clearly at risk of being unable to provide for internationally recognised levels of comfort, well- being and dignity in retirement. 23 Given the limited scope of this submission there is little utility in suggesting how these issues might be addressed in a balanced way except to note the following concluding comment: The Tax Working Group has effectively been instructed what solutions it is required to rationalise, including a requirement to lift the tax load over a decade from 30% to some 35% of GDP. The National Party on the other hand is proposing to drop it from 30 to 25%. My submission calls for a reordering of government priorities, but within a budget that does not threaten to stuff the goose - say 30% of GDP. Donald G Foster April, 2018. 24

SUBMISSION TO TAX WORKING GROUP ON THE ISSUE OF IMPROVING KIWISAVER TO REDUCE THE BURDEN ON NEW ZEALAND SUPERANNUATION By Drew Hoffman Authorised Financial Adviser 12 April 2018 \[1\] SUMMARY OF MAJOR POINTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 1. The number of people over 65 is increasing rapidly. The ratio of people aged 65 and over as a proportion of people aged 15-64 is projected to more than double by 2068. 2. New Zealand Superannuation will be put under strain because of the increase in the percentage of people in retirement. More of the cost of retirement will need to be placed upon individuals saving for retirement. 3. KiwiSaver has had a good start, but more incentives are needed from both the government and from employers to allow people to save enough to have a comfortable retirement and reduce the burden on New Zealand Superannuation. I. INTRODUCTION After 10 years in existence, there are 2.7 million KiwiSaver members and over $40 billion in assets invested in KiwiSaver. 1 These figures exceed all government expectations. The government’s surprise says more about its failure to understand the country’s need for a retirement vehicle and less about the successful design of the KiwiSaver. In spite of the large uptake in KiwiSaver, there is trouble on the horizon. According to the Statistics New Zealand, the ratio of people aged 65 and over as a proportion of people aged 15-64 is projected to more than double, from 23% in 2016 to 50% in 2068. 2 The Tax Working Group are well aware of this and you point it out in your Submissions Background Paper. Another troubling statistic is that the average balance in a KiwiSaver account after 10 years in existence is approximately $15,000. 3 A recent study conducted by Clare Matthews of Massey University indicates that New Zealand Superannuation is not enough for even a bare bones retirement. A couple wanting a comfortable retirement needs a nest egg of nearly $500,000. 4 That figure will only increase as the population demographics strain New Zealand Superannuation. Of the 2.7 million KiwiSaver members, 1.15 million (42%) of members are not contributing to their KiwiSaver accounts. Over 16% of members are in default schemes. 5 These figures indicate that there is more than a little apathy surrounding KiwiSaver, which does not bode well for many Kiwis’ successful retirement. Inadequate incentives are likely to lead to KiwiSaver members failing to contribute enough to enjoy a successful retirement. Currently, an employee can contribute 3% (after tax) of his or her salary and receive a 3% match from his or her employer, which ends up being less than 3% because it is taxed as well. A KiwiSaver member also receives a maximum of $521.43 (member tax credit) from the government if the member contributes at least $1,042.86. 6 1 Financial Markets Authority, KiwiSaver annual report 2017. 2 Stats NZ, National projections overview, updated 8 March 2017. 3 New Zealand Herald, KiwiSaver hits $40 billion, but balances stay low, May 15, 2017. 4 Stuff, $101,774 in savings needed at 65, just to get by in retirement, July 6, 2017. 5 Financial Markets Authority, KiwiSaver annual report 2017. 6 In prior years, the government matched a member’s contribution of up to $1,042.86 dollar for dollar. Up until 2015, the government also provided a $1,000 kick-start when a member first opened a KiwiSaver account. Additionally, the government did not tax the employer match. The government has stripped away with those incentives and benefits. II. SOLUTIONS A. TAX INCENTIVES New Zealand’s assistance with employee defined contribution schemes is well below that of other developed countries. The following chart compares New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. The chart provides the general rules for taxation in the various countries and is not meant to cover all circumstances. Country Contributions Tax on Growth Distributions New Zealand Taxed\* Taxed No Tax Australia Taxed at 15% Taxed at 15% No Tax United Kingdom No Tax No Tax Taxed United States No Tax No Tax Taxed United States Roth Option Taxed No Tax No Tax \*New Zealand contributes a maximum of $521.43 if at least $1,042.86 is contributed by the KiwiSaver member. Once an employee has contributed up to 3% of his or her salary, there is no incentive for him or her to contribute anymore under the KiwiSaver scheme. A contribution rate of 3% for most people is not going to result in a comfortable retirement. With the amount of New Zealand Superannuation likely to diminish because of population demographics, the New Zealand government needs to incentivise Kiwis to save more. As it stands, most people will make the minimum contribution to get the tax credit and the employer match. A persuasive reason to allow a larger tax incentive is that it will cause KiwiSaver members to contribute more and thus will create a disciplined way of contributing to a retirement programme where the money is locked away until the employee reaches age 65. Any of the tax advantaged options from Australia, the United Kingdom or the United States would be better than New Zealand’s current system. Because New Zealand has no tax on the distributions under its current system, for simplicity’s sake, the Roth option used in the United States would be an excellent choice. In that system, the employee contribution is taxed upfront just like New Zealand’s current system. However, under the Roth method, there is no tax on income and growth and no tax upon distribution from the retirement scheme. Under the Roth method, income and growth on current amounts in KiwiSaver accounts would no longer be taxed and income and growth on additional contributions would not be taxed. I recommend that the limits on contributions be set at $15,000 per annum or 15%, whichever is lower, for employees under age 50. Employees aged 50 and over should have limits of $20,000 or 20%, whichever is lower, to encourage savings for those nearing retirement. The government actually generated positive revenue off KiwiSaver even taking into account the amount it contributed to the member tax credit. In 2017, after tax employer contributions to KiwiSaver were $1.8 billion. Investment returns in 2017 were $2.7 billion. Tax on those two sums easily exceed the member tax credits of $697 million made by the government. 7 In the future, the amount made by the government on taxation of KiwiSaver will only increase under its current form. The New Zealand government needs to get serious about encouraging people to prepare adequately for retirement. In order to do that, it needs to give up some of its current revenue, otherwise it will 7 Financial Markets Authority, KiwiSaver annual report 2017. have much larger problems on its hands in the future in attempting to fund New Zealand Superannuation. Under this proposal, the government will no longer have to make the member tax credit. If people are better prepared for retirement, the government will not have the larger funding problems for New Zealand Superannuation. One other point about encouraging retirement savings and taxation needs to be made. It is safe to say that a fair amount of funds invested in KiwiSaver make their way into New Zealand publicly traded companies. The excellent returns in the sharemarket in New Zealand over the last several years were no doubt assisted by the implementation of KiwiSaver. Investment in New Zealand’s publicly traded companies assists those companies in that more local investment capital is available and there is less reliance on more expensive foreign capital. B. Gradually Increase the Employer Match Currently the employer match is 3%. Initially, the concept was to increase it to 4%. The Global Financial Crisis created challenges for employers and the government left it at 3%. At this point, New Zealand’s economy has been doing extremely well. It’s time for the employer match to increase. I would suggest that the employer match gradually increase to 5%. However, I would also suggest that employees need to contribute up to 7% to get the 5% match so that employees are incentivised to increase their contributions. 8 C. Eliminate the Tax on the Income and Growth on the Employer Match To make a seamless transition and provide incentives for employees to get the highest match, I suggest that the government use the Roth method with respect to employer contributions; i.e. continue to tax the employer match and then allow the employer match to grow (both income and capital appreciation) without being taxed. At the time of distribution from the KiwiSaver account the income and growth on the employer match would not be taxed. 9 Either the government gets serious about providing incentives for retirement or it will create a problem it cannot solve in the future. Kiwis deserve a first class retirement. D. Eliminate the Provision Allowing Employers to Reduce an Employees Pay to Fund the Match Section 101B of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 requires an employer to make the KiwiSaver match in addition to the employee’s wages. Section 101B (4) essentially allows the employer to ignore that section and reduce the employee’s overall compensation by the amount contributed to KiwiSaver. This provision needs to be eliminated. If New Zealanders are going to have a successful retirement, there needs to be cooperation from all three involved—the employee, the employer and the government. Employers in other developed countries have been on board with this for some time. It’s time that New Zealand businesses got on board as well. 8 An easy way to do this is to have a dollar for dollar match by the employer up to 3% of compensation and then 50 cents on the dollar match for the next 2%. For example, an employee who puts in 5% of compensation would get a 4% match from the employer. An employee who contributes 7% of compensation would get a 5% match from the employer. 9 I would suggest that at retirement age, funds in a KiwiSaver account are required to be distributed. While at that point, there would be no tax on the distribution, once those funds are distributed and invested outside of a KiwiSaver account, the growth and income would be subject to normal taxation rules. III. Conclusion KiwiSaver has had a successful start. However, to make it a programme that substantially increases the ability of New Zealanders to have a successful retirement and reduces the problems of an ageing population, tax and employer incentives are needed so that contributions will increase. Over the long term, this will reduce the burden on New Zealand Superannuation, increase the local capital available for New Zealand’s publicly traded companies, and reduce reliance on more expensive foreign capital, thereby increasing tax revenues from those companies.

Tax Working Group Submission Cameron Bradley Introduction The following details my comments, thoughts and ideas on taxation in New Zealand. I have commented on the five key questions asked, as well as some other points I consider important. While I have tried to limit what I say to the scope of your study, some points may be outside of this and for that I apologise. Thank you in advance for your time and please feel free to reach out if you would like to speak further. What does the future of tax look like to me? I believe our tax system requires a complete overhaul for two reasons: 1. The current tax system and the way it is applied has significant gaps in it, such as the ‘gig economy’, a large part of property and multinational corporation profits; and 2. There are currently significant negative effects happening to our country which can be addressed by tax, such as long term health, rapidly rising property prices and environmental degradation. I believe an optimal tax system would be made up of: - A wealth tax, with sensible provisions in place for asset rich, cash poor parties such as pensioners; - An adjusted company tax to address tax avoidance by multinational corporations; - GST as it currently stands; - Other relatively significant excise taxes on goods and services with negative externalities to society, such as driving, polluting, eating unhealthily, smoking and drinking. \[1\] As a wealth tax is unlikely to be politically achievable, an alternative may be to keep income tax as it currently stands and implement a capital gains tax with no exemptions to minimise enforcement costs. What is the purpose of tax? While collecting revenue with minimal effort and compliance costs is currently the primary purpose of tax, I believe it should also be important that tax is used where significant negative externalities to our society are present. This should encourage parties to take into account some of that cost, and also provide revenue for government to address the resultant costs which arise to society. While this is in place for cigarettes and alcohol, some other examples of this are: - When someone elects to drive to work in the city alone every morning, they are imposing a cost to society in terms of increasing congestion and emissions, therefore they should pay a petrol or congestion tax of some form. - When an individual chooses to eat lots of sugary foods for a long time they are more likely to use our health system, therefore a sugar tax should help address this. - When a company creates carbon emissions the company should pay for this in the form of a carbon tax. Are we taxing the right things? I do not believe so. With property and multinational corporation profits being largely untaxed for whatever reasons, this increases the burden on the general public. Also as the gig economy increases, cash jobs are likely to become more common making PAYE less efficient and requiring increased enforcement costs. I have already mentioned that tax should be used to address negative externalities. Can tax make housing more affordable? Of course. Property is already an attractive investment due to currently low interest rates, high demand from population growth and the relative ease of avoiding taxation than, say, starting a business. Your own research shows the current system presents owner-occupied housing as the lowest taxed investment class by far, followed by rental property which is still almost 20% lower than the third lowest taxed investment class. While another important factor in investment decisions are the actual return on investment which is to be taxed, the health of the current market suggests that property should be taxed the same as anything else. I believe a comprehensive capital gains tax should be implemented which does not exclude the family home for a number of reasons, primarily enforcement costs. What tax issues matter the most to me? The number one priority for me would be to use tax to help address the negative externalities which arise from certain transactions, as spoken about in the purpose of tax. Other points Multinational tax avoidance I have two ideas to minimise tax avoidance: 1. Tax based on revenue, rather than profit. Tax rates which differ by industry should be informed by research on companies around the world, and the onus should be on the multinational to make a case as to why they should pay less; 2. Tax based on global profits, apportioned to NZ revenues. Multinationals have resources available and likely already do create global profit and loss statements. Long term NZ It is pointed out that the future of work is unstable. Two possible future scenarios I can envision are: 1. A largely increased publicly employed workforce to ensure our cities and towns are in top condition; 2. An increased benefit system to support the unemployed population, which may start increasing from those who choose not to work. In both of these scenarios our government will incur increased expenses, and these will need to be funded either through increased taxes or reducing expenditure elsewhere. With an ageing population leading to increased healthcare and superannuation costs, I believe it is likely taxes will need to be increased in the long term and our tax system should prepare for this. Bank integration One way to help reduce our dependence on PAYE and address the growing gig economy is to integrate the IRD with banks, much like PAYE is through integration with employers. Due to privacy concerns this is likely to initially need to be up to the customer to opt in to, and it will also mean some enforcement that the entirety of a customer’s bank accounts are being tracked and there are none being hidden. Inequality I also believe our country will be better for all with lower inequality. I think our top tax rate can be increased, especially for the very high earning, and this can be spent on supporting our citizens with the very least. I also believe wealth and capital gains should be taxed, as these are both taxes which will rarely hurt our vulnerable people, and primarily affect those who can afford it. Progressive company tax I think there are bigger priorities to be fixed in our current system before investigating this. Environmental taxes Yes yes yes, read above re: using taxes to address negative externalities (such as environmental harm). GST exemptions I believe it is safer to increase taxes on the negatives rather than introducing exemptions on the positives, as this increases rather than decreases revenue.

By way of background I have attached my biography, but would like to highlight my experience in reviews for successive Governments, namely: -Chairman, Review of the Taxation of Investment Income (2004) which led to the managed funds PIE taxation regime which underpins inter alia Kiwisaver superannuation schemes; -Chairman, International Fund Services Development Group (2010) which led to the tax changes necessary for NZ to become a funds domicile; and -Independent Member, External Challenge Group to the Crown’s Investment Statement (2018) which incorporates the Treasury’s Living Standards Framework for the Four Capitals (Human, Financial, Social and Natural) Comments on Terms of Reference I note that several important areas are documented as out of scope in the Terms of Reference such as increasing any income tax rate or the rate of GST, an inheritance tax, changes to the taxation of the family home/land, and the interaction between the taxation and benefits systems (which is subject to a separate review).There are implications for these omissions such as potential overinvestment in the family home/land relative to other productive investments. While it is not documented as out of scope there is no discussion called for on the interaction between central government taxation and local authority taxation (rates). The principle to discuss is that of subsidiarity-not changing the overall tax collection but devolving taxation from central to local government which allows Councils to have greater relative competitive autonomy over the setting of local taxes to meet local expenditures. The recent announcement of regional fuel taxation powers is helpful in that regard but much more work needs to be done to redress the imbalance of central government benefiting from the taxation of national policies (such as tourism) but expecting local ratepayers to bear the costs of that policy. Finally I am not sure if there should be a taxation system objective that must result in the overall tax collection remaining at circa 30% of GDP. Clearly tax revenues should be required to balance the Crown’s operating expenditures through the economic cycle, but a greater focus on expenditures can still result in a balanced budget with a lower overall tax burden. \[1\] Comments on Taxation Principles Tax policy settings can be rife with troublesome boundaries some of which deserve ridicule. Classifications of foods that are or are not exempt from VAT in overseas jurisdictions are a good example. Although NZ relies on only three main sources of taxation-individual, company and GST- I endorse the comments made in the documents provided by the Tax Working Group about our current low rate, broad-based taxation system namely it is “justifiably commended internationally for being simple and efficient” and which “guiding principle is neutrality”. It is important that policy makers continue to sustainably support these principles which contribute to greater long-term certainty of the rules of the game for taxpayers. Taxation policy volatility will lead to increased risk premiums and potentially adverse changes in economic behaviour. There is also good execution of these principles in the design of NZ’s income taxation principles which is not highlighted at all in the Working Group’s public documentation. The first is the alignment to the marginal tax rate of the individual taxpayer. Individuals’ marginal tax rates drive their taxation of income from NZ companies (the imputation regime) and their taxation of income in the Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) savings regime through Prescribed Investor Rates (PIRs) which is also a final tax. This is a largely efficient and fair taxation methodology. The second is the use of the Risk Free Return Method (RFRM) to tax non-Australian overseas shares held within a PIE. This is currently set at 5%. Investors are taxed at their individual PIR on this return regardless of the actual total return of the shares. It provides a fixed revenue stream to the Crown at a RFRM rate that has been low enough to be acceptable to investor taxpayers, and successfully bypasses debates on the capital/revenue boundary. I do support well flagged consensual evolution of policy under these principles. Comments on Specific Challenges 1.Capital Gains Tax NZ already has a capital gains tax. However it is not comprehensive, and there are concerns about how to consistently enforce it. I am not convinced that overseas jurisdictions have capital gains tax regimes that are efficient or neutral. Tax boundaries just seem to get shifted, and transaction costs rise for all parties. The Working Group needs to consider the taxation parable of the apple tree. If the seeds and resulting tree are the capital required, and the apples are the eventual income, do you tax the growth of the tree? At what points in its life do you tax it? Does this change risk appetite to plant trees? If it doesn’t bear fruit do you offer a rebate? When does income start? At budding? At picking? Bypassing these boundary issues using a comprehensive low rate RFRM should be seriously considered. 2.Alignment of top marginal individual income/trust and company tax rates. Taxing companies/PIEs at 28c but trusts and individuals at the top marginal tax rate of 33c is not efficient. It does lead to tax structuring and enforcement costs. There must also be some concerns about the global mobility of individuals on the top marginal tax rate who contribute a disproportionate amount of tax on a pro rata basis. These tax rates should all be aligned at the same rate ie 28c. 3.Individual tax brackets While the Working Group does not have a mandate to increase tax rates there is a case for reviewing tax brackets, including disincentives to move up the brackets, methodologies to stop bracket creep, and the 0% threshold. 4.Company taxation. I do not support more progressive taxation to favour small vs large businesses. How do you decide the boundary between small and large? Do we want the tax system to encourage large businesses to shrink? The Working Group does need to address the inability of 0% taxpayers to use imputation credits. This is unfair. Addressing this improves Social Capital outcomes, a vital part of the Living Standards Framework. 5.Savings regime Leave the TTE regime as it is. The PIR integration with PIE taxation is fair and efficient. An important additional benefit is that it is a final tax with no administration required by investors. However when RFRM was introduced at 5% interest rates were much higher and there was no agreement on methodologies to adjust the rate. Arguably the rate should be 3% today. The Working Group should consider when RFRM should adjust. 6.Rental Property The Crown currently proposes to ring fence taxable deductions for rental properties to prevent offsets against other non-property income (ie income unrelated to the rental property/properties concerned). The problem definition is that residential rental property is somehow favoured by the current approach. The solution is that deduction eligibility is only valid when the property rental income concerned is taxable. This may be common in commercial property structures, but not necessarily so in residential rentals. What is not clear is consistency of approach-is rental property in fact favoured? What are the consequences of the proposed changes? For example does it impact on the financing of small business who do use housing as collateral to raise debt? Does it discriminate between debt funded (where interest is deductible) and equity funded rental investors? Holiday houses should not be taxed provided no income is earnt. 7.GST The coverage of GST should be widened to include consumer goods purchased online from overseas. NZ retailers are unfairly penalised by being required to apply GST to all items sold locally wheras consumers purchasing online from overseas vendors with a value of less than $400 are not required to pay GST. In the interests of fairness GST should apply at the border at a minimum flat $ rate per item. If the item purchased online is more than $400 the normal 15% GST rate should apply. 8.Environmental Taxation The evolution of the Crown’s Emission Trading Regime is the appropriate place for addressing carbon taxation and NZ’s climate change obligations. What has yet to be addressed are other costs to the health of our natural capital under the Living Standards Framework from urban and rural polluters of our land, lakes, rivers and seas. As these costs are not directly borne by the polluter, they do not have a direct financial incentive to manage or cease their pollution. The Working Group should consider whether changes to the NZ tax regime is the best place to encourage changes to polluter behaviour or whether it should be addressed outside the regime. 9.NZ taxation in a global context NZ needs foreign investment whether it is inter alia to finance Crown, Local Authority or company debt, or to invest in new and existing listed and unlisted NZ enterprises. There are important attendant benefits including employment, transfers of skills and technology and the introduction to/expansion of foreign markets. NZ should be at least a neutral destination from a tax perspective for both portfolio and direct investors from overseas. Foreign investors should not pay further NZ tax on top of their domestic tax. And any regime for non- residents should not discriminate against domestic firms wishing to compete globally. I am very concerned about the current unclear tax policy frameworks for foreign investors which raises uncertainty and risk premiums, and results in poor tax revenues. The funds domicile progress, and changes to the Foreign Trusts regime are examples of an increasingly weak approach. Our opportunity is to improve our global capital markets reputation, attract investment to locate in NZ as a base for global activities and through a principled broad-based neutral approach thereby increase the Crown’s tax base and revenues. The Tax Working Group should consider a work stream on these opportunities. Conclusions Overall the integrity of the NZ tax regime is strong. It can accommodate future economic change and still deliver required tax revenues through the cycle for the Crown. There is however room for evolutionary improvement, provided it enables taxpayers to plan with certainty. I would be happy to share these thoughts further with you at your convenience.

Dirk De Lu I would like to present an oral submission. Four Living Standards At least since the mid 1980’s Treasury’s ‘living standards’ have been in decline in NZ. The neo liberal ‘miracle’ has brought many changes, at too high a cost. Much of the country’s infrastructure was sold off, degraded and some bought back at a high price. Many of our factories closed quickly in the face of foreign competition. Thousands lost their jobs in both the public and private sectors. Suicides and poverty increased. With the sale of West Pac to Australian interests capital control along with billions in profits were lost offshore. With the bursary for higher education and apprenticeship programs discontinued our human capital degraded. Institutional knowledge and skills were lost. Many of our best and brightest continue to go overseas to find meaningful work. As a society we have deep divisions, loss of faith in government, insecurity in the work place and degraded community assets. Our local Councils struggle to maintain services and infrastructure. Our people struggle to afford housing which is too often of poor quality. Our waterways are notoriously degraded; intensive dairying is coming to grief from over exploitation of unsuitable land, our clean water over allocated and now others, often under foreign ownership bottle it for sale to people overseas. The challenges facing NZ are also found in many other western countries. Looking to overseas experiences and solutions may be helpful. The neo liberal ‘miracle’ is not just NZ’s nightmare. Tax to Change Behaviour Where what people do has a financial impact on or produces negative outcomes for others or the government it makes sense that tax be used as an incentive or disincentive. Relying on the criminal justice system is not the only tool available. As noted in the discussion paper taxes are there to fund the services required by society. Heavy taxes on alcohol and tobacco can mitigate health care costs, reduce productivity losses due to ill health, etc. The taxes collected should be at least that which is required to offset all costs. The same logic applies to taxing other actions or behaviours which incur costs to the public. Incentivizing behaviours which benefit society is equally legitimate, at least during the transition periods required to achieve behaviour change. Incentivizing electric cars makes sense, but should be dropped as the prices come down and the functionality increases. Road user charges for electrics will need to be implemented. Incentivizing active and public transport makes sense as it saves on the larger costs of having to constantly maintain and expand the more expensive transport choice of larger motorized vehicles. \[1\] 5 Key Questions What does the Future of Tax Look Like? With decades of institutionalization of neo liberal influence the future of taxation will be a one sided war between taxing entities and those who have successfully removed regulation replacing it with tax and trade treaties favourable to protecting and expanding their outsized profits and assets. Government power has been decreased while the power of those with wealth is secured by those same governments. Our globalized economy allows tax evaders to pick and choose where they will ‘locate’ business headquarters, where they will live, where they will declare their income. NZ will find taxing the wealthy a very challenging task. A task we have no choice but to tackle. Add in our aging population, fewer jobs due to technology, many jobs lost to overseas production, the long deferred costs of damage done by extractive industries now requiring remediation, climate change, inequality and the list goes on. Governments face extreme challenges with a shrinking ability to effectively assess and collect tax. In the present environment tax fairness and the credibility of taxation are effectively undermined. The Changing Nature of Work Taxing the ‘gig economy’ should be possible through quarterly reporting from both vendor and vendee. Workers contracting for international work performed in NZ will be a challenge to discover and audit. Fund for the likely increased monitoring and enforcement costs. Environmental Challenges Individuals and entities should not be allowed to ‘externalize’ costs to others, such as the damage they do to the environment or society. Doing so creates inaccurate market signals and poor consumption choices. The tax system can attempt to see all costs included in the market price of the good or service. Adding robust and well documented environmental cost assessments to taxpayer activities will require cooperation and reliance on environmental agencies of the government as well as input from the many environmental organisations which have developed the expertise and credibility to document the impacts. It will be important to find professionals who are not subject to ‘capture’ by the interests being assessed for taxation and to overcome political lobbying efforts by those interests. Who determines what is good, what externalized costs should be taxed? After decades of neo liberal dominance we have a highly degraded environment, deteriorating infrastructure, gross inequality leading to homelessness, over full prisons, high suicide rates, ever increasing costs for the necessities of life and the challenge of tackling climate change which we have yet to effectively address. Looking at their track record it is clear which ideologies and ideologues should not be included in making the determination of what is good. The scientific community applies the scientific method to determining what is theory, what is proven, the flexibility to revisit as new information comes to light and the ‘consensus’ of peer review. This can be a model for guiding taxation legislation. Economic analysis will also play a part. What are the long term economic impacts? Addressing climate change impacts through carbon sequestration for ongoing activities adds costs which will be borne by generations, who did not incur the debt, require constant maintenance and are subject to failure. Tax which brings all costs into the current market price allows consumers to choose and producers to innovate. The resulting economy is able to plan and develop for current and future demands. The inertia of business as usual replaced by an economy ‘fit for purpose’. Clearly those who stand to profit by ‘gaming’ the system will always be looking for advantage. As always it is up to a well informed electorate served by skilled, knowledgeable, ethical and self-aware public servants to engage in decision making. The tax system alone will not achieve this, but should not thwart it. Technology Government may well be forced to monitor all bank accounts, ban crypto currencies and require registration for all income generating activities. We will all hate this invasion of our privacy and freedoms and it gives far too much power to government. Without it there will be many who do not pay their fair share. Alternatively and preferably audit intelligently and enact punitive laws which make the cost of noncompliance so great that it is mainly discouraged. Government can also utilize software and artificial intelligence to reduce tax avoidance. Improving Productivity It is wrong headed to assume that lower corporate tax rates will increase productivity or encourage more corporate creation. Many corporations and individuals have simply relocated their ‘headquarters’ and ‘residences to a lower tax domain. The resulting ‘race to the bottom’ has left governments struggling to fund their basic mandates. Inequality Inequality is verifiably and unquestionably increasing. That you assert this is questioned undermines confidence in the impartiality of this process and the usefulness of submissions. Tax on income, from whatever source, must be used to achieve better balance in economic benefits for all. CEO’s making millions may add more value, but only as they are in the position to do so. Their position would not be possible without the contribution of the workforce which produces the goods, technology, or services which produce the profits. A progressive tax system with a wealth tax could help to spread the wealth to all those who create it. There is little point in paying a CEO millions if income greater than $400,000 is taxed at 90%. The same applies to paying more in dividends to shareholders when they too are subject to a progressive tax system. Paying workers more can increase productivity, satisfaction, social cohesion and puts money with those who are more likely to spend it on the necessities of life than to hoard it or invest it offshore. For the state to credibly require that we all comply the wealthy must be stopped from avoiding or evading tax. And the tax they pay must be at a rate higher than paid by lower income individuals. With the inequality already in place those with the funds have bought the tax laws which serve them. By not keeping up, by serving special interests, successive governments have allowed tax evasion to become entrenched. It is hoped that this review will offer the changes required to undo much of this. Those who cannot contribute to the economy need to be supported at some reasonable level. Homelessness, child poverty and other results of inequality cost us all. Lost lives, lost potential, crime, costs of health care for stressed often mal nourished individuals, communities no one wants to visit let alone live in. The contributions of tax dollars for goods and services to these unfortunates can help break the cycle of poverty. We all benefit. Globalization Physical goods purchased over the internet to be assigned GST as they enter the country. Services also attract GST. Virtual goods will be far more challenging. Tax treaties are required but may well be undermined by non-signatory governments or lack of enforcement by some governments. Effective tax treaties are also unlikely given the clear favouritism to corporate interests found in the CPTPP for example. What We Tax NZ needs to aggregate all income sources for determining tax brackets and to tax them all. Apply a progressive tax structure offering an increasing tax rate as income received increases. Income earned in NZ by overseas companies and individuals to be taxed the same as residents. Progressive taxes are preferred. Regressive taxes like GST may be seen as the only or affordable way to tax economic activity. If this is to continue lower decile persons should receive a GST rebate quarterly. Our tax system is regressive with the poor paying tax on nearly all of their income twice. Carbon Tax A carbon tax priced to account for the full impacts and a premium is required. Returning the premium portion of the tax collected evenly to all consumers will help to offset the impacts while encouraging low carbon consumer choices. The carbon tax will need to be sufficient to achieve NZ’s stated goal to be carbon neutral by 2050. Tax on NZ derived Income To tax an overseas business with sales in NZ that percentage of its sales made in NZ to be applied to their worldwide earnings and taxed at that value. Do not permit the spurious claims of costs currently used to allege minimal profits derived. Require disclosure of related party transactions often with inflated prices to push up costs. Penalize noncompliance. Departure Tax on non-value added goods sent Overseas Too many of NZ’s resources are sold without value being added, water, logs, milk powder are examples. A departure tax is one possibility to encourage local value added enhancement which creates employment and increases income for NZ. Capital Gains Tax Apply income tax rates to an inflation adjusted capital gains tax. Holding periods of less than 2 years would simply incur tax at unadjusted income rates. The inflation adjustment would be equal to the cumulative inflation of the holding period. Inflation adjustments resulting in a net loss would not be treated as a loss for tax purposes. All asset classes to be included, income is income. Capital Gains on Real Estate All real estate transactions for property held less than 2 years, outside of the family home, taxed as income. Longer term real estate holdings, outside of the family home, incur an inflation adjusted capital gains tax. Depreciated capital costs and costs covered using pre-tax dollars are not eligible for calculating basis. Mortgage interest paid is not a deductible expense or credited to basis. Where rental income was not sufficient to cover after tax dollar losses are only eligible to be credited against gain from sale. Capital gains in excess of basis on the family home greater than 150% of the average house price in the region to be taxed as income. Verifiable expenses for undepreciated capital improvements to be added to basis cost. Require home to have been the taxpayer’s primary residence for at least the last 3 years for this exemption to apply. A taxpayer can have only one primary residence in which they actually lived in any 3 year period. Why the exemption? When a person moves they need to buy at the then current prices. If they sell their highly appreciated home only to have a large percentage of the gain taxed away they are penalized for moving. For the average person this may well be a financial penalty that they simply cannot afford. As most of us don’t relish moving and do so only for compelling reasons and moving is rarely detrimental to society as a whole a capital gains tax on the family home is a disincentive on an activity that generally does not need to be discouraged. Like a homeowner exemption businesses which are relocating within NZ would have a limit on the amount of gain allowed before tax is assessed. Empty Homes Tax Homes in residential areas with unmet housing needs which remain unoccupied for more than 4 months without active building consents are to be taxed. Estate and Gift Tax Estate tax for estates over a set limit, say $3 million, can encourage philanthropy while lessening the likelihood of familial dynasties. If heirs are truly capable and skilled they will be able to do well for themselves with the capital contribution received. Encourage meritocracy, not entitlement. Heirs of a very large going concern would none the less have millions of equity to support the tax to be paid on the excess and to borrow should it be required. The Paris Hilton’s of the world take much and add little. Gift taxes would be required to make evasion of the estate tax difficult if not impossible. Cumulative gifts with a value greater than a set limit, say $10,000.00 to any one recipient in any tax year must be declared. Valuation for tax purposes to be current market value at time of receipt. Donor is to have the option of inclusion of gifts in the estate exemption in which instance no tax would be due until the estate tax return is filed. Alternatively the amount in excess would be taxed at recipient’s income tax rate. For both estate and gift tax the untaxed gain, if any, of gifted assets would be taxed. Income Averaging Some taxpayers will have grossly uneven income year to year. Those holding assets for long term gains are one example. Upon sale after many years the gains due for taxation at applicable income tax rates, even with inflation adjustment, can be substantial. Allow taxpayers to choose to income average, either to previous or future years or both for tax purposes. A limit, perhaps 10 years, could be applied. While this adds complexity it can bring greater tax fairness. Accounting software will quickly adapt to ease compliance. Financial Transactions Tax Apply a ‘Robin Hood tax’ to financial product trading, shares, bonds, futures, commodities, etc. This would essentially be a ‘fee’ on all such transactions. The fee should be sufficient to discourage day trading, low enough not to interfere with legitimate investment and business activity. Frequent trading is not productive and has resulted in dysfunctional market behaviour. Liquidity is important, but not at the cost of the economy. Financial products such as collateralized debt obligations masqueraded as ways to raise capital; they proved to be highly damaging fictions. If it cannot be easily understood and/or does not genuinely deliver clear benefits to the economy as a whole, tax it out of existence. Similar to taxing activities which damage the natural or social environment tax activities which present the potential for current or future harm to the economy. Such taxes must collect an amount sufficient to discourage the behaviour and at least equal to the cost of remediating their potential harm. Luxury Tax Add luxury tax to all non-essential items and to commonly required items which sell at more than a 50% premium to the average cost of such goods. Start with the most obvious. The purchase of luxury goods does not increase overall economic productivity while directing capital away from activities which can contribute. Many luxury items must also be imported removing funds from the local economy. Charities Tax Charities should pay tax on their commercial activities. Their commercial activities benefit from the many services provided by government. Rates relief on assets which serve primarily charitable purposes makes sense. These are assets which, supposedly, benefit the community and which many charities would not be able to maintain if having to pay full rates. A public good is often achieved. Donations to charities to be tax deductible up to a set limit. That limit to be no more than 100% of the average post tax income. Assets Tax Taxpayers who fail to manage assets for productive gain need education more than taxation. Holding real assets incurs costs, rates, insurance; maintenance applied or deferred, utilities, etc. A progressive tax structure limits taxpayer’s ability to amass unproductive capital; they may well not have the funds to hold an unproductive asset long term. When an unproductive asset is held within a corporate structure the overall income of the corporation is likely applied to cover holding costs but, at a direct cost to profits. This should be sufficient to encourage the sale of unproductive assets. Upon sale of the asset the holding costs are not added to basis as these will have been funded with untaxed dollars. Undepreciated capital costs would be applied to basis. For many working, middle and even upper middle taxpayers the family home is their chief asset. Some may also have prepared for retirement by investing in shares, term deposits, etc. A tax on assets along with rates has the potential to see retirees forced to give up much of what they have spent a lifetime acquiring. (Rates are required for our local Councils to operate. That they also need other income streams is not the discussion here.) All assets remain subject to taxation upon sale, gifting or as part of an estate. This is especially apropos given the need for a capital gains tax. A retiree holding an investment which does not pay dividends, but which increases in value may be forced to sell that at an untimely juncture just to pay tax. Forcing the productive use of assets which would justify an assets tax is better achieved with a progressive and comprehensive tax system. The tax due will be paid when it is in the best interest of the taxpayer to sell it and pay the capital gains tax. . NZ has similarly illegitimate taxes already. Current tax law assess a tax on imputed gains from overseas investments, this in spite of the ease of a taxpayer showing that no gains were realized. The current situation undermines the fairness of taxation while limiting the inflow of dividend income from overseas. Housing See discussion on the need for a capital gains tax above. The lack of a capital gains tax on real estate is in part responsible for our unreasonably high real estate costs. Most other investment options do not offer the tax advantages of real estate investing. Leaving them at a disadvantage to attract capital. This limits local capital availability and requires more borrowing from overseas. Add in that much of our real estate debt is also funded from overseas and NZ is haemorrhaging cash. Meanwhile many are burdened by unaffordable housing, bought or rented, or suffer homelessness. While this will be extremely unpopular with those who are benefiting, or hope to, it is what is required. Escaping Tax and Responsibility Eliminate the asset protection trusts or at least make them voidable for the collection of legitimate taxes and debts. ‘Gifts’ between spouses/partners or to trusts are to be assessed and taxed at current value and to be voidable for the collection of legitimate debts related to the likely acquisition of the gifted asset. Trusts and transfers are to be voidable where the donor has been found guilty of fraudulent activities which may have contributed to the ability to make the gift or transfer. Funding Losses The government should not fund losses from investing or asset sales. A tax refund is only possible if the tax has already been paid. Apply this to the example of taxation of imputed gains. If an asset has been assessed and paid tax for imputed gains and upon sale the profit, if any, does not justify the tax paid, a tax refund would be due. Land Tax Land already incurs rates. Rates should reflect both the cost to provide services and the value of the land. An investor land banking a section should be paying rates based on both. Agricultural land with a covenant restricting it to agricultural use should pay less in rates and adding a land tax would only discourage agriculture in favour of defeating the covenant to allow development. Progressive Company Tax Apply progressive tax rates across the board. A company, large or small, that makes a paltry profit should pay a lower tax, if it makes a large profit it pays more. This will require careful auditing of costs and sales. Related party transactions will be of special interest, especially where an individual or company is self-trading between entities. Discovery of unreported relationships should incur penalties which more than offset any gains which could have been realized. Where many ‘shell companies’ are utilized and tax avoidance is the most reasonable explanation enforcement costs to be added to penalties and a simpler structure required. Legitimate business expenses should not include provision of luxury goods, offices, furniture, cars, services, etc. to employees. Where luxuries are provided the cost is to be included in calculating employee income for taxation. Tax and the Environment Tax all activities for their full impact costs. Tax is to be collected upon creation and included in the market price of the good or service. Guardianship, sustainability, social responsibility are values to be encouraged and supported. Integrating full costs into the market price will encourage alternatives. Extractive industries offer a good example. Require bonds to cover full remediation costs of all impacts. Require remediation to be contemporaneous with production rather than later. Assess all impacts including environmental and social. GST Your discussion on GST again undermines confidence in this process. The most egregious example being the specious example of should we tax tomato sauce, soup, etc. As noted many countries already exempt all food from GST. We can easily learn from their experience. It is not that difficult. Portraying it as vexed is disingenuous, at best. What is food? From the dictionary “any nutritious substance that people or animals eat or drink or that plants absorb in order to maintain life and growth.” Clearly candy, soda, alcohol, tobacco and foods which offer more ill health than nutrition are not included. Certainly some debate around the edges can occur, but the overwhelming numbers of grocery items are easily classified. Suffice to say that food, medicine, sanitary products and other base necessities should not incur GST. The Tax Minimisation Industry Whatever tax law is created by this process will immediately attract those who seek to profit by offering their ability to get around the law to those who seek to minimize their tax liability. Parliament working with the IRD must seek to learn from these activities and quickly pass legislation to thwart them. Failure to do so undermines confidence in both Parliament and the IRD while providing a rationalisation for those who chose to participate in the untaxed cash economy. Both tax avoiding groups shift an unfair burden of taxation to those who dutifully comply.

There are a number of different matters that I wish to comment upon under the following headings. • Capital Gains Taxation • Previous Tax Review Outcomes – Including an Appendix containing extracts from those earlier reviews • Kiwisaver and Taxation of Savings The submission content follows. Capital Gains Taxation One expects that the question as to whether there should be a capital gains tax will continue to be asked ad nauseum until a capital gains tax is introduced. Accepting without reservation all of the theoretical reasons that justify the introduction of a capital gains tax, I am yet to see anyone, including numerous previous tax review groups, come up with a practical capital gains tax that meets the theoretical requirement. That, surely, is the fundamental reason why New Zealand has not previously introduced such a tax and, I am sure, remains the fundamental reason why New Zealand should continue not to do so. For the record, I note yet again that such a tax fails to meet the theoretical requirements because: • There must be exemptions to gain political acceptance (e.g. the family residence, which will simply continue to exacerbate over-investment in housing) • The tax can only be applied on asset realisation, as an accruals basis is simply not practical on large value assets without forcing sale to meet the accrual tax • Roll over relief may be required for some assets • Taxation is generally (and inappropriately) applied to gains unadjusted for inflation • Assets may have to be periodically valued, increasing costs • Tax returns become more complicated, reducing the benefits of simplification already achieved in New Zealand Previous tax review outcomes Referring to the Appendix attached, including extracts from two previous tax reviews (2001 & 2010), the following questions are relevant for the tax working group to consider: 1. Unless the latest government tax working group can identify something that has changed since the conclusions reached in the 2001 review report (provided to the 3 then Hon Dr Michael Cullen, Minister of Finance), what justification can there now be for supporting narrowing the GST base or for taxing some goods or services at lower GST rates, or for introducing: a. a general realisations-based capital gains tax b. a general wealth tax c. a cash-flow tax d. a Tobin Tax e. national eco-taxation? 2. While the 2010 tax review supported the introduction of a low-rate land tax, does the government directive (presumably to address the political sustainability issue) to exclude owner-occupied property from such a land tax mean that a recommendation to consider such a tax proposal can still be regarded as appropriate or useful? One can also note that exclusion of all owner-occupied property from many of the proposed taxes effectively results in an increased impost on rental residential properties at a time of recognised rental accommodation shortage. Is this appropriate? Ironically, the exemption for owner-occupied residences also potentially provides for legally allowable mechanisms to minimise or remove the impact of such taxes from those individuals or entities investing in property that any such proposal is meant to be targeting. Reduction or avoidance of the taxes can be achieved by an individual or entity wanting to invest in property simply providing a non-recourse loan to someone else to buy and live in a property where the loan repayment amount is set at a percentage of the eventual sale value of the property, the percentage being anything up to 100% of such sale value. Interest payments on the loan can be set at any amount from 0% upwards. Interestingly, Brian Fallow, an economic journalist for the NZ Herald, outlined a similar lending concept in a Herald article dated 15 December 2017, albeit he proposed a much smaller equity sharing loan component, focused upon a risk-sharing alternative to traditional mortgage debt to reduce systemic financial risks in an economy. Further, while I make no claim to be an expert on sharia law, I understand that this concept can be structured to be sharia compliant, via a profit sharing contract known as “murabaha” that might be used to provide a mortgage on a property. The property is registered to the buyer from the start. While owner-occupied property is exempted, such a legally allowable loan structure also avoids the recently introduced bright line test as well as any proposed capital gains tax, wealth tax, or land tax, even while all of the benefit is effectively being passed to the loan provider under the structure envisaged. However, I acknowledge that any profit achieved on repayment of the loan will likely be taxable but note also then that any loss on repayment of the loan would likely be tax deductible, against all income, not ring fenced. 4 In case you might think it appropriate to introduce anti-avoidance measures, I strongly suggest that anything that allows a New Zealander to borrow to buy a home and potentially to also live in it, even while giving up some of or all the potential growth in value, must be acceptable and should not be precluded or disadvantaged. Such a structure may be even more beneficial for overseas parties providing the financing. Not only does it potentially minimise or avoid tax, but it also provides a simple legal mechanism to still obtain economic exposure to NZ residential property while avoiding the proposal currently being considered under the Overseas Investment Amendment Bill to ban foreigners from buying residential land, provided a New Zealander is the recipient of the loan, which is then applied by the New Zealander to purchasing a property for the New Zealander to occupy. I emphasise that these comments do not imply that I am supporting removal of the exemption for owner-occupied homes, rather that these comments simply help highlight the impracticality of any attempt to introduce such taxes, as recognised by both the 2001 & 2010 tax reviews. KiwiSaver and Taxation of Savings The government tax working group background paper acknowledges the differential rates of taxation applied to various forms of savings or investment options, including KiwiSaver. Clearly, while one answer to fix this is to increase tax on the tax favoured savings or investment options, don’t lose sight of the other answer available, namely to reduce tax on the savings and investment options regarded as being tax disadvantaged. This is a topic that previous reviews have focused upon. The combined IRD & Treasury paper titled “Taxation of Savings and Investment Income” and dated 27 September 2012 is also worth referencing again. Focusing now on retirement savings, retirement savers always fall into one of three categories: • Those who can afford to save and already do • Those who can afford to save and don’t • Those who can’t afford to save and don’t To the extent that KiwiSaver results in the final two groups undertaking retirement savings that would otherwise not occur, there may be some small incremental increase in retirement savings. I understand that research suggests that this is the outcome being achieved by KiwiSaver, but with much of KiwiSaver monies otherwise being savings diverted from alternative savings. The latter is certainly the case in my KiwiSaver account, undertaken at the minimum possible level as a self-employed person, solely to obtain the incentive provided in the form of a government credit. Noting that KiwiSaver includes incentives in the form of a government credit, alternative incentives might also be considered by the tax working group, whether as a direct 5 deduction of contributions from taxable income, or as some form of relief from tax on fund earnings. However, as history has proven time and time again when incentives are provided, most of the benefit goes to the first category of savers, and/or to the fund managers. It is therefore unsurprising that the Chair of the tax working group has publicly lamented the obvious and entirely foreseeable outcome that KiwiSaver increases inequity. This was always going to be a given outcome of the scheme as designed. The Chair of the working group has also been publicly reported as suggesting compulsory membership of KiwiSaver be considered to assist in overcoming this inequity. Noting that compulsion is pointless for the first group, one can conclude that compulsion might only ever assist people in the last two categories to achieve retirement savings that otherwise would not occur. However, for the last group, it is at the expense of their ability to meet their basic living requirements. Hence, if compulsion is introduced, to ensure that the living standards of this final group are not adversely impacted, government has no choice but to either enhance the income of this latter group to cover the contributions required to be made to KiwiSaver, or alternatively for the government to make some or all of the payments direct to KiwiSaver that such individuals would otherwise be required to make,. It is at this point that one can ask, in the face of a universal NZ Superannuation payment and minimal poverty reported amongst the aged population, what the point of KiwiSaver is? Acknowledging that KiwiSaver has had some benefit towards enhancing financial capability in the form of financial literacy, outside of this benefit, it only has a point if it is believed that NZ Superannuation is insufficient in itself to provide an adequate retirement income, or if there is an as yet unstated intent to replace NZ Superannuation with KiwiSaver or make NZ Superannuation means tested again. Unless the financial literacy benefit achieved via KiwiSaver is sufficient unto itself, I suggest that the inequity that the Chair of the tax working group is concerned about might best be addressed by abolishing KiwiSaver and reverting to the pure voluntary savings structure that previously existed, supported by an ongoing universal NZ Superannuation benefit at a level that obviates poverty in old age. Retirement saving is simply about having enough money when one wants to retire to enjoy the lifestyle that one aspires to at that time. It does not need to be in a specialised “retirement” fund. Providing incentives, introducing compulsion and locking money away until a specified age simply introduces unnecessary distortion, increases inequity, and reduces personal financial flexibility. Even without compulsion, KiwiSaver does all of this, with the restrictions on financial flexibility specifically recognised in the circumstances allowing withdrawal of funds in the case of hardship and buying a first home. KiwiSaver fails to recognise the other costs that the lack of flexibility within the scheme imposes. 6 Appendix Extracts from the Overview of the Final Report of the 2001 Tax Review “We do not consider that New Zealand should adopt a general realisations-based capital gains tax. We do not believe that such a tax would make our tax system fairer and more efficient, nor do we believe that it would lower tax avoidance or raise substantial revenue that could be used to reduce rates. Instead, such a tax would increase the complexity and costs of our system.” “We do not support implementing a general wealth tax in New Zealand, nor reintroducing an estate duty. We conclude that neither of these taxes would fill a gap in the income tax base. We recommend that the Government not implement a cash-flow tax, given the severe transitional problems that would arise.” “In the Issues Paper, we indicated our support of the overall design of GST and did not propose any significant changes. In particular, we did not believe that a strong case could be made for either narrowing the GST base or for taxing some goods or services at lower rates. We have not altered our view of GST, and do not recommend any material reform.” “We do not support the introduction of a financial transaction tax, first, because of harmful cascading effects, and secondly, because we do not consider it a superior substitute for GST. We do not support the introduction of a tax on short-term foreign exchange flows popularly known as a Tobin Tax, as we believe that the goal of reducing exchange rate volatility by means of a Tobin-type tax is misguided. We are also unconvinced that a Tobin tax imposed by a single country would be effective in furthering such a goal.” “The Review was unable to identify instances where new eco-taxes at the national level could be considered an effective means of addressing environmental concerns facing New Zealand. It follows that we do not favour proposals to target and move towards predetermined levels of tax revenue from national eco-taxation. For similar reasons, we do not consider that national quotas or similar regimes are appropriate to New Zealand circumstances. Such measures also fail to satisfy the criteria noted earlier for a nationally applied eco-tax. Where, on the other hand, environmental concerns are highly localised, as they currently appear to be in New Zealand, measures such as carefully designed eco- charges applied at the local level can be appropriate.” Extracts from the Overview of the 2010 Report of the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group titled, “A Tax System for New Zealand’s Future” “Most members of the TWG support the introduction of a low-rate land tax as a means of funding tax rate reductions and improving the overall efficiency of the tax system. However, there are concerns over the political sustainability of such a tax.”

Capital Gains Tax – A chance for New Zealand to grow The first thing to note in this paper is that the writer has no axe to grind rather has a desire to truly make New Zealand a better society as a whole. For many years I have seen investments being made for capital gains purposes solely rather than truly economically viable investments. It is the drug of the New Zealand investment community and it is time for the country to be weaned off the drug and in this case the best way is to go cold turkey. By way of background the writer is a chartered accountant with a practice in the south of Taranaki which is predominately agricultural focus. Most of the ideas expressed in this paper come from discussions with farmers and incorporate the responses of those farmers thus ensuring a balanced and fairly equitable approach. Capital Gains Tax – The simplier the better The most successful taxes to be implemented are those that are seen as legislatively simple to understand, easy to manage and enforce, with very limited if any scope for abuse. New Zealand was a leader in this field with the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax regime in the mid 80’s. Even today New Zealand’s Goods and Services Tax regime is the envy of the western world for its simplicity and ease of use. This approach has to be applied to any Capital Gains Tax regime. In order to be successful any tax must be as broad as possible so as to limit any scope for opting out of the regime. Coupled with that the rate of the tax must be set at a level so as to positively encourage compliance and minimize the potential of abuse. This said by setting the rate at the correct level there becomes a societal pressure to comply thus ensuring the enforcement is both effective and wide ranging. What should be caught. It is the writer’s view that capital gains should apply to all capital gains with absolutely no exemptions. Remember it is often not the tax that is unpalatable but rather the rate at which the tax is administered. Thus the family home is included in the net, as too capital gains on the sale of shares, art work, wine, collectibles, crypto currency, commercial buildings, farms, orchards and so forth. Basically if you make a capital gain you will be liable for capital gains tax, full stop. Yes I know this could be seen as political suicide but the reality is that the greater good for New Zealand is the aim of implementing a simple and transparent tax base not popularity. That said I also firmly believe that it is not the governments role to subsidise poor investment decisions and processes and thus there should be no allowances made for capital losses. Those losses should be bourn solely by the investor and not the government. The rate of Capital Gains Tax The moment you link a capital gains tax to income tax rates the government of the day is asking for a scrap. The clear answer here is to make the capital gains tax a separate and stand alone tax. In the process you would significantly reduce the volume of the current taxation acts and thus truly achieve significant tax simplification. By my rather limited analysis approx. 2/3 rd if not one entire volume of the tax act could be removed and replaced which something no larger than the GST Act. In discussing this issue with a vast cross section of the client base it would appear that an acceptable rate to be applied would be in the area of 10 – 15%. I felt there would be significant push back from a client group that had been raised on the drug of farming for capital gains however they were in most part completely comfortable with a capital gains tax of this level and many commented that they thought this was fair and reasonable. They were also completely comfortable with including the family home as it makes it so simple to apply and the rate is not seen as excessive. How do we calculate the Tax Lets try and keep this as simple as possible, the most basic form would be (Selling price – (Purchase Price plus and capital improvements)) x Capital Tax Rate = Capital Gains Tax There will be those who state that an allowance needs to be made for inflation etc etc. To these I say rubbish. The capital gain is the capital gain, raw and simple. Don’t forget the more rules the more options for ripping the system. The family farm was bought in 1985 for say $500,000 and was sold in 2020 for say $4,000,000. Capital Improvements (As per Tax Law) were say $400,000 during that time. The rate of tax is 10%. Therefore the amount of Capital Gains Tax would be (4,000,000-(500,000 + 400,000)) x 10% = $310,000 Capital Gains Tax Perhaps this is overly simplistic but it does follow the KISS principle and severely limits the scope for abuse. In Summary In summary • Yes to a capital gains tax • Yes to making it stand alone • Yes to making it comprehensive • Yes to making it fair and simple. My challenge to the review group is Be Bold, be Radical in Thought and most importantly Be Brave. Dean Pratt Chartered Accountant

Submission to the New Zealand Tax Working Group My name is Eric Constantine, b. 1937, Manchester, England. I consider myself very fortunate in that I lived through the best period of the 20 th century, that is the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. I joined the Royal Navy in 1954 and served until 1964. Between 1965 and 1968 we managed to save the £200 deposit (10%) for our first home. In November 1974 my wife and I and our two children emigrated to New Zealand. In 1975 we were fortunate to obtain, by City Council ballot, our first section. By February 1976 we moved into our first New Zealand home. We had two mortgages, one for the land and the other for the house, the section was bare and we had little furniture but it was a start. My reason for mentioning the above is that while many people condemn past policies as old and outdated I believe there can be no question that they worked, and worked well, in a post war era. I also believe that a post-war progressive tax policy was at the heart of our good fortune. The war may not be the same but there is no denying that we are still at war, poverty, housing, health, climate, fresh water, air pollution, infrastructure, employment and wages etc, are today's battlefields. After reading the documentation there is no question that tax is a very complex issue. Today a wealthy person buys a property for $200,000, sells a year later for $250,000, profit $50,000, tax $0. A pensioner with a 1yr Term deposit at 3% receives $495 after 17.5% tax ($105) As stated I believe the major contribution to England’s post WW II was the progressive tax system. In New Zealand the progressive nature of taxation has gradually been eroded to the point where even politicians shy away from having their incomes progressively taxed. Politicians are, today, more concerned with themselves than with society as a whole and I include the Labour Party. I believe New Zealand needs a more progressive tax policy if it is to win today's battles, no minor skirmishing or poking round the edges. Some years back I compiled the following chart for one of my submissions. 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 $0 $5,000 $10,000 $15,000 $20,000 $25,000 $30,000 $35,000 0 Comparison Between Relative Tax & Poverty Coefficient 1985 to 2011 Relative TaxLinear Regression for Relative Tax GINI CoefLinear Regression for GINI Coef R e l a t i v e T a x G I N I C o e f While I don't have the resources today that I had then it would be interesting if a member of the working groups staff could bring it up to date. It would be more interesting if the salaries of politicians could be added to it, and would executive, private and local Government, salaries rise in proportion to the poverty coefficient? Please don't say they 'earn' them, they are either given to, or taken by, the recipients. For the record: I care not how affluent some may be, Provided none are disadvantaged as a consequence. Thomas Paine. Unfortunately far too many people today are disadvantaged. I support a more progressive tax on wealth/incomes in order to fight today's battles. Capital Gains Tax I support the concept of a Capital Gains Tax. I oppose a capital gains tax on the principle home. At one point in time I would have had no objection to anyone holding another 1 or 2 properties for their retirement provided all are held for a set period of time, 10yrs, 20yrs etc and have been maintained to a standard determined by Government. Today, in the interests of a clear, and progressive tax policy, I would reconsider my position to avoid any ambiguity. Remember: If I, as a pensioner, held a term deposit for 20 years I would still have to pay tax on the interest. Land Tax The following is based upon the Land Value based rating system of Palmerston North. While I fully support a Land Tax it will not work if it is not made robust enough to completely exclude all political interference both at Central and Local Government levels. In 1990 the Palmerston North City Council, in an effort to mitigate high rates on a number of properties made a change to the charges (which I supported at the time) following minor hiccups the system remained fairly balance for some 10yrs. In 2001 the Council was led by, and supported by, what I personally considered to be a neoliberal minded majority. Since then considerable efforts have been made to continue mitigating the rates for the wealthy by reducing the variable (land rate) and increasing the fixed rate (charges). Chart 1. Chart 1. This group of Councilors in their zeal to impose a greater burden on the less affluent continued to reduce the variable (land rate) benefiting the wealthy to such an extent that I calculated that the whole city would be on a “flat” rate in less than 9 years. Chart 2. Chart 2. At this point the City Council, in its wisdom, began to slowly, very slowly, increase the variable (land rate) (chart 1) while increasing the fixed (charges) even faster and therefore continuing to burden the less well off at a greater rate. The burden upon the poor, in Palmerston North, and the most vulnerable, was even further exacerbated by Quotable Value NZ in 2015. In 2015 the majority, if not all, commercial premises had their land values significantly reduced which in turn reduce their “General Rate” the following, Chart 3 is based upon those commercial premises situated in the city's main square. 1988/1989 1990/1991 1992/1993 1994/1995 1996/1997 1998/99 2000/01 2002/03 2004/05 2006/07 2008/09 2010/11 2012/13 2014/15 2016/17 2018/19 Rates Trend 1988 Onwards Fixed ChargeVariable Charge 1988/2003 2003/2008 051015202530354045 38.94 8.19 Palmerston North City Council Trend of Variable Rate Years to ZERO Chart 3. As the group can see these premises have paid, and continue to pay each year, less of a general rate than they did in 2015. This shortfall is taken up mainly by the poorer, more vulnerable and less affluent residential ratepayers (chart 1). Bear in mind that the above chart only applies to 13 of the city's commercial properties. A similar, but less drastic, effect was also applied to many in the Rural Sector where their Land Value remained static but the burden still has to be carried by the residential sector. As a result I believe that this year both the PNCC and Regional Council are taking advantage of that situation by applying higher rates, significantly increasing spending and significantly increasing debt. Horizons Regional Council, forced to introduce Capital Value rating by Central government who, by the way, would not apply it to government land, found it too onerous on the wealthy after 3 years and guess what, introduced fixed charges to mitigate wealthy properties. (Chart 4.) Note: Alternative, and minor, mitigating fixed charges, not shown, are often added they are usually based upon land area. It follows, that regardless of whether rates are charged on Land Value or Capital Value politicians, central or local, will abuse each system for either their own benefit or for the wealthy and the excuse, as always, to be fair, or as my city council would say “try to be fair”. Unfortunately, from my perspective, they never succeed and in fact fail quite miserably. In 1963 no one put their hand up when Capital Value rating was first suggested, and I believe, if memory serves, it was the Labour Party pushing it in the 1980s 12345678910111213 $0.00 $10,000.00 $20,000.00 $30,000.00 $40,000.00 $50,000.00 $60,000.00 $70,000.00 $80,000.00 Selected City Centre General Rate Reductions September 2015 Valuations 2015 Gen Rate2016 Gen Rate2017 Gen Rate2018 Gen rate Property Number G e n e r a l R a t e R e d u c t i o n Chart 4. As charts 1 and 4 clearly demonstrate the rating system(s), whether LV or CV, are clearly manipulated to benefit the wealthy, which includes politicians. Yes, taxation is a very complex issue, but who made it so? Personally I would like to take a greater interest in it but I have to spend so much time of what I have left fighting my local and regional councils. One last word, farming and commercial enterprises do not pay rates per se, they are an overhead, if a farmers rates go up he charges more for his product, when the commercial rates and costs go up they pass the charges to the consumer (and the local rate and tax payer), when the working persons rates go up they ... are stuck with them. Government has devolved responsibility to the private sector for employment, wages, housing and poverty. In response to Amy Adams, Dominion, 15/3/18, p,A10, it isn't the amount of tax that is important, it is where it comes from and to whom the national wealth is distributed to. Thank you for this opportunity, Unfortunately I did not learn of this process until a few days ago but if I can provide any further information on my local rating system please do not hesitate. Palmerston North was the first borough to introduce Land Value rating following its initial proposal by Central Government in the early 20 th century and after much discussion in the latter part of the 19 th century. Thank you again.

The rest of you? Not to much. (Photo: Screenshot/HBO) Comedian John Oliver pulled no punches (well, he pulled a few) during Sunday night's episode of "Last Week Tonight," especially in the feature segment in which he eviscerated the U.S. tax system by revealing just how endlessly favorable it is to corporations and the wealthy at the expense of everybody else. Citing last year's massive tax giveaway to the rich, which will ultimately raise taxes on tens of millions lower-income families, Oliver says, "We just had a huge chance to reform our tax code and we absolutely blew it." As The Week details, Oliver goes on to pillory the ability for corporations to avoid taxes by exploiting loopholes and a worldwide web of tax shelters: Oliver walked through the "long and infuriatingly proud history" of corporate tax avoidance, with a special nod to Apple and Google for being top "innovators in weaselly accounting," though GE and other huge companies paid zero federal taxes for much of this century. The new tax bill does force some of those companies to pay taxes on money stashed overseas, but at bargain rates — a gamble that did not pay off in terms of job creation in 2004, and probably won't this time either, Oliver said.

Bernie Sanders by Jake Johnson, staff writer Representing just how much he "gives a crap" about working people or upholding signature campaign promises, President Donald Trump holds up his fingers in the Roosevelt Room at the White House on March 8, 2018. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) As if his enormous tax cuts for the rich, attacks on the safety net, and efforts to help bosses steal their employees' tips weren't proof enough, President Donald Trump further demonstrated that he "does not give a crap about working people" on Thursday by telling lawmakers he is considering rejoining the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade pact he withdrew from last year and repeatedly derided as "terrible." "It's a ridiculous reversal and a slap in the face to the hard-working Americans Trump promised to fight for. TPP is a lousy deal." —Sen. Elizabeth Warren In a statement responding to the news that Trump has directed his top economic adviser Larry Kudlow and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to examine options for reentering the 11-nation accord, Lori Wallach of Public Citizen argued that the president's move "could bring short term joy to Democratic campaign operatives" but would be yet another signal that Trump "cannot be trusted on anything." While Republicans like Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) were quick to celebrate the president's step toward reentering an agreement analysts have said would reward corporations at the expense of workers and the environment, progressive lawmakers and union leaders decried Trump's TPP directive as a potentially disastrous "step in the wrong direction." "In a series of broken promises Trump made to the working people of this country, rejoining the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership would be the biggest yet," warned Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in a tweet on Thursday. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) also weighed in, calling Trump's move "a ridiculous reversal and a slap in the face to the hard-working Americans Trump promised to fight for." Negotiated under a veil of strictly-enforced secrecy by the Obama administration and so-called trade advisory committees stocked with corporate representatives, the TPP was never really even about establishing conditions for "free trade," as numerous analysts have noted. Rather, as The Intercept's Zaid Jilani argued, the pact is primarily aimed at "protecting corporate profits" by "crafting regulatory regimes that benefit certain industries." The deal—which was signed in March by 11 Asia-Pacific nations amid fierce grassroots opposition—is particularly generous to Big Pharma, as it "expands monopoly protections and patents for various pharmaceutical drugs," Jilani observed. Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, concluded in a 2016 analysis that "the TPP is a deal about redistributing more income upward" "It's imposing more competition on those at the middle and the bottom while maintaining and increasing forms of protectionism that benefits those at the top," Baker wrote. "The TPP is a protectionist pact for those at the top who are worried that free trade will undermine their income—like it did for those at the middle and bottom."

Taxing Charities on Retained Earnings Dear sir/Madam, The focus of my submission is on what I describe as ‘Corporate Charities’ Those charities that function as quasi corporate entities and enjoy tax free status to enable them to grow and expand due to not having to pay 28% corporate tax on profits. That is $280,000 of tax revenue on each $1m of profit made.. Our research is not complete but will continue to include non Iwi based Corporate Charities to ascertain the current asset values , the rates of growth and the revenue loss through non contribution of tax. The tax free status of iwi has been granted in perpetuity and based on our initial research on growth rates , the asset base is expanding at faster than the economy is growing. Iwi have an advantage over other commercial operators because of this benefit. This extends to establishing a business because they can undercut and still be profitable. In the longer term this is undesirable for the NZ economy especially as growth rates are considerably higher than other business who are restrained by tax. Iwi and other corporate Charities use infrastructure for free that has ben pai d for over the years by wage and salary earners and corporates who continue to do. Our first world infrastructure is a result of all New Zealanders paying their fair share over the years. When corporate Iwi expand or take over previously tax paying businesses they diminish the tax base by converting them from taxpayers to tax takers . For example Ngai Tahu’s purchase of a large share in Hilton Haulage Ltd which was previously contributing tax to the economy but is no longer. This loss of revenue must be made up by others. This is unfair on New Zealanders. The perpetual tax free status will become a burden to our economy by eroding greater amounts of revenue from areas where it is needed most such as health, education, welfare, defence, infrastructure, investment etc. As a small country competing for its place in the world we face profound challenges , not the least of which will be major threats to traditional economic models of primary production and manufacturing. As the world transit ions to a greener, more cyclical economy with high levels of technology and automation replacing millions of jobs, we will need everyone and every entity to be contributing to the national coffers. Our research to date has not investigated the revenue loss from multi nationals underpaying tax within New Zealand . Nor have we considered the implications of a tax free status on future law changes. For example, if a capital gains tax is introduced does this mean Iwi and other charities are exempt? Are they exempt from all taxes, Road user charges, GST, capital gains, income tax, sales tax, rates customs duty etc. All of these taxes fuel the economy so why should such a large group not pay its share yet enjoy the benefits? I fully accept the need for redress with treaty settlements to put to rest historic injustices but we must move on as one nation and one system. I also accept that Iwi provide an important role in providing assistance and charitable objects for iwi members. I am not suggesting that tax be paid by Iwi on income that is distributed for charitable objects but that tax is paid in some form on retained earnings . The difficulty posed by a retrospective revision of the deeds of settlement will be the removal of an eternal tax free benefit to be replaced by something which is perceived as less desirable by Iwi. The problem will only grow \[1\] 2 if not addressed because Iwi assets are growing at a faster rate . Our future research will focus on current revenue loss , current asset base values and future projected asset values and future revenue loss to New Zealand. The current settlement amount is over NZ$4Billion and growing, this is not the current asset value but the amount paid out by tax payers . The income off this is yet to be researched as will be the distributed and retained earnings. We will also focus on non Iwi based Charities, who in many cases are functioning as corporates behind the ‘tax free’ veil. For example Sanitarium health Foods and numerous others. We live in a changing world and as New Zealanders we must look after ourselves and support future generations, all must contribute regardless of being an individual , an Iwi or a multi national. It’s the fair thing to do and that’s the New Zealand way. Thank you. Ernest Duval. The information contained in this mail message is confidential and may be subject to legal privilege.

Responses to Questions Future of Tax Submission Submitted 21 April 2018 To: submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz From: ​Martin Taylor, Chapter 2: The future environment Chapter 3: Purposes and principles of a good tax system Principles for assessment Defining ‘fairness' Chapter 4: The current New Zealand tax system Frameworks Taxes and behaviour Retirement savings Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system Fairness and balance Tax and business Chapter 6: Thinking outside the current system Chapter 7: Specific challenges Housing affordability Capital gains tax Land tax Environmental taxation Progressive company tax GST exemptions for particular goods Chapter 2: The future environment What do you see as the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system over the medium- to long-term? Which of these are most important? ● Wealth concentration in fewer hands with a smaller share of income from wages. ● Tax avoidance facilitated by mobile capital and favouring the wealthiest with the resources to minimise tax. \[1\] ●A higher proportion of non-workers or underutilised workers due to age- and technology-related causes. The most important opportunity is to use the tax system, through changes to what is taxed and redistributive measures, to reduce wealth and income inequality. This will produce both a stronger, more stable society and a stronger economy. How should the tax system change in response to the risks, challenges, and opportunities you have identified? ●Boost the share of land and financial transaction taxes which will (a) be harder to avoid and (b) be progressive so that those with greater wealth (not necessarily just greater income) pay a greater share of taxes, and (c) discourage financial speculation, especially NZD currency speculation. ●Tax foreign-domiciled online businesses based on NZ revenue share rather than profits. ●Reintroduce inheritance taxes as a way to fund the health and pension systems from asset-rich elderly, with the attendant benefit of countering intergenerational inequality from inherited wealth. How could tikanga Māori (in particular manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, and kaitiakitanga) help create a more future-focussed tax system? No view. Chapter 3: Purposes and principles of a good tax system Principles for assessment What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? ●Progressiveness​ – those with most income and wealth should pay a proportionately higher share, in line with wealth share rather than just declared income. As well as increasing fairness, this will reduce much of the unproductive speculative investment – such as housing – which exploded after tax cuts drove big increases in after-tax income for high earners. These were justified on the now-discredited theory that it would drive productive investment and the benefits would “trickle-down”. The evidence suggests that this tax strategy drove neither the big boost in productive investment nor the trickle-down of its benefits. ●Adequacy to fund high quality, universally available public infrastructure and services​. This will be higher than the recent government size of 30% of GDP. Our recent history shows this level has degraded physical and social infrastructure and deferred essential maintenance and replacement. There is no proven causal connection between economic performance and size of government (comparing developed economies) while there is ample evidence of poorer social performance where the government share is artificially reduced. ●Difficulty of avoiding tax​. This is achievable through what is taxed (eg fixed land vs mobile income), how tax is levied (eg on online sales to Kiwis, rather than profits of the foreign-domiciled owners of these websites). ●Reducing negative behaviours​. For instance, a financial transaction tax such as a Tobin tax could (1) reduce speculative trading of the NZD which probably accounts for some of its over-valuation, and (2) potentially help fight an attack on the NZD, particularly if the legislation to introduce it also gave the Reserve Bank Governor or Finance Minister emergency powers to temporarily increase the Tobin tax rate. Defining ‘fairness' How would you define ‘fairness' in the context of the tax system? What would a fair tax system look like? ●Progressive income tax​. The higher taxes on high earners don’t necessarily have to be just from high marginal income tax rates. High earners might, for instance, shoulder a bigger share of land, capital gains or financial transaction taxes. ●Reduce regressive taxes on low income earners​. Reward hard work and enterprise by having much higher income thresholds at the lower end before income tax is levied or benefits/tax credits abated. Low income earners are paying a disproportionate share of GST, fuel taxes, excise taxes, etc so are still contributing to the tax system, but the regressive abatement regime means they are heavily disincentivized to get off benefits or increase part-time work hours. ●Capture more tax on capital​. Rebalance the system to properly reflect the size, concentration and growth of wealth in the economy. ●Few deductions for individual taxpayers or trusts​. A complex tax system penalises those who can’t afford expensive advisors and favours those who can. ●Share value gains from public actions​. Where gains result from public investments or law changes, such as land rezoning or public infrastructure investment, the windfall gains should be shared with the public, not 100% privatised. A value-capture land tax would be an example. Chapter 4: The current New Zealand tax system Frameworks New Zealand's ‘broad-based, low-rate' system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. Looking to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? If not, what approach should replace it? ●Broaden this ‘broad base’ further to capture more from assets (especially property) and financial transactions, especially foreign currency trading. ●Increase the ‘low rate’ at the top end, either by income tax increases or by a higher share of new taxes such as land taxes being paid by the higher earners and wealthier. Taxes and behaviour Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes? Yes, taxes should have a role in modifying behaviour, in particular: ●Financial speculation, especially currency​. Introduce a Tobin tax or similar, possibly with different rates on the buy and sell side. Make it deductible for GST-registered NZ businesses. Give emergency powers to the Reserve Bank Governor or Finance Minister to hike rates temporarily if the NZD comes under attack. It could potentially be introduced in Labour’s first term with an initial rate of 0%, allowing it initially to sit on the books as an emergency mechanism. ●Public health​. A sugary drink tax could be levied but would have to be levied at a high rate with the purpose of changing behaviour, not raising revenue. A low rate won’t change behaviour materially and will be used as ammunition to “prove” that such taxes don’t work. The income from a tax like this should be hypothecated and spent with the same general public health goals in order to make it more popular and effective. ●Property speculation​. Asset and capital gains taxes can moderate speculative behavior but they should be designed and levied primarily for their benefits to a fair, broadly-based tax collection system. The behavioural change should be a (highly desirable) byproduct, not the primary driver of their design. Retirement savings Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? Yes. ●Reduce private indebtedness so that people can save​. Driving down house prices relative to incomes is the main opportunity for change. This will reduce mortgage debt (both interest and principal repayments) which drains cash available for saving. To achieve this, it will be essential to better manage the years of excessive bank credit creation directed almost entirely at the home mortgage market. This in turn will only be achievable if the government participates directly in new money creation that is currently the sole domain of private banks. Without this change, the destructive cycle we’ve been in for years will continue: a growing economy needs to increase the money supply, this comes almost exclusively from private banks who pump it into the economy primarily via home mortgage lending and consumer credit. This leads to even higher levels of private debt, making saving harder, and creating a boom-bust economy as consumers periodically deleverage. ●Increase public spending​. There is a clear relationship between government surpluses pushing up household indebtedness. This is logical when a government’s surplus takes money out of the economy and (under the present system) this must be put back via more private borrowing to avoid a recession. This needs to stop — by less fretting about government debt, and having the government participate directly in new money creation so that not all new money increases indebtedness. With strict rules and transparent oversight, this can be conducted in a manner that is more responsible than the private bank credit creation system which has produced a massive debt bubble, a housing crisis, inequality and political crises that we are seeing today. Government money creation in a mature, well-governed democracy such as New Zealand can reduce private debt, increase private savings, reduce the amount of tax needed, and strengthen the public sphere. ●Make long-term/lifetime renting feasible and desirable through security of tenure​. When renting is as good as ownership from a family security point of view, more people will choose to invest in non-property assets such as financial assets, boosting the savings rate. (The German example shows massive financial wealth in a country with 40% home ownership and strong tenancy protections that underpin the social stability.) Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system Fairness and balance Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? No. ●The primary distortion is housing price inflation which drains resources from the productive sector as well as undermining social stability. This is driven partly by preferential tax treatment but primarily by excessive bank credit creation at a time that coincided with tax reductions at the top end and the rise of two-income households. Taxes should be levied on capital gains generated from business income such as residential property investment. ●Another distortion has arisen from reducing the share of after tax income in the hands of the low to middle income earners and increasing the share in the higher earners, eg as a result of the halving of the top tax rate. This has reduced the economic benefit that flows from a boost to lower income households who primarily spend that extra income on goods and services that boost the economy rather than the speculative and debt-driven economy. Tax and business Does the tax system do enough to minimise costs on business? Anything that reduces compliance costs without increasing avoidance/evasion would be welcome. Does the tax system do enough to maintain natural capital? No. Significant environmental costs are either socialised or ignored and, combined with decades of general public underinvestment from the “small government” era, has led to depletion and degradation of natural capital. Are there types of businesses benefiting from low effective tax rates because of excessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income? ●Property investment which fails to tax capital income adequately. ●Tax regimes that favour debt-fueled company takeovers and highly leveraged balance sheets. These undermine the long-term health of companies, and undermine the efforts of prudent company owners and managers to have strong balance sheets and cash flow by making them takeover targets. Chapter 6: Thinking outside the current system What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? Which of these inconsistencies are most important to address? The inconsistencies between: ●Tax paid by NZ companies and tax paid by foreign multinationals ●Tax paid by NZ individuals vs non-domiciled individuals and foreign entities using NZ vehicles to avoid/minimise tax in NZ or in their own countries. Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Yes. ●Financial transaction tax​, especially on NZD currency trading. ●Inheritance tax​ which will help to finance end-of-life health and pension costs without causing cash flow problems to the asset-rich, low-income elderly. In addition, it will play a role in tackling intergenerational concentrations of wealth. ●Land tax​ levied on developed and undeveloped land. ●Land value capture tax​. ●Capital gains tax​ with teeth on residential property investment. Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? ●The overall tax take should increase. There should be no requirement to offset all new taxes with tax reductions elsewhere. ●The primary area to reduce taxes (and abatements which operate like taxes from a behavioural point of view) is at the low income end where beneficiaries and part-time workers are heavily disincentivized from improving their circumstances by the 50-80% EMTRs. Chapter 7: Specific challenges Housing affordability How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? Yes, there is a case to change the tax regime on housing, particularly by increasing tax on capital profits though it’s likely their impact on price will be modest. However, as already noted, there is a strong case for capital taxes on housing, independent of its impact on affordability. The primary driver of housing price inflation is excessive bank lending into the housing sector and this has to be addressed by constraining bank credit as discussed above. Capital gains tax Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have? Yes. It should primarily be introduced in order to broaden the tax base and make it fairer by capturing capital profits on similar terms to income. As a secondary benefit, it might slow house price inflation a little but this would be a happy side-effect rather than the primary goal in introducing it. Land tax Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? Yes. It should be levied on both developed and undeveloped land, and farmland, with a higher rate payable on undeveloped urban land. A land value capture tax should be available to share windfall gains that result from public investment or legislative change. Environmental taxation What are the main opportunities for effective environmental taxation? A carbon tax​. We should tax carbon directly rather than have an ETS. A carbon tax will produce taxation income for NZ, unlike tradable emissions credits which send a lot of money offshore with limited direct investment in fixing the environment here. The ETS is also open to abuse as has been seen already, and financial speculation divorced from the real world environmental issues. Progressive company tax Should the tax system do more to support small businesses? In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax? Yes. Capping the company tax rate to the tax rate of shareholder employees could encourage leaving more profits in the business to fund investment and growth. GST exemptions for particular goods Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from GST? If so, what should be excluded? What else should be taxed to make up for the lost revenue? No. But there is room for hypothecation of GST collected on some classes of goods such as fresh fruit and vegetables which can be spent directly on the public health goals that their existence hinders. This can be done, for instance, by an electronic ‘food stamp’ programme that directs the money collected from GST to the purchase of fresh fruit and vegetables for children in low income households.

Page 1 of 29 SUBMISSION TO TAX WORKING GROUP From: Geoff Cole Date: 22nd April 2018 "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." The phrase is widely attributed to Gainesville, Georgia-born Thomas Bertram Lance, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget during Jimmy Carter's Presidency. Apparently Bert Lance believed he could save Uncle Sam billions if he could get the government to adopt the motto, "If it ain't broken, don't fix it!" He went on to explain, "That's the trouble with government: Fixing things that aren't broken and not fixing things that are broken." In February 2018 it was reported that he New Zealand government's operating surplus was bigger than expected in the first six months of the 2018 financial year as low unemployment and upbeat consumer sentiment helped GST and income taxes continue to track ahead of forecast. The above was not an isolated instance but another tick on this country’s very good financial report card over a number of years. Overall, the current level of tax revenue, including local government rates, is equivalent to 32% of gross domestic product (GDP), which is slightly below the OECD average of 34% of GDP. This more than it should be and the Tax Working Group should be looking at how to get this figure even lower. This submission is about let us not fix things that aren’t broken but let us fix things that are. And there ain’t many things either way. Our Tax System The NZ Treasury claim in their ‘Tax policy Priorities’ (March 2012) that: To be internationally competitive, the tax system must... • Raise enough revenue to meet government spending • Support taxpayer decisions that direct effort and resources to where they are most valuable • Contribute to wider government goals • Tax income at relatively low rates, to help keep New Zealand an attractive place for people to work, save, invest and establish businesses • Operate in a consistent manner that creates certainty for taxpayers • Be fit for a small open economy with one of the most internationally mobile labour forces Page 2 of 29 • Be relatively cheap to comply with and administer In short, our tax system must be fair, balanced, simple, cost effective and administered well. This submission covers the following topics: 1. Income Distribution and Growing Inequality 2. Wealth Tax 3. Goods and Services Tax \[GST\] 4. Taxing Tourists 5. Taxing Foreign Investments – Australian Ones In Particular 6. Tax Relief For Research & Development (R & D) 7. Housing Affordability 8. Tax Relief for Health Insurance for the Elderly 9. Capital Gains Tax \[CGT\] Page 3 of 29 1. Income Distribution and Growing Inequality The spiralling upwards in the size of remuneration packages for Chief Executive Officers (CEO) and senior management is a disgrace. The concentration of incomes at the top is not only bad governance but can result in stagnant and even falling wage rates at lower levels. This situation can impact on housing affordability, especially when housing supply is stretched, as well as engender feelings of discontent and anger by those who feel their position is becoming increasingly hopeless. If those who determine and award these ludicrous remuneration packages will not act then other measures should be investigated. For example: Higher tax on ‘super’ sized salaries. The ‘Otago Daily Times’ (1 November 2017) reported as follows: Otago University Business School Accountancy and Finance researcher Dr Helen Roberts’ longitudinal study, which adjusted for inflation, showed the proportion of CEOs paid over $500,000 per year had also increased approximately five-fold across three different compensation measures. It showed chief executives were now paid 30 to 50 times more than the average wage of $60,000. Almost half of New Zealand chief executives now earned at least $500,000 as the cash component of their compensation package in 2013, compared to only 10% of CEOs in 1997. However, cash only represented some of the picture and total compensation and real wealth had more than doubled since the research began, with considerable change recorded in the last decade. In real terms, mean total CEO compensation was up 114% in 17 years, while mean real worker income is up 26%, confirming there is a widening gap between the CEO’s income and that of their workers. The ever-widening pay ratio is an international trend - the CEO pay ratio in the United States for instance is typically between 300 and 500, but in some cases exceeds 1000 times that of the average wage. The highest paid executive of a listed New Zealand company this year is Fonterra CEO Theo Spierings, who received an $8.32 million salary package. Mr Spierings’ 2017 base salary was $2.463m, plus benefits of $170,036, short-term incentive pay of $1.832m and long-term incentive pay of $3.855m, which worked out to an annual increase of 78.5%. Dr Roberts also tracked the economic performance of the CEO’s company alongside remuneration, to give an objective overview of the link between CEO performance bonuses and company’s annual results. “This clearly demonstrates an overall trend of marked growth over time which is not on the same trajectory as the economic ups and downs of publicly listed companies in New Zealand, nor worker salaries.” Income fluctuated from one year to the next, but while some downturns, like the Global Financial Crisis, for example, dampened the increases, they still rose. Page 4 of 29 The remuneration of CEO’s in the public sector situation is also a disgraceful. It should be remembered that it was not so long ago that local authority CEO’s were called Town Clerks. Nick Truebridge focussed on Christchurch in an item for ‘Stuff’ (9 December 2017) when he wrote the following. It would be a fair assumption to say that Christchurch would not be the only city in New Zealand to be so afflicted. Christchurch's public sector CEO salaries revealed Enable chief executive Steve Fuller earned $808,000 last financial year – that's $338,000 more than Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. Fuller, who heads the Christchurch City Council-owned fibre broadband company, took home a fixed salary of $441,000 and performance-based pay totalling $367,000. Lyttelton Port chief executive Peter Davie, Christchurch's highest paid public boss, took home $955,000 – a fixed salary of $597,000 and incentive payments of $209,000 and $149,000. He is forecast to earn $961,000 next year. Paying council employees a living wage of $20.20, which will benefit 470 staff, will cost the city $775,000 a year. At lines company Orion, Rob Jamieson made $628,000 in the last financial year, while his counterpart at Christchurch Airport, Malcolm Johns, got $721,000, including a base of $600,000, an "at-risk" salary of $100,000 and Kiwisaver contributions of $21,000. Lyttelton Port Company chief executive Peter Davie earned two incentive payments of $209,000 and $149,000 in addition to his fixed salary of $597,000 last financial year. British Prime Minister Theresa May is on just over NZ$296,600. City Care chief executive Onno Mulder raked in $710,000 – a $547,000 base topped with an incentive payment of $163,000. Fuller, Davie, Jamieson, Johns and Mulder are among Christchurch's most well-paid public sector leaders. The companies they work for are either wholly or partially- owned by Christchurch City Holdings Limited (CCHL). Councillor Yani Johanson wants an overhaul of the way public sector chief executive salaries are set. The Public Service Association (PSA) argues the public sector has been sucked into paying private sector wages, but the Canterbury Employers' Chamber of Commerce (CECC) says it is "absolutely" important to keep these pay packets competitive in the open market. PSA national secretary Glenn Barclay says the shift to private sector practices has happened for about 20 years. "We've been sucked into the private sector argument that . . . these are the salaries you've got to pay to attract the right kind of chief executives because it's a global market and that's what they're worth.” Page 5 of 29 Canterbury Employers' Chamber of Commerce chief executive Leeann Watson says public salaries need to remain competitive to attract top talent. "We obviously think that there are problems with that," he says. There are "numerous examples" of private sector bosses securing bonuses even when their company's performance "isn't that great or is even going down the gurgler". "But for the public sector to buy into it as well is completely wrong. The public service element is what should drive the setting of salaries. "Our members, by and large, they come to work for public sector organisations because they want to help, they want to make a difference. "It's a well- established factor known as the public service contribution and we think that should apply to chief executives as well," Barclay says. CECC chief executive Leeann Watson offers a different opinion. "We've got some big challenges ahead of us as a city, so we should absolutely be making sure that those salaries are competitive in the market to attract the very best people and the right talent for the job." Barclay says the public and private sector "shouldn't necessarily be in the same market". "Going back to the state sector reforms, and local government got caught up in a bit of this as well back \[in\] the 80s and 90s, there was the idea that we needed as much movement as possible between the private and public sectors. "I wouldn't dismiss that, but I do think that what's more important is the notion of the career public service – the people who are doing well in that get promoted over time and they're the ones who understand the public sector, who understand the concept of public service and the importance of the public service ethic," he says. Watson, despite being supportive of offering competitive public salaries in the open market, believes there needs to be a balance. "They do need to strike a balance, but that's a hard role for any organisation to take when you are trying to make sure that you provide a competitive salary package when you are being compared to others in the market place. "Absolutely there is a difference between big corporate organisations and your state-owned enterprises, so I think there is a balance. "But that has to be also balanced with actually putting something competitive out there in the marketplace to attract the right people, so that we can actually get the job done that we need to get done across the city," Watson says. She has views on another feature of the city's 12 highest-paid public professionals, just two of whom – Christchurch City Council boss Karleen Edwards (on $402,900 a year) and Christchurch NZ chief executive Joanna Norris (on $325,000 a year) – are women. "We have to make sure that we've got the right people in the right roles with the right skill set, regardless of gender. "I think it's always a bit disappointing to see the lack of women in leadership positions. "But actually I think as a region we do pretty well and we're starting to see more women in leadership positions and that's something that I'm pretty passionate about," Watson says. Page 6 of 29 Yani Johanson and Aaron Keown were on opposite sides of post-earthquake Christchurch's most high profile chief executive salary debate. The public sector boss in question was Tony Marryatt. Councillors eventually approved his $68,129 pay rise in December, 2011, boosting his annual salary to $538,529. Marryatt was controversial. Christchurch business leaders raised concerns over his operating style and questioned his reappointment process. He was criticised for his involvement in the Ellerslie International Flower Show purchase, the proposed Arts Centre music conservatorium and the $17 million purchase of five properties owned by developer David Henderson. Johanson was firmly against the increase and continues to speak out against large public pay packets. "I have repeatedly requested, when I was on CCHL and also on council, for a complete overhaul of how CEO pay is set. "There needs to be a different way of doing CEO public sector pay." Johanson does not pull punches when assessing current remuneration levels, calling the system "unfair" and "out of touch". "I think the issue for me is we've seen a huge rise in inequality in our society over the last few decades and that's been exacerbated by this sort of situation," Johanson says. He asks a fundamental question – how much is a person worth? "When you start to see some of the figures that are being paid, it's absolutely extraordinary in my view to think that would be necessary for someone to do the job. "That's in no way a criticism or an attack on anyone that's doing the job. "I think as elected members and as boards there needs to be a degree of accountability back to the people who are setting these levels of remuneration," he says. Johanson wants to see a system of relativity between those at the bottom of an organisation and those at the top, rather than the current system, which he says compares those at the top with those at the top. "Effectively, you compare the ease of \[how\] some of these salaries seem to be set, versus the struggle to get a living wage paid to those people at the bottom," he says. Keown was on the other side of the Marryatt debate. He voted for the salary increase. At one stage, he was almost barred from helping appoint the council's next chief executive when Christchurch investment adviser and businessman Tim Howe lodged an injunction after concerns over Keown's public support for the incumbent, Marryatt. His support of Marryatt continues to be a bit of a noose around his neck, he says. "People bring it up all the time. "But for me at the time, Tony's \[increase\] was just pay parity – that's what other people in the same position as him were getting paid," Keown says. "The bit that I didn't enjoy about that whole experience was why don't we go after all CEOs? Why is one person getting singled out?" Marryatt's increase was in line with other city chief executives, including then- Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority boss Roger Sutton, who was on $500,000. Page 7 of 29 However, Keown believes there should be a cap on what public sector bosses are paid. "There should really be a limit to what they get paid, because isn't there a level of public service involved?" he asks, pointing to current leaders who have taken pay cuts to enter the public sector. "They've gone from being multi-millionaires to try and make their country a better place. "Look at America at the moment, I'm sure Donald Trump made way more doing property," he says. Stuff Recent news media reports have indicated that senior Plunket managers are now embroiled in ‘the toxic problem of excessive executive pay.’ Showing that the matter has now spread from the corporate to the voluntary sector. Disgraceful. Recommendation: This is ‘broken’. Fix it! Page 8 of 29 2. Wealth Tax The purpose of tax is to raise revenue NOT pander to the politics of envy. New Zealand already has a tax on wealth. It is called rates and is levied on almost all real property. The higher the value of your chunk of real estate the more rates (i.e. taxes) you pay plus you pay GST as well. Other than real estate wealth can take on an almost infinite variety of forms. From fine art to vintage airplanes; from rare stamps to ingots of gold; bank deposits to celebrity autographs. Imagine the army of experts the IRD would need to employ to: (a) find this wealth (b) assess the value of it, and (c) actually collect the tax. On the other side of the fence would be an army of tax experts that would be employed to thwart the fiscal fiends. Just what this country really needs! New Zealand used to have a wealth tax – it came in the guise of death duties. In the 1990 election campaign, National promised, among much else, to abolish estate duty, and in 1993 they fulfilled that promise. The justification offered by the Minister of Revenue, was that estate duty was easy to avoid and therefore capricious. Nothing has changed. In the UK they have death duties but they are called an inheritance tax and it is paid if a person's estate (their property, money and possessions) is worth more than £325,000 when they die. It doubles to £650,000 for a married couple - as long as the first person to die leaves their entire estate to their partner. The current rate is an eye watering 40%. There is also the possibility of double taxation. Suppose you win $5 million in a lottery and deposit the money into a bank term deposit carrying an interest rate of 3.5%. You will pay tax on the $175,000 of interest earned. Fair enough but then along comes a wealth tax and takes a whack off your $5 million. A real vote catcher this one. New Zealand has a low wage economy with poor productivity. A wealth tax is unlikely to encourage savings and investment and so build prosperity for its people. Recommendation: A wealth tax is a nonsense. Forget it. Move on. Page 9 of 29 3. Goods and Services Tax \[GST\] “New Zealand’s GST is the most efficient Value Added Tax (VAT) in the world.” {NZ Treasury ‘Tax Policy Priorities’ March 2012}. This is largely due to its design, comprising a single rate with very few exemptions and being a low-cost tax. This is a clever tax as it is simple, pretty much unavoidable, easy to understand and inexpensive to collect. It is paid by everyone including the highly paid, high nett worth individuals. Data may well show that the wealthy not only earn more but also spend a lot more and so are good GST contributors. Tourists pay GST. Approximately $1.5 billion a year according to Chris Roberts, Chief Executive, Tourism Industry Aotearoa. This is half a billion dollars more than Shane Jones’s pork pie Provincial Growth Fund. The Government is missing out on some GST revenue through overseas internet shopping. Although this is likely to change as the previous Government had already commenced work on such a proposal and significant progress has already been made with Customs, Inland Revenue and Treasury. It would be a shame if the current Government was to abandon this work on the flimsy pretext of being accused of ‘copy-cat’ or ‘stealing’ policy. Australia are about to implement a so called ‘Amazon Tax’. Observing their experience may well be useful. If the Tax Working Group really want to have a fiddle and suggest something over and above the ‘Amazon Tax’ then they might like think about increasing the GST rate to say 20%. Certainly do not consider complicating the system by exempting certain goods and services. The anguish of a GST increase that may impact on the lower paid could be mitigated via suitable adjustments to the welfare benefit system. Recommendations: (a) Consideration be given to the idea of introducing an ‘Amazon’ tax; BUT (b) Our GST system ain’t broken so no need to fix it! Page 10 of 29 4. Taxing Tourists Throughout New Zealand the growth in tourism is pressuring local authorities to provide a scale and quality of facilities that surpasses the needs of the local population and their ability to pay. The key issue is that the costs and benefits of tourism are spread unevenly. An estimated $14.5 billion annually comes from tourists into central Government coffers via GST, income and company taxes. The costs however are borne locally and local authorities have to go begging to central Government for money. Yet another example of the socialisation of profits with losses carried by individuals. Local authorities are seeking the ability to charge tourists to help pay for the local infrastructure that they use. Currently the only tool local authorities have is the blunt instrument of a special rate on accommodation and hospitality. Some form of local mechanism is required. The question is “What?” In this regard the local authorities and local tourism operators are perhaps the best people to provide practical and sustainable solutions. Passenger service and facility charges levied at the border are a much less complex matter. Travellers all around the world face an increasingly complex web of taxes and they have different names under different jurisdictions. In general the departure & arrival taxes have morphed into various passenger service or facility charges; Border Clearance Levy; Fuel Surcharges; Bio & other security charges, Air Passenger Duty; Passenger Movement Charge; etc. They now tend to be included in the air or cruise ship fare. It is claimed, for example by UHY Hacker Young (31 October 2016), that ‘the financial burden of such taxes stifles tourism, hampers economic competitiveness and puts regional airports at a considerable disadvantage.’ This may well be so for countries that are not over 2,100 km from their nearest neighbour and have many more international ports and airports often in close proximity to each other. Choice is not a luxury New Zealanders enjoy in this regard. International visitor arrivals in the year ended January 2018 were in excess of 3.7 million. This was up 5% on the previous year and is forecast by MBIE to reach 4.9 million by 2023. Hardly a good case for the stifling of tourism argument and/or the hampering of economic competitiveness. It is understood that the Border Clearance Levy, when combined with existing charges, is about $NZ36 for a return flight - lower than Australia's A$55 (NZ$58) passenger charge and Britain's £71 (NZ $137) long-haul passenger charge. Clearly New Zealand’s levy is substantially less than either of the two examples. The levy is due for review and reset on 1 st July 2018. This tax is simple to understand, difficult to avoid, readily collected and imposes the burden where it should belong - on that of the traveller. An increase of say $10 (or $20 return) Page 11 of 29 represents only a small percentage of the total travel cost of those s arriving and / or leaving New Zealand. Recommendations: (a) Taxes on tourism while not broken need to be more focussed at the local level; AND (b) Consideration be given to a modest increase in border levies. Page 12 of 29 5. Taxing Foreign Investments – Australian Ones In Particular Mum and Dads who want to diversify their savings and invest in Australian company shares have many complex hurdles to jump and our Inland Revenue Department contributes significantly to this situation. The problem is even worse for investments outside Australia to the extent that many do not even bother as it is in the too hard basket. The prime investment focus for many New Zealanders is residential property. Governments appear to want this to change but have so far been largely ineffective. Maybe the big stick ain’t working and the carrot on a string trick may be worth a try. Investment gurus are forever encouraging investors to diversify into other vehicles such as company shares in a variety of activities in a spread of countries. The theory being to reduce the risk of significant loss. Unfortunately achieving these objectives is proving very difficult. The problem, apart from our low level of financial literacy, is the Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) regime administered by the Inland Revenue Department. The rules are so extremely complex that even tax accountants baulk at undertaking this work for clients. The FIF tax rules that were introduced around April 2007 and were aimed to encourage savings by low and middle income earners. It hasn’t worked. There are currently 13 companies that are incorporated or have a main place of operations in New Zealand that listed on the Australian stock exchange but not the New Zealand stock exchange. All 13 companies do not qualify for exemption from the draconian FIF regime. New Zealanders wanting to invest in these 13 New Zealand based companies are effectively told to go and look elsewhere. That is just plain dumb. If you want to invest a total of less than $NZ50, 000 in certain Australian company shares then the FIF regime is not an issue. Step away from this and the eyes mist over in total bewilderment. The reasons for this include: De Minimus Threshold: The figure of $NZ50, 000 is now too low and needs to be raised immediately to say $250,000. Certain Australian Companies: The IRD’s website provides the following information: List of companies that qualify for the exemption To assist investors in determining whether or not an Australian company satisfies the exemption criteria we'll provide a Australian share exemption list (IR871) for the relevant year. This is a list of companies from the ASX All Ordinaries index which we consider qualify for the exemption from the FIF rules. Investors with the standard balance date will be able to rely on the list and treat the investment as subject to tax under the general rules. We'll treat any investor who relies on the list as having taken reasonable care in taking that tax position and will not be subject to any shortfall penalty if the shortfall arises from errors in our list. When the list is available The Australian share exemption list (IR871) is issued as soon as possible following the end of the tax year on 31 March. Page 13 of 29 The reality is that IR871 is not now available. No reason is given for this but an on line tool is provided by IRD that replaces the IR871 list. It is frankly almost useless and poorly designed. But it gets worse. Investors wanting to spread their risk via Listed Investment Companies (LICs) are advised by IRD that: “Due to copyright restrictions over the FTSE AFSA Australia Listed Investment Companies (LIC) Index, we can't include LIC information in this tool. Contact the investment company or the FTSE to confirm whether your investment is part of the LIC Index.” There are over 90 LICs listed on the Australian stock exchange. Attempts by the submitter recently to obtain this information failed miserably. Only 3 out of 15 LIC’s Company Secretaries contacted bothered to reply and one of those that replied didn’t know what the FTSE AFSA Australia Listed Investment Companies (LIC) Index was. All in all not very encouraging. If the owners of the copyright are not prepared to license the use of their product then either scrap it or find something else. If the latter then something simple, readily found and understandable. Almost all of the LIC’s listed on the Australian stock exchange pay a dividend. As a result tax would be paid by holders of those LIC’s. So why bother with the FIF regime? It may in fact be possible that more tax would be collected on the dividend income than via the FIF regime without even taking all the bureaucratic paper work into account. Investing in shares is towards the upper end of the risk spectrum. Having uncertainty about the possible tax consequences makes it even more hazardous. Hence the attraction of property. If the Government want to shift investment away from residential property then the alternatives need to be made more attractive. New Zealanders wishing to invest in Exchange Traded Funds (ETF’s) listed on the Australian stock exchange are discouraged as none of the 175 or so available are on the so called exempt list. By way of comparison there are only about 25 ETF’s listed on the New Zealand stock exchange and the range to choose from is pretty much a waste of time. For many investors Kiwisaver is the beginning, middle and end. A choice of one is no choice at all especially as concern is being expressed over the high fees being charged. Diversification needs and greater financial literacy mean additional and / or other avenues become attractive. ASX listed LIC’s and ETF’s offer that opportunity but our tax system discourages such investments. Further, it gives the NZ stock exchange a significant advantage by default. The New Zealand stock exchange is minute and the variety of shares offered is miniscule. To obtain some semblance of diversification investing off shore is often recommended. The FIF regime makes achieving this not quite so easy. The value of all New Zealand shares on the main board is about $130 billion. This is about the market capitalisation of the big two Australian miners – BHP and Rio Tinto. Or about a 14% of Microsoft. Page 14 of 29 A future tend that the Tax Working group may wish to take cognizance of is the uptake of ETF’s by ‘millennials’ in the USA and more recently in Australia. Tony Kaye in “InvestSmart” of 15 March 2018 wrote: Australia’s exchange-traded funds market is evolving rapidly, with the take-up of ETFs products by younger investors accelerating and more financial planners actively recommending them to clients. It’s a trend that is being mirrored in the United States, where millennials (those born from the early 1980s through to the late 1990s) now account for more than 30 per cent of the $US4.8 trillion US ETFs market. What’s the big attraction for millennials? It simply comes down to the fact that ETFs offer easy diversification across different shares and markets, their low-cost structure, and the ability to buy and sell them just like any other stock. Data from US stockbroker Charles Schwab shows that 63 per cent of US millennials believe ETFs will be their primary investment vehicle in the future, versus only 23 per cent of Baby Boomers. This week, in Australia, research firm Investment Trends and ETFs product issuer BetaShares released their own findings on the booming domestic ETFs sector, showing a similar gravitation towards these products by younger investors including millennials. Indeed, their BetaShares/Investment Trends Annual ETF Report 2017 found that currently just over one in four ETF investors are retired, with the typical investor aged 49. Some of the key findings of the research include: • ETF investors are getting younger, with the average age of those who started investing in ETFs in the last 12 months 42. That’s well down on the average age of 56 among those who started investing in ETFs more than five years ago. • The ETF market has significant potential for further growth with the number of “next wave” ETF investors reaching record highs. Almost one third of these investors are millennials (those born from the early 1980s through to the late 1990s). • Diversification, cost-effectiveness and access to overseas markets are the top drivers of investing in ETFs. Recommendations: (a) Raise the $NZ50,000 De Minimus threshold to $NZ250,000; AND (b) Reinstate IR871 or find a replacement; AND (c) Include on the exempt list all ASX listed but New Zealand incorporated companies; AND (d) Include on the exempt list all ASX listed LIC’s and ETF’s. This is broken. Fix it. Page 15 of 29 6. Tax Relief For Research & Development (R & D) Many New Zealanders were delighted to learn of the new coalition government's goal of boosting spending on research and development, (R & D), to two per cent of GDP by 2027. According to the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), New Zealand's level of gross spending on R&D is just 1.3% - about half that of the OECD average of 2.4%. A very dismal effort. Good news is that according to a recent Statistics New Zealand's Business Operations Survey (Year ended August 2017), New Zealand businesses are investing more in their growth and research and development. The not so good news was that while the number of businesses carrying out R&D is at a 10-year high only 11 percent of firms are doing it. In terms of barriers to innovation, 18 percent claimed that the cost to develop or introduce innovation was an impediment and 17 percent cited a lack of management resources. The Government’s R&D policy is essentially a scrapping of the Callaghan Innovation Growth grants and replacing it from April 2019 with a 12.5% tax credit on companies' spending on research and development. Businesses would need to spend a minimum of $100,000 on eligible expenditure, within one year, to qualify. Apparently all other Callaghan Innovation grants and services will remain in place. However one needs to read the fine print to discover that this will be the case. It could be argued that that is of no consequence as nobody knows about them anyway. Five key difficulties are foreseen in implementing the new R & D tax incentive: Firstly, the 12.5% tax credit may not be enough and could be supplemented perhaps by a re- introduction of some of the grant programmes, (see below), of about a decade ago, suitably updated to reflect today’s environment and to remedy any perceived defects in the old grant system. Hindsight suggests that these grant / funding programmes were terminated prematurely and that whatever replaced them have been poorly directed and almost certainly not marketed with the consequence that they have been ineffectual in building R & D capability. New Zealand Trade & Enterprise Growth Services Fund (GSF) Provides co-funding support to medium- to high-growth potential firms to purchase external advice and expertise, marketing intelligence, and development services. Enterprise Development Grants for Market Development (EDG-MD) Provided co-funding support to help businesses enter a new export market, or carry out market research, or a new activity in an existing export market. The aim was to encourage greater integration of more New Zealand businesses into global markets. Technology New Zealand Grants for Private Sector Research and Development (GPSRD) This scheme provided assistance for small and medium-sized “technologically aware” firms to undertake research and development projects with potential to raise their technological capability. Page 16 of 29 Technology for Business Growth (TBG) This programme aimed to promote research and development and innovation by part- funding projects that enhance the technological capabilities of firms. Technology for Industry Fellowships (TIF) This provided assistance for placing researchers or technologists in firms to build links and encourage technological innovation. TechLink Provided technology guidance, strategic planning, and promotional services to stimulate awareness of technological innovation in firms. Secondly, there is doubt that we have enough researchers and that there will be a need for an increase in their number. Add to this the finding in a recent Statistics New Zealand's Business Operations Survey (Year ended August 2017), that 17 percent of those surveyed cited a lack of management resources as being a barrier to innovation. The number or researchers required probably means that foreign scientists, engineers, technologists, etc. will need to be recruited. They will not come for the low DIY No 8 wire research budgets that New Zealand offers or our mediocre salaries. In this regard the absence of a capital gains tax is important. It is one of our significant points of difference to other countries. Compensation by way of equity participation and/or employee shares can be offered in the event that the research results in marketable product(s). A capital gains tax is a deterrent against such ‘windfall’ remuneration or ‘sweat equity’ being devoted to riskier investments without the chance for reward. Few things are riskier than investing in a start-up company – and we need more investment in innovation. Other than remuneration attracting appropriate researchers will mean a huge marketing pitch on lifestyle, being in a politically stable country, having academic freedom, being in a collegial research environment and away from military / terrorist / street & drug gang conflict zones, etc. will be no doubt be necessary. Accommodating these people and their families will add more pressure to the housing demand unless emigration fixes it first. Thirdly, for most businesses cash flow is king. Many start-up innovative businesses do not make a profit for a number of years and so unless the R & D tax credit puts real money in the bank rather than a line or two on a balance sheet a tax credit is nigh on useless. To offset this a temporary grant scheme will be implemented to provide support for Growth Grant recipients with insufficient tax liability to use the R&D credit immediately. However, the Growth Grant scheme will be closed to new applicants on March 31, 2019. After this date? Go whistle dixie. Fourthly, New Zealand has very few businesses with large research budgets, and rebating what is really a small proportion, 12.5%, of an already small expenditure would do little to achieve the large-scale focused investment required to make a difference. For small to medium sized businesses 12.5% may prove, in dollar terms, to be so puny to be not worth the bother. In which case a well thought out grant programme to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship may be more successful. It will need to be marketed though. Page 17 of 29 Fifthly, In the Statistics New Zealand's Business Operations Survey (Year ended August 2017), 18% of businesses surveyed claimed that the cost to develop or introduce innovation was an impediment. Investing in R & D and producing your firm’s amazing widget is one thing commercialising it another. Grant programmes need to be available to businesses to assist them to get their amazing widgets on their pathway to market. One of the disappointing aspects of the Callaghan Innovative grants system is that New Zealand tax payer’s money is used to fund the grants yet the recipients are, once their project or development is or close to commercialised, are free to give overseas investors a better chance to buy equity than the New Zealand tax payer who funded their enterprise initially. For example: Volpara Health Technologies is listed on the ASX but not the NZX. Volpara has received grant funding from Callaghan to develop its software products designed to improve clinical decision making and aid in the early detection of breast cancer. If a New Zealander wants to invest in Volpara shares they are subject to IRD’s complex and convoluted FIF regime. Australians have no such restrictions. This is broken and a few steps appear to be have been started to fix it. Will they be the right ones? Recommendations: a. Modify & update the existing Callaghan grant schemes and in the process include commercialisation aspects; AND b. Implement a comprehensive marketing programme for the Callaghan grant schemes; AND c. Retain the Callaghan Growth Grant scheme and supplement it by introducing the proposed 12.5% tax credit for research and development. AND d. Introduce as a condition for a grant or tax credit the requirement that in any public equity raising that New Zealand investors be given first option and that New Zealand stock exchange listing be sought. Page 18 of 29 7. Housing Affordability The question of housing affordability has vexed politicians in many countries for many years. The issue has been and will continue to be because housing affordability is essentially a problem of supply. With the other side of the coin, demand, equally problematical. The Valuation Department, (now non-existent), undertook some research a few decades ago into the determinants of house price inflation. Their finding was that the single most significant factor was the ‘rate of household formation’ and in this regard immigration flows were more often than not the major factor. Numerous studies from around the world all contend that the size and direction of migration flows are strongly determined by differences in economic opportunities. This applies to both international migration and the movement from rural or small towns to the cities. In general ‘the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence’. Motivations for Migration Push factorsPull factors Economic and demographic Poverty Unemployment Low wages High fertility rates Lack of basic health and education Prospects of higher wages Potential for improved standard of living Personal or professional development Political Conflict, insecurity, violence Poor governance Corruption Human rights abuses Safety and security Political freedom Social and cultural Discrimination based on ethnicity, gender, religion, and the like Family reunification Ethnic (diaspora migration) homeland Freedom from discrimination Source: World Bank In New Zealand the early 1970’s house prices increased by more than 50%. This more or less coincided with not only a special Samoa immigration quota that was introduced but also with a record inflow of immigrants in 1973 and 1974 when there was an assisted passage scheme and publicity to attract migrants due to labour shortages. More immigrants, more households, more demand so up went the prices. Very different reasons in around 1981 - 83 contributed to the next period of high increases in house prices. This increases more or less corresponded with the flow on effects two pieces of legislation. (a) The Property (Relationships) Act 1976. This act was mainly about how the property of couples was to be divided up when they separate or one of them dies. (b) The Family Proceedings Act 1980. This act made ‘no-fault’ divorce possible. Irreconcilable breakdown of marriage became the only basis on which divorces were granted. No one was blamed. The result was that instead of mum, dad & the kids being under one roof two or more dwellings were now needed. In more recent times New Zealanders returning home, many of whom arrived with plenty of cash, and others deciding to stay at home, perhaps to invest an inheritance in a rental property, has created much higher than normal housing demand. It would be interesting to Page 19 of 29 see the political fallout should a Government decide to stop its citizens from leaving the country or returning home. Discouraging them from returning home, as opposed to stopping, is another issue. For example, Government may consider extending the qualifying residential / earnings period for ‘free’ health and education services, welfare benefits, National Superannuation, etc. According to Statistics NZ net migration peaked at 72,400 in the July 2017 year. At 2.7 persons per household this was the equivalent of about 26,800 homes or about the size of New Plymouth. Building a city of this size in that timeframe stretched resources. Negative net migration, (i.e. emigration), could diminish housing demand just as rapidly as it rose. Land supply is core to unaffordability, but it is wrong to assume that more land being released and consented more cheaply and rapidly equals more housing more quickly. It is a good start but if there are people that have no money to buy a home or there are no builders or there are no building materials then a plentiful land supply means nothing. Prefabricated or factory built houses may help but they will still need to be paid for and sited on a piece of land. Be that as it may being a developer in the business of creating building sites either from bare paddocks or derelict warehouses is not for the faint hearted. The profit for the developer doesn’t come until the cash from last few building sites sold is in the bank. In the meantime the developer has to pay for the land, the infrastructure, the holding costs, etc. If the Tax Working Group really want to fiddle with this they may wish to address taxation issues specific to those confronting property developers after all nobody builds houses in order to pay more tax. Recommendation: This is not broken. Can be left alone and be viewed as being part and parcel of global economic cycles. Page 20 of 29 8. Tax Relief For Health Insurance For The Elderly Private health providers can take pressure off the public health system by those prepared to pay for health insurance. It is totally reasonable that those paying private health insurance premiums should receive a tax benefit as they are also paying for the public health system. Those who have retired know what happens to medical insurance premiums. They go up and up and up. It is therefore no surprise that medical insurance is one of the first cost items that is shed or down-graded by those qualifying for New Zealand superannuation. It doesn’t have to be that way. Making private health insurance premiums tax deductible for the New Zealand superannuant may well slow down the ‘grey hair flight’ from private health insurance schemes. With more of our elderly using health insurance, space on public waiting lists would be freed up for those without. It would mean that all New Zealanders would get treated sooner. It would help conditions to be treated before they become debilitating and additional time in hospital may not be required. Add in the reduction in the use of expensive pharmaceuticals as well as medical staff and carer time and attention that could be devoted to other tasks. With an ageing workforce and population coupled with advances in medical treatments and technology we need to take a big picture approach to health. Anything that assists with the fiscal problem facing healthcare especially for the elderly, reduces waiting lists, promotes good health and quality of life seems like a no-brainer. Making private medical cover tax deductible for those receiving New Zealand superannuation may well reduce the burden on that bottomless pit called the public health system. Recommendation: The public health system is broken. Consider making private health insurance premiums tax deductible for the New Zealand superannuant. Page 21 of 29 9. Capital Gains Tax \[CGT\] A capital gains tax is a tax on the increased value of an asset. It is a tax that New Zealand does not need. The election results of 2011 and 2014 indicate that it is not wanted by the public either. There are strong reasons for it being not needed or wanted. The Manawatu Standard, 12 Sept. 2017, published the following item written by Liam Hehir, “Capital Gains Not Worth The Hassle”. The fact that we are one of the few countries without a capital gains tax is not, in itself, good reason to adopt one. Compared to most other countries, our system of taxation is simple and elegant. Tax simplicity is one of our few competitive advantages. This is sometimes under-appreciated by those who only pay PAYE and GST, but is not something New Zealanders should take for granted. It is also no coincidence that, compared to other countries, we also have a very high rate of tax compliance. Tax simplicity is wonderful. Taxing capital gains is an invariably complicated exercise. Before implementing the tax, you need to determine the types of assets to be taxed and when it will be payable. Will art be captured? What about shares? Kiwisaver portfolios? What if it's jointly owned and one person dies? What if it's left to you in a will? What if it's in a family trust? All these things require complex rules for implementation, administration and compliance. In return, you don't actually raise a lot of revenue. \[For the full article: https://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/opinion/96699833/capital- gains-tax-not-worth-the-hassle \] Despite there being many questions that need to be answered before a CGT is even thought about being introduced the Government has gone ahead and introduced a CGT anyway via the ‘bright line test.’ The ‘bright line test’ requires tax to be paid on any gains made from a residential property sold within two years of purchase. It was introduced and applies to residential properties for which an agreement to purchase was entered into on or after 1 October 2015. Property gains that are subject to the rules are taxed at ordinary marginal tax rates. In March 2018 the bright line test was foolishly extended to 5 years. The Inland Revenue Department (IRD) considers that two years is the better bright-line period and warned the Government that the high level of non-compliance so far seen with the bright-line test will continue if it is extended by another three years. An impact statement by the Treasury and Inland Revenue said that “high-level analysis” of taxpayer compliance with the existing bright-line rules suggests that voluntary compliance is less than 50%. It is no surprise that property investors have been managing their affairs to avoid the bright-line test. To ensure greater compliance a bigger bureaucracy will surely follow. What a mess of potage. Despite all this sound advice the Government pressed on and argued that extending the test to five years will help deter property speculators and Page 22 of 29 “may” have of a dampening effect on the housing market. This is ‘suck it and see’ legislation and a CGT by surreptition to appease the envy sector. This fool hardiness is being exasperated because the housing market is already showing signs of quietening down. Five examples follow: 1. Auckland house prices weaken in February as volumes increase. House prices in New Zealand's largest city of Auckland are likely to remain stable over the remainder of the summer and autumn sales season according to Barfoot & Thompson, the city's largest realtor. The average sale price fell to $919,454 in February, down 1.6 percent from January and 2.7 percent below February last year. The median price of $820,000 is 1.2 percent below January and unchanged from February last year. (March 2018) 2. Powered by CoreLogic data, the February 2018 QV House Price Index shows the late values resurgence witnessed in Auckland post-election subsided in February, dropping by 0.5%. Simultaneously, Wellington capital city values tracked sideways after previously experiencing more sustained growth throughout the second half of 2017 and into 2018. 3. Parts of the country are suffering sharp house price falls of more than 10 per cent, and the downturn could spread. The Real Estate Institute data for January 2018 reveals that although the number of properties sold across the country was up 2.7 per cent compared to January 2017 but compared to December, national house prices dropped 5.5 per cent to a median $520,000. 4. Property asking prices fell in five regions of New Zealand last month, creating opportunities for house-hunters. Realestate.co.nz has released its data for March (2018), which shows weakness in some of the country's main centres. Auckland's average asking price was down 1.3 per cent from February to $949,538. Central Otago/Lakes dropped 5.2 per cent to $879,325. Southland was down 4.1 per cent to $289,796, Canterbury down 2.8 per cent to $488,157 and Otago down 1.3 per cent to $386,793. 5. According to the NZ Property Institute’s housing predictions for 2018 their CEO, Ashley Church, (31 Jan 2018), says that the cost of renting will replace the price of housing as the #1 housing issue in 2018 – and the housing polices of the new Government, combined with uncertainty around housing investment over the next few years, will ‘scare’ some property investors out of the market - creating a growing crisis in the number of dwellings available for rental. people will choose to desert the market rather than stay in for three to four years, house prices are flat, that means no capital gain, add in rising compliance costs like insulation and some properties won't pay their way. Plus a review of tenancy laws is also making some nervous and won't fix the problem. The full list of the NZ Property Institute’s predictions can be seen via the link below. Their predictions for 2017 had a 100% ‘hit rate’.

What assets will be liable? Family home: How many days each year does it need to be lived in? What if it is partly used for a business? What if you inherit an additional home from a recently deceased family member? Holiday home: Define this. What if close family members live in it for some months? Company Shares: Gambling & Lottery winnings: Retirement portfolios such as Kiwisaver Maori Land Crown Land Are things like the following going to be liable for CGT? If not, why not? art gem stones and jewellery precious metals rare stamps coins & bank notes vintage cars fine wine collectibles such as dolls & toys militaria autographs sport memorabilia old cameras antiques furniture china & porcelain books & comics The list is almost endless. Who owns the assets? Joint ownership: How will splitting the CGT liability be handled? Can mum, dad, children, siblings, uncles, aunts, cousins, grand-parents all now become joint owners and so share the tax burden? Family Trust: What about rights to occupy? Maori Land: How will CGT on Maori land be dealt with? Could the Maori Land Court quickly, fairly and effectively sort out Maori CGT liabilities? Will the costs of owning the asset be deductible? Page 24 of 29 In the UK you can deduct certain costs of buying, selling or improving your personal possession from your gain. The costs you can deduct include: • fees, e.g. for valuing or advertising; insurance, brokerage, storage, etc., • costs to improve your possession (but not repairs), • VAT (unless you can reclaim it). (VAT is equivalent to our GST) You can’t deduct certain costs, such as the interest on a loan used to buy your asset. If the above were to be adopted here what a delightful can of worms it would open. The raft of avoidance possibilities is almost infinite. Already compliance with the ‘bright line test’ is an issue. The trouble is that failure to allow such costs renders a CGT as a very unfair tax and is probably and rightfully political suicide. How will capital losses be treated? If gains are taxed then losses must be allowed to be used to offset against other tax liabilities. Or if there are no other liabilities then cash in the bank will do nicely thank you. In other words, a capital gains tax socialises profits while privatising losses. Unfortunately, a CGT is a deterrent against riskier investments and an incentive for safer ones. E.g. The family home, (if it is to be exempt), as New Zealanders perceive residential property to be safe haven. Among the things that New Zealand needs is less money being poured into residential property as an investment and more angel and venture capital investors. A CGT inhibits such activity. Presuming the tax is payable on the sale of an asset, it can be easily avoided by simply not selling it. Consequently freeing up capital to invest in something more promising becomes harder and more expensive. Productive opportunities fall by the wayside and effectively capital becomes locked away. The result innovation and entrepreneurship are stifled. How efficient is a CGT? The short answer is probably not very. The cost of collection is said to be very high and hard reliable data is needed to verify or discredit this claim. Perhaps there is a reason why data on the cost of CGT collection is nigh on impossible to find. Not having a CGT is an important point of difference in marketing New Zealand to investors and entrepreneurs. Further, because other countries have a CGT is no reason why we should have one too. A CGT will result in a whole new avoidance industry being created. CGT are for practical and political reasons invariably riddled with exemptions and exceptions making them devilishly complicated to administer and to comply with. Making it a veritable bonanza for tax lawyers, tax accountants, tax consultants and tax bureaucrats. But bad news for everyone else. Page 25 of 29 In July 2011 Labour’s Phil Goff proposed a CGT of 15%. It would raise a miserable $17.5 million – about the cost of a flag referendum – in the first year. However this would rise to $3.7 billion by 2028. Sounds impressive but it ain’t. At the time Treasury’s Long-Term Fiscal Model estimated that the total tax in 2028 would be $120 billion. The CGT would therefore be only 2.83% of the total tax take. Why bother? Will the double tax issue be fixed? Many companies, perhaps the majority, that make a tax paid profit do not distribute all of their profit back to their shareholders usually by way of a dividend. The retained profit is reinvested back into the business. {Perhaps as increased R & D investment}. This retained profit usually and eventually gets reflected in a higher share price. A CGT will then steal some or all of the increased share price. This is double taxation and such a complete and utter rort that a CGT on shares should be abandoned forthwith. There is a glimpse of an argument that claims that share prices reflect the expectation of future profits and that those expectations exceed the level of retained earnings. Not surprisingly sound evidence for this argument appears to have gone astray. Companies can reinvest their retained earnings in many ways. One such way might be investing in developing products and processes which are expected to generate further profits over time. In such instances a CGT can be seen a tax on expectations rather than reality. For small businesses that are not stock exchange listed the value of the business is usually a very close approximation of the net present value (npv) of its expected income stream. The income stream is taxed and so the value of the business is an after tax valuation. Suppose a business makes $1000 a year and the npv discount rate is 10% then the value of the business is $10,000. Deduct tax at say 30% and the business is now worth $7,000. The business owner get busy and doubles the earnings to $2,000 a year. Now the business is worth $20,000. Deduct tax at say 30% and the business in now worth $14,000. The owner can sell the business and trouser a capital gain of $7,000. However along comes a CGT of 15% and steals $1,050 of the capital gain leaving only $5,950. So instead of paying $6,000 in tax, (30%) on the $20,000 the business now pays $7,050 in tax or 35.25%. Thinking that a CGT is about imposing "fairness" – even if it results in everyone being worse off as a consequence – then it's got to be a terrific idea hasn’t it? What adjustments will be permitted to compensate for inflation? Numerous researchers have examined the impact of inflation on the assessment of CGT and have concluded that it is nothing more than highway robbery. Page 26 of 29 Inflation distorts all aspects of the taxation of personal income but is particularly harsh on the taxation of capital gains. When company shares or any other asset is sold a capital gains tax be paid on the difference between the selling price and the original cost even though much of that gain was the result of a general rise in the prices of consumer goods and services. Taxing capital gains in this way very substantially increases the effective tax rate on ‘real’ price adjusted capital gains. Under the federal tax code, the increase in an asset’s price is determined as the nominal amount (i.e., not adjusted for inflation). When an asset (often a stock) is sold above its purchase price, a gain is realized and is taxed. Any capital gain due to inflation is not accounted for, and the taxpayer is taxed on both their increase in income and on increases in prices economy-wide. As a result, the effective tax rate on the real (inflation indexed) capital gain has exceeded the statutory rate every year since 1950 and has averaged around 42 percent. In some instances, the practice of taxing the nominal gain can lead to an infinite effective rate on real capital gains when the increase in price is only due to inflation. In fact, if a taxpayer purchased an average stock in 1999, 2000, or 2007 and sold in 2013, they would be taxed entirely on inflation. And there was more: More specifically, in 1973 individuals paid capital gains tax on more than $4.5 billion of nominal capital gains on corporate stock. If the costs of these shares are adjusted for the increases in the consumer price level since they were purchased, the $4.5 billion nominal gain becomes a real capital loss of nearly $1 billion. \[“Inflation and the Excess Taxation of Capital Gains on Corporate Stock” by Joel Slemrod. 1983 National Bureau Of Economic Research and published by the University of Chicago Press\] The following item is from UK’s ‘The Telegraph’ and somewhat scathing about failing to make allowances for inflation when assessing CGT. Capital gains tax without inflation is 'highway robbery' Plans to increasing capital gains tax would be akin to "highway robbery" unless allowances are made for the effects on inflation, experts warned. By Harry Wallop, Consumer Affairs Editor, The Telegraph; 21 May 2010 Without adjustments for natural increases in prices, many savers will be forced to pay tens of thousands extra in tax. Some will see their bills double. The new coalition government is planning to increase the tax savers and investors pay when they sell any assets from 18 per cent to 40 per cent or even 50 per cent. This move will hit hard second home owners, buy-to-let investors, or anyone with a decent portfolio of shares. Some accountants have suggested as many as a million people a year will be caught by the tax. However, leading tax experts have given warning that it would be "grossly unfair" to raise the tax without introducing indexation. This is the technical term for taking into account inflation. When people sell any asset, be it a picture they inherited or a second home they bought some years ago, they have to pay tax on the profit -- or capital gain -- they Page 27 of 29 have made. But some of the profit could be down to inflation during the time they have owned it. If someone bought a second home twenty years ago, for instance, the average price would have been £69,000, according to the Halifax. The average home is now £168,000. So, the person would be sitting on a near £100,000 profit. But according to Government statistics, nearly £50,000 of that profit is down to simple inflation, as measured by the main cost of living index. Indexation strips out this effect, meaning consumers only have to pay tax on the real return. In this instance they would pay tax on £50,000 profit rather than £100,000 -- thus halving the tax bill. Mike Warburton, leading tax partner at Grant Thornton, the accountancy firm, said: "I have had a lot of clients ringing up worried about this. They feel it is grossly unfair to pay tax on inflationary gains. And let's face it, inflation has not gone away. The dragon has not been slayed. Taxing people on any gains they make from inflation is a big disincentive to save." Earlier this week, the Office for National Statistics said that inflation, as measured by the Retail Prices Index, had climbed to a 19-year high of 5.3 per cent. Indexation has been part of capital gains tax ever since it was raised to 30 per cent in 1988. Only when Alistair Darling, as chancellor, moved capital gains tax down to 18 per cent two years ago did indexation get scrapped. Bill Dodwell, head of tax policy at Deloitte, the accountancy firm, said: "There are plenty of arguments in favour of increasing capital gains tax. But it would be very unfair to do so without reintroducing indexation. That has to happen. "The longer people hold assets, the more inflation affects the value of that asset." Mark Dampier, head of research at the independent financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown, said: "When CGT was 10 per cent, or even 18 per cent, people understood that you might not get inflation taken into account. "But to put it up to 40 per cent without indexation is pure highway robbery. Over the long-term your asset could increase in value considerably, but only because of inflation. "There is a real feeling from our clients that it is unbelievably unfair to put up the rate without indexation. It is unfair to be taxed on inflation." A spokesman for the Treasury said: "There are a range of possible options on capital gains tax to fulfil this aim and no decision has yet been taken on one option. It will be important to take the time to get this right." In addition to the above compelling arguments there is the question of what indexes would be used to measure inflation. For example: Consumer Price Index QV House Price Index S&P NZX All Index Gross Producer Price Index Labour Cost Index Trade Weighted Index Using these indexes or a combination of them to determine the true capital gain net of inflation is quite complicated especially allowing for the cost of maintenance and other Page 28 of 29 adjustments that will be made over a number of years of ownership. It’s hard to do financially, witness the issues with the FIF regime, let alone in terms of writing and then administering tax law. Then there is the issue of Government meddling with the activities of the Reserve Bank to influence the movement of inflation and so dictate the quantum of CGT assessed. It is just six months since there was a change in Government and already the Reserve Bank is being required to establish a committee, the members of which will be appointed by the Minister of Finance, to pay more attention to the state of the labour market and not just inflation when setting interest rates. Unlike the inflation target, there will be no hard number on employment. The employment goal will be dynamic and broad and impacted by many variables. Maybe one of those variables will be the quantum of CGT the Government wants to collect. Unfortunately it doesn’t look like it is going to end here as the new Government has asked Treasury to undertake a wide ranging review of the way the central bank operates and how it makes decisions. Having a Government influenced inflation rate over which you the tax payer have no control could well determine your tax liability. It may well prove to be a step too far. Banana republic here we come. Recommendation: A Capital Gains Tax is not needed or wanted. Forget it. Move on. Page 29 of 29 Conclusion There is a section of the New Zealand population that are always up for taxing the rich and the successful. It’s certainly does not appear to be about improving the well-being of the citizens or the economy. The Tax Working Group have been given an opportunity to be a catalyst to change this thinking for the betterment of all New Zealand citizens. Finally, one can only hope that the Tax Working Group will take heed of Bert Lance’s advice that the trouble with government is that they fix things that aren't broken and not fix things that are broken.

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. To the Tax Working Group. Here are some considered thoughts re questions in response to the call for consultation by the Tax Working Group. I apologise for not sticking to your key questions, but much of this is interrelated and of course complex. I want to concentrate on structural questions. Should the tax system be different? A progressive tax where people in higher income brackets pay more than people in lower income brackets over our history has been positive for the community. However New Zealand has become a very unequal country with the distribution of wealth concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. Out tax system rewards this. The value to the individual of income at the middle and lowest levels is greater than to those on higher incomes because they have less money to live their lives. Consequently taking tax off middle and low income people has greater impact on the things people have good reason to value in their lives. A good test is to ask would the most wealthy person in New Zealand agree this tax system is fair, if at an instant they went onto the lowest income and had to pay 30% of their income in tax? Higher incomes in New Zealand are driven more by returns on investments than by incomes from wages and salaries. That is to say higher incomes are derived by returns from ownerships of companies, land, houses, farms, factories, shares, cash investments and intellectual property. Of course some capital investments are more profitable and generate more income than others. People who have the advantage of capital such as finance, property, education or positions of wealth and influence by inheritance, often fit into higher income brackets. Somehow this remains true for the higher earning professions such as law and medicine as well. Most have done nothing more than wage and salary earners other than possess the good luck to be born into wealth, comfortable lives of privilege in society. Such is the levels of inequality we have developed in New Zealand by income generation being greater from capital than from wages and salaries. However this can almost all be balanced off if we introduce an asset tax. Every person or company in New Zealand would submit a balance sheet outlining their ownership wealth on tax day. Inland revenue would assess the rate of return on the balance sheet and set the payable tax. High value assets pay high tax. Low value of assets pay low tax. If we do not tax wages but tax that which people own (including a family home) people who own companies, farms, factories, shares, rental properties, income generating IT companies, international business interests, planes, cars, boats, holiday homes, family trusts will pay tax on the value of the capital they own not pay tax on what they can produce off this capital. This is a far more equitable way of taxing from the people who have little or no capital wealth to the people who have excessively high levels of wealth. The incentive would switch from being taxed on what we earn to incentivising productivity of the assets we own. For example: ●A person buys 3 properties and build a 10 bedroom palace at a capital value of $20m then under an asset tax system that person is going to pay more tax than if he/she had built a modest home. ●Two farmers who own the same land and stock will pay the same tax. One might work harder and smarter and earn more income than the other. So be it. Respecting the ecology of the farm mitigates against short term gains because to continue to generate income (which the farmer keeps) the farm needs to be protected against environmental damage. ●The investor who owns multiple houses and apartments would pay tax on the value of the properties. The higher the income from the rents the higher the value of the properties the higher the tax. The incentive to balance off excessive tax liabilities would be to limit rent rises to levels which generate a good income but do not drive up the capital value. This would advantage renters. ●A person or company owning a share portfolio would pay tax on the value of the investment on tax day. The income from the shares is theirs to spend. The incentive to invest in a company will be more driven by what can this company earn in income rather than what non-earning assets can this company acquire and later sell. This is also a liberating idea for people on low incomes because their tax liability will be assessed on what they own which might not be much. They would be free to spend all their income if they wished or invest in assets as they could afford them. The other advantage of this system is that inflation increases the tax liability. Inflation gives every wage and salary earner an effective pay cut. The drivers of inflation, increased prices on goods and services, increased land values, would be problematic to owners of capital because inflation would increase their taxes. Inflation increases the value of assets simply through continued ownership of the assets. This is particularly true of land. Speculators who land bank or buy up non-productive companies for their assets hoping the value would increase would pay a tax on the value as the value and on increases in value. This would be a disincentive ON land and housing speculators. Producers of good and services would need to ensure their incomes increased through productivity but not the value of their assets if they wanted to control their tax liability. A balance of energy would be needed to improve being productive balanced off against tax liabilities. The setting of the levels of tax would be the biggest fear of people who own significant levels of capital. Government collection of tax through assets would be an internationally innovative way of funding government programmes and contemporaneously drive down income and social inequality. Should GST be removed from healthy foods? No. The great thing about GST is its universality. It is easy to calculate and easy to collect. Breaking this up opens the door for wroughts and confusions to occur. Should cooked bananas be more taxed than raw bananas? Should Subway sandwiches cost more in a Subway shop than a Subway sandwich in a supermarket? Other Benefits of a Asset Tax Under a total asset tax system a higher proportion of working people would pay no tax; or very little perhaps on the value of their home, if they own one. The majority of tax would be paid by people who own capital in its many forms. The amount of income they can derive from this capital is not taxed and they would be free to make as much money as the market could stand for their good and services. The incentive for people who own capital assets is to employ people and make the assets work for them by increased productivity. The other advantage of this system is that those people who currently work the tax system to their own advantage or operate outside the current tax system (mates rates) will be taxed on what they own. This would include overseas companies, tax-avoidance and tax-dodging mechanism and black market operators. This asset tax system is much wider and much fairer. Concluding Comments on Asset Tax The current income tax system is unfair and significantly drives inequality and social pathologies. An unfair tax burden rests on the middle and low income earners and advantages people who make capital gains through investments and inheritance. These factors have created social inequality in New Zealand, an underclass of survivors, working poor and divisions within society. We have an opportunity to look at something vastly different than what we have now, which is why I am advocating the abolition of income tax to be replaced by an asset tax. Should sugar be taxed? Sugar is very similar in chemical composition to alcohol. The theory for taxing alcohol is that we tax alcohol to provide a source of revenue in an attempt to limit the harm caused by abuse of alcohol. Sugar, similarly has an addictive effect and acts as an activation of the neurological reward system in our brains. The more sugar the more reward and so the addictive effect advances. Sugar also impairs memory and learning skills damaging synaptic activity in the brain. Growing children suffer most from excessive sugar in their diets. The public health messages of telling people to stop smoking had almost no effect on cigarette sales. However the continued increases in price (tax) over the last 10 years has had extremely positive effects of bringing smoking rates down for large sections of the population. Also banning smoking in public spaces has contributed. Conversely we also see poor families using more of their income on cigarettes and young men sometimes engaged in robbery of dairies to steal cigarettes because they cannot afford to buy them and feel it is ok to rob dairies to obtain them. A tax on sugar making high sugar foods more expensive would have both positive and negative consequences. The positive consequences are that like alcohol sales, sugar tax will raise revenue making revenue available to spend on health care to treat the sequelae of sugar addictions e.g. obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This would presuppose that the public health system has the ability to do this without simply absorbing increased revenues into itself (I greatly doubt that this would happen). Secondly, raw sugar products, sugar laden drinks, cakes/buns/biscuits and high sugar confectionary would be more expensive and less affordable with discretionary income. However the negative policy consequences of a tax on sugar will mean that possibly people will decide to pay more for sugar laden foods and drinks because they will not or cannot do without them and have less money to spend on healthier food and drink choices. Overall the sugar tax would have the negative effect of making their diet worse. On balance, I think a sugar tax would be a positive thing for the community and I would recommend bringing it in slowly. If the sugar tax is to go into the health system, measures of the performance of the health system to managed sugar related disease would also be helpful. Greg Coyle 29 April 2018 \[1\]

GJWL G J WILLS Limited TAX ADVISER & ACCOUNTING SERVICES 26th April 2018 Attention: Tax Working Group (2018) Thank you for attending the ATAINZ Auckland Regional Meeting 1Oth April last. You insoired me to do a submission. I trust the Tax Working Group has a brief to look at all possibilities and will consider the very radical system I explain below. I wish to make the following submission to the tax working group; With the rapid uptake of digital transactions and a growing number direct to overseas suppliers, there needs to be a much wrder system of cQllection. 1. To create a "Transaction Tax" to be levied on every transaction going out of a bank account. (Transfers between accounts in the same name should be exempted as to not penalize a person setting money aside for savings) LE. only captures money going out of a bank account to a third party and therefore being "spent". Scope: Given the Government's total Tax Revenue of $70.4 billion, (12 months to June 2016 is the figure I have used from Inland Revenue source data). Compare this with the total value of transactions through SBI (year to October 2016) was $1 .1 trillion. - (source NZ payments Stats from the Statistics Dept.) So, I will use these overall numbers to illustrate. lf you were to Scrap most other taxes (GST. PAYE & Income Tax plus Company Income Tax, these three, which account for approx. 87.9% of total revenue. and apply a 6.0% "transaction tax" to every transaction, this would produce the same ball park revenue. - possibly a little more - about 0.3 of a percent, however I shall use the round 6.0% just to illustrate. However, the 6.0% seems a rather high percentage for every transaction, and you may want to consider keeping some of the existing taxes. For example, FBT (was never designed to collect revenue, approx. $14 million last time I looked, but was designed to alter behavior. Similarly - The current taxes on Tobacco and Cigarettes may want to be retained. Depending on the total of the existing taxes retained, then the % could be reduced accordingly. Mechanics of application; 1. At midnight (1.E, strictly daily calculated) The transaction tax is deducted from the account and the whole dollars be paid to Inland Revenue the next day. The fractions left should be carried forward to the next day. Collectively these small amounts at a bank would be compensation for the banks expenses of running the system, We have 4 major banks that between them have most of the bank accounts held by new Zealanders. Example say approx. 1,000,000 accounts each multiplied by 25c average, conservative truncated amount - then held overnight is about $250,000 - not a number to be despised. This would mean an end to the governments cash flow problems as the money would arrive daily! Note, the transfer to Inland Revenue from a bank would also need to be exempted. The above system would mean that Inland Revenue could do away with most of their staff, save-for say 200 lT experts to carry out audits of the banking institutions. The staff made redundant, could then be gainfully employed in the productive economy. \[1\] \[1\] It will be apparent that this system automatically captures the increasing amounts being paid to Apple, Facebook, Google, Uber etc. for their services used by New Zealanders. lt is also Inflation proof as it follows prices paid by consumers. 2. There may be a case for a cut over point depending upon the size of the transaction. lf we say that any transaction over $10,000 can have the "Transaction Tax" added (just as GST is added now), then it would ensure that the issuer of a "Transaction Tax" Invoice would receive the Price they were asking, but the payer would pay the higher inclusive of tax figure. The bank would deduct the "transaction tax" and transfer it to the Inland Revenue Clearing account for that day's accumulation of "transaction tax" amounts. Note that it even captures money garned from lllegal activities as the receiving person has to spend the money (Cars, Boats and Property etc.) Examples; Just to put some real-life examples into perspective; '1 . A person on near the average wage of $48,000 (No PAYE deducted) so he/she gets the whole amount except for any arranged employer deductions Eg. Kiwi Saver - assume he/she has the 3% Kiwi saver deducted and that he then spends 85% of it, so in a year he would have paid $2.375 in Transaction tax. 2. A person on $100,000 pa, assuming he/she has Kiwi saver 3% deducted at source, then spends 80% of it, would have paid $4,656 Transaction Tax. 3. A person on $90O,OOO pa, again assuming 3% Kiwi saver deducted, and a spend of say 70o/o implies an amount of Transactign tax paid of $36,666 pa. 4. A person buying a new motor vehicle, advertised at $50,000 plus "Transaction Tax," would actually PaY $53,000 for it 5. Similarly, A person buying a Property advertised for $900,000 would actually Pay $954,000 for it to happen. There is of course a multiplier effect inherent in this system as it is a tax on Money Girculation. All the amounts a person pays out (Food Fuel, Rent, etc.) go to firms who in turn pay their expenses, tl're 6.4o/o gets collected again. My understanding is that the multiplier is something like 8 or 9 times for a single dollar. You could of course, tinker with the system around its extremes. An example would be to say apply a capped total amount on large transactions, say over $2,000,000. However, this then introduces complexity. I have always believed that Tax should be simple and understandable by anyone and clear and concise so there is no doubt about the calculation and the amounts. There is one negative aspect in that it may encourage more people to try to use cash for transactions. However, I believe that the value of cash circulating is now quite small compared with electronic transactions. - So maybe not a material problem seeing we seem to be heading towards a "cashless" society. I trust this can be given Consideratlon, Yours Sincerely lreville J Wills Member ATAINZ \[1\]
Tax Working Group Public Submissions Information Release Release Document September 2018 taxworkingroup.govt.nz/key-documents Key to sections of the Official Information Act 1982 under which information has been withheld. Certain information in this document has been withheld under one or more of the following sections of the Official Information Act, as applicable: \[1\] 9(2)(a) - to protect the privacy of natural persons, including deceased people; \[2\] 9(2)(k) - to prevent the disclosure of official information for improper gain or improper advantage. Where information has been withheld, a numbered reference to the applicable section of the Official Information Act has been made, as listed above. For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Tax Working Group Submission Equity Income Splitting • The Government treats the family or couple as the relevant unit for assessing eligibility for transfer payments such as National Superannuation, unemployment and other benefits. • For personal income tax, the relevant basis of assessment is the individual. This means that two families/couples with the same income can face significantly different tax bills. • I earn $140,000 and my wife earns $30,000. We pay significantly more tax than a family/couple where each partner earns $85,000. • In our case we made a conscious choice that my wife should not work and later only work part-time so that one of us could be more involved in our children’s development. We chose to get involved in Playcentre, a parent co-operative early child education body where parents train in early childhood education and run the programmes – the funding discrimination compared to kindergartens or ECE centres that pay their staff is a different issue. • There is significant research that supports the assessment that parental involvement in child development has significant benefits and enhances achievement and therefore the child’s contribution to society. • I believe the family/couple was the basis in the past and that this should be restored as the current situation is contrary to the principle of equity in taxation and transfer policy. The family/couple should be the basis for assessment for both. Transparency “Bracket Creep” • Tax brackets should be indexed, probably to wage indices not CPI, so the Government is not able to increase the average tax rate people pay by stealth. • This would remove the need for periodic, much-debated “tax cuts” which only serve to return the situation to what it was before people moved up the marginal tax rates due to wage inflation. Savings Real Returns • With low interest rates (relative to 1980s-2008) expected to continue for some time the effect of the top personal tax rate on a return of say 3.5% is very significant. • A component of any interest rate is compensation for inflation on the capital amount, separate for the return for allowing the other party use of the funds for a period. Only the real return should be taxed. Superannuation • The current TTE regime on superannuation reduces the benefits of compounding on long-term savings. • Moving to an EET regime would improve returns to savings. This would help improve the attractiveness of investing in things other than residential housing which would have benefits for our capital markets even if National Superannuation is not means tested and increased savings do not reduce the cost of this. • Any taxation of withdrawals from superannuation should differentiate between capital and earnings as it is not fair to tax people on their own money (assuming that capital contributed is from income which is taxed rather than being tax deductible). Residential Investment Property • There is wide agreement that New Zealand has too much invested in residential investment property and there are a number of reasons for this. • The main reason is the ability to gear an investment significantly – up to 80% until the LVR restrictions. Regardless of the favourable tax treatments this meant that the returns on a 20% equity investment were much higher than investment in managed funds or direct equities which cannot be geared (at least not for the average tax payer). • Adding in interest deductibility not available on owner-occupied housing, ability to offset tax losses against other personal income and the fiction that people do not invest in residential investment property for the tax free capital gain (whether they own it for 2 years or 20 years) – yeah right!!! – and it is no wonder we are over-invested in residential property, our banking sector is completely dependent on this asset class, and our foreign debt is overwhelmingly funding this. • The tax system won’t end the benefits of leverage but it can address the fiction that people invest in residential property for the income during the life of the investment, rather than the tax benefits and tax-free capital gain. • New look through structures for residential investment property should be ended with existing entities grandfathered in recognition that many MP’s have significant residential property investment and are not going to vote their own benefits away, although fear of a resulting reduction in house prices might influence their voting decisions. Capital Gains Tax • It is clear to me that historically farming and property investment have been largely for tax free capital gains rather than an acceptable return during the time the asset is held. • Rather than a capital gains tax to address this The Opportunity Party proposed a tax assessed on all assets on the basis of a minimum deemed income, with the tax on this minimum income being offset against the actual income so that those achieving a higher return will pay no more than at present but those earning no or low returns (because they are investing for the tax free capital gain on sale) will pay more. • This asset tax would improve resource allocation away from non-productive assets such as land banks into productive uses. • This is in effect a wealth tax and there is growing concern about both income and wealth inequality, with the latter more of an issue. • The potential changes in work (technology, gigs, etc.) on top of the significant shift in the balance of power (and therefore share of GDP) between labour and capital poses a major threat to the current tax base which is over dependent on personal, consumption and company tax. In a worst case scenario of mass job destruction and unemployment the average tax payer will have lower or no income so won’t be spending (so not paying GST) and many of our companies could go out of business. • The TOP policy included owner-occupied housing in this tax but this may not be possible given the Government instruction that owner occupied housing is not within the scope. This just means that the tax rate on other assets would have to be higher or the reduction in other taxes lower. • The TOP policy also included a Universal Basic Income which I understand is outside the scope of the Working Group. • I am sure the members of the Working Group have all read Gareth Morgan’s “The Big Kahuna” which goes back to first principles and looks at the philosophical basis for redistribution of income and wealth and the ad hoc evolution of the New Zealand tax system, as well as his proposed solutions to the problems he identifies in the current system. I commend it to those of you who haven’t read it. Tax Base – broad based, low rate • The description of the current tax base as “broad based” is only partly accurate in that there are few exemptions or deductions. • The current system is not broad based in that it excludes wealth which is the major source of inequality over time – income, education, housing, and therefore ability to contribute to society and the current tax base. • The focus on personal income, consumption and company tax is a soft option in that these are all relatively easy to measure and collect with PAYE, transaction data and company accounts. • Taxing wealth will be more challenging but doing so will be vital for social cohesion and prosperity in future. • GST should continue to be charged on the current basis with no exemptions or lower rates for fresh food, etc. The other changes I support should lower average tax for lower income earners which would be a better way of countering the regressive effect of GST. • I recall GST was increased to 15% in the wake of either or both the GFC and the Christchurch earthquake and the effect on Government finances but like most tax increases in response to a short-term issue this was never reversed once the problem had been addressed. Currency Transaction Tax • The submissions background paper refers to the New Zealand dollar being one of the most traded currencies in the world, out of proportion to our GDP and trade flows. • Most of this trading is speculative by parties with no underlying need for NZD, most of them offshore. • A tax on currency transactions would raise revenue but also presumably change the economics of this trading and so reduce the volumes traded and the effect of this trade which is not related to the real economy on that real economy and financial conditions (as taken into account in setting monetary and fiscal policy). Taxing “Bads” • Taxes to influence environmental outcomes should be introduced: o Pollution taxes o Agriculture included in Emissions Trading Scheme o Royalties on water (urban households pay water rates) Summary New Zealand and the world are at an inflexion point where we cannot continue with tinkering around the edges and the Working Group has the opportunity to be a key part of raising awareness of the issues facing us all, many of them outlined in the Submission Background Paper, and also in Colin James’ 2017 book “Unquiet Times”. The last time we faced such an inflexion point was 1984 when the socio-economic model that had prevailed since WWII broke down and was replaced by the Friedmanite neo- liberal, monetarist orthodoxy, in New Zealand with “Rogernomics” and “Ruthanasia”. The gross mishandling of this transition, the failure to deliver on the promise of “a rising tide lifting all boats” or “trickle down”, and the failure to take society through this change has resulted in the legacy of inequality and reduced social cohesion. The challenges we face are much bigger than many people realise, and bigger than the previous Government was willing to admit. You have an opportunity to grasp these challenges and propose bold solutions, and to build understanding and consensus. I encourage you to have the courage to be bold, to think big and broadly, and to not shy away from the challenge. Tinkering around the edges will not get us through.

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Ian Anderson’s Submission to Tax Working Group  Using the list of headings in your discussion document 1 Aging Population  Aging population is one of the factors that mean that the workforce will become a smaller percentage of the population in the future. This means that income tax becomes less viable as the main source of tax. We need to broaden the tax base. 2 Maori economy and values  Maori participate in many of the same economic sectors as non-Maori so any tax changes to support those sectors have board application to Maori and non-Maori. Many Maori values are also values shared by many non-Maori just using different slogans. So any changes in the tax system to assist in achieving those values will be seen a positive move by many Maori and non-Maori -- assuming they are implemented in a way that is accessible to both Maori and non-Maori. In particular care for each other, care for the land and sustainability. 3 Changing Nature of Work  As jobs become casual and as jobs disappear due to both globalisation and automation the total income earned from wages, salaries and contract labour will decrease. This will impact our tax system that depends so much on income tax. We need to broaden the tax base. Job casualisation will also impact both the tax system and benefit system as both are predicated on most people having permanent jobs most of the time. Correct and fair calculation of PAYE rates, secondary income tax rates become more difficult. Stand down periods before getting benefits become problematical. A universal basic income and a flat tax may be a more practical and fairer solution than trying to adjust the current system which is based on assumptions about permanent jobs that no longer applies to an increasing sector of the working age population. 4 Environmental challenges  Some economic activity is done at a cost to the environment. That cost can be by extraction, by using things unsustainably and by pollution (including greenhouse gases). Our current accounting systems rarely take this into account. Even though sometime a company is legally liable for doing things like restoring land to a reasonable standard this can be unenforceable when the company gets wound up or goes bankrupt. It seems fairer if environmental costs are accounted for and paid for up front. This will get rid of any natural advantage environmentally unsustainable activity has over sustainable activity. Taxation will probably have to be used to make sure costs are paid for. Such taxes should be used to fund environmental recovery. Currently there are royalties paid by the mining industry and petrochemical industry but otherwise not much else of this sort. Extractive industries should be taxed, polluting industries should be taxed, preferably at source. Activity that degrades land, water and biodiversity (including fish stocks and the seabed in our EEZ) should be taxed with the taxes going to a fund government and NGO activity that restores and improves our environment (and the associated scientific activity). Such a tax system needs to take into account importing and exporting so that we aren’t merely transferring our environmental impact overseas. 5 Technology  As noted above automation will destroy existing jobs. Internet commerce adds to the transfer of jobs out of NZ. Other disruptive technology (like Uber) casualises work. All of these require a broader tax base to compensate.. International internet commerce can undermine the GST system because it is difficult to enforce overseas. An alternative approach to GST is probably an easier alternative to trying to enforce GST abroad or trying to turn NZ Post and courier companies into tax collectors. Currently most international internet commerce is carried out via a tiny number of routes (PayPal, VISA and Master Card). It is probably easier to get these agencies to charge and collect the GST upfront and try to collect it after the fact. These companies will probably have enough information about each transaction to understand the difference between a domestic transaction, a transaction while travelling and international internet commerce. Other methods of payments may start to compete with these 3 but if we anticipate change the tax system can adapt faster. Ultimately it may turn out to be easier to replace GST with a universal transaction tax. IRD has gradually introduced online technology to assist in tax collection, especially for GST (Income Tax and Provisional Tax have lagged behind). This effort should continue and possibly accelerate. 6 Improving Productivity  Because NZ doesn’t tax wealth, investing in assets (particularly land and houses) makes more sense than investing in businesses. Taxing wealth (in particular land and houses) should move more investment into business and increase productivity. Culturally NZ businesses don’t value training staff. It may be worth allowing business to claim more than 100% of staff training costs for a few years to try and change NZ business culture. 7 Inequality  Only apologists for the current economic management would claim that inequality isn’t increasing in NZ, especially with respect to wealth and the rise in executive level salaries compared with minimum wage or middle class salaries. The rise in wealth inequality might be slowed a little by introducing taxes on wealth. 8 Globalisation  As noted above globalisation contributes to the loss of jobs in NZ. International online commerce usually avoid GST (and possibly duty as well). Multinational corporations organise themselves to avoid or evade paying tax in NZ (and some manage to avoid almost all tax anywhere in the world). Transaction taxes including between subsidiaries and parent companies or between sister companies can go a small way to addressing such issues (while collecting data on them). NZ should not be seen as a follower when it comes to making changes in this area. Trusts and shelf companies can be used to hide assets and income streams from tax agencies. The use of NZ trusts has declined since recent changes to trust law, but the use of NZ shelf companies to achieve a similar purpose hasn’t. IRD should take a more active role in trying to stamp out the practise, including suggesting law changes. If NZ IRD is seen as a good partner by other tax agencies it might be possible to leverage some quid pro quo the other way. As you say, the world and NZ are changing and the tax system needs to change to cope. Many of the assumptions the NZ tax system is based on are changing and some assumptions (like wealth shouldn’t be taxed) weren't true in the first place. Companies and people are always changing their habits to avoid paying tax. Tax systems need to change to cope with this natural change in behaviour, otherwise the tax base will get eroded. Tax can be used to change behaviour (Tobacco Tax, Alcohol Tax, Congestion Tax, Sugar Tax, Carbon Tax etc). Though these could be seen as a way to use IRD to implement health and environmental policy. The gap between personal and company tax rates is an obvious flaw in the system. Broadening the Tax Base  Broadening the tax base is a solution to many of the problems outlined above. Wealth Tax  Not taxing wealth and assets is the biggest hole in the NZ tax base and one that has distorted the NZ economy for generations. In particular the taxation of land and housing is the most significant part of this hole in our tax system. While taxing the family home has been removed from the scope of the tax working group, it should be possible to suggest wealth taxes structured in a way that can easily be extended to include the family home once there is a political appetite for it. A capital gains tax is often the first wealth based tax people think of but it is difficult to come up with a workable and fair capital gains tax that doesn’t have its own distortions (such as encouraging people to just hold onto assets for a very long time to avoid tax meanwhile leveraging those assets for untaxed economic value). A wealth tax where assets are taxed as if they were interest-earning term deposits with a value equal to the insurable value of the asset, means that wealth incurs tax every year, not just when it is sold. Transaction Tax  GST is a good and straightforward tax. A transaction tax is another simple tax. NZ has a small financial system where most transactions go through one of 4 main banks or a similar number of smaller banks. The two main credit cards are mostly operated via the banks and most of the electronic payment systems are also linked to those banks. NZ has no land borders, it is at least 2 hours by plane to any other country. Implementation of a transaction tax for all but cash transactions would be much simpler in NZ than most other developed countries. Cash usage is on the decline with many people under 30 years of age rarely carrying cash. A transaction tax can be used for international online transactions more easily than GST. It can also gather tax from multinational companies transfering money out of NZ. A transaction tax could be seen as an addition to GST or as a replacement for it. If a transaction tax replaces GST then it could happen at one date or gradually (with GST decreasing from 15% to 10% to 0% while the transaction tax is increased to whatever rate is necessary to take the same amount of tax) Resource Taxes  Resource taxes are more a way to implement environmental policy by put a realist cost on environmental degradation than raising revenue. The money raised should probably all be used to restore the environment.

Submission to the Tax Working Group Background Paper: Future of Tax Jim Newfield 27 April 2018 This submission does not attempt to answer the questions raised in the background paper, but takes another approach to providing the feedback that the Tax Working Group seeks. First this submission highlights some of the themes presented in the background paper and from those comments presents an idea that I believe is not only open to the Tax Working Group to consider but is vitally important to its work. The Tax Working Group’s report is less likely, in the foreseeable future, to be side-lined by evolving societal developments if it appreciates the point of this submission. I applaud the high quality and the thoroughness of the background paper. It is an informative description of the present tax system and some of its history and of the immediate talking points. My approach in giving my feedback is surely built on the range of information in the background paper and, while not responding directly to its questions, this feedback does not imply that the background paper does not serve its intended purpose. The particular items in the background paper that underlie this submission are:  The changing nature of work;  Technology;  Inequality; and  Globalisation. While the background paper deals with these items individually, I believe that their interaction is more important, not least because they are to some extent mutually enhancing. This interaction is inevitable and long-term. The one-decade focus of the review is no excuse for the Tax Working Group not to report on the trends nor to suggest that we do not need to start preparing for them. The background paper rightly draws attention to the global-market aspect of globalisation. However, another fundamental driver of markets becoming more global is relevant. Undeveloped economies, characterised as having “cheap labour”, have been determined to better utilise that resource by making low-cost merchandise that is wanted by the consumers in more developed economies. At the same time, technology is allowing those more developed economies to move towards higher-skilled activities that are much less labour-intensive and some are inconsistent with the traditional nature of work. The result, particularly in the more developed economies, is more people who lack enough up-market employable skills and become “left behind”. This gives us inequality, and it reaches levels that are socially unacceptable. I see no reason to believe that it will spontaneously go away. Fundamentally, relying on wages, with a little help from welfare and the tax system, to distribute prosperity will soon no longer be good enough. No simple answer is apparent. But I believe that your consideration of the Future of Tax and the following review of Working for Families must begin the conversations on these interactions and their consequences. 2 In response to the emerging trends, a few commentators have already proposed major changes to the transfer systems, involving increasing taxes and paying every resident citizen a basic income. One of the manifestations of inequality is “child poverty”, and one of the high-cost periods of having a child can be the period before the birth of that child. So I see the basic income, or any similar solution to the issues, starting at conception and continuing through life, in due course incorporating New Zealand Superannuation. But whatever the mechanism, I believe that the implications are too far-reaching for the mechanism to be part of the welfare system. Welfare’s role is to address individual hardship, likely to be short- term. Welfare cannot be expected to be the answer to a societal rather than an individual problem. The trends coming at us require a solution that is universal and relatively simple to administer. New Zealand Superannuation appears to be good model, if the practical solution to the new problem is found to be compatible with that model. Regardless of the mechanism for this future distribution, the impacts on the tax system are substantial. I believe that they cannot be ignored in the present review. The terms of reference indicate that the tax take should continue to support traditional levels of government spending, at about 30% of GDP. The purpose of this constraint must be to focus the Tax Working Group on the mechanisms of taxation, rather than on any changes to the effects on the economy of the taxation system. The economic effects of taxation must be dominated by taxation’s predominant feature: taking discretionary spending away from individuals and entities in society, and passing that spending to the state. Transfers are not part of the taxation revenue that is passed to the state; transfers instead move spending ability between individuals and societal entities. I suggest that the Tax Working Group will be more helpful if, in appropriate circumstances, it interprets that element of its terms of reference as providing for government spending, other than basic transfers, remaining at its present percentage of GDP. The increase in taxation required to solve the issue I am addressing would certainly be significant, though, having its own economic impacts. This indicates two challenges. The first is to find a process that works and is an acceptable solution to the issues that are trending-in. The second challenge is to devise a workable transition over some years, because such large changes cannot be made quickly without risking social disruption. I do not know the answers. But I believe that the working group and its support structure has the astuteness, the skills and the knowledge to suggest useful next steps to the government. I also realise that the working group is likely to be dealing mostly with deeply-felt public concerns about the present taxation arrangements, but I urge that this not be at the expense of the future effectiveness of the taxation system as part of delivering solutions. By dealing properly with expected future issues that have already introduced themselves, I believe the Tax Working Group will be elevating its work to the conceptual level, rather than just meddling in the current detail.

APPENDIX TABLE: HOW TAXES DESTROY WEALTH.......................................................75 4 INTRODUCTION Firstly, I must emphasize that, as a Christian, my submission is prepared in support the fundamental view that the financial and banking laws outlined in the King James Bible (KJV), if closely followed, guarantee the most reliable, equitable system of wealth creation, prosperousness, the elimination of poverty and fairness in the tax system for all governments and nations of the world. Unfortunately, however, today both apostate Jews and the vast body of the Christian Church have largely repudiated these elementary laws and given us the corrupt, global Fractional Reserve Banking System that we have today being forced upon us. Sadly, this corrupt, incredibly unfair, Fractional Reserve Banking System allows international banks in collusion with central reserve banks, to create credit and interest bearing debt out of thin air – and therefore, excessive currency depreciation which creates inflation in asset prices, transferring the wealth generated by workers and producers to asset-owners, the majority of which are now owned not by ordinary hard-working citizens – but by the international bankers themselves. Left to itself, unless soon stopped, by divine intervention or some other radical intervention, this corrupt system of Fractional Reserve Banking will ultimately confiscate and transfer the entire assets of the earth to just one corporation, bank or person through mort-gage debt (from French Jews in London: mort ‘death’ and gage ‘bond’ = death bond) – enslaving the whole world under a giant web of debt bondage. This is in sharp contrast to the basic financial and banking laws given to Israel in the Bible, (now meant to be followed by all Jews and Christians, which sadly aren’t) where all tithes (modern taxes) were limited to maximum 10% to fund the government and care for the poor. This was a system which allowed all loans to the citizens of Israel to be raised at NO INTEREST, with loans to strangers and foreigners only carrying nominal interest. To keep the Levites and bankers who were in charge of this system honest, all outstanding short-term loans every 7 years had to be written off for those who had difficulty in repaying them. All long-term loans outstanding had also to be written off completely at the beginning of the Year of Jubilee, every 50 th year, when any land or assets taken as security had to be returned to the original owners. 5 In this way, the provision of credit to the nation was provided by the Levitical priestly bankers to ensure the nation became prosperous, yet without having the bankers grow rich by extortion and blackmail (as is the case today), in lining their own pockets at the expense of everybody else, forcing the public into a continual spiral of debt bondage and impoverishment. I also realise, probably more than most, that what I am going to write, may be extremely unpopular in many banking or financial circles, and I am probably very much a lone voice crying in the wilderness or simply blowing recklessly in the wind. Nevertheless, if for no other reason than for posterity itself, I thought I should take the time and effort to contribute my two pennies’ worth, in the real hope that the majority of people might be awakened, or at least those in power who have the intellectual ability to understand what I’m advocating. In the ultimate aim our government here in New Zealand might lead the world in long overdue meaningful economic and taxation reforms – to hopefully make the place a much fairer and better country for all citizens. Not just for a privileged banking minority, as is the case at present who, regrettably at this time in history, largely do not even reside in this country at all – and are not even included as the primary focus in The Tax Working Group’s Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper report, which to say the least, is quite remarkable. While I do quote from OECD statistics to illustrate some pertinent points to be consistent with the NZ Treasury’s and Reserve Bank’s format, it should be sharply pointed out that I believe the OECD, contrary to general opinion, is simply an organisation at the top run by Anglo/American bankers. Indeed, the OECD originated out of the reformed Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) founded in 1948 to help administer the Marshall Plan, to aid in European recovery after WW2, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. In 1961, the OEEC was reformed into the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that has continued to the present day. It is important to understand that the Marshall Plan was created by the Committee for the Marshall Plan. The Committee disbanded not long after April 3, 1948, when U.S. President Harry S. Truman signed the Marshall Plan into law, which granted $5 billion in aid to 16 European nations. The committee’s headquarters were in the Empire State Building in New York. Of the committee’s executive board members, eight served on the Council of Foreign Relations, which is the American branch of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (now called 6 Chatham House) in London, set up to reform the political world system, abolish the sovereignty of nations and bring in a world government headed by City of London bankers. On April 2, 1948, the day before the Marshall Plan was signed, there were eighteen members of the Executive Committee, mainly bankers or representatives of bankers. For a brief example, the following are just a few: Allen Dulles; was at first a corporate lawyer and partner of Sullivan & Cromwell, an international law firm in New York City whose clients included, J.P. Morgan (one of the major foreign shareholders of the “Big Four” foreign-controlled banks in Australia and New Zealand today). Peter Thiel, the billionaire and co-founder of PayPal, who today incidentally has dual US/NZ citizenship originally worked for Sullivan & Cromwell. Allen Dulles later carried on to become the first civilian Director of the CIA. Dean Acheson; also served on the Marshall Plan Executive Committee. He was a key creator of the Marshall Plan and later the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). He also attended the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944 as the head delegate of the U.S. State Department. At this conference the post-war international economic structure was designed – which birthed the International Monetary Fund (founded 27 December 1945), the World Bank (founded July 1945), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (signed October 1947) which later evolved into the World Trade Organization. Alger Hiss; another Rockefeller agent, was also on the Marshall Plan Executive Committee. He served as Executive Secretary of the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in Washington D.C. in 1944, which drew up plans for the future United Nations. In late 1946, Hiss left government service to become President of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, where he served until May 5, 1949, when he was forced to step down being accused as a Communist agent, and was convicted of perjury in relation to the charge on 21 January 1950. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and Brookings Institute (Robert C. Brookings (1850-1952) was funded by British bankers) are the foremost two American economic think-tanks today which work closely with the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House) in London and Bilderbergers in Europe, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, Ford Foundation, Carnegie Trusts and Mellon Foundation. All controlled by Anglo/American bankers who, right from the very beginning of their inception have been tirelessly working towards setting up the United Nations to be reformed to become a world government controlling the social and political affairs of the world. While having the City of London Corporation-controlled multinational banks and companies, ultimately owning the physical assets of the world in a socialist-styled benevolent dictatorship headed by an 7 oligarchy of financial elite families. Former U.S. Federal Reserve chairs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke; former Federal Reserve vice chairs Donald Kohn and Alice Rivlin are all Brookings scholars. Today the Australian affiliate of the Brooking Institute is the Grattan Institute based in Melbourne. Another on the Marshall Plan Committee was Herbert H. Lehman; one of three brothers who founded Lehman Brothers financial services firm. Another Committee member was Winthrop W. Aldrich; who was President and Chairman of the Board of Chase National Bank from 1930 to 1953, owned by the Rockefeller family. He was U.S. Secretary of State under President Harry Truman from 1949 to 1953. His sister, Abby Aldrich, was the wife of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. In 1947, he was appointed an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire by King George VI. Stacy Friedman; General Counsel for JPMorgan Chase & Co, was also on the Marshall Plan Executive Committee. These are just some of the individuals in the early stages that led up to creation of the OECD who were mainly leading INTERNATIONAL BANKERS OR THEIR AGENTS. Bankers that largely now directly or indirectly control the world economy not only the New Zealand economy, and certainly not in the remotest sense possible ever were or are interested in being “fair” to New Zealand citizens. So for the Government to confidently make the claim it wants the Tax Working Group to recommend making substantive changes to the New Zealand taxation system which will make it “fairer for everybody” through the exercise of following OECD advice, guidelines and protocols – by taxing New Zealand citizens much more in the process one must ask the very pertinent question. Since these foreign banking bodies and their agents in New Zealand generally appear not to be a prime target of the Tax Working Group’s Terms of Reference, unlike many other normal hard-working New Zealand citizens, to supposedly make the tax system “fairer for everybody” – may we ask, fairer for whom? Clearly under such onerous circumstances the Tax Working Group has a very difficult task. To try to implement genuinely good, meaningful, independent, courageous reforms for New Zealanders, not blindly following other countries in compliance of questionable standard OECD guidelines, (behind the scenes controlled by these same Anglo/American international bankers) – with the continuation of the existing, global, Fractional Reserve Banking System, is an enormous challenge to say the least. Especially when our own Reserve Bank and Treasury is packed to the brim with such economists, who largely follow these OECD guidelines, have been indoctrinated in such Anglophile socialist institutions as the Rhodes Trust, Fulbright Scholarship Program or the 8 Fabian Society’s London School of Economic and Political Science – and in most cases have the mental inability to think beyond what they have been academically indoctrinated, rather than exercise any genuine free thought or vision of their own to benefit our economy and make it more equitable for all our people. So yes. I acknowledge The Tax Working Group has an extremely difficult task ahead of it to satisfy all of these many varied vested financial interests mainly dominated by overseas bankers, while at the same time, truly attempting to maintain the general trust and confidence of all New Zealanders, to instil general integrity and fairness into the tax system. At the end of my submission I will address in much more specific detail how these foreign bankers’ and the multinational companies that they control, are disgracefully sucking the economic lifeblood out of the New Zealand economy, monopolizing and taking over control of almost all the nation’s key national assets. In so doing, they are rapidly pauperizing the general population under a deliberate system of debt bondage and enslavement, and are unduly manipulating and negatively influencing the New Zealand banking and tax system. Accordingly, at the end of this submission, I will make, I hope, some realistic and meaningful recommendations to show how the tax system might be acceptably reformed in the future to make things genuinely much “fairer” for all our citizens – but certainly not for these foreign banking parasites as is the prevailing case now. I have written my submission more in regular book format hopefully to help make it more easily readable because it is dealing with a very complex issue not widely known or appreciated. I have divided up my following comments and recommendations into sub- headings by number, in general order of priority, with the last ones being an exception, specifically addressing the banking fraternity’s duplicity, because I don’t want to give readers ‘heart failure’ before they have read the earlier part of my submission. Nevertheless, I am sure you will appreciate, rarely does one economic policy operate entirely in isolation without affecting another, and so I have tried to comment only on the very few key ones that I see as most important facing New Zealand at the present. Subsequently I have recommended policies which I feel are the simplest, yet will have the most positive impact for everyone in our country, \[with the exception of the bankers that is\], without negatively impacting the rest of the general economy. In this submission I am critical of serious failings within certain particular groups, bankers, Catholic and Protestant Christians, Jews and Socialists. I have tried to adhere to the bare facts only. Please do not take these criticisms personally if you are a member of one of them. There are good, sincere people in all of them. It is more the system that needs to change, rather than the personalities in it. 9 1) TAX REVENUE TO GDP RATIO – THE BIBLE VERSUS SOCIALIST OECD ECONOMISTS I note that in the Terms of Reference: Tax Working Group (presumably prepared by the NZ Treasury) released by Hon Grant Robertson, Minister of Finance, on 23 November 2017, that the Tax Working Group is instructed to maintain this following objective for the NZ tax system: “A system that supports a sustainable revenue base to fund government operating expenditure around its historical level of 30 per cent of GDP.” This again was confirmed in your Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper, page 5, “Overall, the current level of tax revenue, including local government rates, is equivalent to 32% of gross domestic product (GDP), which is slightly below the OECD average of 34% of GDP.” This was further confirmed by Hon Sir Michael Cullen, in his Speech to the International Fiscal Association (IFA) Conference, Queenstown, 2 March 2018, on page 4, where he said, “It seems unlikely that, beyond the ten-year horizon set for the Tax Working Group, operating expenditure will be kept as low as around 30% of GDP. The Treasury prediction for 2045 is just under 40%.” With respect, with taxation rates of 30% or worse, rising to 40% to GDP, what the NZ Treasury are saying, in effect, is that by continuing to pursue the existing policies of increasing government spending as a proportion of GDP, they are going to gradually destroy our economy and create more poverty. In my view, this level of ignorance about basic economics and how the levels of tax affect an economy is entirely unsatisfactory. Accordingly, I will explain this point further. The Bible Old Testament (Torah to Jews) very precisely limited all revenue to the government of Israel in the form of tithes (equivalent to taxes today) to a maximum of 10% (plus voluntary offerings). This is an immutable economic law set by Abraham (1996-1821 BC). It is not only a ‘political’ or ‘religious’ law, but it is a ‘universal law of basic economics’ (similar, for example, to the law of gravity) which, if broken, produces consequences. Obviously taxes must be levied to provide funds for governments to operate, and we all agree with that. However, if one studies levels of tax rates, one will observe a unique phenomenon. When taxes rise as a proportion of GDP over a baseline threshold of about 10%, when calculated over a 10-year period, altogether the government, the taxpayer and the nation all end up with vastly LESS REVENUE. 10 For example, a 10% Tax to GDP Ratio produces over TWENTY TIMES MORE WEALTH for a nation, and hence equally more tax revenue for the government, than a 75% tax rate over a 10-year period. I know it is a remarkable paradox, and that ordinarily one would naturally think that the higher a government levies various taxes on its citizens the more revenue it will generate to help the poor and pay for other government spending. But the truth is, when the level of tax revenue to GDP rises over 10%, the policy actually produces less wealth for all, including the government, the taxpayer and the nation. Ordinarily, this universal economic law is difficult to understand for most because it goes against one’s natural thinking. So I have typed up an Appendix Table titled, “HOW TAXES DESTROY WEALTH – Example: A Company Producing 100% Profit Before Tax Each Year, Produces the Following Wealth,” covering a 10-year period (to comply with your Terms of Reference), to illustrate the point much more simply. Under the Appendix Table on page 75, are also some “Special Notes” about it, and a summary of the most well-known “Biblical Economic Laws” underneath which you may find of interest, although in the current global economic system, totally impossible to implement. I have copyrighted this TABLE and SUMMARY to protect the original text, but nevertheless, have provided it to the Public Domain for all who wish to freely use it, including yourselves – since it seems so plain now, that all of the world’s leading economists, or at least those at the OECD, with respect, haven’t got a clue in the wide world what they’re talking about! I have included a copy of this Appendix Table and summary on page 75 at the end of this submission. Even when a country becomes exceptionally prosperous, if this basic law of economics is broken, depending on the level of tax imposed on its citizens above this 10% threshold, the country will ultimately decline in direct proportion to the taxing excess. If the Tax Revenue to GDP rises above 10%, the rate of decline can be temporarily restrained for a period by increasing credit expansion and the money supply over a period of years, but as this inevitably depreciates the currency and causes inflation in the longer term, it saturates the economy with unsustainable debt, and will ultimately collapse the banking system and economy. 11 Norway is a good example of an extremely wealthy country at present in the process of beginning to be destroyed by a high Tax Revenue to GDP Ratio of 54.7%, the second highest in the OECD. While the country is richly endowed with natural resources and has a huge income from oil and gas, much of it accumulated in the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund valued at almost $900 billion as of early 2017. After solid GDP growth in the 2001-07 period, by 2017, it was experiencing a very modest GDP growth of only 1.4%, and the decline is accelerating. In fact, the mediocre growth in all OECD countries of around only 1% – 5% now is directly attributable to these excessive government Tax to GDP Ratios averaging 34%. MY RECOMMENDATION: Therefore, based on the figures provided in my table on page 75, I believe that one of the first things that the Tax Working Group should do, is at least point out to the NZ Government and NZ Treasury that the Terms of Reference prepared by Treasury is substantially in error. The government should not continue to follow its spurious historical standard OECD guidelines, but should gradually concentrate on reducing the New Zealand Tax Revenue to GDP Ratio from 32% to around 10%. This should not be done too quickly or overnight, but it should be introduced very gradually. This would ENORMOUSLY stimulate the growth in the economy, provide an enormous incentive for everyone broadly not to try and evade taxes anymore. It also would help make the levying of taxes simpler and fairer for everybody, and it would create increased wealth for all taxpayers – and as the result, generate a much bigger tax revenue cake for the government to share with the needy and meet departmental spending.

It is true many other countries in the Western world today have progressively introduced nefarious taxes like these in recent times. This, in spite of the fact that history has overwhelmingly shown that these taxes, at their very heart, are incredibly unfair for most people, are hated by the general public, destroy innovation and entrepreneurship, and are extremely counter-productive. So why, on earth, should the New Zealand Government at present, ever want to blindly follow other countries to introduce them is a complete puzzle. NZ LAND TAX HISTORY When one looks at the chequered history of Land Taxes in this country in particular, to seriously contemplate their reintroduction now is bordering on madness. Land Tax was first imposed on New Zealanders under the Land Tax Act (1878) followed by the Property Tax Act 1879 which was charged at a rate of .4%, but since there was a £500 exemption, very few people in the country actually paid it. By 1895, it made up 76% of the total land and income tax revenue income of the government. Yet by 1967, in a report produced by a committee chaired by Auckland accountant Lewis Ross, land tax made up only .5% of government revenue. By 1982, only 5% of total land value was taxed, and as land taxes were also considered to be duplicative of local authority property rate levies, with these making up 57% of local government income by 2001. There was an almost unanimous cry from all sectors to abolish them. As the result. It was the economic impetus of reforms pushed by the Labour government elected in 1984 that wisely saw a strong move away from taxing capital in all forms. Accordingly, in 1990, the Land Tax Abolition Act (1990) was passed, terminating New Zealand’s long history of taxing land. So we may ask, why on earth is the same political party that formerly abolished these taxes, now pushing for their reintroduction now? Land and capital gains taxes are very pernicious in that they attack the productive assets base of any country. 13 Unlike taxes on production, which vary with the ebb and flow of the general economy, land taxes especially, are relatively constant and are an extremely dire imposition on businesses and individuals who pay them especially during any downturn in the economy. Because these taxes do not rise and fall with earnings, or respect the ability of the taxpayer to pay them, in depressed economic times they are very financially destructive indeed. There has been a marked resurgence in governments all around the world in recent times to implement various forms of land tax, but in the long-term these taxes are very counter- productive and destructive to the general economy. Usually when land taxes become more onerous on taxpayers, governments end up making them much more complex and building up yet another giant parasitic bureaucracy to administer them because of the countless rafts of exemptions and concessions sought by various interest groups that can’t afford to pay them. These pressures for extensive exemptions and concessions end up forcing the government to depart from any simple system using a standardized low land tax rate over all land in the state, and end up making it very complex and administratively expensive. This usually includes implementing cascading rates, surcharges, special rates for trusts, absentee landlords or corporations, with endless exemptions for Crown land, certain agricultural land, indigenous peoples’ land, municipal and public land, friendly societies, childcare centres, sporting groups, various non-profit organisations, health centres, residential care facilities, retirement villages, caravan parks and rock concert venues – the list goes on and on – and just to make sure the system becomes even more complex, concessional rates may be applied as well. AUSTRALIAN LAND TAX EXAMPLE Australian states have had land taxes for many years, with the exception of Northern Territory that has none. One only has to leave New Zealand and hop over the Tasman Sea to the Australian state of Victoria at present to see what madness the imposition of Land Tax is doing, with rates cascading up to 2.25% p.a. While it is true the Victorian state government in 2016 generated $1.734 billion from land tax and budgeted for an increase of 22% rising to $2.225 billion in 2017, the policy is upsetting a huge proportion of the public and is impoverishing many investors, businesses and tenants. Although the total amount of land tax collected by the state government at first sounds impressive, it is quite possible, if not probable, that the income generated by land tax is being 14 dramatically offset by an even bigger decline in general tax revenue being paid to the Federal government. Victorian retail tenancy laws prohibit landlords from directly passing on land taxes to their tenants unless the business is a listed company. This all sounds fine and dandy in theory, but in practice, this is meaningless, as landlords are forced to dramatically increase rents during rental reviews to help compensate for the burdensome land tax imposition, sell, or go out of business. Thus rental prices in Melbourne currently are soaring, forcing many tenants to live in tents, backyards or on balconies. Exorbitant land taxes have converted what was a mild rental shortage into full-blown massive rental crisis. In the last 12 months, with 2016-2017 being a revaluation year, most properties in Melbourne that have risen in value through inflation have experienced massive increases in land tax bills, some at levels of 1200 per cent or more. In one case reported by the media in 2017 was a 73- year-old grandfather who saw his retirement property nest-egg land tax bill rise from $5300 to more than $67,900. In another case, an elderly 90-year-old woman who owns a Swanston Street shop in Melbourne and lives off the income with a full-time carer says she has seen her most recent tax bill jump from $6,095 to $40,950. The land tax rises are also destroying the legitimacy of long-term commercial leases, with a national ASX-listed supermarket chain which operates a store in Melbourne’s south-east under a long lease has seen its bill rise from $167,625 in 2016 to $261,788 in 2017. Already it has got so bad, there are calls for the Victorian government to abolish the land tax imposition or reform it to ensure it is a flatter and fairer system, but if that is ever done, it will consequently still hurt a lot more people who can’t afford to pay it and it will substantially reduce the overall level of total tax collected. • “Disastrous” land tax soars 1200 per cent in 12 months. http://www.afr.com/personal-finance/disastrous-land-tax-soars-1200-per-cent-in- 12-months-20170607-gwm9pp • Bill shock for landlords as land tax skyrockets. https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/bill-shock-for-landlords-as-land-tax- skyrockets-20170224-gukiya.html • Renters resort to paying for tents and shared rooms due to high cost of living. http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/buying/renters-resort-to-paying-for- tents-and-shared-rooms-due-to-high-cost-of-living/news- story/d3977d7c436ad9b4e94f11a56dee0fcb 15 LAND TAX & FRENCH REVOLUTION, 1789 George Santayana (1863-1952) is reputed to have wisely said: “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it“. No better does this profound statement apply to politicians and bureaucrats today, who have, at best, a very limited understanding of history. No better does their ignorance of history manifest itself in their stupidity in wanting to reintroduce land taxes. It was the insane imposition of land tax that created the beginning of the French Revolution, in 1789. King Louis XVI needed money. A deep financial crisis forced the French monarch to reluctantly convene the Estates General in order to levy a new land tax that would hopefully solve his monetary woes. It had been 175 years since the last meeting of this deliberative body that included representatives of three Estates: the First comprised the Clergy, the Second comprised the Nobility and the Third comprised the Middle and Lower classes. The Estates General soon declared itself a National Assembly opposing the king’s land tax. The tension increased, exacerbated by massive crop failures that led to a shortage of food. In Paris, mobs filled the city’s streets. The fear spread that the king would retaliate with force. On July 14 th , the mob stormed the Bastille to obtain arms. The attack launched the nation down a pathway that would eventually lead to the destruction of the French monarchy and Crown – culminating with the brutal execution and beheading of Louis XVI on 21 January 1794 at the Place de la Révolution. http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/frenchrevolution.htm Today, the French government, (paradoxically, even though the nation still celebrates Bastille Day in memory of the event) apparently has developed severe amnesia, gone mad or has completely lost its mind, forgotten about this important period of French history, and reintroduced the same land taxes that formerly motivated its citizens in unanimous cry, “off with the King’s head!” LAND TAXES & MAGNA CARTA 1215 Similarly, it was these extortionate LAND TAXES called “Tallages,” “Carucages” and “Scutages” that led to the peoples’ rebellion against King John forcing him to sign the Magna Carta 1215, which still forms much of the basis of English, American and New Zealand law today. 16 Tallages were more frequently levied on the king’s Jewish bankers during the 12 th and 13 th centuries, and more will be mentioned about them relating to the bankers towards the end of this submission. Carucages were a medieval English land tax which replaced the “danegeld” first introduced by King Richard I in 1194. Carucage land taxes were only levied six times, and were later replaced by taxes on income and personal property. It was these scutages ‘land taxes’ that led to the rebellion against King John forcing him to sign the Magna Carta under duress. Subsequently, in Magna Carta 1215, Clause 12, there is a law forbidding the Crown to levy Scutage ‘land tax’ without general consent of the people. It reads: “No ‘scutage’ or ‘aid’ may be levied in our kingdom without its general consent, unless it is for the ransom of our person, to make our eldest son a knight, and (once) to marry our eldest daughter. For these purposes only a reasonable ‘aid’ may be levied. ‘Aids’ from the city of London are to be treated similarly.” It was the barons’ opposition to King John’s annual scutages (1201-1206) that was the predominant factor in their revolt in 1214, that led to the final drafting up and signing of the Magna Carta 1215. The term ‘aid’ in the Charta referred to “feudal aid” that was a legal term for one of the financial duties or payments required of a feudal tenant or vassal to his lord, often required by the lord when he himself was levied with scutage ‘land taxes’ by the Crown. In a similar way, as is the case right now in Australia, the “land lord” who is being oppressed by having to pay these exorbitant land taxes to the state, has to get the money from somewhere to pay them, so he has no other choice than to exact them from his “feudal tenants.” This is simply English history repeating itself now, and although the Australian state governments don’t know it yet, there are obviously going to be severe repercussions in the future for them in proving to be so ignorant of this resounding historical fact. Originally scutage was also called ‘shield money’ from Latin scutum ‘shield’ in feudal law, which was a payment made by a knight to commute the military service that he owed his lord. Scutage existed in various European countries, including France and Germany, but was most highly developed in England where it is first mentioned in 1100. 17 It was first levied on ecclesiastical tenants in chief, who had difficulty in finding their full quota of knights for the king’s army. It soon became a general tax on knight’s estates, and by the 13 th century the rates were standardized. However, because it was so intensely hated, it became obsolete in the 14 th century. Scutage, (as the payment of money in lieu of serving as a knight) soon after, prompted the appearance of landless knights, titled the “bachelery of England,” men who would undertake the service owed to the barons by the sub-tenants. These landless knights were the forerunners of the Knights Bachelor, one of the lower orders of chivalry we have today as part of the British honours system. Perhaps, it’s somewhat of a modern paradox, and a remarkable quirk of historical significance, that Hon Sir Michael Cullen, a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, has been appointed to chair a Tax Working Group that has been given the unenviable task to consider such a tax, that historically was so soundly hated and rejected formerly by his feudal contemporaries, knights and lords of the Crown? 3) CAPITAL GAINS TAX “The theory of Communism may be summed up in one sentence: Abolish all private property.” (Karl Marx, The Communist Manifesto – Chapter II, 1867). Capital gains taxes at their heart are not driven by basic sound economics at all, but traditionally have been often inspired by a “Christian Socialist” religious rejection of the Bible, fundamentalist Christianity, and the free market, private enterprise system. There are many forms of socialism, Christian Socialism, Marxism, Communism (Democratic Socialism), Leninism, Fabian Socialism and Fascism etc. While all these generally have different methods in achieving their goals, they are ‘birds of the same feather’ when it comes to philosophical belief, based on the writings of the two most famous ancient Greek classical philosophers, Plato and Aristotle. The ‘bible’ of all high-level socialists is a book written by Plato called The Republic. Very little that the Jewish philosopher Karl Marx wrote, in fact, was original and most of it was directly taken from these two classical pre-Christian Greek authors. PLATO, SOCIALISM & CAPITAL GAINS TAX Plato dreamed that one day, sometime in the future, all hereditary constitutional monarchies would be abolished, because more often than not these hereditary sovereigns in the past had 18 terribly abused their hereditary power. He also believed, that normal, independent, democratic governments run by political parties should be abolished as well, because more often than not, the politicians that run them did not possess the long-term experience to rule as did monarchs. These politicians, he felt, were more often than not consistently unethical and were not genuinely interested in acting for the general public at all, but more in lining their own pockets for short term interest and political gain only, and like common bed-bugs, often jumped from one political party to another at the drop of a hat. What Plato dreamed of was the creation of a world socialist republic, a sort of ‘paradise on earth,’ where everything was owned and controlled by a benevolent State, and everyone would live in total harmony, peace and security and be treated justly as equals while being led by a benevolent dictator. This man, of course, would be a great philosopher like Plato himself, who would be respected not by birth, privilege or material possessions at all, but rather, for his great philosophical wisdom and knowledge, charity, integrity and enduring multi-faith love for all humanity. Someone who was highly respected, who would end all war and bring in everlasting peace to all nations and religions in a new world order. Because of this, Plato believed, that royalty had the greatest experience of all to lead. So he believed that this ideal world socialist leader to come would still be a royal prince, but instead of ruling his World Republic by hereditary right or privileged birth, he should first have to prove himself as a wise philosopher, prince of peace, and man of the people “uniting all nations” by his charitable stature. Only then, could he be properly considered qualified to rule, to be elected by the resounding will of the people to become the WORLD PHILOSOPHER KING, the coming world dictator, of this new ‘united nations’ benevolent world republic. This is the type of world government, based on the works of Plato, all high level socialists religiously aspire to and dream about implementing today, and central to that is the goal to abolish all privately owned property of the majority through capital and wealth taxes. THE SYNTHESIS BETWEEN MARXISM & FASCISM: PROMOTING CAPITAL GAINS TAX AND ULTIMATE CONFISCATION OF THE FAMILY HOME Today, in socialism there are two seemingly opposing neo-Platonic socialist forces at play. In high level, Marxist socialism, the world state is perceived to become the ultimate beneficial owner of everything. However, conversely, in global fascist socialism (based more on ancient Roman fascism) the state controls everything, while the physical assets of all nations and everyone are planned to be seized and owned by just twelve, giant, global, PRIVATELY- OWNED multinational companies and banks, currently with their head offices domiciled in Guildhall, City of London Corporation. 19 In both forms of socialism, capital gains taxes form an integral part of the global plan to confiscate all private property from 99% of the general world population. Capital Gains Taxes, while more often than not, are deceptively proposed to be introduced gradually by Fabian/Marxist socialists “to make the tax system fairer” for the public, by at first claiming, “but we will not touch the family home” in fact, usually have nothing to do with making anything “fairer” at all. The true aim is to confiscate all private property, INCLUDING the family home and farm, and as the case may be, either transfer it all to a Marxist state owned by an international banking elite, or in a Fascist state, owned by twelve privately owned giant multinational banks and corporations, in turn, still owned by the same banking elite families. At the very highest level of global socialism is World Freemasonry, based in the United Grand Lodge of England, Great Queens Street, London, led in the highest degrees by an occult cabal of bankers bent on enslaving humanity. Their American branches are the York Rite and Scottish Rite based in Washington D.C. and Alexandria, Virginia. New Zealand Freemasonry is a branch of the Scottish Rite based in London. Sadly, neither the majority of Freemasons nor Socialists are aware of this high-level nefarious plan, are naïve victims of it themselves, and if they were properly informed about it, like most good people, would probably passionately oppose it. This is the great tragedy behind the attempt in some quarters today in New Zealand to introduce Capital Gains Tax on our citizens now. The great paradox is, as has been consistently proven in the past by the socialist dictatorships of Adolph Hitler in Germany, Joseph Stalin in Russia and Mao Zedong in China, or even Nero in ancient Rome, when such people take up their positions to rule. The first people traditionally to get a bullet in the back of the head are those very same people that were most instrumental in bringing them to power, and these groups often include many of the very poorer classes of people they claim to initially represent. Although many would deny it, it seems that the present tax system developing in Australia and New Zealand through the promotion of land tax and capital gains taxes currently might be described more as ‘Cultural Marxism’ and ‘Corporate Fascism’ merged together to destroy free-enterprise capitalism. However, of the two branches of socialism, it is “global fascism” that is likely to rise to become preeminent, simply because it now controls the Anglo/American global banking system and 20 media and therefore the minds of the masses. The ancient symbol of fascism is a bundle of rods bound with the helve of an axe called the fasces. There are two gold fasces held by two tritons, the sons of Neptune/Poseidon, at the rear of the Gold State Coach that supports the British Sovereign, and copies of these two gold fasces are mounted on the wall behind the Speaker’s Rostrum in the US House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. In fact, the Statue of Freedom since 1863 crowning the Dome of the US Capitol (temple of Jupiter) building, has a pedestal made up of these same Roman fasces, symbolizing that the seat of the US government now is entirely fascist. http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-674218 https://www.aoc.gov/art/other-statues/statue- freedom This at least partly explains why the impetus to introduce draconian capital gains tax in various countries including New Zealand is coming not only from organisations like the socialist Fabian Society in London, (which largely influences the British, Australian and NZ Labour Parties’ economic policies) directly through its New Zealand Fabian Society branch here: https://www.fabians.org.nz/index.php?option=com\_content&view=article&id=233:do-we- need-a-capital-gains-tax-cgt&catid=41&ltemid=79 It also explains why capital gains taxes are also even more vociferously being unanimously supported by New Zealand’s ‘big four banks’ as well (which are branches of the big four Australian banks, which in turn are not even Australian, but are largely owned and controlled by big foreign Anglo/American banking monoliths in New York and London, now owned by a mere handful of dynastic banking families). Here is a more recent report published by The New Zealand Herald dated 20 May, 2014, about Westpac Bank chief economist, Dominick Stephens; “Support for capital gains tax”: http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c\_id=3&objectid=11257816 Here is another report, posted in News June 7, 2017, about ANZ New Zealand chief economist, Cameron Bagrie, on behalf of his foreign-owned bank supporting the introduction of Capital Gains Tax: https://www.interest.co.nz/news/88145/anzs-cameron-bagrie- suggests-new-zealanders-may-be-ready-eat-broccoli-making-some-hard Here is another, posted October 9, 2017, about BNZ Bank CEO, Anthony Healy, supporting Capital Gains Tax as well, titled, “BNZ CEO calls for capital gains tax.” The BNZ Bank is owned by National Australia Bank, in turn which isn’t even Australian but is owned by foreign bankers. https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/97676478/BNZ-CEO-calls-for-capital-gains-tax 21 Finally, here is the Reserve Bank of New Zealand itself (a body corporate wholly owned by the government of New Zealand), in a report dated April 15, 2015, titled, “Capital gains tax on investment property – bold call from Reserve Bank” where the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Deputy Governor, Grant Spencer, supports the introduction of Capital Gains Tax as well. https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/capital-gains-tax-on-investment- property-bold-call-from-reserve-bank-6288439 Again, while the Bank technically is established by and owned by the New Zealand Parliament and Government, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is in fact controlled by the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, and certainly not by New Zealanders or the New Zealand Government. Yes, there is a Reserve Bank Act through which the New Zealand Government influences the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s economic policies to a small degree through the Monetary Policy Committee. However, the fact remains, the Reserve Bank is entirely independent of the Government and is largely run by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) based in Basel, Switzerland. THE REAL REASON WHY HOUSE PRICE INFLATION IS SO HIGH IN NEW ZEALAND: BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS – CAPITAL ADEQUACY RATIOS FAVOURING HOUSING It is often simplistically said by many, including deceitful bankers, and endless politicians who should know better, that house price inflation is primarily caused by “greedy property speculators and investors.” This might sound very reasonable and acceptable for many uninformed people, but it could not be further from the truth when the real reason is much more complex. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the 25 banks that it licences and controls, are all well aware they are being blatantly misleading in claiming that capital gains taxes or land taxes will help reduce house and property prices and “make the tax system fairer for all New Zealanders” – when they all know full well that the real reason house price inflation is so excessive is that the capital adequacy ratios set by the Bank of International Settlements Basel Capital Framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision through the Basel II and Basal III capital framework heavily influence the banks’ bias to direct the majority of their credit expansion and loans into housing. 22 Thus, in New Zealand, the percentage of total bank funds loaned to the housing sector is about 61%, compared to agriculture at about 15% (of which the dairy sector comprises two thirds), or manufacturing at 3%. It is this foreign power over our Reserve Bank policies that has fundamentally caused, combined with the provision of low interest and easy credit by the banks, the rapid rise in inflation in house prices. Other factors have helped too, such as excessive immigration and shortages of developed land affecting normal supply and demand parameters. But the primary cause is the provision of BIS bias causing banks to heavily target loans towards housing. If the provision of cheap, easy credit to the housing sector was sharply tightened, or if world interest rates were increased substantially by the banks, because of the high levels of debt now concentrated in housing, values would fall significantly. The preference in weighting loans to the housing sector is included in a Regulatory Impact Statement of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand called, ‘Regulatory impact assessment on the asset class treatment of residential property investment loans May 2015’. Because of this irresponsible expansion of cheap and easy credit by the banks aimed at the housing sector, and promoted by the central bank under foreign BIS rules, in spite of Australia now, for example, having some of the most onerous and repressive capital gains and land taxes in the world, house and asset prices in recent times have still risen astronomically in value. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/basel3.htm https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/faqs/basel-iii-capital-adequacy-requirements-faqs AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL GAINS TAX SUMMARY If capital gains taxes were introduced into New Zealand, it is logical to expect that they would be closely aligned with the Australian system. A capital gains tax (CGT) was first introduced in Australia on 20 September 1985 by the then Hawke/Keating Labour Government. The tax applied to most assets owned on and after that date, with the value of the assets held for one year or more indexed to the consumer price index, in which part of the gain due to inflation was not taxed. From 20 September 1999, the Howard Government discontinued indexation and introduced a standard 50% discount on the capital gain for individual taxpayers to make the system much simpler. The 50% CGT discount is not available to companies and superannuation funds, which are entitled only to a 33% CGT discount. F weekly article: Pen pusher pose the biggest threat, Graham Carter 23 Most assets are included, including residential property, commercial property, holiday homes, land, shares, businesses, works of art etc. There are a wide range of concessions and exemptions, but basically, for the average person, the taxpayer’s main residence is exempt and up to the first 2 hectares of adjacent land used for domestic purposes. CGT is applied to 50% of the capital gain at the taxpayer’s top marginal tax rate in the year the asset is sold. Currently, as at April 2018, the two top marginal tax rates for the 2017/2018 financial year (1 st July 2017 to 30 June 2018), in Australia are: 1) $87,001-$180,000 = 37% plus 2% Medicare levy 2% = Total 39% and 2) $180,000 and above – 45% plus 2% Medicare levy = Total 47%. Subject to legislation, the Medicare levy is planned to be increased to 2.5% from 1 st July, 2019. This means, in most cases, the effective CGT tax rate on 50% of the total capital gain on most properties currently is either 39% or 47%. Or, if calculated on the full capital gain – 19.5% or 23.5%. However, there are strong pressures both from within the Australian government and from within the foreign, multinational banks and corporations to entirely remove the CGT discount altogether, and gradually remove the exemption granted to all owner/occupied residential properties. If this happens, Karl Marx’s dream will be close to becoming a reality in Australia! Former Australian Labour Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, in early 2013, was widely known to have pushed for the behind-the-scenes Australian Fabian Society’s plan to abolish owner/occupied residential exemptions from CGT for all homes valued over $1 million, as well as reducing or removing the 50% CGT discount for all but the very cheapest homes. https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/pm-gets-tough-on-deals-for-well-off-20130129- 2dj09.html “PM gets tough on deals for well-off” In early January 2016, there was a proposal within the Australian federal government to again push for abolishing the CGT tax exemption on luxury homes, based on statistical data from two left-wing socialist agencies in Canberra – The Australia Institute and the Centre for Social and Economic Modelling. The Australia Institute is a far-left think tank in Canberra and the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (NATSEM) at the University of Canberra is one of Australia’s major left-wing social policy research centres. 24 NATSEM has a huge number of International partnerships linked to its Centre for Deliberative Democracy and Global Governance which focus on indoctrinating students to support world governance, including the Fabian Society’s London School of Economics Policy Group, the Harvard/Ash Centre for Democratic governance, UN Development Programme in New York, University of Auckland and the University of Waikato. https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/push-to-tax-profits-on-sale-of-luxury-family- homes-rejected-by-labor-20160111-gm36sw.html “Capital gains tax: Push to tax profits on sale of luxury homes rejected.” GRATTAN INSTITUTE On February 20, 2017, in The Australian, David Crowe wrote a particularly pertinent article titled, ‘Coalition remains open to capital gains tax rise to tackle housing affordability.’ In this article he wrote: “The government remains open to a controversial increase in capital gains tax as part of a dramatic move in the May budget to tackle housing affordability ...The Grattan Institute estimates the government could raise $4 billion a year by scrapping a concession on the capital gains tax that means owners of investment properties only pay half the marginal tax rate on the gain they make when they sell the asset...” https://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/coalition-remains-open-to-capital- gains-tax-rise-to-tackle-housing-affordability/news- story/2ba46f5c93a3635b46e7e7498837ebd7 Or, if not a subscriber, Google; “Coalition remains open to capital gains tax rise to tackle housing affordability.” The Grattan Institute is Australia’s foremost public policy ‘fascist’ think-tank pushing for a socialist, one world government. The Institute was established in 2008, and is based in Melbourne, named after Grattan Street abutting Melbourne University. The Grattan Institute in Melbourne is affiliated with, and effectively is, the Australian branch of the Brookings Institute in Washington D.C. Unlike The Australia Institute and the NATSEM left-wing Fabian think-tanks in Canberra, the Grattan Institute is an entirely ‘fascist-thinking’ group, being funded by global big business such as BHP Billiton, National Australia Bank, The Myer Foundation, Google, McKinsey & Company, Deloitte, ANZ Bank, Westpac Bank, and Woodside. The CEO of the Institute is John Daley who has headed it since it was founded nine years ago. Previously he worked for McKinsey & Co and ANZ Bank. 25 FRACTIONAL RESERVE BANKING, GOLD, FIAT CURRENCY & CAPITAL GAINS TAX Most currencies originally backed by gold or silver were abolished after WWI including by countries such as Australia and New Zealand. On June 5, 1933, US President Roosevelt, passed a law so that the US dollar was no longer freely convertible into gold by US citizens, however it wasn’t until August 15, 1971, when President Nixon announced that the US dollar would no longer be convertible into gold in the international markets that it can be truly considered the US was no longer on the gold standard. The Fractional Reserve Banking System in the US was greatly strengthened and expanded with the establishment of the US Federal Reserve in 1913. After all countries went off the gold standard, all currencies in the world may be classed as fiat currencies. These are backed simply by nothing. As banks have expanded credit under the Fractional Reserve Banking System all around the world, overseen by the Bank of England established in 1694 which now indirectly controls the Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland established in 1930, the depreciation in the value of these fiat currencies has accelerated causing rising inflation. Inflation is a devious robber and most pernicious felon for society in general as it is so inherently destructive. While in the shorter term it benefits physical asset owners such as home-owners and land-owners, in the longer term it is totally destructive to almost every sector of the economy. But for bankers and governments that traditionally support capital gains, land and wealth taxes, are a short-term blessing. This is because as an asset rapidly rises in value, the original asset owner’s share in the asset, through capital gains tax on the inflation component is transferred to the government and in most cases is then repatriated on to the banks to service interest payments on irresponsible government deficit borrowing. If over time a freehold house with no debt rises in value from currency depreciation, for example, $1 to $10, the capital gain is $9. When the house is sold, with 50% CGT for example, the government takes $4.50 leaving the home-owner with $5.50 and in the evil process the government has surreptitiously stolen almost half the entire value of the house from the citizen. 26 Repeat the process again and again, and before long the home-owner has lost his whole house to the taxman, who then forwards much of this revenue on to the bankers as interest to service rising government deficit borrowing. Capital gains taxes should never ever form any part in any genuine democratic government tax structure at all. 4) BACKGROUND: INTERNATIONAL BANKERS’ TAKEOVER OF NZ ECONOMY “Banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin. The bankers own the earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create money, and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again. However, take away from them the power to create money and all of the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear, for this would be a happier and better world to live in. But, if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery, let them continue to create money.” \[Reputedly stated by Sir Josiah Stamp (1880-1941) Director of the Bank of England\] In The Tax Working Group’s Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper published on 14 March 2018, you will forgive me, I hope, for being mistaken when reading page 18 titled, “The Four Capitals” about what is referred to be “Natural Capital, Social Capital, Human Capital and Financial/Physical Capital” – that at first I thought I was in fact reading not part of a report to reform the New Zealand tax system, but my copy of Karl Marx’s revolutionary book – Das Capital. Further, in this same Background Paper in pages 36 and 37, the authors refer to “Wealth Inequality” using the Ministry of Social Development’s Household Incomes in New Zealand report which supposedly summarizes the inequality-reducing power of New Zealand’s tax and transfer system compared to OECD averages and guidelines. In it, on page 37, they conveniently include a graph, prepared by Statistics New Zealand, titled, Figure 18 Median personal net worth by age group (2015) which reveals the net median wealth of all New Zealanders by age : “Ages 15-24: $1000, Ages 25-34: $26,000, Ages 35-44: $96,000, Ages 45-54: $182,000, Ages 55-64: $278,000, Age 65+: $288,000.” 27 The inference is, but not expressly mentioned, that these figures supposedly show that those in the two highest age groups must be taxed substantially more to redistribute the wealth to the younger groups that possess substantially less or next to nothing. Yet on average, the net median wealth of the highest over 65’s group is remarkably low at $288,000 – and less than a third of the average house price in Auckland at present. This amount really is outrageously low, and wouldn’t even now buy a residential section in Tauranga or Hamilton. So for an average Kiwi citizen who has spent not only a lifetime serving his country and working on the family farm, and has probably received some form of family inheritance into the bargain as well to buffer up this median figure, to end up with a miserly, grand total of Net Personal Wealth at only $288,000 per person at 65+ age is shockingly low. Perhaps this explains why the number of elderly claiming the accommodation supplement while on Superannuation now is increasing at present by over 2000 per year! Really, this atrocious situation is a complete and utter disgrace for our nation. To even suggest a ‘minority’ of this older group of private citizens who have largely invested most of their life savings tied up in their own homes, or have invested in a few privately- owned shares, pension funds, one or two rental houses or farms or whatever, that continue to benefit the wider economic growth of the country – to end up in this same group accumulating a pathetic net wealth average per person of just $288,000 is totally scandalous. But what is eminently much worse, and an insult, is for the current government, with the complicity of the foreign banking oligarchy that monopolize the banking system in our country, to have the downright cheek and audacity to try to impose capital gains taxes, land taxes or wealth taxes on our people supposedly “to make the system fairer” is a complete mockery and treachery. This therefore leads to the vital question, since the average New Zealander is so incredible poor, just who is it, then, precisely that secretly owns the majority of New Zealand’s assets and wealth? Because it obviously is not the average New Zealand citizens at all. HISTORY OF GLOBAL BANKING: THE ‘KING’s JEWS’ Modern banking as we know it today was first established in the City of London following the Battle of Hastings when William the Conqueror (reign: 25 December 1066 – 9 September 1087) first brought Jewish bankers to England from the continent in 1066. Jews were always considered masters of banking, but they were nothing more than the king’s chattels and 28 accounts receivable clerks, in that what they owned was legally not their own, but ultimately held on behalf of the king. Shortly after the conquest, William granted a Royal Charter around 1067 confirming the rights and privileges to the City of London Corporation, the independent business and banking corporation of the sovereign, located inside the old Roman walls of London, enjoyed since the time of Edward the confessor. Then under the reign of Richard I (Lion Heart) (reign: 3 September 1189 – 6 April 1199) the city gained its right to have its own mayor and later, to directly elect its own mayor from 1215. This is generally the time when it is considered the modern banking Corporation that remains today was founded, when the first mayor was appointed. Believing that the Jews were masters of banking and would make England, but more particularly the king, more prosperous, William the Conqueror brought a group of Jews from Rouen in Normandy to England in 1070. On the conquest of England, William instituted a feudal system in the country, whereby all estates that formerly belonged to the Crown that were largely mismanaged, although he still continued to legally own the land, he appointed Lords of the Manor (Barons) tenants over these vast estates to lease it from him to better manage them. In return, the Lords had to swear an oath of fealty to the King, were subject to financial and military obligations to the king but they became very rich and powerful. Under these privileged lords/barons were Knights (or Vassals), who were given land by the Baron in return for military service and had to protect the Baron and his family as well as the Manor from attack. The Knights kept as much of the land as they wished for themselves and distributed the unwanted balance to the lowest class of all called the villeins or serfs who were the poor peasants. This system, although it has been reformed somewhat, has largely carried on to the present day, although most of the general global population are too uneducated to know or be aware of it. In less than twenty years of arriving in the country, from 1170, the Jews had dominated banking throughout England. By the time Richard I had come to the throne, the Jews held a mort-gage (French; ‘death-bond’) over many of the lords/barons and merchants, having loaned them money to help pay for the king’s costs in fighting the 3 rd crusade for the Pope. The usurious interest rates they charged were high – 40% to 50%. https://archive.org/stream/jstor-1450389/1450389\_djvu.txt “Full text of ‘Aaron of Lincoln.’ Understandably, when the borrowers couldn’t pay, during an economic downturn caused by the tax impositions of the king to pay for the crusade, the King’s Jews began to foreclose on their mort-gage loans and seize borrowers’ properties. Understandably, borrowers got extremely upset and angry. In response, while the king was away, the debtors then got 29 together, especially at York and burned the loan records which were held in the Minster and then tried to kill the Jewish bankers who were seizing people’s homes and properties. The Jews then sought refuge with their families atop Clifford’s Tower in the Royal Castle where they all committed suicide or were killed by the rioters. There were similar massacres in London and other places around England. New York City in the US today was named by immigrant Jewish bankers in memory of this event. On his return, Richard I was very angry, because what was owed to the Jews was indirectly owed to him, and ultimately to the Roman Catholic Pope. So from then on every mort-gage debt was registered in his name, which has continued on to the present day. In fact, in Commonwealth countries headed by the Crown such as New Zealand, even today, the Sovereign legally still owns the land, and those who purchase the Fee Simple of all Freehold land are purchasing the “possession rights” of it only. That is why banks can only register their interest in it on the Title, because the Sovereign still remains the legal beneficial owner of the land. After the persecutions of Jews in York and London in 1190, the “King’s Jews” still continued their role as extortionate bankers in England, to a large part led by Aaron of Lincoln (1125- 1186) who, by the time he died, had become the wealthiest man in Norman England. He was reputedly wealthier than even the King. There was an Exchequer of the Jews \[Latin: Scaccarium Judaeorum\] in the Court of Exchequer at Westminster which recorded and regulated the taxes and legal cases of the Jewish bankers in England after the Massacre of Jews at York until their eventual expulsion in 1290. In fact, after Aaron of Lincoln died in 1186, a special institution was established in the King’s Treasury called Aaron’s Exchequer. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchequer\_of\_the\_Jews Of course, in typical fashion of a Roman Catholic, Christian, Gentile, English king, upon Aaron’s death, King Henry II immediately seized all his vast property as the escheat of a Jewish usurer, and the English Crown became universal heir to his colossal estate and fortune. Gradually the barons/lords, knights and serfs’ simmering hate of the extortionate Jewish bankers (unfortunately all Jews were tarred with the same brush, and many were not extortionate bankers at all) fermented until the reign of King Edward I, in 1290, when under intense pressure from the people, the king issued a royal decree called the Edict of Expulsion expelling all Jews from the Kingdom of England. It remained in force for the rest of the Middle Ages and was finally overturned by the English Protestant Reformation started in the 1530s which laid the groundwork taken up by Oliver Cromwell in 1657 to allow the Jews to return to England. 30 From then on, as the British Empire expanded more and more, Jews, especially European merchants and bankers, migrated back to England, especially London in the 18 th and 19 th centuries - once again to take up their positions as the “King’s Jews” leading City of London bankers – now headed by Nathan Meyer Rothschild (founding his bank in London in 1811), following the Solomon family (who founded the Westminster Bank in 1689), Mocatta and Goldsmid Bank (founded in 1782 and still operating as bullion brokers), Samuel Montegue & Co. (1863), Hambro Bank (founded by Danish Jews), Oppenheimer, Goldsmith, Warburg, the list goes on and on. The Samuel banking family (Iraqi Jews) led by Marcus Samuel at first ran an import-export business called M. Samuel & Co. in London. His son, also named Marcus Samuel (1 st Viscount Bearsted 1853-1927) formed a case oil shipping company called Shell Transport & Trading Company which later took over and merged Dutch Royal family oil interests, funded by British N. M. Rothschild & Sons, to become Royal Dutch Shell today. The merchant banking arm, M. Samuel and Co., merged in 1965 with another City of London merchant bank, Philip Hill, Higginson, Erlangers Ltd, to create Hill Samuel Ltd, which is now part of Lloyds TSB. The Australian branch of Hill Samuel founded in 1969, based in Sydney, Hill Samuel Australia Limited, was later renamed Macquarie Bank. This branch alone, now known as Macquarie Group, is the biggest investment bank in Australia with assets over $450 billion and operates in more than 70 offices across 28 countries with a staff of 14,000. The Samuel banking family also founded the Wagg banking firms, today one of which is known as J. Henry Schroder founded in 1804. Today the bank is known as Schroders Plc., a giant multinational asset management company operating in 29 countries. Sir Herbert Samuel, a member of the same family, founded the British aristocracy’s propaganda media arm, the BBC. In 1534, because the Pope wouldn’t allow Henry VIII to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, the Act of Supremacy was passed declaring that the King was “the only Supreme Head on Earth of the Church of England” and the Treasons Act 1534 made it high treason, punishable by death to refuse the Oath of Supremacy acknowledging the king as such – began the end of the control and usurpation of the Roman Catholic Church’s and Pope’s domination of England, indeed the world of international banking. This City of London economic takeover of the Roman Catholic Church was gradually completed in the 19 th century when the Rothschild family provided a series of loans (some through the Torlonia banking family, Rothschild agents in Italy) commenced in 1832 by James and Carl Rothschild, to bail out the Holy See which then was broke, and this culminated in the Lateran Treaty of 1929 between fascist dictator Benito Mussolini and the Vatican, where funds were secretly provided through British N. M. Rothschild & Sons agents to have all the 31 Papal States confiscated for an amount at the time equal to about one or two hundred million US dollars today. After the deal, the money was reinvested back in Anglo/American banks. From that time on City of London Protestant/Jewish banks controlled the Vatican. After Henry VIII broke with the Pope, immediately taxes once payable to Rome were transferred to the Crown, soon much of the diocesan land in England that was previously owned by the Roman Catholic Pope was confiscated and vested in the Protestant Crown. Much of this wealth ended up in companies and banks in the City of London Corporation Lord Mayor’s Corporation Sole. Not long after this, in 1571, King Henry VIII’s daughter, Queen Elizabeth I, opened the Royal Exchange (now the London Stock Exchange) in the City of London. The Bank of England followed in 1694, and from this expanded the City of London Corporation’s control of the world’s corporate and banking network which exists today. ROTHSCHILD-WARBURG FAMILIES: CREATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE BANKING SYSTEM & BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS One of the most powerful Jewish banking families in the world allied to the House of Rothschild is the Warburg family, although most people don’t hear much about them today. The Warburg family is a powerful German, Anglo/American banking family originally of Venetian Jewish descent derived from part of the Venetian Jewish del Banco family, one of the wealthiest Venetian families in the early 16 th century. Following banking restrictions imposed on the Jewish community the family moved to Bologna in Italy and then on to Warburg, a small town in eastern North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, after which they took their name. The family moved to Altona near Hamburg in the late 17 th century and it was here that the brothers Moses Marcus Warburg (1763-1830) and Gerson Warburg (1765-1826) founded the M.M. Warburg & Co banking company in 1798. It is now a massive, private, global, banking dynasty with headquarters based in Hamburg. Moses Warburg’s great-great grandson, Siegmund George Warburg (1902-1982), co-founded the investment bank S. G. Warburg & Co in London in 1946 with Henry Grunfeld, a Jewish German steel industrialist. Warburg was knighted in 1966, and his large banking firm was acquired by UBS AG creating UBS Warburg, when later was simply changed to UBS AG. He also was simultaneously a secret major partner in the U.S. investment bank, Kuhn, Loeb and Company from 1953 until 1964 through a holding company to avoid the restrictions of the American Glass-Steagall Act. 32 FOUNDING OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKING SYSTEM (1913) AND BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS (1930) Paul M. Warburg (August 10, 1868 – January 24, 1932), was a grandson of Moses Marcus Warburg. His parents were Moritz and Charlotte Esther \[Oppenheim\] Warburg. He was born in Hamburg, Germany, and after graduating in 1886, he worked for Simon Hauer a Hamburg importer and exporter, then later he worked for Samuel Montague & Company, bankers in London in 1889-90. He returned to Hamburg in 1891 to work for the family firm, to become a partner in M.M. Warburg & Company in 1895, founded by his grandfather. On October 1, 1895 Paul Warburg married in New York City to Jewish Nina J. Loeb, daughter of Solomon Loeb who, with his partner Abraham Kuhn, founded the banking firm Kuhn, Loeb & Co in New York City in 1867, led by his brother-in-law, Jacob H. Schiff (1847-1920), born in Frankfurt am Main. Kuhn, Loeb & Co was one of the most influential investment banks in America during the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries. Kuhn, Loeb & Co. were agents of Rothschild and other banks in London. Jacob Schiff’s father, Moses Schiff, was a broker for the Rothschild banking firm in Frankfurt. Paul Warburg settled in New York in 1902, where he became a partner in Kuhn, Loeb & Co., (that specialized in big loans to governments) but still remained a partner in the family firm in Hamburg. Jacob Schiff was close personal friends with Sir Ernest Cassel, the influential Jewish British merchant banker financial advisor of King Edward VII. Schiff’s descendant Andrew Newman Schiff married former Vice-President Al Gore’s eldest daughter, Karenna. ROTHSCHILD, WARBURG, SCHIFF & JP MORGAN Paul Warburg was the driving force behind creating the US Federal Reserve Banking System. In 1910, Senator Nelson Aldrich invited Paul Warburg to lead a secret meeting with other influential bankers on Jekyll Island in Georgia where the draft of a bill to establish the Federal Reserve Bank (with its 12 regional reserve banks) was worked out. As the result, the Federal Reserve Act was passed by the U.S. Senate December 18, 1913. Soon after, Paul Warburg was appointed a member of the Federal Reserve Board on August 10, 1914 and he became Vice- Chairman on August 10, 1916, resigning from the Board on August 9, 1918. Warburg was also a director of the Council on Foreign Relations (1921-32), a trustee of the Brookings Institution after it merged with the Institute of Economics in 1927. At the time of his death he was Chairman of the Manhattan Company, a director of the Bank of Manhattan Trust Company, Farmers Loan and Trust Company of New York, and First National Bank of Boston. Special Note: The Manhattan Company (largely funded by Kuhn, Loeb & Co., Rothschild and London banks) was a New York bank and holding company established on September 1, 1799, 33 which later merged with Chase National Bank (4% owned by the Rockefeller family) in 1955 to form Chase Manhattan Bank, that was to be merged in 2000 with JP Morgan & Co., to become JP Morgan Chase & Co today. Currently, JP Morgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States and the world’s sixth largest bank by assets. It has about US$3 trillion in assets under management and US$23 to US$24 trillion in assets under custody. According to Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, the bank’s turnover per day is now around US$6 trillion!). Today it is a major shareholder in the big four Australian and New Zealand banks, indeed just about every major multinational corporation throughout the world as well. Most Americans, indeed most people, think JP Morgan today is American, when really it is largely British. It was funded by City of London banks headed by N.M. Rothschild & Sons through their agent, George Peabody, right from the very beginning. George Peabody (1795-1869) was a Massachusetts trader and banker that had offices in Baltimore and London and acted as a conduit for the Bank of England, Rothschild, Barings and other London merchant banks used to provide loans to the American states. In 1835 he founded Peabody & Company. In 1837 he moved to London, then in 1854 he brought in Junius Spencer Morgan (1813-1890) as a partner and renamed the firm Peabody, Morgan & Co, then after Peabody retired, because Peabody never married and left no children of his own, he left the bank to his partner and the firm’s name was changed again to J.S. Morgan & Co. After Morgan died, his son, John Pierpont Morgan (1837-1913) took over and renamed the firm JP Morgan & Co. The former London merchant bank Morgan Grenfell, now part of Deutsche Bank, joined JP Morgan in the London Round Table Group in 1891 to set up the creation of the US Council of Foreign Relations in 1918. JP Morgan & Co partnered with Henry S. Morgan (grandson of JP Morgan) and Harold Stanley and others to form Morgan Stanley in 1935. Today Morgan Stanley, headquartered in Midtown Manhattan, has offices in 42 countries, more than 55,000 employees and in (2016) total assets were US$814.95 billion. BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS (BIS) The Bank for International Settlements, founded on 17 May, 1930, located in Basel, Switzerland, is now the ‘central bank of central banks’ of the world, which now controls about 60 central banks around the globe. Ostensibly it is owned and controlled by the central banks that are members, with representatives of these on the Board of Directors, but that is a far cry from the reality that insiders actually run it who are representatives of the Bank of England 34 and US Federal Reserve, in turn controlled by a handful of the world’s financial elite and most powerful dynastic banking families. It is the Bank for International Settlements that largely controls both the Australian and New Zealand Reserve Banks, and the banks licenced by them. The Bank for International Settlements was largely created by just four men on 17 th May, 1930: Hjalmar Schacht (head of Reichsbank), Charles G Dawes (Chairman of City National Bank and US Ambassador to the UK 1929-1932), Owen D. Young (founder of RCA and Chairman of General Electric) and Montague Norman (Governor of the Bank of England). From the founding of the bank until at least 1939, Schacht worked closely with Jacob Schiff, the Warburg family and Montague Norman, in funnelling Wall Street and City of London money into Hitler’s rearmament program, as is painstakingly documented in Professor Anthony Sutton’s classic book on the subject, Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler. Owen D. Young (October 27 1874 – July 11 1962) was an American industrialist, creator and first chairman of Radio Corporation of America (RCA) who concurrently served on the Board of Trustees of the Rockefeller Foundation. Young headed a committee that created the Young Plan (1929-30) for settling German reparations debts after WWI written in August 1929 and formally adopted in 1930. The Young plan was financed by a consortium of American investment banks coordinated and led by JP Morgan & Co. The Committee members, which had been appointed by the Allied Reparations Committee, were Owen D. Young, J. P. Morgan Jr. and his banking partner Thomas W. Lamont. After discussions with UK Bank of England representatives, a Conference in The Hague adopted the plan in January 1930. As the result, with other banking provisions included, the plan to establish the Bank for International Settlements was finally implemented on 17 May, 1930 – largely funded by a consortium of banks led by JP Morgan & Co., Rothschild, Warburg and Rockefeller interests. It is these banking families that largely control the Bank for International Settlements, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the “big four” banks in the country that monopolize our New Zealand banking system. THE ASSOCIATION OF GLOBAL CUSTODIANS Linked to the Bank for International Settlements and regional reserve banks running each country is the enormously powerful Association of Global Custodians, established in 1996, 35 with dual headquarters based at 100 New Bridge Street, London, and 815 Connecticut Avenue, Washington D.C. which represents and runs the Central Securities Depository Companies around the world, which in turn act as custodians for global financial institutions and corporations holding tens of trillions of dollars in securities or shares so that ownership can be easily transferred through a book entry rather than the transfer of physical certificates. However, virtually all of these 12 banks which now own and run it, also hold secret security interests in companies and banks in each country by way of central securities depositories, who act as custodian proxies, so that the ultimate beneficial owner remains entirely unknown to the general public in each country. The Association of Global Custodians’ members are: BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon, Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., Citibank, N.A., Deutsche Bank, HSBC Securities Services, JP Morgan, Northern Trust, RBC Investor & Treasury Services, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Standard Chartered Bank, State Street Bank and Trust Company. The DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY (DTC) in New York is one of the biggest of these central securities depositories, and is owned by its participants, banks and brokerage houses. To keep its records even more secret, it designates CEDE AND COMPANY (a fictitious legal name and legal person, used by the Depository) on its behalf, to secretly buy up assets all round the world. The DTC has tens of trillions of dollars under secret custody, and technically owns virtually all of the publicly issued shares and stocks in the United States. It is a major shareholder, as nominee and custodian, in Australia and New Zealand’s “big four” banks as well. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cede\_and\_Company To illustrate the almost unbelievable power of the Depository Trust Company’s countless list of participant banks and financial institutions, which are largely kept secret from the general world public, one can access them by going directly to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) website here: https://www.sec.gov/interps/legal/cfslb14f.htm - which in turn provides confidential access of their listing here: http://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/client-center/DTC/alpha.ashx NEW ZEALAND CENTRAL SECURITIES DEPOSITARY LIMITED (NZCSD) In New Zealand’s case, the central securities depository is called New Zealand Central Securities Limited (NZCSD), which is a private company fully owned by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, currently with three specially chosen directors. When securities are purchased and settled through NZClear (a real-time settlement system) the NZCSD becomes the legal 36 owner of the securities on the relevant register, and in many cases, secretly holds those securities on behalf of the member, the true beneficial owner which may be a bank in London, New York or the North Pole! In New Zealand, (keep in mind this is only a tiny country of about 4.7 million people), in late 2014, the inventory of securities secretly held in the NZCSD alone was a staggering NZ$198 billion (US$132.6 billion). This amount was more than twice the value of the New Zealand stock market at NZ$94.1 billion and not far below the Gross Domestic Product of the entire country in 2014 at NZ$278.8 billion (US$188.385 billion) \[World Bank Statistics 18 September, 2015\]. Often just Cede & Co or NZCSD as owner will show up on company shareholder lists to hide the real name of the true beneficial owners. https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/markets-and-payments/nzclear Remember, this is on top of the other banking assets in the country held by the major banks in 2017 officially reported by the New Zealand Banking Association at NZ$508 billion, and does not include outside private foreign investment. ROTHSCHILD PRIVATISATION OF THE WORLD In the late 18 th century Mayer Amschel Rothschild rose to become one of Europe’s most powerful bankers based in Frankfurt am Main Germany. He had five sons which established banking branches throughout Europe, and the third son, Nathan Mayer Rothschild, the most brilliant, was sent to Manchester in England, and after he moved to London he founded the bank N. M. Rothschild & Sons in 1811. By the 19 th century the London branch was by far the biggest, and controlled the world price of gold for years up until 2004 in a small room at its London headquarters on St Swithin’s Lane, City of London. Combined with the other branches by the late-19 th century Rothschild banking interests controlled most of Europe and through their American agents, the United States Government Treasury and Federal Reserve. Today most of the enormous wealth held in the London branch has been transferred from it to various tax havens, either in the City of London itself, Rothschild Continuation Holdings in Switzerland, or held in other entities, subsidiaries and jurisdictions. But it is still a big and powerful bank in its own right. Today, it is called Rothschild Group, its chairman is Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, and the bank, among other things, serves the banking and financial interests of the British nobility and British Royal Family in much the same way Aaron of Lincoln did way back in the 13 th century. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N\_M\_Rothschild\_%26\_Sons 37 For a private person or banker to be able to buy up and own all the assets in the world, for this to be achieved, all the state assets owned by countries and governments (usually on behalf of the people) must be privatised first. As the result, N.M. Rothschild & Sons in London set up its International Privatisation Unit in the 1980s to oversee the privatisation of the world through either direct privatization, Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) or Private Finance Initiatives (PFI’s). This devious plan was set out in a book titled, Privatising the World: A Study of International Privatization in Theory and Practice written by Oliver Letwin with the Preface by John Redwood, both former heads of Rothschild’s Overseas Privatisation Unit. In fact, until December 2009, Oliver Letwin was a non-executive director of N. M. Rothschild Corporate Finance Ltd. Letwin’s Jewish father, William Letwin (14 December 1922 – 20 February 2013) was a well-known Marxist emeritus professor at the London School of Economics. Redwood is now Chief Global Strategist at Charles Stanley & Co Ltd. Letwin’s book, Privatising the World, is now the ‘bible’ of central banks and government treasuries around the world who are to privatise and sell off each nation’s ‘family silver’ via corporatizing state assets and government departments, then selling off national state assets to the highest bidder. Not only do these international banking elite want to rob people of their own homes through debt slavery, capital and wealth taxes – they want to seize all the nation’s state assets as well! https://www.amazon.co.uk/Privatizing-World-International-Privatization- Practice/dp/0304315273 Over the past few years in both Australia and New Zealand, Rothschild, UBS-Warburg, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and Macquarie Bank have been the predominant Mergers & Acquisition (M&A) banks taking over each country’s privatised national state assets. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public%E2%80%93private\_partnership https://www.opendemocracy.net/ournhs/joel-benjamin/seven-things-everyone-should- know-about-private-finance-initiative http://www.edmond-de-Rothschild.com/site/france/en/news/sustainable- development/5293-ariane-de-rothschild-global-landscapes-forum-speech In his State of the Union address, January 2015, Fox Rothschild advised that President Obama was proposing to expand the PPP program that encourages all state and local governments to fund infrastructure projects \[and privatize state assets\] through these same Public-Private- Partnerships (or P3s). https://governmentcontracts.foxrothschild.com/articles/public-private-partnerships-p3s/ 38 Before long, these multinational banks will, through privatisation and debt bondage, almost entirely own literally everything in the world. GLOBAL FORUM ON TRANSPARENCY AND EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION FOR TAX PURPOSES The Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes was founded by the OECD in 2000 and restructured in 2009, to address tax evasion, tax havens, offshore financial centres double taxation and money laundering. Since 2009, it has become the principal international body working towards the implementation of the international standards on tax transparency due for completion in 2018. It is being quite effective in addressing tax evasion and eliminating tax haven protection of smaller companies and low- hanging fruit, but when big international banks are involved (that we learned earlier these same banking interests founded and still control the OECD), these giant organisations today are never touched, or for that matter, are never properly audited. It is a huge challenge for governments and IRD staff. General Electric’s annual tax return in the U.S. in 2016 alone, was in the region of 25,000 pages. Many of the big multinational banks such as Rothschild are like this also, but even more complex again. Can you imagine the difficulty that the Inland Revenue Commissioner faces? http://www.oecd.org/tax/transparency/about-the-global-forum/ https://www.icij.org/investigations/offshore/secret-files-reveal-rothschilds-offshore- domain/ https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=27585934 http://vifreepress.com/2015/07/eurotrash-exposed-baron-rothschild-used-bvi-as-tax- dodge-for-billions/ Just so that there’s no doubt about how deep and complex Rothschild international banking interests are structured around foreign tax haven jurisdictions, here’s just one of hundreds, – FIVE CONTINENTS PARTNERS based in the Cayman Islands British tax haven: http://fivecontinentspartners.com/ William Messer, founded Five Continent Partners Limited with N.M. Rothschild & Sons in 1993, and for the past 24 years has headed the company which only deals with clients who have portfolio assets in excess of $2 billion. He is also a director of Rothschild Trust in the Cayman Islands. http://fivecontinentpartners.com/professionals/william-messer/ 39 These are just some of the leading banking characters that own the financial institutions that are the major shareholders in Australia and New Zealand’s big four banks, and behind the scenes control the BIS and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. BRITISH GLOBAL NETWORK OF INTERLOCKING COMPANY DIRECTORSHIPS: OBSCENE CEO & EXECUTIVE SALARIES To control this complex labyrinth of corporate greed and perfidy around the world run by this relative handful of enormously wealthy banking families, the Institute of Directors (UK) was founded in 1903, and incorporated by Royal Charter by King Edward VII in 1906 to control the world’s boards of directors of big companies. Currently it is located at 116 Pall Mall, London, and has about 34,500 full members. About 70% of all FTSE companies have at least one IoD member on their board or in a senior executive position. Each year the IoD has an annual convention in Royal Albert Hall, attended by the most powerful business leaders in the world. In turn, the Institute of Directors (UK) controls all other major 18 institutes of directors all around the world, through the Global Network of Director Institutes (GNDI) set up at a special meeting on December 12, 2012, in Wellington, New Zealand – which now coordinates the policies of over 100,000 leading multinational bank and company directors around the globe. This includes such institutes as the European Confederation of Directors Associations (ecoDa) 55,000 members, the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) in the United States 16,000 members, and of course the Institute of Directors in New Zealand (IoDNZ). The Global Network of Director Institutes (GNDI) has its Secretariat at the Institute of Directors (UK). http://gndi.weebly.com/ This is why CEO and company directors’ pay continues to rise at a rapid rate in unison across the board on a global basis when typically workers are paid less and less, especially relative to changes in consumer prices and inflation. By paying senior executives huge salary packages these executives end up behind the scenes dancing to the tune of the bankers that control the companies they lead, not their employees and most certainly not the general public. For example, in 2013, Wall Street, New York, executive bonuses versus the minimum wage in the US didn’t disappoint this trend. According to the New York State Comptroller’s Office, Wall Street firms handed out $26.7 billion in bonuses alone to their largely banking-related 165,200 senior executives, up 15% over the previous year. To put these bonuses in perspective. Just this $26.7 billion amount in bonuses alone in 2013 would have covered the full cost of more than doubling the pay-checks for all of the 1,085,000 Americans who work full-time based at the 2013 federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. 40 In the United States, for example, if Facebook is excluded from the Economic Policy Institute data due to its outlier high compensation numbers in the sample, average CEO pay in 2013 was $24.8 million, and the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio was 510.7 to 1 http://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-continues-to-rise Because virtually all major global public companies now have average 40% to 50% debt to equity or debt to asset ratios and the international banks are also major shareholders in these same companies themselves – they want key minions in positions of power who will do what they are told and keep their mouths shut about what really is going on. As the result, they pay the CEOs obscene levels of remuneration, often even when they are mediocre at best or plainly incompetent. INTERLOCKING AUSTRALIAN & NZ COMPANY DIRECTORSHIPS Over 15 years ago New Zealand Associate Professor Georgina Murray, now at Griffith University, Queensland, Australia, wrote a superb article on the subject of corporate directorships titled, Interlocking Directorates: Australian and New Zealand Comparisons. In her article, in the section titled, Table 2: Top shareholdings of the top 30 NZ companies 1999, she illustrated how on average, 37% of the top thirty companies (that list the top shareholders in their annual reports) were owned by a single nominee company, a custodial depository of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand called the New Zealand Central Securities Depository (NZCSD), a nominee holding company primarily for foreign banks. Thirty seven per cent is large when just 5% ownership of a company can give strategic corporate control. In Georgina Murray’s chart, ‘The 1998 Australian Interlock Data’ (p.8), just ten directors through cross-directorships or interlocks were controlling 16 of Australia’s biggest companies plus the NZ Dairy Board (now Fonterra). In her chart, ‘Figure 2: Interlocking Directorates 1998 (p.12), just ten directors through cross-directorships and interlocks were controlling 16 of New Zealand’s biggest companies. http://www.academia.edu/3107438/Interlocking\_Directores\_Australian\_and\_New\_Zealand \_Comparisons FONTERRA CO-OPERATIVE GROUP (NZ) In this respect, is New Zealand proportionally any different than Australia? To use just one NZ multinational company as an example, the NZ co-op Fonterra, the biggest dairy exporting company in the world. 41 The CEO of Fonterra Co-operative Group Limited, Theo Spierings, joined the company in September 2011. Between 2011 and 2017 Fonterra’s revenue fell by 3.2 per cent while pay- outs to NZ farmer/shareholders declined by 7.5 per cent. Yet the total remuneration paid to CEO Theo Spierings over this period including his $8.3 million paid in the 2017 year, was $28.6 million. All this while Fonterra’s Annual Report 2017 showed that the company now had a TOTAL EQUITY of $7.2 billion, it had GEARING at 44.3% (now in April 2018 estimated at 55%), NET DEBT at $5.601 billion (now in April 2018 estimated at around $6 billion) with the MARKET CAPITALIZATION of the Fonterra non-voting rights share/units in the Fonterra Shareholders Fund at $803 million most of which is owned by foreign banks, pension funds and financial institutions – meaning that the international financial institutions now hold about $6.8 billion of the company’s $7.2 billion total equity. In other words, the company now is virtually insolvent. Having been led by a CEO who was paid $28.6 million dollars for the privilege of largely running it into the red for the bankers who have now, for all intents and purposes, quite flagrantly effectively disenfranchised it from the 10,600 NZ farmer supplier shareholders who still think they own it, but in reality, because of the company’s massive debt, really don’t. In the opinion of this author, if things don’t positively change for this huge company, probably the next step will be for the banks to put the company into statutory management or receivership, and then hock it off to the Chinese, Kraft or Nestle, of course, companies owned and controlled by these same bankers’ parents. Brian Gaynor, in The New Zealand Herald, March 31, 2018, page C4, wrote an excellent article titled, Does big pay bring big results: Fonterra lacklustre under $35m CEO, but neglected to mention the seriousness of the company’s excessive growing debt to the bankers. However, the Banking industry salaries by far exceed all other sectors, dominated by London and New York, and their regional banks in various countries. In fact, not only do they have the highest salaries, the City of London has more than three times as many high-earning bankers as the rest of the EU combined. In Australia, in 2016, in spite of pending government legislation to control their remuneration, the CEOs of the ‘big four’ Australian and New Zealand banks were paid: Commonwealth Bank Australia Ian Narev $12.3 million, National Australia Bank Andrew Thorburn $6.7 million, ANZ Bank Shayne Eliot $5.07 million, Westpac Bank Brian Hartzer $6.7 million. Macquarie Bank, (we remember, controlled by the Samuel banking family in London 42 that also founded Royal Dutch Shell with the Rothschild family) CEO Nicholas Moore was paid $25.7 million and Peter and Steven Lowy of Westfield Corporation (funded by City bankers) combined were paid $26.2 million. In New Zealand, even way back in 2010, three of the ‘big four’ Australian owned banks dominating 90% of the market share saw their combined pay rise to $11.97 million, while all of their customers were facing rising interest rates. NZ CEO Ralph Norris head of Commonwealth Bank in Australia in 2010 was paid $16.1 million, up from $9.2 million the previous year. INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL BANKERS Founded in 1966, now headquartered at 299 Park Avenue, New York, the Institute of International Bankers, with its sister organisation in London, the British Bankers Association (that itself represents over 200 member banks in 50 countries with operations in 180 jurisdictions), represents through its members virtually every international headquartered financial institution and banking association in the world. Through its members’ influence, and also through its national affiliate banks and banking associations, it advocates on behalf of international banks on pending legislation, regulatory and tax issues, mainly in the United States, but also around the world. While it is mainly supposed to represent American banks, most of the members on its Board of Trustees are in fact foreign banking representatives. ANZ Banking Group, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank, Rabobank International, Standard Chartered Bank, HSBC Bank, and China Construction Bank, to mention only a few, are members. http://www.iib.org/?page=IIBHistory http://www.iib.org/page/MembersoftheIIB As may be seen on its member list, many of the big banks which operate in New Zealand are members of the Institute of International Bankers in New York. In turn, they are members also of the New Zealand Bankers Association. NEW ZEALAND BANKERS ASSOCIATION The New Zealand Bankers Association was established in 1891 and is headquartered in Wellington. It represents the interests of most of the big banks in New Zealand, on behalf, of course, of the foreign international big banks that own and run them linked to either the British Bankers Association or the Institute of International Bankers. 43 Kirk Hope, a member of the current Government Tax Working Group, currently Chief Executive of BusinessNZ (that effectively replaced the NZ Business Roundtable Group), was previously CEO of the New Zealand Bankers Association. He has previously held a number of senior executive positions at Westpac Bank, including Head of Government Relations and Regulatory Affairs. So with respect, may we hesitate to ask, just who is Mr Hope really representing on the Tax Working Group? INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS – NEW ZEALAND SUPERANNUATION FUND The International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF) is a non-profit international group of sovereign wealth fund managers which was established in 2009, headquartered in St. Clements House in London. This organisation represents about 23 leading state-owned international investors from around the world including many of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds. Its members collectively have about $5.5 to $6 trillion currently under management, representing about 80 per cent of all assets managed by sovereign funds throughout the world. The New Zealand Superannuation Fund, colloquially known as the “Cullen Fund,” created by the New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Act 2001 is a sovereign wealth fund and currently is worth about $15 billion. Like all these funds, it invests its surplus capital mainly in stocks, and it is a member of the IFSWF. A lot of these ‘pension fund’ sovereign wealth fund managers invest some of their funds through other fixed income asset managers such as The Vanguard Group, BlackRock or Fidelity, so often it is difficult for the average person to know who it is that actually owns the shares of a particular company, bank or pension fund. However, if the current highly inflated world stock markets were to decline substantially, this would have a huge detrimental effect on the value of these large wealth or pension funds. Over and above all of these banking agencies and institutions, including the US Federal Reserve, IMF, World Bank, Bank for International Settlements, European Bank for Reconstruction & Development, Asian Development Bank, and so on – is the City of London Corporation and The Worshipful Company of International Bankers. CITY OF LONDON CORPORATION The City of London Corporation, or sometimes called the ‘Square Mile,’ located inside the old Roman walls of London is a private, independent corporation not responsible to the British 44 Parliament. It directly or indirectly controls almost every major multinational bank and corporation in the world today. Prior to King Henry VIII, it was an exclusively Roman Catholic corporation headed by the Lord Mayor under Oath of Allegiance to the English King under fealty to the Pope. After Henry broke with the Papacy and set himself up to become the Supreme Head of the Protestant Church of England in 1531 and later confirmed it with the Act of Supremacy of 1534. Henry’s daughter, Queen Mary I, a staunch Catholic, attempted to restore the English church’s allegiance to the Pope and repealed the Act of Supremacy in 1555. Her half-sister, Protestant Elizabeth I, took the throne in 1558, and in the following year Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy of 1559. This restored the original act, with the exception, because many Protestant Christians charged the Sovereign was claiming divinity or was usurping Christ as Head of the Church by claiming the title ‘Supreme Head,’ pressured the monarch to change the title to ‘Supreme Governor’ as it remains today. During her Coronation ceremony of 2 June 1953, The Queen took an Oath administered by the Archbishop of Canterbury to “maintain the Laws of God and the true profession of the Gospel.” She also completed this Oath at the Altar, with her right hand on the Bible, kneeling on the steps, saying, “The things which I have here before promised, I will perform and keep. So help me God.” She then kissed the Bible and signed the Oath. In every respect, the Queen was anointed into her office by the Protestant Church of England. Legally, the enormous wealth of the City of London Corporation’s Twelve Great Companies and their many subsidiaries are held in the CORPORATION SOLE of the Lord Mayor of the City of London, who is elected each year for a 12 month term. After his election, he takes an Oath of Allegiance to the Sovereign to carry out his/her wishes, under a gentleman’s agreement, in his/her role as Governor of the Church of England, and because of this he is blessed at a special Service of Blessing at St Paul’s Cathedral by the Bishop of London. It is sometimes erroneously claimed that the Sovereign has to ask the Lord Mayor for permission to enter the City of London, but this is not so, as the Lord Mayor is in subjection to the monarch through his Oath of Allegiance. It is very esoteric and difficult to understand for the average person, and largely beyond the brief of this submission, but the fact is, the ultimate beneficial head of this enormous wealth of the world’s multinational banks and corporations, at the very highest level, currently is the Governor of the Protestant Church of England. 45 This is why the hypocritical Arms of the City of London Corporation include a shield on which is the Cross of St. George and Sword of St. Paul underneath which is the Latin motto, Domine dirige nos ‘O Lord Guide us.’ Really. One cannot imagine a greater level of hypocrisy than this. Didn’t our Lord advise his disciples and the rich young man? “...Go and sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven...” (Matthew 19:21 KJV). https://www.cityofLondon.gov.uk/about-the-city/Pages/default.aspx https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLGzreJguBI WORSHIPFUL COMPANY OF INTERNATIONAL BANKERS While British banks and their American proxies have largely expanded their enormous banking interests over the globe since the establishment of the Bank of England in 1694, founded by a Scottish banker, William Paterson – it never really was fully considered that the City of London Corporation completely controlled every major bank in the world until the Guild of International Bankers was founded in July 2001, was constituted a full Livery Company (106 th ) on 21 September 2004, and it finally received its Royal Charter from Queen Elizabeth II granted on 10 th December, 2007. This is by far the most powerful banking organisation in the world. Its Company Crest is a Bermuda Sloop, taken from the Overseas Bankers Club. The ship sits on 5 gold bezants (gold coins that were first minted in Byzantium and England for use by merchants) representing, like the five golden arrows of the House of Rothschild Crest, the company’s control of the banking industry in the five continents of the world. Americans might find it hard to believe that the American giant investment advisor and mutual funds investor, The Vanguard Group, headquartered in Malvern, Pennsylvania, founded on May 1, 1975, also has this same sloop as its company logo. Vanguard Group, now with over $5 trillion in assets under management, is the largest provider of mutual funds and second largest provider of exchange-traded funds in the world after BlackRock’s iShares. Go and have a look at the twenty major shareholders of any major bank, corporation or company in the world, and in all likelihood, The Vanguard Group interests will be at least one of them. Today, either directly or indirectly, every major bank in the world is controlled by the Worshipful Company of International Bankers in the City of London Corporation, very similar 46 to the bankers in the days of Christ’s ministry in Jerusalem, or Aaron of Lincoln in England in the 13 th century, but now mysteriously resurrected to operate on a global scale. http://internationalbankers.org.uk/ WHY DO ONLY JEWISH & PROTESTANT FAMILIES CONTROL GLOBAL BANKING NOW? Most of the leading bankers in the world today are Jews, or those that the author refers to as ‘apostate Protestants.’ Lest the author be labelled an ‘anti-Semite’ or ‘anti-Protestant- Christian’ of some sort (when he most definitely is not, as he is a Christian himself who has many cherished Jewish friends), while aiming to document the hard facts of the matter entirely free of hearsay, it is important to briefly explain why and how the current monopolization of global banking has occurred with these particular two uniquely religious groups as leaders – and as such, how they specifically control the New Zealand and global economy today. The Roman Catholic Church gradually grew out of ancient secular Rome from the expansion of early Christian influence in the empire, when the positions of arch-bishop of the Roman church and emperor of the state were gradually merged. It started with the British Roman Emperor Constantine in 312 AD when he claimed his miraculous conversion to Christianity, and in 325 convened the council of Nicea. It was accelerated under Emperor Theodosius I in 380-381 when he made church membership compulsory (contrary to the teaching of the New Testament) with the Edict of Thessalonica declaring Christianity to be the only universal (Catholic) religion of Rome. It was firmly entrenched by the time of Emperor Gratian (359- 383) when in 376 he refused the title of Pontifex Maximus, when from this date it was bestowed on the Bishop of Rome. From then on the Roman Catholic Church arose to rule much of Europe and the world. It controlled religious life, politics and banking for over a thousand years up to the time of the English Protestant Reformation started in the 1530s – which culminated in the termination of the Pope’s powers during the reign of King Henry VIII (reign: 21 April 1509 – 28 January 1547) when Henry broke with Rome in 1534 and set himself up as head of the Protestant Church of England, in the process, seizing all of the Roman Catholic Church’s vast assets. In Roman Catholic England, William the Conqueror first brought the Jewish bankers from the Continent to England in 1070 not because he particularly liked the Jews, but because he acknowledged they had proven, above all others, to be natural masters of banking. Unfortunately for the Jews, they were more often than not persecuted by Catholics throughout Europe, and because of their oppressive banking practices were hated even more and they were only looked upon as a necessary evil by the Catholic king – and hence, were tolerated as such as a necessary evil in England until their final expulsion in 1290. 47 After Henry VIII’s Treasons Act 1534 which made it high treason, punishable by death to refuse the Oath of Supremacy to the King and not the Pope, combined with the growth of the Protestant Reformation, British colonization and trade, strong anti-Catholicism developed throughout the United Kingdom, while at the same time Protestantism was much more permissive of the Jewish people, beginning with Oliver Cromwell in 1657 in allowing the Jews to begin to return to England. From then on European Jews began to migrate back to England, especially during the 18 th and 19 th centuries, to once again take up their favoured positions in commerce, colloquially known as the “King’s Jews” and leading City of London bankers. Most of the big banks in London were established during this 500 year revolutionary period of severe anti-Catholicism, during which Catholics were consistently forbidden to hold positions of power, including in banking. Today this explains why most of the really powerful big banks in London and New York are almost entirely of Jewish origin, or are Protestant, or a mixture of Jewish/Protestant firms, but none or very few are Catholic. Hence, to provide a few examples of some of the big Protestant banks today: Lloyds Banking Group (75,000 employees 2017) today was founded in 1765 by John Taylor, a button maker, and iron producer and dealer Sampson Lloyd (a Quaker). Barclays Plc Bank today (119,300 employees 2018) was founded in 1690 by John Freame (a Quaker) and Thomas Gould. Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC Holdings plc), now the world’s 7 th largest bank by assets (228,687 employees 2017) was founded in 1865 (to launder opium drug proceeds) by Sir Thomas Sutherland, a Scotsman. Standard Chartered Bank (another big opium drug proceeds laundering bank) was created in 1969 by the merger of two banks, the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China founded in 1853 by another Scotsman and Quaker James Wilson, and the Standard Bank of British South Africa in 1862 by Scotsman and Quaker John Paterson. In the United States, John D. Rockefeller, long considered the wealthiest American of all time and one of the richest people in modern history was a devout Northern Baptist. So all the “King’s bankers” are not exclusively Jewish, as many today may claim, but rarely will they not be Jewish or Protestant, and rarely Roman Catholic. This does not infer all Jews and Protestants are tarred with the same brush and are extortionate bankers. But it does show that since these bankers are not complying with the clear financial and banking laws plainly advocated in the Bible or Torah, they are indeed, in the true sense of the term – Jewish and Protestant apostates. 48 COALITION FOR INCLUSIVE CAPITALISM: ROTHSCHILD & ADRIAN ORR GOVERNOR OF THE RESERVE BANK OF NEW ZEALAND The Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism is one of the most powerful Rothschild-led global financial organisations in the world today representing all the big banks, asset managers and multinational corporations. It was co-founded by the Henry Jackson Society and Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild (wife of Sir Evelyn de Rothschild) at the Conference on Inclusive Capitalism held on 27 May, 2014, at The Mansion House and Guildhall, City of London Corporation, London, UK. The inaugural Conference on Inclusive Capitalism was opened by its effective patron, HRH The Prince of Wales, and Christine Lagarde, Managing Director, the IMF. Delegates at the Conference included many current and former political leaders, and most of the world’s major banking and business leaders from 27 countries and represented over $50 trillion of investable assets across 25 business sectors, making up over one third of the world’s financial assets under management. The aim of the Coalition ostensibly is to develop a whole new global movement made up of multinational corporate business leaders, academics, government and civic leaders, NGOs, IGOs, global spiritual leaders including such people as the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Pope – to get them all to collaborate together on global solutions to “develop a more socially responsible form of capitalism that ‘inclusively’ benefits everyone,” not just themselves. Of course, this is utter nonsense, and is nothing less than a deliberate smokescreen to hide their confiscation and monopolization of the assets and wealth of the world, cloaked in apostate ‘Judeo-Christian’ ethics, philanthropy and charity. In reality, as they increasingly takeover and monopolize the wealth of the world in their highly privileged positions as an enormously wealthy minority – they are getting more and more concerned that they may soon face a global uprising and revolt from the vast majority of ordinary citizens that they are increasingly pauperizing by their parasitic economic policies. In fact, Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild, who co-hosted the May 2014 Conference told the NY Observer why she was so concerned: “I think that a lot of kids have neither money nor hope, and that’s really bad. Because then they’re going to get mad at America. What our hope for this initiative is that through all the efforts of all of the decent CEOs, all of the decent kids without a job feel optimistic.” 49 A book could be written about how Sir Evelyn and Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild control and influence the Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism. Sir Evelyn retired from his position as head of N. M. Rothschild & Sons in London in 2003 when it was merged with Paris Orleans to be renamed Rothschild & Co, a subsidiary of Rothschild Continuation Holdings registered in Zurich, Switzerland. Although Sir Evelyn is in his late seventies now and has retired from many of his responsibilities in the Rothschild family banking empire, he still has immense global power, either directly himself or through his American wife. If the reader goes directly to Sir Evelyn and Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild’s private investment company website here: https://www.elrothschild.com/ on their Homepage you can click on “Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism” in red which will take you to the Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism’s own website here: https://www.inc-cap.com/ which is extensive. Here, it will be seen, is a list of photos of Members of the Coalition’s Working Group of institutional investors, asset managers, business leaders, academics, policy makers and labour representatives to help the Coalition to craft pathways and concrete steps that can be adopted by leaders throughout the investment and business community to make global capitalism more “inclusive.” This Working Group provides advice to the Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism on a voluntary basis. Shockingly, it includes a photo of Adrian Orr, the newly appointed Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand: https://www.inc-cap.com/leadership/ Here is what the Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism has to say about Mr ADRIAN ORR: • “ADRIAN ORR: Chief Executive Officer, New Zealand Superannuation Fund As Chief Executive Officer at New Zealand Superannuation Fund, Adrian Orr is responsible for general management of the Guardians of New Zealand Superannuation and of the Fund under delegation from the Board. Mr Orr joined the Guardians in February 2007 from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand where he was Deputy Governor. He also held the positions of Chief Economist at Westpac Banking Corporation, Chief Manager of the Economics Department of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and Chief Economist at the National Bank of New Zealand. He has also worked for the New Zealand Treasury and the OECD based in Paris. Mr Orr is Chairman of International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds, a Board Member of the Pacific Pensions Institute, the Komiti Pasifika Advisory Committee of Victoria University, Wellington and the Emory Center for Alternative Investments at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.” https://www.inc-cap.com/bio/adrian-orr/ 50 All this means, not only is Adrian Orr largely influenced by the Rothschild banking family, pushing ‘inclusive banking’ for those who founded and still control the Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism. Orr has previously been Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, has been the Chief Economist of both Westpac Banking Corporation and the National Bank of New Zealand formerly owned by Lloyds TSB in London which was sold to the ANZ Bank in 2003, now a subsidiary of the ANZ Banking Group in Australia – in turn owned by foreign banking interests who are certainly not largely domiciled in either Australia or New Zealand at all. So may we hesitate to ask, with due respect, with credentials like this, as a member of the Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism headed by Sir Evelyn and Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild – is Mr Orr, the new Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, really working in the best interests of all New Zealanders as the Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand? – or, his foreign banking associates? What makes Adrian Orr’s recent controversial appointment to the position of Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand most particularly galling, at least in the opinion of this author, is the fact that the Reserve Bank is supposed to be entirely independent, not controlled or influenced by foreign or outside interests, and it is supposedly meant to be working for the best interests of all New Zealanders, when plainly it appears it is not. This whole highly questionable situation is part of an ingrained culture that is gradually allowing foreign banking interests to monopolize and confiscate the wealth of our country. It has quietly been going on for many years but is now reaching a critical level where something must be done about it. It is a national disgrace and it is time it was abruptly stopped. One does not need a great deal of imagination to see that these parasitic foreign-controlled banks and their representatives would be the last people to believe about anything let alone advocating economic policies that will work toward the long-term best interests of ordinary New Zealand citizens. This especially applies to the bankers’ comments on the pros and cons of any Land or Capital Gain Tax, or general reforms to the tax system that the NZ Parliament wants to work towards making things “fairer” for everybody creating genuinely good economic policies that positively affect all New Zealanders. 51 ROTHCHILD CONTROL OF THE RESERVE BANK OF NEW ZEALAND: GOVERNOR ADRIAN ORR Indeed, a number of patriotic New Zealanders are increasingly becoming extremely concerned about this highly suspicious Rothschild foreign banking influence and control over our Reserve Bank and our general economy. On May 12, 2017, an Official Information request to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand was made by Mr Paul Millar. It read: • “Dear Reserve Bank of New Zealand, I would like a categorical response to the question – “What influence does the Rothschild family exert over the reserve bank of New Zealand? Yours faithfully, Paul Millar” In response to Mr Paul Millar’s Official Information request, Mr Angus Barclay, External Communications Advisor, Reserve Bank of New Zealand, on May 15, 2017, replied: • “Hello Mr Millar, The Rothschild family has no influence over the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.” https://fyi.org.nz/request/5866-rothschild-involvement https://fyi.org.nz/request/5866-rothschild-involvement?unfold=1 https://fyi.org.nz/body/rbnz Of course, this concise reply from Mr Angus Barclay is remarkable, and is, under the circumstances, blatantly misleading. Even if one goes back to the early colonization of New Zealand and the New Zealand Government’s early financing, right from the very beginning, it was arranged through Sir Julius Vogel, New Zealand’s 8 th premier and first Jewish prime minister of New Zealand – with N. M. Rothschild & Sons in the City of London. Vogel is best remembered for his great public works schemes of the 1870s, for which, as colonial treasurer, he borrowed the massive sums at the time of around 10 million pounds to fund the construction of the roads and railways – from the Bank of England and N. M. Rothschild & Sons in the City of London. Here are copies of some of the actual Loan correspondence: https://atojs.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/atojs?a=d&d=AJHR1875-I.2.1.3.7 52 ADRIAN ORR’S APPOINTMENT AS GOVERNOR OF THE RESERVE BANK OF NEW ZEALAND On 11 December 2017, the New Zealand Minister of Finance Grant Robertson announced that Adrian Orr had been appointed Reserve Bank Governor effective from 27 March, 2018. During his announcement, Grant Robertson said; • “Following the Reserve Bank Board’s unanimous recommendation to me, I have appointed Adrian Orr for a five-year term at the completion of Acting Governor Grant Spencer’s Term. I’m delighted the Board has been able to secure a Governor with such a strong track record of delivery and public service. Mr Orr has the technical and leadership qualities required to be Governor and CEO of the Reserve Bank. Further, I consider that he has the skills necessary to successfully lead the Bank through a period of change ...” https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/news/2017/12/adrian-orr-appointed-as-new-reserve- bank-governor-from-27-march-2018 So what, precisely, are Adrian Orr’s claimed “public service, technical and leadership qualities” to which Finance Minister Grant Robertson and the Reserve Bank Board broadly refer? Well. Presumably they are referring to his qualifications as listed by the Rothschild’s COALITION FOR INCLUSIVE CAPITALISM website referred to above, as a former Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, Chief Economist of both the ANZ and Westpac Banks, not to mention his allegiance to Sir Evelyn and Lady Lyn Forester de Rothschild’s international Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism group. So is Mr Orr, with these other foreign banking alliances like this ever likely to be working for the “best interests” of all ordinary New Zealanders? Is this state of affairs acceptable for most New Zealand citizens? Is the Reserve Bank of New Zealand truly working for the best interests of all New Zealand citizens? – or is it primarily acting for foreign banking interests? These are vital questions that must be brought out into the light of day and resolved, because obviously they will influence major decisions of key economic policies that, in the end of the day, will determine what is truly fair, equitable or not for all New Zealanders in the future. 53 5) HOW FOREIGN BANKS RORT NEW ZEALANDERS & ARE SUCKING THE ECONOMIC LIFEBLOOD OUT OF THE COUNTRY Perhaps New Zealand’s foreign banking monopolization of the country in recent times was best summarized by Brian Gaynor, executive director of Milford Asset Management, in The New Zealand Herald, February 10, 2018, p. C4, in a succinct article titled, ‘China’s banks building their NZ presence.” In part of his excellent summary of the New Zealand banking sector he perceptively wrote: “China Construction Bank is the third Chinese bank to incorporate in New Zealand and be registered as a bank by the Reserve Bank. The three Chinese banks have a relatively small presence in this country but they have a massive opportunity to expand because Industrial & Commercial Bank of China is the world’s largest bank, China Construction Bank is the third largest and Bank of China is the fifth largest global bank. The three banks are huge, with average assets of US$3,380 billion compared with New Zealand’s total banking assets of just US$370 billion. The Chinese banks seem to have adopted a politically oriented strategy in New Zealand, as former Prime Minister Dame Jenny Shipley is the chair of China Construction Bank (New Zealand), former National Party and Act Party leader Dr Don Brash is chair of Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (New Zealand) and former Napier National Party MP Chris Tremain is chair of Bank of China (New Zealand). Ruth Richardson, a former Finance Minister, is also on the Bank of China (New Zealand) board. This is a strange strategy as most NZ politicians haven’t made a hugely successful transition from parliament to the board table... Foreign owned banks completely dominate the New Zealand financial sector, as illustrated in the accompanying table. Twenty of the country’s 25 banks are overseas owned, with 10 incorporated locally while the other 10 are branch offices. The four large Australian owned banks account for 86.3 per cent of total bank assets and the 20 foreign owned banks have accumulated 92.5 per cent of the country’s bank assets. The 20 overseas owned banks dominate the New Zealand business sector in several ways, including: • They generated total net earnings after tax in the past financial year of more than $5.0b compared with net earnings of just $3.5b for the 20 largest listed NZX companies. 54 • The four major Australian owned banks reported net earnings of $4.7b last year while the four largest NZX companies had net earnings of just $0.7b. • ANZ, ASB, BNZ and Westpac paid nearly $3.5b in dividends to their Australian parents last year. In addition, the banking sector has increased its share of Kiwisaver from 58.6 per cent at the end of 2013 to 66.9 per cent at the end of 2017. Banks also face less competition following the collapse of the finance company sector. A 2017 IMF Working Paper, Bank Ownership: Trends and Implications, shows that New Zealand is near to unique in terms of bank ownership. The study looked at 90 countries – 26 developed countries and 64 developing. The IMF assessed New Zealand as having 95 per cent of its banking assets under foreign ownership. Only four countries had more offshore ownership. These were Fiji, Estonia, Belize and Madagascar. More importantly, the other 25 developed countries had average offshore bank asset ownership of 34 per cent compared with New Zealand’s 95 per cent. The IMF paper concluded that “the evidence indicates that foreign-owned banks tend to be more effective in developing countries, typically promoting competition in a host country banking sector”. However, the situation in developed countries can be different as foreign bank ownership may have a negative impact on credit levels if “foreign banks were brought in to recapitalize failing banking sectors”. The acquisition of the Bank of New Zealand by National Australia Bank is an example of this. Bank concentration is an issue in New Zealand, with the four major Australian owned banks accounting for 86.3 per cent of total assets. This makes it extremely difficult for small NZ banks to compete against the Australian giants or for new foreign-owned banks to make significant headway. In this light, the appointments of former politicians Shipley, Brash, Tremain and Richardson to the Chinese banks’ boards is fascinating. Does this signal that the Chinese banks have long-term strategy to acquire the NZ operations of an Australian bank and, to get approval, they want to develop closer ties with key political figures? ...” REVOLVING DOOR POLICIES OF CIVIC LEADERS & POLITICIANS In relation to Brian Gaynor’s article, in both New Zealand and Australia now there is a growing trend for former politicians and civic leaders, upon leaving office to join a big business 55 ‘revolving door’ policy to be hired as lobbyists by multinational corporations or given plum jobs with banks or corporations they have previously behind the scenes often been working with, not normally always in the best interests of their country and fellow-citizens. In Australia, just a few of the many endless examples of this ‘revolving door policy’ are: Andrew Robb, former Trade Minister upon retiring from politics took up a job with the New York investment bank Moelis & Company. Lindsay Tanner, former Finance Minister, joined Lazard Bank. John Fahey former Finance Minister 1996-2001 quit to become a consultant for JP Morgan. Bob Carr NSW Premier quit in 2005 to be given a plum job at Macquarie Bank. Kim Beazley, Defence Minister 1984-1990 upon leaving was made a director of the Lockheed Martin Australia Board. This is increasingly becoming standard practice. Perhaps, since the New Zealand Government, Treasury and Reserve Bank officials, who ostensibly are so keen in following other OECD recommendations, logic and supposed “fairness” in other areas such as advocating repressive Capital Gains Tax or Land Tax on other NZ citizens, but don’t when it applies to themselves in managing major conflicts of interest in public service, should reconsider regulating and implementing the very clear OECD Trust in Government – Integrity and Fairness guidelines and recommendations here: http://www.oecd.org/gov/trust-integrity-and-fairness.htm ANZ, BNZ, WESTPAC & ASB’S EXORBITANT PROFITS PUT IN PERSPECTIVE Of the 26 banks registered with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand as at 29 March, 2018, the ‘big four’ foreign-owned Australian banks in New Zealand – ANZ, BNZ (owned by National Australia Bank), WESTPAC, and ASB (owned by Commonwealth Bank) comprised 87% of all bank lending. The five New Zealand-owned banks accounted for 8% of NZ bank lending, so in reality the big four Australian banks (which are not even Australian-owned) dominate nearly 90% of the New Zealand banking system. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has rated these big four Australian banks operating in Australia, and most particularly New Zealand, as the most profitable banks in the developed world, which means these banks are outrageously fleecing their customers at a massive level. To appreciate just how devious these big four foreign-owned banks are, it is worthwhile to look at an example such as Westpac. A good summary, written a few years ago about how Westpac (Australia) is secretly foreign-owned and controlled is here: http://www.gwb.com.au/gwb/news/banking/wpac97.html Here is a later article published on May 19, 2014, titled ‘WHO REALLY OWNS THE BIG FOUR BANKS? Here: https://blog.creditcardcompare.com.au/big-four-ownership.php 56 On May 14, 2017, Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison, said the big five Australian banks (includes Macquarie Bank as well) had a return on equity of around 15% about twice as high as banks in other parts of the world. In New Zealand, according to the New Zealand Bankers Association, the 2017 average return on equity was exactly 14.43%. In the 2016-2017 financial year, just these ‘big four’ Australian banks alone made NZ$5.19 billion net profit after tax, most of which was repatriated out of New Zealand to their Australian parents, then remitted to these banks’ secret foreign shareholders in New York and London. To put these exorbitant profits into perspective, KiwiRail provides a good example. According to KiwiRail’s Annual Return 2017, the total Assets of the KiwiRail as at 30 June 2017 were $1.114.2 billion. This includes 4,000 kilometres of railway track throughout the whole country, 1656 bridges, 18,000 hectares of land managed, 198 mainline locomotives, 4,585 freight wagons, 2 owned and one leased Inter-islander Cook Strait ferries – a national rail system that has taken over 150 years to build throughout the country. In round figures, just one year’s tax paid profits of these ‘big four’ foreign-owned predatory banks, was almost five times more than the current value of New Zealand’s entire railway system! To make matters worse, these banking parasites are not even re-investing the majority of their enormous profits back into New Zealand, but are transferring them overseas. Westpac and ASB, for example, try to appease their consciences and improve their images by deceiving the simple-minded to believe that they are charitable, by giving ‘peanuts’ to local charities here and there, but the truth is they ripping-off the New Zealand public at an enormous rate. Westpac has been sponsoring rescue helicopter appeals for 35 years. Yet in the 12-month period to 30 September 2017, Westpac’s profit before tax was NZ$1.369 billion compared to the year before at $1.229 billion, a 10.7 increase for the 2017 year after paying relative ‘peanuts’ for charitable sponsorship. ASB (owned by Commonwealth Bank of Australia) was no different. In the 12-month year to June 30, 2017, ASB made an all-time record net profit AFTER TAX of NZ$1.069 billion, an increase of 17 per cent on the year before. 57 Again, to deceive the simple-minded by giving sponsorship ‘peanuts’ to charities like St Johns, ASB First Aid on Farms, ASB Classical Sparks, The Star City Surf and Bankers on Bikes – this bank has been steadily ripping-off the New Zealand public for years. To illustrate the rate of increase one only has to look at ASB’s last few years net after tax profits: 2017 - $1.069 billion, 2016 - $913 million, 2015 - $859 million, 2014 - $806 million, 2013 - $705 million, 2012 - $685 million, 2011 - $568 million, 2010 - $236 million and 2009 - $425 million. https://www.interest.co.nz/business/89200/asb-june-year-profit-rises-13- nz1033-billion At this enormous rate of increase, the obscene net after tax profits of NZ$5.19 billion for 2017 of our ‘big four’ banking pirates in just five or six years will be in the region of NZ$15 billion per year. This is simply a national disgrace for all New Zealanders and surely must be stopped. And yet these ‘big four’ professional banking parasites have the temerity and cheek to recommend that the few New Zealand citizens that are left who actually own a few homes, farms, commercial properties, shares, or whatever, need to pay new land tax and capital gains tax to make the tax system “fairer.” Who on earth do you think they are kidding? Or if looked at another way, the net tax paid profits of just these ‘big four’ parasitic banks amounted to more than a $1000 for every man, woman and child of New Zealand’s 4.7 million population in 2017. Remember. This is only the tax paid profits from one year by our ‘big four’ banks, out of a total of 26 banks now registered and licenced to operate by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand! The truth is these big four duplicitous foreign economic banking leeches are sucking the economic lifeblood out of the country’s economy at a phenomenal rate. So why is this happening? FRACTIONAL RESERVE BANKING “I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property – until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered.” Thomas Jefferson – spoken in 1802 58 Most people find it is extremely difficult to understand how modern money is mysteriously created or how modern Fractional-Reserve Banking operates, because most bankers lie through their teeth saying it is so incredibly complex when really it isn’t. Today Fractional- Reserve Banking is the system that operates all around the world and is controlled by the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. However, in essence, the system is very simple indeed. Fractional-Reserve Banking is the deceptive practice whereby a bank accepts deposits, makes loans or investments, but is required to hold reserves equal to only a fraction of its deposit liabilities, in case there is a bank run and the bank does not have enough to pay back depositors. Reserves are held as currency in the bank, or as balances in the bank’s accounts at the central bank. In most country’s legal systems a bank deposit is not a bailment which means the funds once deposited are no longer the property of the customer. Many years ago banks in collusion with the courts and governments perniciously deemed all deposits in banks effectively as loans to the bank, which are not legally the property of the depositor until repaid, so that in the case of the bank becoming insolvent, the receivers can legally seize all the depositor’s money and people’s life savings with immunity from prosecution. Unlike the Biblical banking system outlined in the Bible, where no interest is allowed to be charged fellow-citizens, and all loans are written off in the Year of Jubilee every 50 years to free everybody from debt bondage, to stop the bankers becoming rich and powerful, and in the process pauperizing poor people. The modern, corrupt, Fractional-Reserve Banking system allows banks to ingeniously create credit out of thin air each time they issue a loan, then enslave the borrower in perpetuity by mort-gage (death-bond) over the borrower’s property and if the borrower can’t pay, the bank seizes the property. Of course, if this corrupt system is repeated long enough it craftily transfers all the assets that are mort-gaged to the bank and hence its shareholders. It works like this: A young farmer wants to buy a farm off an old farmer for one million dollars. The young farmer goes to the bank and it agrees to loan him the money with a mort-gage over the security of the farm. On the bank’s books this loan, created out of thin air is then shown as an ASSET on the bank’s books, because until the mort-gage is repaid and released, technically the bank owns the security being the farm. The young farmer takes the cheque for one million dollars from the bank to the old farmer in payment for the farm. The farmer is quite well off and after a lifetime of farming is in need of nothing. So, as he doesn’t need the money immediately, he trots off to the same bank and deposits the one million dollars in his super saver bank deposit account. This then is shown as a LIABILITY on the bank’s books, because the bank has effectively borrowed this deposit from the farmer and may have to pay it back in the future. 59 The bank is then required to hold 20 percent of this loan/deposit ($200,000), for example, as reserves at the Reserve Bank, but then re-loans the balance of $800,000 out to the next young farmer that comes along looking for a loan too. This young farmer, in due course, after his loan has been duly approved and granted, also allows the bank to slam a death-bond/mort- gage over his farm as security as well. Repeat this devious process over and over again ad infinitum and the bank ends up mortgaging and owning the world. Regardless of what all banks would have most people to believe, banks don’t just re-loan money. They create it. To use this analogy above to illustrate how it works for and how it favours New Zealand’s big four foreign-owned banks controlled by the Reserve Bank is interesting: As of 31 March 2017, ANZ Bank (NZ) was required to hold $1.267 billion of capital reserves at a risk weighting of 22% against its $67.228 billion worth of total residential mortgages. This $1.267 billion was equivalent to 1.9% of ANZ (NZ)’s total mortgage exposure. However, conversely, the smaller NZ banks are dealt with much more strictly. For example, KiwiBank. As at June 30, 2017, KiwiBank was required to hold $515 million of capital reserves at a risk weighting of 35% against $16.521 billion worth of residential mortgages, with some of its risk weightings even as high as between 40% and 100%. KiwiBank’s $515 million held against its $16.521 billion of housing mortgages was equivalent to 3.1% of its mortgage exposure. This means that the Reserve Bank was favouring the ‘four big foreign-owned banks’ over the small New Zealand ones in setting its risk ratings when all the banks had the same level of underlying residential risk exposure. Thus, this uneven playing field favoured the big foreign- owned banks and penalized the NZ ones at the same time. This is just one of many reasons why the ‘big four’ foreign-owned banks are steadily increasing their market share and are dominating New Zealand’s banking market. This is why banks increase their assets on their books so quickly during periods of rapid credit expansion, and why the New Zealand Bankers Association deceptively say in respect of their members’ obscene profits, “but in 2017 the return on assets was only 1.04%.” When the real reason is, as their volume of assets have risen so quickly each time they have raised a loan out of thin air, there is some fiscal drag on the bank’s profits as the credit, or a proportion of it, works its way back to be re-deposited in the bank to become a LIABILITY. There are several different ways banks can generate credit and fund bank lending, and in New Zealand most of the ‘big four’ banks fund loans from offshore or the domestic savings market. 60 According to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, currently around 23 per cent of non-equity funding is sourced from offshore. Short-term offshore bank funding (from parent banks and associates usually) accounts for almost two-thirds of New Zealand’s net external liabilities, which makes the New Zealand banking system extremely vulnerable to extreme disruptions in global financial markets. About 61% of all current bank lending in NZ is to the household sector, the vast bulk of which is secured against housing assets, agriculture around 15% of which dairy is two-thirds, and about 25% to the business sector with 35% of that being property-related. This is why the expansion of cheap and easy credit favouring weightings to the housing sector has pushed housing values up so much compared to many other asset categories. It is the same situation in Australia as well. Currently (April 2018), these foreign banks officially hold assets in New Zealand valued at total $515 billion secured against New Zealand’s assets. Then there is another $198 billion or more secretly held in New Zealand Central Securities Depository Limited (NZCSD) owned by the Reserve Bank that the NZ public by and large knows absolutely nothing about. Clearly, with a highly inflated NZ total house asset value at around $1 trillion at present, if interest rates were to rise substantially in a global financial crisis in the future, because New Zealand home prices are now the highest in the world compared to average incomes, the equity people have in their homes could easily end up being destroyed in a serious downturn. In this event the banks could end up owning most of the homes throughout the country, or worse, the banks themselves could become insolvent. The only truly independent figures on New Zealand’s debt position other than the NZ Reserve Bank and Treasury figures the author is aware of is the information provided by Mr John Pemberton on his website. According to Pemberton, most New Zealanders are being rapidly converted into debt slaves. According to his statistics, the total New Zealand debt position as at May 2017 was: $614,212,000.00, with average debt per person of $129,664 calculated on a population 4.736,933, while the average debt to these banks since 2016 is growing at $876.24 per second. http://debt.johnpemberton.nz/index.html As this deleterious Fractional-Reserve Banking System creates money out of thin air each time a loan is granted, the short-term positive effect is it stimulates the economy. However, in the longer term, the negative effect is it depreciates the currency, inflates asset prices upwards 61 like shares and property, while it gradually floods the whole financial system with unsustainable debt, which ultimately will lead to bank insolvency and the whole system’s general collapse in the future if not radically corrected. With global banks generating such an enormous amount of interest-bearing debt like this, and in the process taking over the wealth of the whole world through mort-gage debt-slavery, the system is ultimately destined to fail. Because if a future downturn in the economy is serious enough, it will not only allow the banks to effectively foreclose on everybody’s loans throughout the world and seize borrowers’ properties, if bad enough, it will cause the banks’ liabilities (deposits and borrowings) to end up being more than the banks’ devalued assets on their books, causing the banks themselves to become insolvent. This is not the extreme position that the major international banking dynastic families want, of course, because in the event that this were to happen, they will lose all their wealth as well. Hence, the duplicitous Anglo/American banking families who own and run the big global banks now, know this is inevitably coming. As the result, they are secretly planning for this eventuality by preparing a banking “reset” to fraudulently write off this excessive debt in their LIABILITY ACCOUNTS, and by a deliberate system of fraud and deceit, plan to embezzle the life savings of all ordinary citizens and depositors. 6) OPEN BANK RESOLUTION: THE COMING FINANCIAL APOCALYPSE AND PLANNED ROBBERY OF NEW ZEALANDERS’ LIFE SAVINGS As the result of the concern that this Fractionalized Reserve Banking System is soon going to collapse, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), now funded, hosted and controlled by the BIS in Basel, Switzerland, was founded in April 2009. It was established after the G20 London Summit as a successor to the Financial Stability Forum. The FSB has been assigned a number of important tasks, working alongside the IMF, World Bank and WTO. Chairman of the Board is Mark Carney (2011-present) Governor of the Bank of England. Membership includes 68 international member institutions, ministries of finance, 62 central banks and supervisory authorities, including such organizations as the Bank for International Settlements, European Central Bank, European Commission, IMF, OECD and the World Bank. Part of the Financial Stability Board’s job after the financial crisis of 2007-08 has been to formulate a list of Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) colloquially called ‘too big to fail banks’ under the Basel III Capital Adequacy Ratio requirements and have these banks submit an updated emergency Resolution Plan no later than March 2018. This includes, during a potential global financial crisis, to stop these G-SIBs from failing, an insidious plan to recapitalize these banks, digitally overnight, by the transfer (stealing) of depositors’ funds from their savings accounts (which are liabilities of the banks) to bolster up the assets of the banks on the other side of the ledger so that they will not become insolvent. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_systemically\_important\_banks https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial\_Stability\_Board The Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s current plan to meet this directive is called OPEN BANK RESOLUTION and is found on their website here: https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/regulation-and-supervision/banks/open-bank-resolution This is precisely what the Reserve Bank and ‘big four’ Systemically Important Banks in NZ are deviously planning to do in the future and they are, paradoxically, remarkably very transparent about it as well. On top of this, all bank depositors’ funds are not even insured or guaranteed in New Zealand by the government as they are in most other countries. This in itself is a disgrace. So not only are these ‘big four’ duplicitous banks sucking the economic lifeblood out of the entire New Zealand economy at an increasingly alarming rate, while they have the downright cheek to hypocritically support the imposition of new draconian land and capital gains taxes on many of our hard-working citizens – it would seem overwhelmingly clear they are also planning on blatantly robbing the entire New Zealand public of their life savings to recapitalize their banks in the next global financial banking crisis. The continuation of this outrageous, malignant, legalized rort by these professional foreign banking leeches and economic blood-suckers is a national disgrace and must be immediately stopped forthwith if the Government seriously wants to make New Zealand’s tax system “fairer for everybody” and improve the standard of living for all our citizens. 63 7) BIG FOUR BANKS TO DRASTICALLY CUT JOBS One of the primary claims of the New Zealand Bankers Association, the voice of the banking industry, has advocated in recent times, is how their member banks so enormously benefit the New Zealand economy by creating jobs in respect they employ over 25,000 people. In fact, they even publish this on their Home page: http://www.nzba.org.nz/ Yet in The New Zealand Herald, April 11, 2018, pg.B2, appeared an article titled, ‘BNZ jobs on the line, says union.’ Here is an excerpt from it; “First Union says 50 jobs are likely to be made redundant and replaced with part-time roles at BNZ as its Aussie parent bank cuts thousands of jobs. First is aware of, and disappointed by, the projected 6,000 redundancies being rolled out at NAB, BNZ’s parent bank in Australia... NZ’s actions were part of a worrying trend away from face-to-face banking towards online, telephone-based or automated services... BNZ and the other banks present these changes as an inevitable response to technology, when in reality it is a deliberate choice to put profit ahead of the interests of customers and workers. – Stephen Parry, First Union.” Of course, this recent announcement in April 2018, gives only part of the full story. In fact, BNZ’s parent National Australia Bank’s CEO Andrew Thorburn, who will earn $6.7 million this year and who lives in a $3.235 million mansion in South Yarra, Melbourne, has quite openly said this 20 per cent, 6,000 employee cut will boost profits by $1 billion. On top of this, these ‘big four’ Australian banks, National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank, ANZ and Westpac, plan to cut staff by 12 per cent across the board or 20,000 full-time jobs from their current staff of 159,028 by the end of 2018. Over the past two years, ANZ alone has cut 10 per cent of its employees or 5,456 staff. http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/financial-services/big-four-to-cut- 20000-jobs-20171221-h08qk9 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5229983/Australias-big-four-banks-cut-20-000- jobs-2018.html This is only the beginning of massive future staff cuts for these banks following most of the big multinational bank’s policies to do the same all around the world. Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC), for example, way back in 2015 embarked on an aggressive plan to shed 50,000 jobs to boost profits by another $5 billion by 2017, after having cut nearly 40,000 jobs previously between 2011 and 2014. http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/09/investing/hsbc-job-cuts/index.html 64 Clearly, as banking is being computerized more and more, cheques and cash are gradually being eliminated and replaced with an electronic digitalized payments system. Soon technology will largely replace humans – and in the process, it will generate even more excessive profits for bankers – who, in essence produce very little physical wealth at all themselves, because basically they are glorified clerical ‘pen-pushers’. Yet now, even that traditional physical function will be largely done away with and be replaced by computers digitally generating yet even more billions in profits for their foreign, largely hidden shareholders. Really. It is way past the time this blatant foreign banking rort of our economy was radically stopped. In its Terms of Reference for the Tax Working Group, the Government emphasized that it hoped the New Zealand tax system should be reformed to provide much more “fairness” in the system, promoting job growth, better income equality while keeping it simple, efficient, coherent and balanced. Consequently, I would like to make the following key recommendations to reform the tax system primarily focussed on reforming the greatest unfairness of all and the real evil drain on the New Zealand economy – the massive rort of the whole economy at present by these ‘big four’ largely foreign-owned banking parasites who, in just the last financial year alone, ripped-off $5.19 billion after tax and repatriated most of these outrageous profits to their overseas shareholders. In just one year alone, these excessive profits were an amount equivalent to nearly FIVE TIMES the entire value of Kiwirail – our national railway system including the Cook Strait Ferry System that has taken the nation over 150 years to build! If that is not legalized theft and ‘highway robbery’ then I don’t know what is? Accordingly, I believe, the time has now arrived where the bull must be firmly taken by the horns by our Government and this vital issue must be urgently addressed and resolved. 65 8) FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS RECOMMENDATION #1: REJECT ALL PROPOSALS TO IMPLEMENT LAND OR CAPITAL GAINS TAX ON NEW ZEALAND CITIZENS As mentioned earlier in this submission, because both Land Taxes and Capital Gains Taxes proposed by the banks and others are intrinsically counter-productive and destructive for the average citizen, and ultimately, history proves, to the national economy and political stability of the country – these global banker-inspired tax proposal impositions (which are largely designed to protect multinational banking vested interests) should be entirely rejected outright. In their place, however, since these foreign predatory banks are so keen on advocating harshly taxing others, especially normal hard-working New Zealand citizens to breaking point, while protecting themselves and their own self-interests, in perpetuating their cancerous rort over the economy by making ever more excessive profits to be repatriated to their overseas shareholders – I recommend the following: RECOMMENDATION #2: INTRODUCE NEW ZEALAND ‘MAJOR BANK LEVY BILL 2018’ To correct this enormous rort and unfairness over the New Zealand economy by these ‘big four’ foreign-controlled parasitic banks in particular, namely; ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited \[owned by Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Australia\], Westpac New Zealand \[owned by Westpac Banking Corporation, Australia\], Bank of New Zealand (BNZ) \[owned by National Australia Bank (NAB)\], ASB Bank \[owned by Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)\] – the New Zealand Government should urgently introduce a new levy on these four major banks’ after-tax profits called the “Major Bank Levy Bill 2018,” based on the recent Australian Major Bank Levy Bill 2017 and the Treasury Laws Amendment (Major Bank Levy) Bill 2017 passed by the Australian Parliament on 19 June 2017. https://www.aph.gov.au/About\_Parliament/Parliamentary\_Departments/Parliamentary\_Lib rary/FlagPost/2017/June/The\_Major\_Bank\_Levy\_explained ... but with the following unique New Zealand modifications: The Australian Bill introduced a ‘major bank levy’ at 0.015 per cent on banks’ liabilities of all banks with a threshold of over $100 billion in total liabilities, currently Commonwealth Bank, ANZ Bank, Westpac, National Australia Bank and Macquarie Bank, and is expected to generate 66 about AU$1.6 billion p.a., or AU$6.2 billion over the next four years for the Government, every year net of increased deductions for other taxes. This levy applied from 1 July 2017. I believe this Australian Bill is a step in the right direction, but that the levy percentage applied is infinitesimal relative to the size of these banks’ massive profits which in the 2015/16 financial year topped AU$32 billion for just these five big foreign-owned Australian banks alone. For the 2015/16 reporting year CBA recorded a $9.45 billion profit and paid out 76.5 per cent of this profit in dividends. Westpac’s 2015/16 profit was AU$7.82 billion, returning 80.3 per cent in dividends to shareholders. ANZ Bank’s 2015/16 profit was AU$5.89 billion, returning 79.4 per cent in dividends to shareholders. NAB’s 2015/16 profit was AU$6.48 billion, returning 80.8 per cent in dividends to shareholders. Macquarie Group’s 2016/17 profit was AU$2.22 billion and paid its CEO Nicholas Moore AU$18.7 million. Look at the List of the Twenty Biggest Shareholders of any of these big Australian banks, (four of which own the big four banks in New Zealand), and apart from these Australian banks’ cross shareholdings in each other, virtually all of their major shareholders are not Australian. https://www.sbs.com.au/news/big-banks-profits-targeted-by-morrison http://investors.morningstar.com/ownership/shareholders-major.html?t=WEBNF To illustrate why I believe this Australian 0.015 per cent Major Bank Levy figure is ridiculously low, and just tinkering with the issue, not only did these big five foreign-owned banks rort Australian taxpayers as well to the tune of over AU$30 billion in the 2017 financial year. To use Westpac as a good example of all, this bank alone paid its top 13 executives AU$38,958,635 in 2017, an 11.39 per cent increase on the year before. To be precise, here are these 13 executives basic salaries in alphabetical order: Alexandra Holcomb AU$2.44m, Brian Hartzer $6.68m, Peter King $2.66m, Christine Parker $2.09m, David Curren $2.43m, Brad Cooper $2.96m, David Mclean $2.10m, George Frazis $3.31m, Philip Coffey $4.94m, Lyn Cobley $3.15m, David Lindberg $2.37m, Rebecca Lim $1.88m and Gary Thursby $1.95m. http://insiders.morningstar.com/trading/executive- compensation.action?t=WEBNF&region=usa&culture=en-US&ownerCountry=USA So clearly, these giant predatory banks, with such a huge privileged position in the business world, in that they are able to print money and create assets at will, generating massive profits like this year after year largely being repatriated to their big overseas shareholders both from within their New Zealand and Australia’s banking operations, and with such enormous multi- 67 million dollar pay packages being given to their executive staff as well –they should pay their fair share. While the author does believe it is extremely important for a government to prudently control its state spending, including wages, relative to its income without taxing its citizens to breaking point. While these big four banks’ executives are paid so incredibly highly, and the banks themselves are making such massive excessive profits that are being repatriated overseas, it seems ironic that our own 27,000 nurses who are members of the NZ Nurses Organisation are paid a mere pittance by comparison, and currently are being offered around a 2 per cent yearly increase for registered nurses, midwives, health care assistants and community nurses – it would seem that now is the appropriate time in history to level up the playing field and tax these parasitic banks substantially more. While I agree the Australian Finance Minister has made a splendid step in the right direction, I believe the Australian ‘Major Bank Levy’ is far too low and should be applied to the tax paid profits of the big banks rather than to their liabilities. The reason and logic for applying the levy against their tax paid profits is that in an economic downturn affecting their profits, in fairness to the banks, the levy will not become unsustainable, but will rise and fall with their profits or losses, rather than bluntly being applied to the more fixed liabilities or assets of the banks. This would administratively be very cost effective and simple both for the banks and Government to apply following the publication of the bank’s annual or bi-annual company returns. The New Zealand ‘big four’ privileged banks made a massive combined tax paid profit in the last financial year 2016/17 of NZ$5.19 billion. Most of this excessive profit was repatriated to their Australian parent banks and then remitted to their foreign shareholders and very little was actually retained for reinvestment in either Australia or New Zealand. In 2017, the top five Australian banks made after tax profits between them of AU$32 billion. Most of these obscene profits were repatriated to foreign shareholders in the US, UK or elsewhere abroad, and these funds were largely not used to strengthen the credit worthiness of the local banks (which mainly are registered as separate limited liability companies in their own right so depositors cannot claim against the parent or foreign shareholders in a failure). Neither were the majority of these profits reinvested back into the Australian or New Zealand economy. So it is obvious that if these net after tax profits were heavily levied, it means that the levy will not negatively affect the bank’s financial viability or stability in New Zealand at all, but will only affect their mainly foreign shareholders who will simply receive lower, but much more appropriate and realistic dividends. Prior to introducing such a levy, obviously, any shares in these banks held by New Zealand pension funds should be reassessed. 68 Since these ‘big four’ parasitic banks and their senior executives have openly advocated a Capital Gains Tax (CGT) for all New Zealand hard-working citizens, which at the effective top Australian rate from 1 July 2019 without the 50% discount will probably be 47.5% over and above existing personal taxes, it therefore would seem entirely consistent and appropriate that the profits and assets of these big banking bloodsuckers pay their fair share also. Therefore. I recommend a ‘Major Bank Levy’ be applied to the net after tax profits of these big four New Zealand registered banks at 50 per cent. This would generate, based on last year’s after tax profits alone, NZ$2.595 billion per year in extra revenue for the Government, which could be used to “re-balance” the income of other poorer New Zealanders and help make the tax system much fairer. Because this 50 per cent levy level would initially come as a shock for the banks, and therefore their major shareholders, there should be a reasonable transition period to reach the maximum rate, perhaps over a period of 2 or 3 years, starting with a rate of just 10 per cent. The banks will whine somewhat and carry on as if the sky is falling down, but they will still be left with enormous profits at over NZ$2.5 billion per year at the full levy rate. The New Zealand Bankers Association will immediately throw their arms up in the air by claiming their NZ banks in 2017 already paid $2 billion in tax, and that their average net interest margin was only 2.98%, their return on assets was only 1.04% and their average return on equity was only 14.43%. But the fact remains, due to their highly unique and privileged position, they are allowed, like no other company or individual, through Fractional Reserve Banking, to privately create credit and loans, and therefore their assets, out of thin air, which no other corporation or business ever does. That is why they become so incredibly wealthy so quickly. Even after a Major Bank Levy at 50%, just these ‘big four’ banks in New Zealand at current after tax profits will still be left with over NZ$2.5 billion to pay in dividends to be repatriated to their largely overseas shareholders – and I would suggest even that is far too high. Recently I heard that the New Zealand St John Ambulance service is struggling for funds and ambulances in New Zealand as the result of a sharp rise in demand and costs. The service currently treats and transports approximately 400,000 people servicing 90% of New Zealanders every year. Currently it operates about 600 ambulance vehicles from 205 ambulance stations. Currently each new ambulance costs in the region of $200,000 each. 69 Even after a Major Bank Levy at 50%, these ‘big four’ banks will still be left with totally outrageous levels of after tax/levy profits in excess $2.5 billion per year for a small country like New Zealand. Put in proper perspective, this figure is equivalent to purchasing 12,500 new ambulances per year! Yet, we have an ambulance service that is increasingly struggling to serve our people with just 600 ambulances. The situation is utter madness, and it is about time this brazen rort of our general economy by these professional banking parasites was stopped! Further. These banks will still be allowed to carry on with their independent privilege of privately printing money and generating assets out of thin air, which no other business, corporation or member of society ever does. So they should be grateful many more onerous restrictions aren’t placed upon them as well, such as full nationalization, or the task of ethically writing off all short-term loans every 7 years, and long-term loans every 50 years in the Year of Jubilee, as clearly advocated in the Jewish Torah and Christian Bible (Deuteronomy 15:1-6; Leviticus 25:8-12). And lastly, I believe, if a Major Bank Levy regime like this was adopted by the Government to implement these radical measures, unlike either land tax or capital gains tax, they will most certainly be universally welcomed by about 99 per cent of the general New Zealand population who inwardly feel they have had enough of being ripped off by big business, particularly international bankers. Indeed, it is my considered view that there exists right now, deep in the hearts and minds of most ordinary folk around the world in all countries, for the time being a suppressed general contempt and hatred of international bankers and business executives who increasingly rort the system – and I believe, if the New Zealand Government has the courage of its convictions to implement the levy as I suggest, there will be overwhelming support for our boldness and general worldwide respect. RECOMMENDATION #3: INTRODUCE ‘PROVISION OF NO INTEREST LOANS FOR LOW INCOME CITIZENS’ Three economists headed by Claudio Borio, Head of the Monetary and Economic Department at the Bank for International Settlements, have advocated for years that non-interest bearing money be created as non-interest bearing central bank liabilities. Central Bank asset purchases financed by issuing non-interest bearing bank reserves have been practised in the past, notably by the Bank of Japan during the early to mid-2000s to 70 finance government deficits and so on. The aim of this is to allow the government sector to incur a lower service debt burden, and as this saving would boost demand, there would be no need to boost additional taxes. I support this system as it is closer to the Biblical banking laws I support as a Christian, and I would love to see a policy of providing ‘no interest housing loans’ to poorer members of society. However, with the global Fractional Reserve Banking system that presently exists, based around creating interest-bearing debt, such a policy may be difficult to implement on a meaningful scale, short of abolishing the existing global system and starting again. The policy of no interest debt is often ridiculed by mainstream economists as ‘helicopter money’ or a ‘free lunch’ but perhaps such a policy may be worth considering: https://voxeu.org/article/helicopter-money-illusion-free-lunch . Baron Adair Turner, former Chairman of the Financial Services Authority (UK), has long been an avid advocate of having central banks directly finance government spending and cash distributions to citizens using no interest ‘helicopter money’. The policy of NO INTEREST bearing debt is advocated for all Jewish people and citizens of Israel in the Bible. (Exodus 22:25, Leviticus 25:36-37). However, with the Bank for International Settlements Basel IV new rules and reforms requiring some banks to carry more capital reserves as the bank’s capital costs increase, to be fully implemented in 2022, it may be difficult if not impossible to contemplate such profound changes promoting no interest loans as a viable option. These new Basel IV rules are not only going to affect banks and insurance companies but many other big businesses worldwide also. However, I still believe the idea of providing non- interest bearing debt and loans is worthy of investigation by the Tax Working Group. RECOMMENDATION #4: INTRODUCE NEW ZEALAND ‘BANKING EXECUTIVE ACCOUNTABILITY REGIME (BEAR) BILL 2018’ In response to the outrageous salaries and other unacceptable conduct carried out by banking executives, the UK Government established the Financial Services Act 2012 which came into force on 1 April 2013. Specifically the Act gave the Bank of England responsibility for financial stability and introduced a new regulatory structure consisting of the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority. 71 The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has significant powers. Following its establishment the FCA established the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SM&CR) in March 2016 to oversee and monitor senior executives of large banks, building societies and credit unions and is to be extended to cover all financial services firms by mid to late 2019. The aim of the SM&CR is to raise the ethical and business standards of conduct of everyone who works in financial services by making senior executives much more responsible and accountable for their actions. In New Zealand, its equivalent is called the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) which was formed on May 1, 2011 as part of the Financial Markets (Regulators and KiwiSaver) Bill. Unfortunately, since the FMA was established in New Zealand, it has done virtually nothing to rectify the monopolization and rort of the country by the ‘big four’ foreign-owned banks, but rather has concentrated on legal action against small finance companies instead. This failure to monitor the big banks in New Zealand urgently needs to be reformed. However, the Australians, in this respect, have been much more effective and direct. On 7 February 2018 the Australian Parliament passed into law the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2018. This Bill amended the Banking act 1959 to establish the Banking Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR), announced by the Government in May 2017, to impose accountability, remuneration, key personnel and notification obligations on authorised deposit-taking institutions and persons in director and senior executive roles; and provide the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) with additional powers to investigate potential breaches of the BEAR and extend these powers to APRA’s other supervisory functions; and Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998 and Banking Act 1959 to make consequential amendments. https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary\_Business/Bills\_LEGislation/Bills\_Search\_Results/Res ult?bld=r6000 This recent legislation gives the new Banking Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority huge new powers to change financial institution remuneration policies, ban executives and impose penalties of up to AU$200 million for misconduct. In an unprecedented move, the regime requires at least 60 per cent of chief executive bonuses and 40 per cent of other senior executive’s bonuses be deferred for a minimum of four years. As short-term and long-term incentives make up the majority of senior executive’s pay, these measures will mean executives will be forced to become more accountable. They will be subject to much greater scrutiny and there will be increased consequences for when executives and banks do not meet expectations. 72 The major banks have been embroiled in various scandals in recent years, including market manipulation in setting bank bill swap rates, breaching responsible lending laws, and providing misleading financial advice. APRA will receive AU$4.2 million in funding over four years to implement the measures, which address the recommendations of the Australian House of Representatives Coleman Report. This form of financial regulation is well overdue in New Zealand. (Indeed, as some have suggested, it could be extended to other major public company boards of directors as well of companies that have a key influence over the national economy). However, the banks and financial institutions are the first priority. On top of this, a Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry (also known as the Hayne Royal Commission) was established on 14 December 2017 by the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia to inquire into and report on misconduct in the banking, superannuation and financial services industry. The AU$75 million royal commission is due to make its final report by 1 February 2019. Among the banks being investigated for being implicated in numerous alleged scandals are Commonwealth Bank (owner of NZ’s ASB bank), National Australia Bank (owner of NZ’s BNZ), Westpac, ANZ and Macquarie Bank. In December 2017, Australian shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, attacked the Terms of Reference for the commission, saying, “if the Turnbull government does not get this right from the start, we will only see a continuation of the financial scandals” and continued, “The Terms of Reference must enable the royal commission to investigate the rorts and rip-offs to the fullest extent possible.” Currently, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has an online tool to collect the public’s stories of banking misconduct, fraud and criminal activity. https://financialservices.royalcommission.gov.au/Pages/default.aspx So it is obvious that some similar new radical measures must be implemented here by the government to help bring these ‘big four’ banking rip-off merchants into line. Accordingly, I recommend that the Tax Working Group recommend to the New Zealand Government that a “New Zealand Banking Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR) 2018 Bill be drafted and passed into law here too. This Bill would fit like a glove with its proposed sister legislation, the Major Bank Levy Bill 2018. In my view, these two radical measures alone would by themselves have a huge effect on the tax system by generating another NZ$2.5 billion or more for the government, forcing those who really are the chief culprits extracting excessive profits from the New Zealand economy to pay their fair share. It would also be much fairer than either land tax or capital gains tax 73 and would not alienate a large proportion of the population, as these latter taxes most definitely would, and do, in other nations. These two legislative bills could be easily drafted and passed into law within the existing term of government, and be implemented within the timeframe of other measures envisaged in the Tax Working Group’s Terms of Reference and final recommendations to the Government. IN CONCLUSION Although these bankers and their foreign shareholders will be extremely unhappy about my recommendations, little do they know, it is ultimately for their own good, and long-term best interests of their profession. Because, if something is not radically done soon to rectify this gross, growing unfairness and pauperization of the middle classes, working classes and poorer people, if history repeats itself, and it probably will. Their coming retribution will most likely in the future be much more severe than they can ever imagine. In the Old Testament and Jewish Torah, poor people who couldn’t afford to bring the Levitical priest a lamb to sacrifice for their atonement at the temple, were allowed to bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons instead. (Leviticus 5:7, 12:8 KJV). When Jesus, during his earthly ministry, “...went into the temple of God and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves, and said unto them, ‘It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.’” (Matthew 21:12-13 KJV). One of the main things he was so upset about was that the self-serving priestly bankers, sitting in the temple entrusted with the nation’s treasury, were charging extortionately high prices for selling doves, robbing even the most impoverished people in Jerusalem of their last dime and hard-earned personal sacrifices. In my view, this is what, once again, is taking place now, but this time it is much more subtle and it is happening on a global scale. Worse, it is sadly largely being perpetrated by apostate, hypocritical, Jewish and Protestant bankers, who all should know very much better now with the benefit of historical hindsight and an open Bible. In this submission I have generally criticized socialists, some of whom I know are members of the Tax Working Group, and some others who certainly are active members of the existing Government. In closing, I must give some credit that is due, especially to those individuals who sincerely hold some of their socialist views with a passion to make the system more 74 equitable. Because, in many respects, to my shame as a Christian, I believe that the growth of modern Socialism, where it advocates reforms by FORCE designed to help poorer people and redistribute the wealth, in many ways, is a natural by-product and response often of well- meaning more secular people against this deplorable rort of this Judeo/Christian banking hypocrisy, continuum of naked capitalism and perfidious greed – that now, in large part, has disgracefully abandoned its original tenets of faith and service enunciated in the Scriptures – to VOLUNTARILY help poorer people who are less fortunate, love thy neighbour as thyself, and charitably, more impartially, ensure as much as possible that the wealth of the community is equitably and honestly distributed. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to comment, and may you, all members of the Tax Working Group, be especially blessed with wise discernment and honesty, to recommend the very best of economic reforms for us all as New Zealand citizens in our beautiful little country, not just for a foreign privileged few, dominated by, in my view, currently an avaricious cartel of parasitic foreign bankers.

Submission to Tax Working Group Submission to Tax Working Group From:- John O’Malley. C.A. 1 Purpose of a Tax. Taxation is Revenue for the Crown and a tool in fiscal management. As a rule, an essential part of taxation system is for the Crown to tax all gains in a nation as the entire community has benefited from the economic and social stability that stable Government has provided. All participants of that society should contribute to the financial cost of generating the desired social conditions. The principle should be “where wealth flows—the State should clip the ticket for a share of it”. The current New Zealand tax system is seriously unbalanced. Of concern is living in a culture which believes in obtaining money – effortlessly– by rent-seeking, most of it non-taxable, which is a form of manipulation and distortion of the economic system. It is not something to be valued in an economy, and changing this culture is imperative. Present taxation system favours a minority, i.e. more affluent who own assets. The less affluent live off taxed wages or income and don't have the ability to earn money effortlessly. The present system favours a disincentive to innovate, to take risks, in favour of collecting effortlessly economic rent from an asset (both on revenue account and capital account, with the latter rarely taxed). Much of this “wealth” is inflation generated. New Zealand – and Auckland in particular – has some of the most unaffordable housing in the world. Those who are lucky enough own such an asset are effortlessly rewarded, those who don't own homes find themselves without a roof over their heads. We should use our tax system to incentivise or discourage certain behaviours. A tax system should promote health and wellbeing behaviours, encourage productive investment in the goods and services we need, and discourage speculative activities. It should also facilitate the competitive practise and work against oligopolies and monopoly’s. A case can be argued for Charities to be tax exempt as they perform many of the social functions that would be performed by Government if those Charities did not exist. Capital gains tax All gains in asset values that are realised in cash, ( or cash equivalent) excluding the family home and land thereon should be subject to a Capital gains tax. The rate should be high enough to discourage speculators and bring in Revenue for the Crown. It should be set at the top tax rate for individual tax payers i.e. 33%. We should explore the Australian Capital gains tax systems as to its suitability for the New Zealand environment. Funds derived from a Capital gains tax should be used to reduce personal income tax, for lower and middle income New Zealanders. Submission to Tax Working Group Submission to Tax Working Group From:- John O’Malley. C.A. 2 Imposing a tax on an increase in asset value that has not been realised, in cash, is fickle, should not be implemented. To do so may result in the assets, or a portion of it, needing to be sold to pay the tax. (you cannot sell half a valuable work of art such as a painting). Furthermore, assets go up and down in value over a period; e.g., share investments, thus making it difficult to determine when such a tax should be imposed. There is already a strong resistance in the nation to the current system of rates of Local Authorities based on valuation of properties rather than a charge per household. Under the current rates charging system some retired and other low-income people have had to sell up their homes, leave their communities, as the rates charged have become exorbitant due to house inflation. Taxing on an increase in asset values will furtherer exacerbate the problem. Sugar Tax. The health problem of obesity in New Zealand is the result of the consumption of foods that have a high sugar content. We need to encourage a healthier life style in choice of food. A sugar tax should be imposed on sugary soft drinks such as was imposed in the UK from 2018. Consideration should be given to imposing it on all processed foods. To offset this, remove GST on fresh fruit and vegetables. We need to tackle the rising rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Taxation on Banks and other large financial institutions. Both the United Kingdom and Australia have an "excessive profits" tax on their large banking and financial institutions. (See Australian Federal Budget 2017, additional taxation on banks.). The Australian banks in New Zealand are essentially an oligopoly, that gouge the New Zealand economy under the disguise of them being “Strong Banks .” Exempt smaller NZ based banks i.e Kiwibank, TSB and credit unions by way of a universal size limitation based on liabilities or turnover (e.g. apply such a tax to institutions greater than $1.5b gross income). As the Australians found this incentivized competition in bank interest charges and fees, between the smaller and larger financial institutions. Submission to Tax Working Group Submission to Tax Working Group From:- John O’Malley. C.A. 3 Land banking as a speculative investment of land zoned residential. Given the current national housing crisis Land banking by speculators in residential zoned land, that do not have dwellings constructed thereon, needs to be discouraged. Such vacant residential zoned land areas should have a “Residential Vacant Land“ valued add tax imposed (rate of 33%) as a disincentive to hold land that is required for housing. This is creating the incentivisation to build residential accommodation for rent or sale, to avoid paying the tax, thereby increasing the supply of residential properties. Provisional Tax for small business: - AIM method of provisional tax for small business is time consuming and does not address the cash flow problems of small business. Small business struggle to get their debts paid in a timely manner and end up having to use bank overdraft to pay provisional tax. Move away from accrual accounting for provisional tax calculations for all small business with an annual turnover of less than $5m. Implement a cash basis for paying provisional tax. It will be based on what the business “actually receives in cash, less what it pays in cash”, for all taxable sources, at a prescribed rate; i.e. net cash over a defined time period. (Non-taxable cash flows are excluded.) The prescribed rate could be either:- I. The ratio of residual income tax (RIT) to all taxable Gross Revenue for the previous year, or II. On a prescribed rate that is specified by the tax payer. There needs to be a requirement that 80% of total tax payable for a year is paid as provisional tax to prevent gaming. Failure to meet this target results in use of money interest applying on all tax payable for the year less provisional tax paid. III. Synchronise timing of provisional tax payments along with GST payments. A spread sheet with an example of how this could work is attached to this email. Taxation supporting monetary policy. The Official Cash Rate(OCR) is not the lowest rate of interest charged on loans in the nation. Some mortgage brokers have access to large funds of off-shore money which through a variety of financial instruments have an interest rate less than the Official Cash Rate. (In the past Japan has been a source of such funds). Access to this source of finance has flowed into the housing market, and in doing so has undermined the economic purpose of the Official Cash Rate. It has been a contributor to housing inflation. Either restrict the source of such capital inflows into the nation or charge a Submission to Tax Working Group Submission to Tax Working Group From:- John O’Malley. C.A. 4 differential tax on the difference between the OCR and that interest paid where the rate is less than the Official Cash Rate, to bring the effective loan rate up to the OCR. Carbon Tax. The reality of climate change needs to be faced. If we are to move away from fossil fuels, carbon pollution etc, to other sources of energy, then the issue of Carbon taxes, and the trade ability of Carbon rights needs to be revisited. The upside is it generates greater incentives for forest owners, and continued investment in trees, with a down side to dairy farmers (and other polluter industries) thereby threating their viability. Any such tax would need to be introduced at a very low rate and over a considerable period, but even then, it signals that we cannot continue with current behaviours. From:- John D O'Malley.

SUBMISSION TO TAX WORKING GROUP What does the future of tax look like to you? I want to see a tax system that is fair, equitable, consistent and uncomplicated. As the population ages we need to be thinking of ways that the elderly can continue to be contributing members of the society. Science shows that a large part of the decline we see in the elderly is a consequence of isolation and lack of purpose. Changing Demographics We also need to create a tax – shared by workers and their employers – for a superannuation fund to be held and managed separately for the purpose of supporting people when they retire. As a government fund, the superannuation fund should not be taxable. Private retirement saving schemes should be given a tax benefits such as the tax deferred pension funds in other countries. Increasing tax on investments is a disincentive to saving for retirement. Te Ao Maori I’d like to see the wealth arising from Treaty settlements be applied more directly to developing skills and opportunities for Maori rather than in generating more money. The Changing Nature of Work What is described here is a direct result of government policy that shifted the economy from a PAYE basis to individual contractors and “trickle down” mythology. I’d like to see more of a commitment between employers and employees with employers sharing responsibility for working conditions such as sick leave, regular salary increases in line with inflation, pension funds, etc Environmental Challenges Taxing negative impacts on the environment just serves to raise the price to the consumer while detrimental practices continue. Government needs the courage to regulate for change rather than tax for change. Technology The rise of online platforms that bypass tax were created, in part, by the public’s frustration with being held hostage to corporate greed and by the need to supplement income in an environment where many people who have full time jobs can not afford the necessities of life. This is another opportunity to address the source of the problem rather than be the ambulance at the bottom of the hill. The real threat of technology is the rapid move to replacing people working in jobs with machines that can do the job more quickly and cheaper. I have no suggestions/solutions, but think it is possibly the greatest threat to the economy, to our tax base, and to the social fabric of New Zealand Improving Productivity The absence of a widely applied capital gains tax, together with immigration policy that allows foreigners to buy NZ property (and to automatically gain residence status in the process if they invest enough money for three years!), AND by forcing the repatriation of the NZ dollars invested overseas with the FIF tax amendment, property speculation boomed – rendering the NZ economy largely non productive, with no tax revenue from the property speculation, a generation unable to buy a home and many New Zealanders left homeless. I would like to see a capital gains tax (that does not include the family home), a revocation of the FIF tax legislation (replaced by capital gains tax on the sale of foreign investments), and a widening of our single pointed reliance on dairy farming and tourism (both of which are having a significant negative impact on the environment) Inequality In replacing the higher income tax rate with GST we effectively made the poor relatively poorer because GST is charged for the essential things we all require - most especially food and utilities – and we are all taxed equally on those essentials regardless of ability to pay. I would like to see GST eliminated from store bought groceries (not restaurants or take aways) and from household utilities (not for business) Globalisation Although goods and services can be bought by New Zealanders from anywhere in the world (with no GST revenue), due to our geographic location it is often more expensive to buy online. A greater problem posed by globalisation is the fact that multinational organizations can (and do) avoid tax amounting to billions of dollars while millions of people globally, who are living and working in countries other than where they were born, are caught up in complex compliance requirements between differing tax jurisdictions. What is the purpose of tax? The main purpose of tax is to ensure that every citizen has access to food, shelter, education, healthcare, and transportation in a safe, just, and sanitary environment. As in an ‘extended family’, we are all responsible for contributing tax revenue for the wellbeing of our society according to our individual means. It is therefore important that tax also be used to ensure that people have the means to engage productively in employment by supporting the acquisition of the skills required for gainful employment. It is NOT the purpose of tax to manipulate public behaviour by making certain undesirable behaviours more expensive through taxation. We can better incentivise good behaviour by focusing on providing the means for those in every sector of the society to feel valued for their contributions in a society they are proud to be part of. Are We Taxing The Right Things? When a business buys something and sells it for a profit, it is called “income” and everyone understands the justification for paying tax on the profit from sale. Capital gains should also be taxed on anything that is sold for a profit: including the sale of property (with the exception of the family home), financial investments, business, etc. There should be no tax until capital gains have been realised. As stated above, we should have a payroll tax – shared by workers and their employers – for a superannuation fund to be held and managed separately for the purpose of supporting people when they retire. As a government fund, the superannuation fund should not be taxable. Private retirement saving schemes should be given a tax priority such as the tax deferred pension funds in other countries. Increasing tax on investments is a disincentive to saving for retirement. We should not tax charities but should have regulations in place that ensures a certain per cent of their donations are applied directly to the beneficiaries or cause they serve. If the charity makes money from running a business the same per cent of profits must be applied directly to the beneficiary cause. I strongly disagree with a wealth tax. Tax should be limited to ‘income’ – ie.to money received - whether passively as in investments or actively through business or employment. It should not extend to money one has saved or to material possessions one owns. Taxing wealth is a powerful disincentive to saving. Any additional money that wealth generates should be taxable (interest, dividends, capital gains, profits from gambling, etc) Tax on the value of residential property for the purpose of setting local rates is the only exception. An additional tax on the land that one’s home sits on will create too great a tax burden on long term home owners (some of whom are already being forced to leave) and on those new home owners who struggle to pay a mortgage. Estate Tax should have a threshold like $2 or $3 million before it is taxable. There should be zero tax on money left to charities. Taxing a business with no base in NZ whose goods are sold here used to be accomplished with import tax. Globalisation has rendered most countries as ‘subsidiaries’ of a regional umbrella group through binding regional trade agreements. Import tax would now isolate us and lock us out of regional trade. Britain reclaimed their right to act independently and we are all waiting to see the outcome. Can Tax Make Housing More Affordable? Yes. The housing crisis is a direct consequence of government policy that focuses on attracting foreign currency into NZ to balance the outflow of NZ dollars overseas. I believe that capital gains tax on the sale of property that is not the family home will help to make housing more affordable. We should no longer allow negative gearing on losses from rental property. And we should consider rent control measures to secure tenancy for long term tenants. What Tax Issues Matter Most to you? Capital Gains Tax on property other than the primary family home and on anything sold for a profit is probably the greatest source of taxable revenue that we have not realised due to political inertia. Capital gains tax will put our tax system more in sync with other nations and should cancel the FIF regulations that created a whole new arbitrary tax category (tax on accrued value or unrealised gain) rather than join the globally community in accepting tax on capital gains.

I support the conclusion of the 2001 (McLeod) Tax Review 1 that reforms should focus on incremental improvements to what we have and that deviations from this approach should only be made where a substantial burden of proof is discharged. I also support the conclusions of both the 2001 and 2010 (VUW) 2 reviews of the tax system that, with respect to taxing capital gains, we should continue with the current practice of including particular capital gains in the income tax base as and when issues arise (as the current government is doing in extending the bright line test). Given that the arguments in favour of maintaining the current broad base, low rate system and against introducing a comprehensive tax on realised capital gains (CGT) are well canvassed in both the previous reviews, there is no need to explore them further here. The only point specific to the current review is that inheritance tax is excluded, so if a CGT is introduced it should allow roll-over relief when assets are passed to the beneficiaries of current asset owners. Rather, this submission addresses the question posed by the Tax Working Group (TWG) on land tax: i.e., “Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have?” The 2001 Tax Review found no justification for a selective wealth tax, like a land tax. A majority of members of the 2010 Review did consider a comprehensive low-rate land tax to be worthy of consideration to fund other revenue changes: i.e., one that applied to all land, including land under the family home. However, excluding the land under the family home undermines both the efficiency and revenue arguments used to support the conclusion of the 2010 Review. It also creates serious additional problems for a land tax, especially given its potential impact on renters. Indeed, an advocate for a land tax who was a member of the 2010 review group concluded that “For a number of reasons (including maintaining the viability of the rental market) it is difficult to see blanket exemption of owner-occupied homes being a viable policy option.” 3 The 2010 Review also identified a number of problems with a land tax that were not fully addressed and overlooked others. These are explored in more detail in this submission. I conclude that New Zealand should not introduce a land tax that excludes land under the family home for the following reasons. First, it lacks a strong justification. The 2001 Review concluded that a selective wealth tax like a land tax is not justifiable in terms of filling any gap in the income or expenditure base and was effectively 1 Tax Review 2001: Final Report 2001 and Issues Paper. This was a government appointed Review. 2 A Tax System for New Zealand’s Future: Report of the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group, Jan 2010. This Review was set up by Victoria University, with tax officials made available to it. 3 Dr Arthur Grimes was a member of the 2010 review group and has supported the idea of a comprehensive land tax. This is a quote from page 45 of Coleman and Grimes, Fiscal, Distributional and Efficiency Impacts of Land and Property Taxes, Motu Working Paper 09-14, Motu Economic and Public Policy Research, September 2009. 2 a double tax on income (the only material gap remains owner-occupied housing). Moreover, excluding land under the family home also undermines the 2010 Review’s justification in terms of efficiency and revenue generating potential. A “substantial burden of proof” in favour of this tax cannot been discharged. Second, it is not fair. It imposes a very large and arbitrary tax on the current owners of land and is not fair in terms of horizontal equity. It is also likely to be regressive, although more work is needed to identify just how regressive. Third, it creates serious cash flow problems for taxpayers that can only be adequately addressed by taxing only the realised gains in value over an initial level: i.e., a CGT on land. Fourth, uncertainly over the durability and design of a land tax will destabilise land prices for some years and lead to a further loss of efficiency. A land tax will be controversial and vulnerable to repeal and, unlike income tax or GST, repeal is feasible. Even if not repealed quickly, future governments are likely to exempt those it considers unfairly impacted, as the current Government has done already with land under the family home. Exemptions erode potential revenue and make ultimate repeal easier. Fifth, local authority valuations are not appropriate for establishing a base for imposing a land tax. Limiting application of the tax to land acquired after legislation is passed would provide a solution to this particular problem. It would also prevent land currently held on trust for descendants, and taonga land, from being alienated to pay land tax. Sixth, a land tax is likely to hold back land development; especially development of agricultural and horticultural land. Land development is likely to be compromised to the extent that a land tax causes an immediate drop in the value of land, requiring cash that could be used for development to be required to reduce debt and restore equity levels. For farmers who are cash constrained, the extra annual tax burden would also reduce the cash available for fertiliser and other investments in productive capacity. Seventh, contrary to the intention of this Government, the land under the family home will end up paying more land tax, albeit in the form of higher rates because the impact of a land tax on local government’s rating base will shift the incidence of the tax. Eight, integrating a land tax with rates and applying the family home exemption adds to both the administrative and compliance burden of a land tax (and further reduces revenue). The latter arises because there are a number of possible definitions of the land area “under” the family home, and because private and business land use can co-exist on the same defined area, even in the same dwelling (e.g., the home office), each with different efficiency and fairness implications. Finally, imposing a new land tax will be seen by many as unfairly retrospective: i.e., that existing landowners were not aware of the potential tax liability when purchasing the property. This could be addressed by limiting application of a land tax to land acquired after legislation is passed. In my view, these considerations should lead the TWG to recommend against the adoption of a land tax that excludes land under the family home. If this is not accepted, then the worst features of a land tax could be reduced to some extent by: exempting home rental, agricultural and forestry land; taxing only the realised gain in value over an initial level; and having a transition that limits application of the tax to land acquired after legislation is passed. That would make the tax less controversial but also less useful in terms of revenue generated. 3 The rest of the submission expands on these nine points. Background: the 2010 Review The 2010 Review noted that most members supported a low-rate land tax applied across all types of land as a revenue raising measure, although they were concerned about the political sustainability of such a tax. In support of this tax they argued that a single rate applied to all land without exception would be efficient, raise significant revenue and, if based on rateable values, be easy to administer. The report argued that a land tax would cause land values to fall by the net present value of the expected future land tax liabilities, which would be a lump sum tax on existing landowners, although they noted that existing landlords may increase rents to cover additional costs. Land tax lacks a strong justification The 2001 Review argues that there can be a case for a selective wealth tax, like a land tax, if some gap in the income (or expenditure) base could be identified that this tax could fill. Otherwise a wealth tax, like a land tax, amounts to double taxation of income. The only material gap remains owner-occupied housing, and extending the base in this way has already been ruled out. There is, therefore, no justification for introducing a land tax on this basis. One of the main reasons the 2010 Review rejected a CGT was the likelihood that owner-occupied housing would be excluded from coverage and yet, when considering a land tax, did not consider that the land under the family home might also be excluded. This exclusion undermines the assumed efficiency and revenue generating advantages of a land tax. In terms of efficiency, this exclusion would advantage land used for owner-occupied housing over land used for other uses, including land used for rental housing. This could have serious consequences, especially for renters who would face increased rents even in the absence of such an exemption. In their quantitative assessment of the Fiscal, Distributional and Efficiency Impacts of Land and Property Taxes Coleman and Grimes model the effect of a property tax with an exemption for owner-occupiers which, “... resulted in the virtual complete collapse of the rental market, as the long term costs of renting exceeded the long term costs of home ownership, We do not consider this result to be just an artefact of the model; in reality, a distortion of this nature could severely impact on renters and could have major welfare consequences.” (p22) They also pointed out that exempting land under owner-occupied houses would reduce land tax base by over 40% and create an incentive to avoid tax by shifting housing land into the owner- occupied category that would be “... perhaps the most difficult dichotomy to police ... .” (p33) In summing up the implications of possible exemptions to a flat land tax, Coleman and Grimes conclude that: ”For a number of reasons (including maintaining the viability of the rental market) it is difficult to see blanket exemption of owner-occupied homes being a viable policy option.” (p45) In terms of revenue potential, the ownership exclusion also undermines the potential revenue generating advantages of a land tax. Coleman and Grimes estimated it would reduce the taxable base by over 40%, similar to the figure that IRD and the Treasury provided to the 2010 Review 4 . 4 Land Tax, Background paper for session 3 of the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group, Sept 2009 4 Extending the exemption to land under rental properties would reduce the land tax base by a further 24%. Official’s advice at the time was that: “The inclusion of the majority of land in the base would be required if a land tax is to be successful.” (p.6) There is no reason to believe that that advice would be any different today. In summary, exempting owner-occupied land from a land tax significantly undermines its efficiency and its revenue generating potential as well as creating real problems for renters. The proposed land tax is not fair, is likely to be regressive and, for some, oppressive Land tax is clearly not fair in terms of horizontal equity and is unlikely to be fair in terms of vertical equity because of the owner-occupier exemption. For many rural land-owners, the quantum of tax would often be seen as oppressive. Land tax is only applied to one form of capital and so disadvantages those who have invested a disproportionate amount of their savings in land, creating serious horizontal equity issues. Land tax mainly impacts those, like farmers and Maori Authorities, who hold most of their wealth in the form of land when other forms of wealth are not taxed. Indeed, a land tax is worse than a CGT in terms of horizontal equity. The housing owner-occupier exemption only exacerbates this horizontal inequality. Moreover, much agricultural land is also “owner-occupied,” which creates different classes of taxpayer even within this narrow category unless owner-occupied farms and other rural holdings were also exempt. For many land-owners, the annual land tax would be oppressive because it would far exceed what unimproved land could produce by way of rental income. This would be the case, for example, with land zoned and used for farming but close enough to a town for values to be inflated by the expectation that zoning changes may eventually allow more profitable uses. In many cases, a land tax would be simply unaffordable and force sales to speculators who can afford to hold the land in the expectation of future zoning changes. The Background Paper notes that we already tax land in this case; if the sale is within 10 years of acquisition and at least 20% of the gain on disposal arises from the zoning change then the whole of the gain is taxable. A land tax would be a poorly targeted way of taxing this particular activity. Better to increase the 10 years to, say, 20 years if the aim is to discourage land-banking speculation and the current law is considered inadequate. This horizontal equity problem can be largely addressed by exempting land intensive activities. This would, however, also substantially reduce the revenue collected. In terms of vertical equity, exempting land under the family home means that a land tax is likely to disproportionately impact renters, who tend to be lower income and have little wealth. The official advice to the 2010 Review noted that a flat rate land tax with no exemptions lead to tax payments that are a fairly constant proportion of income as income rises and that farmers in all deciles would pay more land tax than non-farmers. Owner-occupiers are likely to earn more, and be wealthier, than renters. When owner-occupiers are excluded from land tax and some proportion of the land tax is passed through to renters, a land tax is likely to be regressive. Indeed, Coleman and Grimes calculate that about 43% of households are renters and this proportion falls as income rises: i.e., poorer people are more likely to rent. More starkly, 96% of households in 5 the lowest net worth quartile (and 66% of households in the second lowest quintile) are renters. Moreover, Maori and Pacific families are both strongly represented in the rental category. Land tax creates cash flow problems that are difficult to address Annual payment of land tax raises cash flow problems because it generates immediate tax liabilities that are may not be able to be met from either the income earned from the land (the rental value of the land) or a transaction (sale of the land). This raises similar issues to taxing capital gains on an accruals basis. In terms of an accruals-based CGT the 2010 Review concluded that: “In practice taxing all capital gains on accrual is not feasible (and no country has implemented it) due to such problems as identifying market values for some assets and the cash flow difficulties that arise when accrued capital gains generate immediate tax liabilities but assets yield no immediate (cash flow) returns.” (p.48) Taxing land on accrual suffers from the same problems. The valuation issue is discussed below. The cash flow issue is discussed here. The 2010 group suggested a possible solution to the cash flow issue would be to allow these taxpayers to defer the tax (plus an interest charge) until sale or death; albeit “... most estates that seek deferral will have major liabilities for land tax. There would also be lock-in effects for those in deferred payment schemes, although these could be mitigated with some form of roll-over relief.” (p. 51) Deferring the tax until death would be equivalent to imposing an inheritance tax on land-owners and this has been excluded in the TWG’s terms of reference. Moreover, it does nothing to address the cash flow issue unless the land is actually sold when the landowner dies. Deferring the tax until sale does not necessarily address the cash flow problem because it may well be that the total deferred tax liability is greater than the realised value of the land. 5 It may also force a sale if transfers to descendants trigger the tax because the cumulative tax liability would be prohibitive for many after any substantial period of time. This problem can only be adequately addressed by: a. only taxing the gain on sale over and initial level so there will always be enough value realised to pay the tax; and b. not deem land held in trust for descendants as “sold” as long as it remains held for the benefit of those descendants (even if the entity that holds the land in trust changes because, for example, trusts have limited lives). This latter condition also addresses the question posed by the Background Paper about “...what the appropriate treatment of Maori land might be when it is a taonga asset” because it would prevent land from being alienated to pay for deferred land tax as long as it remained held for the benefit of descendants. It also offers non-Maori who want to hold land in trust for their descendants to enjoy the same protection. Finally, it prevents a deferred land tax becoming an inheritance tax imposed on those who own land. If an objective of policy is to reduce land values and effectively exempt land considered taonga, the easiest way to do that would be via transitional arrangements that only applied a land tax to land 5 For example, in a simple case of no growth in land values, a 1% land tax and a 4% annual interest charge would mean that the cumulated tax liability would consume the total value of the land after just 40 years. 6 acquired after the legislation was passed. That would also mean descendants would not have a crippling differed tax liability hanging over their heads and may well enhance political sustainability. Doubts over political sustainability will create costly uncertainty and instability The durability and design of a land tax is unlikely to be stable in the face of changes in government and this instability is itself costly. The 2010 Review acknowledged this inherent weakness when it noted, with respect to a land tax, that: “... there are concerns over the political sustainability of such a tax.” (p 67) The problem arises because a land tax is hard to justify, will be seen as unfair by a number of groups and possibly the wider population, and falls disproportionately on people with a concentrated interest in seeking exemptions. There will be votes in repealing the tax and, unlike GST or income tax, such a repeal is feasible. Even if not repealed quickly, future governments are likely to exempt those it considers unfairly impacted, as the current Government has done already with land under the family home. Exemptions for one group are likely to create pressure to exempt others, eroding potential revenue and making ultimate repeal easier. A land tax is unlikely to be durable in anything other than a form that would yield little revenue. Uncertainty over durability and design will be costly. In their advice to the 2010 group, officials noted that there would be strong pressure on future governments to exempt or lower rates for certain groups or sectors. They argued that this uncertainty can lead to a loss of efficiency, when investment decisions are delayed or not made on the basis of their current rate of return but uncertainty about future rates of return. Moreover, if land tax in some form ultimately becomes accepted, the risk that future governments might increase the rate would discourage people from investing in land-intensive ventures. This instability is likely to create significant volatility in land prices over time. A land tax will cause land values to fall by the net present value of the expected future land tax liabilities. The expectations of future tax liabilities will, in turn, depend on what changes people expect future governments to make. Given the magnitude of the net present value of land tax, even at very low rates, quite reasonable changes in expectation will drive considerable volatility in land values, at least until durability and design issues are no longer controversial. Given the newness of a land tax, the likely controversy around its introduction, and the initial pressure for relief from highly impacted groups, it is likely to be some years for this to occur. It may well be, for example, that people initially expect the tax to be short-lived, or that exemptions will be extended, and so land values may not fall as far as initially predicted. If the tax is repealed or significantly amended, land values will rise again. If not, then it is likely that the balance of risk will be for future governments to be tempted to raise tax rates or tighten exemptions (e.g., remove the exemption for land under the family home). This quite reasonable evolution in expectations would see land values driven as much by expectations of future policy changes as by any other factor. Valuation is difficult and using Local Authority land valuation to set land values is not appropriate Unless land is sold by willing sellers to willing buyers, valuation has to be established by some other process and is inherently and inevitably an arguable matter. Someone has to then determine the tax base for a land tax in a way that is not true for any other significant tax. It would not be surprising if 7 the results were perceived by taxpayers as unfair and arbitrary, especially given the potentially large and unpredictable impact that imposition of a land tax would have on land values. The Background Paper notes that “A land tax is generally regarded as having low administration and compliance costs given the existence of local authority land valuation systems for imposing rates.”(p.48) Local authority valuations are not appropriate for establishing a base for imposing a land tax. These valuations value land by taking observed recent property sales in the area (i.e., land plus improvements) and adjusting for a number of factors to try and identify “like” properties and also adjusting for improvements. Each of these steps requires judgment and estimation that is subject to error. This error is likely to be larger outside city locations with fewer transactions available to make like comparisons. This error does not matter a great deal when valuations are only used to assess the share of rates that are paid by different landowners (so, for example, land that increases by the average rate should only see their rates increase by the increased expenditure of their local authority). They would matter a great deal if rates increased or decreased by the amount of any change in property values and established a taxable base (as would be the case with a land tax). Indeed, Auckland Council makes a point on their website of saying that “Council valuations do not reflect your property’s market value and should not be used for insurance or mortgage purposes.” Moreover, the value of “recent sales” before the imposition of a land tax will be an overestimate because the land tax will have an immediate negative impact on land values. This is unlikely to be either easy to estimate or a one-off reduction in value because, as noted above, expectations of the durability and design of a land tax are likely to drive significant volatility in land values for a number of years. There are a number of possible ways to address this valuation issue. The easiest and most credible would be to limit application of the tax to land acquired after the legislation was passed. This would mean that the valuation of each piece of land was at least based on a real market price. A more complicated alternative would be to capitalise the value of rental income from unimproved land and gradually increase the tax rate to the target rate over time. This makes it obvious that a land tax is an additional income tax. It should be more stable than sale values because unimproved rental value will be a proportion of what the land can produce, which is less subject to the volatility created by a land tax. It would address the cash flow problem, as long as a low rate land tax was deductible from income tax and combined with a tax credit for rates, so the total tax burden on income produced from land is not out of step with other income tax rates. However, unless there was a reasonable history of rental income the proportion of total income deemed to be attributed to land rental would require estimation and so suffer from error and, therefore, still be perceived by some as arbitrary. It would also add to administrative complexity and compliance burden. Land tax is likely to undermine investment in increasing land productivity A land tax is likely to hold back land development; especially development of agricultural and horticultural land. If the tax was considered durable there will be an immediate drop in land values equivalent to the net present value of the tax, conservatively estimated by officials in 2010 to be about 16% of the land value. In this case, borrowers would then have to inject more equity to make up at least some of this loss in order to stay compliant with their banking covenants. 8 Land development typically requires significant leverage, so money that would otherwise be used for development would have to be diverted to debt reduction. Given the increased volatility in land values created by a land tax, Banks may require more of a buffer in future rural lending. Other forms of development financing, like sale and lease back agreements, would not be immune because financiers typically require a minimum return and are likely to pass the burden of land tax back to the leasee. It is also possible that farmers would react to the extra annual cash drain by cutting back on fertiliser and other investments in productive capacity, just because they are cash constrained and, with the reduction in equity, unable to borrow to ease that constraint. Land under the family home will pay more land tax, albeit in the form of increased rates The likely impact of land tax on the rates base will shift the incidence of land tax and mean that, contrary to government’s intention and at least the spirit of the TWG’s terms of reference, the land under the family home will end up paying more land tax, albeit in the form of higher rates. Land values determine the share of any given local government expenditure that is born by different rate-payers. Assuming the land tax is considered durable, there is a large reduction in the value of all land other than that under the family home. Inevitably, land under the family home will have to pay a larger share of that unaltered local government expenditure. Integrating with rates and applying the family home exemption adds administrative complexity and compliance burden Land tax needs to be integrated with local body rates. Removing double tax from this source requires that, for those subject to the tax, rates be treated as a tax credit, rather than a deduction. This adds a measure of complexity and further reduces the revenue generated by a land tax. Exempting land under the family home adds administrative complexity, especially if rural, urban, business and mixed-use landowners are to be treated equally in terms of the defining the scope of land “under the family home”. The issue arises because of there are a number of possible definitions of the land area “under” the family home and because private and business land use can co-exist on the same defined area. In the interests of fairness, you would want to treat urban and rural owner-occupiers in the same way. You would also not want to disadvantage owners of businesses on a separate title relative to owners of businesses that shared a title with the family home. You would also want to treat family homes that are owned by family trusts and occupied by the beneficiaries in the same way as family homes that are owned by the people living in them. The simplest solution to defining an area under the home would be to exempt all of the land on the title on which the family home is located and not differentiate between private and business use. However, this will disadvantage businesses on a separate title and encourage people to shift more of their business activities onto titles shared by the family home (and enlarge these titles to enable that outcome). This distortionary impact would be reduced by taking the announced policy literally and just exempting the area immediately under the building that is the family home (while not exempting a business that is an extension of this building or on a lower floor). While there would be an incentive to do more business from within this building, the scope for this is relatively limited. However, it is also likely to be the most costly in administrative and compliance terms because all home owner 9 occupiers would need to define the area under the home and pay land tax on the remainder of the title. Alternatively, IRD recognises the idea of “curtilage” which refers to land under the dwelling and surrounding the dwelling (which, if not fenced, has to be estimated) and that is used for private purposes. The exemption could be defined on this basis. Exempting the area defined as curtilage would eliminate compliance costs for most urban owner occupiers whose curtilage area is well defined and only used for private purposes. However, it would still be administratively complex and add to the compliance burden of everyone else, so it would be less equitable in terms of the impact of the tax and associated compliance burden than the narrower definition discussed above. The size of the area “surrounding the dwelling” depends on each case. The fact that this definition has been subject to a number of court cases demonstrates that it is not a straightforward matter. Defining what is “for private use” arises when the curtilage has both private and business uses is also complex. This is illustrated by the rules IRD has had to develop to address this problem in the administration of income tax and GST. While rules for differentiating between private and business land use may be simpler, this is yet to be tested (e.g., treatment of land under the “home office”). Whatever definition is used to apply the family home exemption creates compliance and administrative costs, each with different efficiency and fairness implications. Imposing a land tax on current landowners will be seen by many as unfairly retrospective Many will see the imposition of a land tax on current landowners as unfair because they were not aware of the potential tax liability when purchasing the property. This could be addressed by limiting application of a land tax to land acquired after legislation is passed. Conclusion A land tax with an exemption for land under the family home lacks a strong rationale and creates so many practical problems that it would be very controversial and, therefore, unlikely to be durable in anything other than a form that would yield little revenue. If specific types of land transactions are considered socially harmful, then better to clearly identify the harm and target this directly with a capital gains tax on sale (as is currently done to discourage speculation in land in the expectation on future changes in zoning). In my view, the TWG should recommend against adoption of a land tax that excludes land under the family home.
Tax Working Group Public Submissions Information Release Release Document September 2018 taxworkingroup.govt.nz/key-documents Key to sections of the Official Information Act 1982 under which information has been withheld. Certain information in this document has been withheld under one or more of the following sections of the Official Information Act, as applicable: \[1\] 9(2)(a) - to protect the privacy of natural persons, including deceased people; \[2\] 9(2)(k) - to prevent the disclosure of official information for improper gain or improper advantage. Where information has been withheld, a numbered reference to the applicable section of the Official Information Act has been made, as listed above. For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 23/4/2018 Submission to Tax Working Group I would like to see some research & modeling put into an Automated Payment Transaction Tax (APTT) as the main source of taxation along with a comprehensive Land Value Tax (LVT) - The current tax system is very complicated and open to manipulation by those with high net worth who can afford the right accountants and lawyers - There are differences in how tax is captured and avoided by local businesses and foreign owned businesses. GST and Company Tax does not result in a level playing field for online trading or revenue shifting by corporates to low taxation jurisdictions - Property has significant taxation advantages over other forms of income that has seriously distorted the investment profile of New Zealanders. - An APTT is essentially a turnover tax levied in real time, through the computerised banking system, on every transaction in and out of a given account. It does not apply to transfers between an individual’s, company’s or trust’s accounts within New Zealand but does apply to transfers offshore eg Apple NZ - Apple Ireland and from one related entity to another eg company - trust – individual or company - subsidiary - A Land Value Tax (LVT) would be an annual levy on the underlying value of land of a significant enough percentage to make short term speculation in property unviable and long term land banking not without financial or opportunity cost. There is the opportunity to do away with local body rates, residential & commercial and instead fund local government with a share of the LVT - An LVT would become difficult for retired people on low incomes. If they were so assessed, they could pay a smaller percentage with the rest commuted at zero interest to be paid from their estate or until the next sale of the property - These two taxes would not preclude other smaller taxes to change societal behaviour in a desired fashion ie excise taxes on alcohol, tobacco, fuel & possible dietary incentives like a sugar tax. There is also plenty of room for environmental/pollution taxes to incentivise changes in individual and company behaviour in line with global warming & biodiversity targets - An APTT & LVT would be virtually unavoidable and would tax the transactions and proceeds of the considerable black market and “cash under the table” transactions. Foreign & domestic companies would be on a level playing field with backyard operators - There would be significant reductions in time and money for businesses and individuals to manage their tax affairs Tax policy in New Zealand seems to be a perpetual game of fiddle and tweak by the two major parties, with one unintended consequence after another as various forms of income are taxed at different rates (or not at all). As Gareth Morgan and Susan Guthrie pointed out in the Big Kahuna, many of the nation’s wealthiest people minimise their income tax and pay little to no tax on their financial assets, especially property. They are free to move their wealth from asset class to asset class as tax policy changes, aided and abetted by a cadre of lawyers and accountants. Meanwhile the middle class salary and wage earner is bound by PAYE that is difficult to avoid, hence the popularity of negative gearing on property and offsetting income against mortgages on properties subject to tax free capital growth. The 20th century was a story of increasing income and consumption taxes and decreasing property, inheritance and import taxes. This has been accompanied by a range of tax breaks, exemptions and deductions that change on a regular basis and often require an accountant to administer. Who gets these breaks is often determined by political influence and lobbying and creates further distortions. The Automated Payment Transaction Tax (APTT) offers the possibility of a broad based, nearly unavoidable form of revenue raising, with a low rate. It is progressive in as much as it affects the wealthy more than the poor despite its flat rate. In effect it is a turnover tax, levied against every credit and debit from a given bank account, collected by the computerised payments system of the banks in real time. All existing deductions, breaks and current personal income, corporate and consumption taxes would be dispensed with. No one need file a tax return again. No company would require an accountant for tax, only business planning. Other taxes to encourage or discourage particular behaviour like drinking, smoking, fuel consumption etc could still be levied but they would not be deductible expenses. A business either makes a profit, which its shareholders keep; or it makes a loss. No paper losses carried from one year to the next offsetting future profits. It would perform the role of stamp duty, capital gains tax, payroll tax, Financial Transaction Tax, inheritance tax, sales tax, import and export duty, Resident Withholding Tax.....The wealthy who move their money around a bewildering array of personal, company and trust accounts would have their money clipped at each step. Move it offshore – it gets clipped. Move it back – it gets clipped. Buy or sell shares – it gets clipped. Buy or sell property – it gets clipped. Inherit your parents estate – it gets clipped. Give your children some money – it gets clipped. Its biggest threat is cash and barter. Barter can be discounted as inefficient and unpopular. Not to say it wouldn’t happen, just that it is unlikely to be significant. Cash would be more of an issue as it could circulate without being picked up electronically. However it does not do this indefinitely. It was estimated in the US that cash was used for payment 2.5 times before returning to a bank. A higher rate of tax could be applied to cash withdrawls and deposits to compensate and discourage the cash economy. Alternatively, New Zealand is particularly well placed to become a cashless society with its very high adoption of EFT-POS and online banking services. This would make an APTT completely unavoidable and capture the black market economy, which is significant, raising more revenue and reducing criminal laundering opportunities. It also gives backyard operators, who currently do not pay company tax or GST, no advantage over legitimate businesses. Another possible threat would be alternative electronic currencies like Bit Coin or unofficial local currencies. Local currencies have the same inflexibility and acceptance issues of barter. Non official electronic currencies could be banned as they have been in several countries already. An APTT also neatly gets around the issue governments and local retailers have with online sales. Unlike GST, the tax would be payable on all online transactions creating a level playing field for foreign and local retailers. Credit card transactions would be taxed along with all other forms of payment. Indeed given the local retailer is no longer subject to income or company tax, they may well have a cost advantage over their foreign competitor, which they can pass on to their customer, use to improve profitability or reinvest. There would also be a significant reduction in time and money spent on tax compliance and collection, at an individual, business and bureaucratic level. Remember no tax returns. The financial sector would hate an APTT and predict Armageddon, as they are wont to do when their money making ability is threatened. Without a doubt many short term currency and share transactions would be unprofitable and liquidity, the number of transactions, would decrease, also reducing the APTT’s potential take (the APTT rate would reflect this). Perhaps it would increase price volatility as the trader’s claim. So what? Maybe the NZD would adjust to something more akin to its fundamental value based on trade and long term investment rather than its speculative value based on sentiment and momentum. Anyone who has seen the NZD crash because of a global panic can hardly say liquidity provides stability, especially when it’s most needed. In fact the opposite is true as all the hot money runs for the exit at once. Banks and foreign investors would have to look for long term opportunities to build value rather than short term speculation. Remember they would have no corporate tax to worry about, a big plus to long term investors. The APTT would clip their money coming in and leaving, regardless of whether they made a profit or loss and there would be no deductions to claim. This would create a level playing field between industries as well as within them. Multinational companies that arrange their operations so that they pay little local tax would have their money flows taxed as they left the country, whether they made a paper profit or loss. Ditto foreign property owners. It is hard to say how an APTT would affect the attractiveness of New Zealand to Foreign Direct Investment. Investors would have to make long term judgements weighing up the new unavoidable APTT, payable win or lose, against the prospect of no personal or company taxes but with no tax deductions to be claimed. Speculators would probably look elsewhere for places to inject their hot money. Good. As US economics professor Edgar Feige put it; The APTT tax reform would create winners and losers – but along lines that most people would find desirable. The greatest beneficiaries will be those whose current level of taxes are considerably reduced, primarily wage and salary earners with modest assets. Those most likely to perceive themselves as losers are individuals and financial institutions that make markets for assets, along with those who sell advice on how to minimize taxes under the current opaque system. A LVT is an old concept advocated by Adam Smith and David Riccardo but most famously by American economist Henry George in the nineteenth century. Its central tenet is that landowners unfairly reap the capital gains of improvements made from the public purse. Winston Churchill succinctly said in a speech to parliament in 1909; “Roads are made, streets are made, services are improved, electric light turns night into day, water is brought from reservoirs a hundred miles off in the mountains - and all the while the landlord sits still. Every one of those improvements is effected by the labour and cost of other people and the taxpayers. To not one of those improvements does the land monopolist, as a land monopolist, contribute, and yet by every one of them the value of his land is enhanced. He renders no service to the community, he contributes nothing to the general welfare, he contributes nothing to the process from which his own enrichment is derived.” While in some respects capital gains from property has since been spread into the middle class and created a vociferous group of property owners who will be deeply concerned about potential flow on effects and reductions in their property value, the stick of LVT has to be weighed against the carrot of removing other taxes and replacing with a low APPT. The distortions to the economy that over investment/speculation in property has are widely acknowledged as exacerbating inequality and holding back investment in productive businesses. Making financial speculation in land more difficult and reducing property prices over time will be resisted but supported by just as many. As a former SME owner who derived a high income from my business but gained less from its sale after 8 years of very long hours and employing dozens of people than my central Auckland home made in capital gains with no improvements, it discourages me that the current system provides little incentive for risky business ventures over seemingly guaranteed property investment/speculation. Just as significant as unearned gains from public improvements and rezoning, is the inflationary effect of bank credit creation for mortgages. A LVT by putting downward pressure on property values would make banks less cavalier with their lending. You cannot reduce the inequality stemming from home ownership or its unaffordability for many and regard house price increases (inflation) as “good”. They are incompatible. On a broader level there needs to be greater recognition of Modern Monetary Theory. Even the Background Paper of this working group refers to tax as funding spending when this is logically not the case. Governments are able to spend without debt or a pool of tax receipts. MMT clearly holds that taxation is there to control inflation and mitigate the effects of income inequality, not to enable subsequent spending. It is spend then tax, not tax and spend. New Zealand with a free floating sovereign currency, the Government being its only issuer, is not like a household or business, and can never run out of money. The RBNZ as the government’s bank can create reserves at will. Government Bonds traded in Open Market Operations are there to help meet interest rate targets, not to fund spending. As long as they are denominated or hedged in NZD the government can never be forced to default. Once these things are acknowledged, taxation & spending decisions become political issues rather than fiscal ones. Likewise the narrative around deficits being “bad” and surpluses being “good” is ill founded. If the government runs a surplus, for the economy not to retract, the private sector must increase debt from the financial sector and/or the country run a trade/current account surplus. If government debt is not really debt but instead a swap of reserves for interest paying bonds; and taxation is to mitigate inflation and redistribute wealth not a source of income; the entire orthodox conversation around tax and government spending priorities, the RBNZ’s inflation targeting with interest rates & NAIRU, is intellectually and morally dishonest. The mainstream narrative enables people to claim there is not “enough money” for health, education, housing, true full employment etc when this is demonstrably not the case. Excessive government spending via the RBNZ creating reserves can certainly create inflation if there are not enough resources to meet demand or if taxation policies leave too much money in the wrong sectors of the economy but that is different to claiming tax receipts are a prerequisite to fund spending on social priorities. Make an argument for lower government spending on ideological grounds by all means but don’t use fiscal constraint as an excuse Stephen Keys \[1\]

Michael Szabo, Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 Email: submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz 24th April 2018 Re: Submission to Tax Working Group Introduction Taxation is central to democracy and the social contract that binds the people of New Zealand together. It is how we pay for the services of our welfare state and the infrastructure that continues to make modern life possible, from primary production to the cultural industries. It is also a democratic mechanism for redistributing wealth through poverty alleviation policies, affordable housing and healthcare in all parts of the country, effective action on climate change, and the conservation of New Zealand’s unique endemic species, habitats and ecosystems which our tourism sector relies on. I welcome the chance to make a submission to the Tax Working Group as a timely opportunity to recommend improvements in the way taxation and fiscal policies work, especially in relation to the environment. Climate Change The serious power line damage and subsequent power outages in Auckland that reportedly affected 190,000 households and businesses in April 2018 were costly, both to those directly affected and the wider economy. This is one of the many ways that the costs of climate change are not adequately factored into our economy and therefore distort it. This can be addressed effectively through carbon pricing, which in turn needs to \[1\] be addressed in a review of the Emissions Trading System (ETS) that the previous Labour-led Government first set up ten years ago. I favour setting a carbon price through the ETS that genuinely reflects the on-going costs of climate change. I would also urge that the Tax Working Group recommends government (through an ETS review) move to immediately extend the ETS to include agriculture, immediately introduce a cap on emissions, immediately remove the cap on carbon pricing and immediately increase the price of emissions units (and rapidly speed-up the phase-out of free units). There are other aspects of taxation and related fiscal policies that can be used to further address climate change. I urge that the Tax Working Group recommends government increase the home insulation grant from 50% of the cost of insulation to 75% of the cost for households that meet the eligibility criteria, to be paid for out of general taxation. This will have beneficial effects on carbon emissions and heating costs, as well as public health – especially children. I also urge that the Tax Working Group recommends government establish a solar credits scheme paid for out of general taxation that is designed to encourage the installation of solar panels on homes, community use buildings, and play centres, schools and tertiary education institutions as an incentive to increase the uptake of solar power in New Zealand. These credits could be linked to the amount of electricity produced by each installation. The bigger the installation, the greater the credit paid towards the installation from a government- administered fund. Fossil fuel subsidies Although the previous National-led Government publicly called for a global phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies, independent research shows that such subsidies rose in New Zealand over the past nine years. Trade Minister David Parker recently co-hosted an event at a World Trade Organisation meeting in Buenos Aires, at which he also called for a global phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies. Researcher Terrence Loomis of the Fossil Fuels Aotearoa Research Network (FFARN) states that the value of taxpayer-funded subsidies in New Zealand to the oil and gas industry between 2009 and 2016 more than doubled from $41 million to $88 million. According to Loomis, subsidies ranged from tax exemptions for drilling rigs and seismic ships, tax deductions for petroleum mining costs, and reduced petrol prices for sectors such as agriculture, forestry and fishing. Also contributing to his total were the costs of geotechnical research provided to the petroleum industry for free, and sponsorship and attendance at conferences. "Most energy experts and government policy advisers now accept the OECD and \[International Energy Agency\] definitions of subsidies as any government action that lowers the cost of energy exploration and production, raises the price received by energy producers, or lowers the price paid by energy consumers," Loomis’ report states. Loomis says that the New Zealand Government stopped measuring the estimated lost revenue from subsidies in 2013, so calculations for the 2016-17 financial year were based on estimates or OECD data. "You can't get it from Statistics NZ, you can't get it from the Treasury, so we've had to go for estimates." Listed in the research was $3.5m in subsidised funding for petroleum industry-related research and development during 2016-17. Clearly, when Government provides things of value for free, it is a subsidy. Source: https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/climate- news/100005999/government-calls-for-end-of-fossil-fuel-subsidies- globally-but-what-are-the-plans-to-end-them-here For too long now, the New Zealand Government has poured public money into subsidies for the oil and gas industry, while at the same time it has ignored clean energy investment. On 20 March 2016, Green MP Gareth Hughes said, “The latest oil and gas subsidy follows the $237,000 National spent wining and dining industry executives, $850,000 spent on an industry conference, $94 million of tax breaks from 2008-2013, and an overall almost 600 percent increase in government spending to assist oil and gas exploration under National.” “Oil and gas is obviously a failed strategy when globally we saw USD$100 billion more invested in clean energy than in fossil fuels last year, according to Bloomberg. We are going in the wrong direction. New Zealand made a commitment to reduce climate pollution last year at Paris, but the Government is doing the opposite by encouraging more fossil fuel exploration.” The previous National-led Government was heavily engaged in subsidising fossil fuel industries, effectively undoing much of the spending that it committed to Pacific Islands facing sea level rise and more extreme cyclones and storms. Much of the subsidisation has been in the form of tax relief – ie, the “motor spirits excise duty refund” and tax deductions for petroleum mining. The New Zealand Government also lends support in the form of research and development, and acquisition of exploration data, which amounted to over $6 million in subsidies in 2012–13. It is unclear whether that subsidisation is in addition to the money funnelled into New Zealand’s Energy and Mineral Research Fund. In 2015, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) announced $12 million in funding over four years for the following projects: GNS Science – Understanding petroleum source rocks, fluids, and plumbing systems in New Zealand basins: a critical basis for future oil and gas ‘discoveries’. $9.6 million University of Waikato – Cretaceous tectonic transition from convergence to extension in New Zealand: Implications for basin development and hydrocarbon plays. $2.4 million The only reason such research funding exists is because the government wants to promote oil and gas exploration in New Zealand and is willing to subsidise the R&D costs of the industry developing its business here. In recent weeks, a controversial proposed waste ‘incineration’ scheme has been the subject of media scrutiny. A $350,000 grant from the Provincial Growth Fund was awarded to a feasibility study of a proposed ‘waste-to-energy incinerator’ scheme on the West Coast at Buller which proposes to use coal as a baseline fuel for the incinerator, according to a 2016 study issued by MBIE: "The rationale for establishing the \[waste incineration\] facility in Buller is to have ready access to waste coal, which will help to ensure minimum energy levels are generated." Source: http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/regions- cities/regional-economic-development/pdf-image-library/tai-poutini-west- coast-growth-opportunities-report.pdf The payment of this grant has been suspended until the results are known of an investigation into the promoters of the scheme. If the grant were to be awarded, it would represent a sizeable subsidy to a ‘Think Big’-type scheme that involves the burning of more coal and more carbon emissions at a time when the Labour-led Government is publicly committed to reducing carbon emissions and a transition to a zero- carbon economy. Removing the distorting tax breaks that fossil fuels currently receive now has mainstream support. The NZ Herald published its editorial on the matter, “Tax breaks for oil companies not good look”, on 4/12/15: http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c\_id=3&objectid=1 1555502 The editorial stated: “Some people think New Zealand was unwise to strip itself of industry protection before asking this of others in free trade negotiations. Some of the same people are criticising the Government for calling on others at the Paris climate conference to abandon fossil fuel subsidies when we still provide tax breaks for oil and gas exploration here. They were wrong before; they are right this time. Industries that need protection or tax concessions are unlikely to make the economy stronger. We should do away with these distortions, regardless of whether other countries do.” I urge that the Tax Working Group recommends government end all public subsidies for fossil fuels, including R&D projects and waste incineration schemes, and instead direct funds into promoting and supporting energy efficiency and bona fide renewable energy sources (ie, wind, solar, geothermal, wave, biomass and micro hydro, but not coal-fired or gas-fired energy sources or waste incineration). Wastes and contaminated sites As the incineration example highlights, carbon emissions and waste are two sides of the same coin. Burning household waste is inefficient and polluting and would increase carbon emissions. It takes more energy to replace the resources that go up in smoke, and it would save more energy and more emissions to compost, reuse and/or recycle those resources contained in the waste stream in the first place. For example, plastic bottles and aluminium cans are suitable for reuse and recycling. The most effective way to ensure that this happens would be through the establishment of a nationwide Deposit-Return Scheme (DRS). I urge that the Tax Working Group recommends government legislate the establishment of a plastic bottle and aluminium can Deposit-Return Scheme based on the successful schemes operated in 40 countries, including five Australian and Canadian states (New South Wales, South Australia, Northern Territory, British Columbia, Nova Scotia). A DRS would help avoid plastic bottle and aluminium can pollution/litter and create a fiscal incentive for individuals, councils, private waste operators and companies to collect and recycle them. Any revenues raised by central government through a DRS could be used to help fund the establishment of new bona fide recycling facilities (or improvements to existing ones) by councils. England and Scotland are also in the process of establishing a plastic bottle and aluminium can DRS: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/27/bottle-and-can- deposit-return-scheme-gets-green-light-in-england Another mechanism to save energy, reduce waste and reduce carbon emissions is the Waste Disposal Levy, which is currently set at $10 per tonne (excluding GST) on all waste sent to landfill. The $10 levy was introduced ten years ago under the Waste Minimisation Act 2008, but over the past ten years the relative value of the levy has declined. I urge that the Tax Working Group recommends the levy be increased immediately by 10% to restore its relative value and the amount raised. A report released in April 2018 by the Ministry for the Environment, “Our Land 2018”, shows that the overall extent of land contamination is unknown, but that 19,568 sites have been confirmed as contaminated: https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/355689/report-unable-to- assess-overall-extent-of-land-contamination The report acknowledges that this is not the total number of contaminated sites, so the list is incomplete, which means more public resources will be required to identify the rest. Only 10 contaminated sites have been prioritised to receive remediation funding from the Contaminated Sites Remediation Fund (CSRF) administered by the Ministry for the Environment. I urge that the Tax Working Group recommends an immediate significant increase in the amount available through the Contaminated Sites Remediation Fund so that more contaminated sites can be cleaned-up. I also urge that the Tax Working Group recommends the establishment of a hazardous substances levy to be paid by businesses with activities that appear on the Ministry for the Environment Hazardous Activities and Industries List (HAIL): http://www.mfe.govt.nz/land/hazardous-activities-and-industries-list-hail The revenues from this levy could then be used to establish a nationwide hazardous substances tracking system to be administered by the Ministry for the Environment. This would allow the manufacture, import, use and disposal of hazardous substances to be tracked, and improve the identification of potentially contaminated sites. If such a system had been established in the mid-1990s when the Minister for the Environment was advised to do so by members of the ministry’s Hazardous Waste Advisory Group, there would already be an accurate database of hazardous substance use and disposal, a comprehensive database of potentially contaminated sites, and significantly more funds would have been made available for the clean- up of ‘orphaned’ contaminated sites. Over the intervening decades, government agencies, the community and the environment have borne the costs of contamination and a large part of the clean-up costs. The businesses that profit from the use of hazardous substances should pay towards the cost of regulation and contaminated site clean-up. A related matter is the way that revenues raised from such levies are spent. They were designed to raise revenue and to phase-out pollution/contamination problems. It is vital that the revenues raised from such levies be used to fund the transition to clean alternatives and the retraining of people that work in the affected sectors, such as the fossil fuels sector (to clean energy), agricultural chemicals sector (to the pharmaceuticals sector) and the pulp and paper industry (to totally chlorine-free and totally effluent-free clean production). It is important not to use the revenues from hazardous substance/waste/pollution levies as part of the general tax-take pool. They should be targeted to solve the issues that they are intended to address. It would be a mistake to view revenues from such levies simply as a narrowly utilitarian mechanism to reduce income tax. If that were to happen, then as revenue falls as the economy and society shifts to a zero-carbon and zero-waste footing, total tax revenues are likely to shrink commensurately. Fisheries and tourism I also favour immediately increasing by 10% the Fisheries and Conservation Services Levy on the commercial fishing industry to pay for more research into the effects of commercial fishing on fish stocks, non-target marine species, and marine ecosystems. Regarding a ‘tourism’ levy or tax, I do not believe that one should be levied on New Zealand citizens/residents because we already pay for tourism infrastructure though income tax. Instead, I would favour a modest flat-rate tourism levy or tax being levied on visitors from overseas, valid for one year from the date it is paid for. New Zealand as a ‘tax haven’ Regarding New Zealand as a ‘tax haven’, I strongly support an end to allowing offshore Foreign Trust ‘tax haven’ entities to operate in New Zealand. The previous National-led Government failed to take effective action on this issue when they appointed John Shewen to review the relevant rules. He was not a suitable person for the role because of his close involvement with previous high-profile tax cases. He had previously reportedly advised the Bahamas Government to zero-rate financial services to "protect the so-called offshore industry”. In effect, he “advised a tax haven on how to protect its offshore financial services industry and maintain its tax haven status.” New Zealand should not be used as a tax haven by Foreign Trusts in any way and I would also support stopping large multinational corporations gaming the tax system here and overseas in order to avoid paying their fair share of taxes in New Zealand. As Matt Nippert noted in the NZ Herald (20 June 2017): “A major Herald investigation has found the 20 multinational companies most aggressive in shifting profits out of New Zealand overall paid virtually no income tax, despite recording nearly $10 billion in annual sales to Kiwi consumers.” “The analysis of financial information of more than 100 multinational corporations and their New Zealand subsidiaries showed that, had the New Zealand branches of these 20 firms reported profits at the same healthy rate as their parents, their combined income tax bill would have been nearly $490 million.” Source: http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c\_id=3&objectid=1 1607336 On 19 April 2018, RNZ broadcast the results of an investigation into an Auckland company that, “may be caught up in an international money laundering controversy after it was identified helping to manage a network of New Zealand-registered companies and trusts for its secret clients.” According to the broadcast, sources claimed that this network led back to the Azerbaijan Government, which has been accused of corruption and money laundering: Source: https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/world/355443/the-daphne- project-new-zealand-still-a-haven-for-some These examples highlight the need for more effective regulation in this area. I urge that the Tax Working Group recommends government take prompt action to more effectively regulate these activities in order to stop New Zealand being used as an offshore tax haven by Foreign Trusts and to ensure that multinational corporations and their subsidiaries operating in New Zealand are no longer able to game the tax system in order to avoid paying their fair share of taxes in New Zealand. The future of tax I support investing a greater proportion of total tax revenues in the transition to a zero-carbon economy, climate change research and mitigation, fisheries and marine ecosystem research, public transport, clean energy generation, environmental research and protection (especially New Zealand’s unique endemic species), conservation, and conservation-related research. I urge that the Tax Working Group recommends the immediate removal of income tax on the lowest earners, earning less than $20,000 per year, in order to both help alleviate poverty and to save the State from having to expend resources collecting and monitoring the relatively small proportion of overall tax revenues that this group pays. I also urge that the Tax Working Group recommends the rate of income tax be increased on the highest band of income earners and the highest earning companies in future, in order to increase public funding of social welfare, poverty alleviation, the public health and public education systems, public transport, conservation, environmental protection, and action on climate change. I also support removing the tax cuts that were made in 2009 and incrementally increasing the top tax rate by 3% per annum for the subsequent three years. I also urge that the Tax Working Group recommends the immediate introduction of a financial transaction tax or Robin Hood tax, with the revenues raised also to be used to increase those same areas of spending listed above. A Robin Hood Tax is a tiny tax of 0.05% levied on the financial sector annually on transactions like stocks, bonds, foreign currency and derivatives. This is small change for the financial institutions but would make a big difference. Financial transaction taxes are well-tested, cheap to implement, and hard to avoid. There are already lots of different Robin Hood taxes implemented by many countries, including in the UK. There should be more of them, particularly in areas not yet taxed, such as transactions of bonds and derivatives. Importantly, transaction taxes are also good because they reduce the number of the riskiest trades, the sort of stock market gambling which helped to trigger the 2008 global financial crisis. Thank you for considering this submission. Yours Sincerely, Michael Szabo \[1\]

The Future of Tax A submission to the Tax Working Group, April 2018. By Kerry Bevin B.Ed. Dip. Tching. \[1\] Introduction As financial transactions globalise, small nations struggle to gather revenue fairly and equitably for necessary development. Several strategic considerations mean significant changes tax management are required to deliver a sustainable and secure life for Kiwis. Long term goal setting is delusional. Clear medium term setting and vision must be tied to 3 yearly governmental cycles. Firstly Our tax take is too low. Compared to other progressive regimes, more revenue is required to sustain first world standards. Infrastructure, social services education, health, defence, recreation and financial processes never have sufficient development funds. Our society is held together by an army of volunteer organisations and charities. Expecting so many to work for nothing is unfair and exploitative. This position is untenable into the future. The overall tax take must increase an estimated 10% or more. Secondly Our tax administration is too complex. Too many economists, accountants, assessors and advisers are required to monitor and process finances effectively for taxpayers. Financial relativities and settings are debated and changed in budgets by changing governments. Taxpayers require simplicity and consistency to plan and enable their working and domestic lives. Workers are happy to pay if it is perceived as fair and manageable. Businesses too often attempt to manipulate information for avoidance and profit. Tax administration needs much greater simplicity for direct accountability. Thirdly Taxpayers are increasingly using card systems ‘plastic money.’ A cashless society with plastic funds makes monitoring cash flows easier through systems authorised by banks and supervised by the Reserve Bank. Cash no longer needs to be legal tender making transactions traceable, accountable and enforceable. ‘Black market’ funds will be difficult to manage. International companies will be taxable in the country of transaction i.e. New Zealand. A cashless society makes revenue gathering accurate and easier to monitor. Fourthly These considerations signal dramatic changes for future tax gathering focussed on transaction monitoring. This will yield fairer, more accurate, simpler and greater revenue delivery that is more difficult to avoid. A TRANSACTION TAX is the way of the future. Conclusion As a small nation, New Zealand would be advised to research and prepare processes for the introduction of TRANSACTIONAL TAX in the medium term estimated at 1% of all transactions. No other tax would be required. Our small economy could be a pilot for TRANSACTIONAL TAX. Such a visionary tax system will be introduced elsewhere. Better to be prepared and engaged than to react to financial influences from much larger economies in a state of international flux. Investigation and reporting could be done by the end of 2019. TRANSACTON TAX then becomes an election issue for 2020. New Zealand financial foresight would deliver greater financial control over our monies and greater autonomy and resilience to shocks. A fairer more responsible, accountable developing society is the likely result at a personal, community, national and international level. Kerry Bevin 26 April 2018.

Submission to Government Tax Working Group Submitter: John Garwood I wish to speak to the submission My Views on Future Taxation Income Tax • Should be significantly more progressive than as at present ie with higher taxes for very high incomes and lower or no taxes for those on very low incomes GST on Food • Our current GST system is very simple. Removing GST on food would introduce unnecessary complications. • GST catches all (particularly for food), including those who engage in the black economy, or otherwise evade/avoid other forms of taxation. • There are calls to remove GST from food but I would expect that GST on food to be one of the main revenue earners. Rather than removing GST on food those most affected (those on lower incomes) should be assisted by increasing the beneficiary/superannuation (Transfer) payments. With the move towards the “Living Wage” (which might practically coincide with the introduction of any new tax system) then the costs to the lower income wage groups would be automatically catered for. GST on Imports • GST on imports should be lowered to all imports over $40, to avoid discrimination against local retailers. Capital Gains Tax • There should be a broad based capital gains tax on profits of all assets sold (or disposed of) after an allowance for inflation. There should be a minimum taxable level set. Capital losses to be offset against current or future CGT profits – not other income. Profits should be taxed at income tax rates with consideration being given to allow the spreading of those net profits over say the 3 previous years, but only where the profit has arisen over an extended period. • It should include the family home (though it is noted that this is outside your brief – but could be commented on in your final report). • The CGT should replace the International Tax Regime Investment Property Income (Rental housing) • Should be taxed as currently but losses should only be offset against future income of that category, not other income. \[1\] Harmful activities • There should be a tax on sugar and its substitutes where those substitutes are known to be harmful to humans. • Similar taxes should be introduced where recommended by health professionals to avoid societal heatth costs. • Environmental harmful activities should be taxed/fined/controlled by the relevant Regional Local Authority. However central government should be responsible for implementing recycling levies/schemes at the point of importation/manufacture for items such as electronic goods/tyres/plastics/glassware etc. Superannuation • Should be catered for under a progressive income tax system • Should be further taxed where other income exceeds a set amount (say $150,000) to be fully offset (at say $200,000). Registered Charities • There are large commercial organisations that are operating as Registered Charities, gaining cash flow advantages compared with taxable equivalent organisations, thus allowing the Registered Charities to expand their operations unfairly. Profits retained in the ongoing operations of Registered Charities should be taxed at normal rates. Inheritances • Should be re-introduced where the value of the estate is over say two million dollars with that figure being inflation adjusted annually. Globalisation • Taxation should be applied on realistic levels of inputed profits for overseas companies making on line sales in New Zealand

What does the future of tax look like to you? I agree taxes are required to fund vital public services that underpin our living standards. However I am concerned at the inequality of our present system. The main taxes we have being Personal income tax, Company income tax and Goods and Services Tax (GST) are necessary in order to obtain monies for Government purposes. I feel there is no need to dispose of any of these taxes but merely create some fairness within these taxes. There is no need for a land tax (creates cash flow problems for those asset rich and cash poor) or varying company tax rates (creates income shifting or formation of more companies). I also feel there is no need to limit property rental losses against other income. The only new tax I would support is a Stamp Duty, and a proper tax on so called capital gains or a separate Capital Gains Tax. 2. What is the purpose of tax? As mentioned, taxes are required to fund vital public services. The system we have at present is relatively simple but this is a poor excuse to avoid rearranging criteria within income tax and GST. For instance, GST on food items is not necessary. Australia cope with not taxing food items and the reasons given by so called experts that administratively it would be too hard to implement in NZ is ridiculous. GST on Government and Council charges also creates a tax on a tax scenario and should not incur another 15%. I do not believe in using tax to discourage certain behaviours such as Excise duty on tobacco and liquor. What has developed is a severe social issue with dairies and liquor stores being targeted for burglaries. I am of the opinion that the least wealthy people will still buy cigarettes and liquor ahead of food for their families. A sugar tax wouldn’t necessarily create any less obesity. Poker machines may provide various funds for the community but many customers are addicted thus creating a wave of child poverty at home. \[1\] 3. Are we taxing the right things? Tax is presently collected on income from $1 upwards. This income would include all benefits. I feel a benefit is a benefit-there is no need to tax these lower incomes. Benefits needn’t be in the tax system and should be managed by Work and Income. There should be a tax free level for income tax on $20,000 or less. This would eliminate collection of income tax on benefits including superannuation. It would also allow interest to be being tax free up to $20,000 allowing growth in retirement savings. Property speculation has been rife in NZ for decades. A weak tax law on “what is income” has allowed profit made on property to be tax free. Anyone can make up a reason “why they did not purchase with the purpose or intention of selling” or when selling why something “forced” them to sell. In my mind income is income whether it is by way of a profit on sale of property, a sale of a business, or any hobby interest that involves buying and selling. The seller of Trade me to Fairfax interests admitted he was embarrassed that no tax be paid on his multi-million dollar profit. I therefore support a tax on these capital gains as part of income tax. GST needs to be collected on imported goods purchased on the internet. The retail sector is being savaged by items being purchased on the internet. Goods purchased this way should be charged GST to create fairness to retailers in NZ. Australia will require offshore suppliers to charge GST for on line sales below $1000 from 1/7/18. A similar law should be instigated here. The status of Charities should be reviewed. Some breakfast cereal manufacturers, health insurance providers, religious groups etc. should not have a tax free status. The tax brackets should be increased with inflation. i.e. the 30% rate which starts on income $48,001 to $70,000 should be rearranged to be $50,001 to $72,000 or thereabouts. The 33% rate which starts on income over $70,001 should be lifted to $72,001 or thereabouts. Company tax should be lowered over time to 25% in the $1. There is no need to have any special rate for smaller companies otherwise tax advisors will just form more companies to spread the income. Imputation credits (franking credits) on dividends from Australian shares should be allowed in NZ. The Australian share market provides more diversity and spread than the NZ market. It is unfair imputation (franking) is not allowed as a credit on Australian dividends for NZ taxpayers. Tax rebates are allowed on donations. Health insurance should qualify for a similar rebate as this would help relieve the public health system for those who wish to insure themselves and not overload the public health system. Some consideration should be made to allow mortgage interest as a rebate for home owners. There should be a higher penalty for tax evasion and fraud. Too many “home detention” sentences are given to white collar criminals. Directors and shareholders of companies are dealt with lightly, and companies simply wind up and seem to be able to start up again under another name. Business owners and “tradies doing cash jobs” who don’t declare income are ripping off the GST and income tax systems with each dollar kept. A report from Inland Revenue reported in the NZ Herald 21/4/18 estimated they are missing out on $800 million a year as a result of self employed underreporting income of 20%. Welfare fraud on the other hand usually involves a prison sentence and repayment over several years creating a situation of one rule for the rich and one for the poor. 4. Can tax make housing more affordable? A capital gains tax is only fair. This will stop the speculation and avoid legal tax cases involving issues over what are income, what the “purpose and intention” was on purchasing, and the reasons for selling. A bright line test of 2 years or 5 years is still not sufficient. Any profit made on a property other than the family home should be taxed as normal income at normal income tax rates. If that is not acceptable, a capital gains tax needs to be introduced like it should have been 30 years ago. Furthermore, relying on the seller to declare income within 2 years or 5 years is not sufficient. There needs to be a system that such a sale (and resultant profit) is reported to Inland Revenue during the legal property transfer process. This will then ensure the seller does declare any profits within the 2 year, 5year or other period. This will allow proper investment in rental housing and steady the property market, by slowing the increase in property prices and rents. Unfortunately a tax on what has been regarded as capital gains can also create a problem on a downturn such as happened following the share market crash in 1987. A raft of claims for tax losses arose shortly after a clampdown on share market transactions prior to 1987. Therefore there should be a limit on claiming capital tax losses-i.e. ring fenced to be claimed only against income from capital gains. No rollover relief should be applied. A capital gain realised should be taxed but only for assets purchased from the date of introduction of any capital gains tax. This to include all types of assets including those held offshore, in family trusts, in Kiwi saver, or any other savings schemes-also gifts and gambling/lotto winnings. Death, emigration and immigration situations should be liable for the tax on any capital gain on assets purchased after introduction. Only the family home for those owners who have lived in that home for a minimum of two years should be exempt. Builders should not qualify for the exemption. There is no need to limit normal rental losses (legitimate expenses exceeding rental income) against other income. Stamp Duty should be applied to buyers of NZ property. As in Australia stamp duty should be applied to all property purchases. A higher stamp duty should apply to foreign (non-resident) buyers. Foreign buyers (non-residents) should not be able to buy existing established homes- New houses or apartments only. 5. What tax issues matter to you most? GST on “cold” food is not necessary. Prices for food items are 15% more than what they are in Australia for the same items sold by the Australian supermarkets in Australia and New Zealand. Milk subsidies may need to be introduced as Fonterra are profiteering out of milk, cheese and butter sold on the domestic market. Milk is $1 litre in Australia yet $3 litre in NZ-which doesn’t fare well for so called efficient NZ farmers. GST on government and council charges is not necessary. GST needs to be collected on imported goods via the internet. This will help the retail sector in NZ. Income should include any profit made on property (other than the family home) and sale of businesses. Whether the second property is sold within 2 years or 5 years or 20 years makes no difference. We need the income (less an adjustment for inflation) to be taxed either as additional income or a special capital gains tax. Higher penalties should apply to tax evasion and tax fraud. Multinational companies need to pay their fare share of tax made on income earn’t in NZ (or have certain inter group expenses disallowed). Income tax rates should include a tax free income limit of $20,000 per individual, and an adjustment to the tax rate of 30c and 33c for the income brackets of $48,000 and $70,000 to make allowance for inflation. Tax rebates should be allowed for health insurance, and some consideration be given to homeowners who pay mortgage interest during the tax year . Imputation (franking) credits from Australian shares should be allowed against Australian dividends received by NZ residents. Stamp duty to be introduced on all property purchases with a higher rate for foreign buyers (non- residents). No foreign buyer to be allowed to purchase an existing established residential home.

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Tax Working Group Submission April 2018 Executive Summary New Zealand currently has a well established, fair and progressive tax system. The more you earn the more tax you pay. Approximately 35% of current NZ tax is paid by the highest 10% of taxpayers. The more you tax these same high earning taxpayers, the more you will alienate them. Tax avoidance will increase, or worse case high earning taxpayers will vote with their feet and leave NZ altogether, as has happened in the past. Any new taxes need to be introduced in a fair and equitable manner and apply equally to all. To apply tax due to ideology or a tax grab does not make for good enduring tax law and will inevitably have unintended consequences. The solution is not to complicate and skew the New Zealand tax system with further exemptions and taxes. The tax system is not broken and does not require new taxes. The solution for property, is to solve the supply imbalances for property and not to penalise and complicate it for those with the entrepreneurial spirit that make this country great. How does the tax system affect housing affordability? Frankly I don’t believe this. The recent property boom quite simply has been driven by a long lasting under supply of property, mainly in Auckland. This is well documented. Latterly the under supply has been compounded even more by a tightening of bank credit and LVRs, making it more difficult to build new homes and purchase property just at the critical time when more are needed. The other main driver of property has been the constant, almost daily, media frenzy focused on property. Count the housing related articles and it will reveal the love affair of reporting on property by the media. The media sells entire sections of the newspaper and its websites on the subject and has a big vested interest in the property market, the same as banks and real estate agents do. There has been much noise and distortion of the facts when it comes to blaming the tax system for supporting housing affordability. And if it did, the most recent changes if anything have tipped the playing field adversely and unfairly against property. The government recently increased the bright-line test to 5 years to target speculators. Whilst I believe the increase to 5 years was unwarranted (the previous 2 year test was sufficient to prevent speculation in the property market) this serves to address the demand side of property speculation. The government has also claimed that the ‘loss offset’ (negative gearing) of property losses against other income distorts the property market. However, this has existed for decades, long before the current property boom and therefore can’t be argued as to the cause of the current property problem. Furthermore, the loss offset rules apply not just to property. It is a basic long lasting principle across the tax system that income tax losses from all sources (including property) can be offset. The effect of this recent change, has been to unfairly target property as the only exemption from this principle, which is not fair and equitable. However, this change won’t just target property speculators (who typically only hold property short term). Ring fencing property losses will more adversely target landlords who intend to rent property for a number of years and who in their first initial years may make a loss. Making a loss starting out in a new business is common in all industries which is why the loss offset of all income sources exists. It is no longer an even playing field. The recent changes to target property has skewed the property market adversely for those who own property for investment. To suggest that the tax system still favours property over other forms of investment is not correct. PIE and Investment Income unfair tax advantage PIE income is taxed at a lower marginal income tax rate for individuals. Examples are unit trusts, kiwi saver and interest income. This concession was introduced a number of years ago to promote the share market and retirement income sources. The fund management industry has conveniently forgotten that they have an unfair tax advantage and they are very quick to allege that property has a tax advantage over other investment sources, however the reverse is actually true. Capital Gains Tax (CGT) is not a silver bullet NZ is often stated as the only country in the world not to have a CGT. And for this very reason, it should have one! However this is a baseless argument. Why should we have one just because everyone else has? Have you considered that NZ may be the only smart country not to have a CGT? CGT exists in other countries, correct. But CGT has not prevented significant property and share market booms over decades in those same countries. This is counter intuitive to the NZ argument we should have one. NZ already has a number of CGTs in its tax law for property, shares and foreign exchange to name a few. Labour has just introduced further change, increasing the property bright-line test to 5 years, to target so called property speculators. So why is there a need to introduce a new CGT as well? Long lasting sections of the income tax act already tax capital gains, relating to property and shares, if brought for the intention of sale and a wide range of other property development scenarios. Labour has suggested the family home would be exempt from a CGT. However, it is difficult to understand the justification for exempting the greatest holders (approx 60%) of residential property from a CGT. What about the family home which is held in Trusts or other entities? What about the inheritance of the family home, should that be taxable? Exempting the family home will have a lot of unintended consequences. It will have limited impact if it only targets the minority of housing, which is not fair and equitable. If a CGT were to be introduced, like GST, it would only be effective if it had the minimum of exemptions and the widest possible base. A CGT would need to apply to everything ie. all investments, sale of businesses, shares, art, and gold. Not just property. Property is only a subset of investment choice and should not be singled out for a CGT simply because property has had a recent boom. What about shares which have similarly enjoyed significant growth? Why is the IRD not targeting share speculators who are blatantly trade shares for a profit? Other reasons for no CGT: • Introducing a CGT will distort decision making, entrepreneurship and growth • A CGT would drive negative ‘lock in effect’ behaviours to avoid paying CGT. Less property would be sold • Higher compliance costs would arise including greater use of lawyers and accountants • A CGT is complicated and difficult to administer and will likely require millions to administer Wealth Tax A wealth or inheritance tax has been suggested as another possible source of tax. Which would be an envy tax. It would be a disincentive for those with aspiration and entrepreneurial spirit to setup business in NZ and succeed. Introducing a wealth tax will risk driving aspirational individuals from NZ, as they likely have the means and inclination to live in any progressive country that welcomes them. As stated previously the top 10% of taxpayers are already paying 35% of NZ tax. Loading them with a further wealth tax is inequitable. Land Tax already exists NZ already has a land tax, it is called rates. This is an out of control tax, welded by councils, which are spending well beyond their means. They increase rates every year with limited accountability. Introducing a land tax, possibly levied on artificial rateable values has questionable merit, other than a blatant tax grab. The reason touted for introducing a land tax is to act as a disincentive and further holding cost for vacant land. However there are already disincentives called rates and interest. A holder of land cannot avoid rates and if they financed the purchase they have to pay interest, with the likelihood of no offsetting income stream. Exempting the family home from a land tax, which comprises the majority (approx 60%) of residential housing on land is ridiculous. Exemptions cause imbalances. This will discourage subdivision of existing large sections and infill housing in the cities, which are desperately needed to for building sites to build new homes. Accordingly, exempting the family home is not well thought out and will cause unintended consequences. The other main owners of land are businesses, farmers and government. Land tax will merely add another burden to NZ businesses and farmers who are trying to make ends meet in a competitive environment. Inevitably businesses would have to pass the higher costs of the land tax on to their customers. GST works well leave it alone The NZ GST system is often hailed as the best indirect tax system in the world. It is a simple tax, with very few exceptions and therefore hard to avoid. It is a consumption based tax, the more you spend the more GST you pay. Accordingly high net wealth taxpayers will pay more GST as they spend more. The argument to remove GST from vegetables, or other basic necessities, because it impacts the poor more is baseless. GST applies to everyone, it cannot be avoided easily, which is at the heart of its strength and why it should not be changed and complicated. Simply put GST is not broke, don’t stuff it up, or the Labour government will never live it down. Progressive Company Tax Why would you wish to penalise successful businesses with progressive rates? Most company tax regimes in other countries have a flat tax rate, as far as I’m aware, which is fair. Why should larger businesses pay a higher rate of tax? As it stands a company pays 28c tax on each and every dollar earnt. The more it earns the more it’s taxed, at the same rate, which is fair and equitable. Don’t unnecessarily complicate NZ tax and discourage business and entrepreneurial effort setting up in NZ. Income Tax Several anomalies still exist within NZ’s current income tax system, which have not been addressed for some time. Namely: • The income tax thresholds have not been adjusted for many years and lag wage growth and inflation • The bottom income tax thresholds are far too low and should be higher Perhaps Instead of increasing the minimum wage, the government should be lowering the lowest income tax rate, to encourage and reward those who work and reduce benefit dependency. I leave you with my considered comments. I’m obviously a tax practitioner that works with the tax laws of the day and I have a strong understanding of the property market as a result. There is no unfair tax advantage granted to property. And in fact, the recent proposals of the current government have significantly skewed the playing field adversely against property. The solution is to solve the supply imbalances for property and not to penalise those with the entrepreneurial spirit that makes this country great. Tania Gullery Chartered Accountant

What Does the Future of Tax Look Like to You and What is the Purpose of Tax? The purpose of tax is obviously to distribute wealth and resources to provide essential services for the good of the community and humanity as a whole. In this sense tax is a good thing. The debate comes when determining the extent and manner of the distribution. There are three principles that I believe should apply to our tax system. i) We Need to Keep our Taxation System Simple Many countries are envious of the simplicity of New Zealand’s tax system. We need to keep it that way. If we complicate the system, for example making some goods exempt from GST, or if we add new taxes, it will not only make it difficult for everyone to administer but it will also increase a totally unproductive tax industry – from government departments, to accountants to lawyers. We must not ruin the simplicity that we have. ii) We Must Not Disincentivise or Punish Effort There are several elements to this. Firstly it is important for human wellbeing, and consequently the wellbeing of the planet, for people to know they will be rewarded for the effort they expend. People gain satisfaction and fulfilment from working hard and achieving. If those that work hard are overly penalised through tax, the point will be reached where they will not bother, as the effort is no longer worth it. That will have social consequences for themselves and for others, and lead to further community decline. It is a fact that the majority of the tax take that funds our entire country comes from a minority of the population. As reported by Stuff Business News on 26 July 2016:  “The top 3 per cent of individual income earners, earning more than $150,000 a year, pay 24 per cent of all tax received. \[1\] \[1\] 2  A table from Finance Minister Bill English's office shows 663,000 households - or 40 per cent - receive more in tax credits and other benefits than they pay in tax. Thousands more are neutral contributors, or are close to it”. The high income earners are often maligned for their wealth, but they do actually fund our country. I have no problem with the high income earners paying the high proportion that they do (which also includes greater GST on their greater level of spending). However what we cannot afford to do is to penalise and disincentivise them with taxation so much that they choose to throw the towel in, for example choosing to leave New Zealand. If it were not for the tax currently paid by these high income earners, whether companies or individuals, we would all be in dire straits. The well-known quote says something like we cannot all just ride in the carriages, someone has to be the train engine or we will all go nowhere. The reality is we cannot afford to have those in the train engine choose to move to the carriages, or to decouple completely. iii) We Need to be Mindful of Unintended Consequences Taxes almost always result in unintended consequences, often negative. Tax distorts behaviour as people will always try to find ways to mitigate taxation effects. It is like squeezing jelly – you squeeze one part (through adding a tax measure) and it pops out somewhere else. The more complicated a tax system, the more costly it will be to administer, the more costly for businesses, and the greater the likelihood that there will be unintended consequences and mitigation effects through changed behaviours. The consequences cannot all be predicted in advance and history shows that many are likely to be negative. Having a simple tax system, as we currently have, minimise negative unintended consequences. 2. Are we Taxing the Right Things? I believe we do have the tax mix right – with tax coming predominantly from income tax, company tax and GST. Perhaps the percentages could be adjusted, but the items are right and it is simple. The reasons I do not like the other tax options come back to the three principles in my item 1 above, particularly simplicity and to not disincentivise effort. I will now comment on each of the other tax options. Wealth and/or Land Tax A wealth tax or a land tax would be very punitive and have negative consequences, particularly for people who have worked hard all their lives to build up a nest egg so they are not dependent on taxpayer handouts for their retirement. Why penalise these people, some of whom may have assets but little disposable income? And if we do disincetivise people from saving a nest egg for retirement, they will simply take the easier route and just rely on the government for handouts without having to expend effort. 3 Capital Gains Tax I also do not believe there is any need for a capital gains tax. However if there was to be a capital gains tax it should only apply at the time of sale and to be equitable it would need to have the cumulative inflation over the ownership period deducted. Capital gain up to the level of cumulative inflation is not capital gain – it is just the value of the asset staying neutral in terms of inflation and should therefore never be taxed. It should also only apply to assets that are purchased after the date of its introduction, not to assets that are already owned. Also, if a capital gains tax were introduced it should apply to all assets including the family home. Exempting the family home would have negative unintended consequences as has happened in Australia (see item 3 below). To be equitable there would also have to be a tax rebate where assets fall in value – which history shows they do at certain times of the economic or property cycle. We have experienced an unusual period of property value increases in the last few years. Property assets may well reduce in value in the future and if a capital gain tax applied then it might have reverse effects i.e. refunds rather than tax take. There is also the complication where an owner has spent money to improve an asset over time and thereby increased its value which should not be taxed. This all leads to more record keeping, unwelcome complication and cost, rather than the simplicity we currently have. Speculators who are looking to capital gain for profit do already pay a capital gains tax in New Zealand through the brightline test which is being extended to 5 years, or through the longstanding intention test. To apply a capital gains tax to the entire property market would be detrimental and is unnecessary given that the speculators are already being taxed. Gift or Estate Tax The same goes for gift or estate tax. Don’t do it. Thank goodness we got rid of these taxes previously, made it equitable for estates to transfer assets to their families, and got away from people coming up with all manner of clever ways to mitigate or avoid these complicated taxes. Please keep our tax system simple as it is now. Charities I believe that genuine charities should continue to not be taxed. That is because they provide a whole raft of social and community services that the government (i.e. taxpayer) would otherwise have to pay for. They save the country significant money. Similarly the tax deductions for donors to charities should continue, as without their donation there would be a cost to the taxpayer. Just a few examples are surf lifesaving, social agencies and churches that provide essential community services, St Johns ambulance and so on. 3. Can Tax Make Housing More Affordable? I do not believe that tax can generally make housing more affordable over the long term. This relates both to affordability of ownership (house prices) and renting. 4 House Prices House prices result from the balance of supply and demand. In some, but not all parts of New Zealand there is or has been an excess of demand and a lack of supply, resulting in increased prices. There are several reasons that house prices are significantly higher than they were several decades ago. Firstly, we have been building increasingly larger and more expensive houses. Secondly, most houses are now purchased by double income couples rather than a family having a single income earner. That means the double income purchasers can afford to pay more, including servicing a higher mortgage, which drives market pricing. Thirdly, it is now very easy to get a bank mortgage whereas previously applicants had to have a long savings record and often also needed a second mortgage. Mortgages were not easy to obtain. Fourthly, interest rates are now at historically low levels, which means that purchasers can service larger mortgages than previously. Therefore in a competitive bidding situation higher prices are paid. This is a global phenomenon not just a New Zealand issue. Notwithstanding well documented supply issues, a significant rise in interest rates is probably the one factor that would now cause house prices to reduce. A capital gains tax has been touted as a theoretical method to reduce house prices, though the government says a capital gains tax would not apply to the family home. You only have to look at countries that already have capital gains taxes to see that they currently have the same issue of high priced housing in large cities where demand is high. The capital gains tax doesn’t make any difference. As the Chief Economist of the ANZ Bank says (NZ Property Professional Magazine – Autumn 2018): “Analysis of capital gains taxes in other countries has generally tended to conclude that they have a one-off negative impact on prices, but little ongoing impact on the magnitude of house price cycles”. Also, if there is a capital gains tax but it does not apply to the family home, any possible impact will be further reduced and there will be other consequences as the market responds. In fact if the government really believes in capital gains tax on the basis of sound economic principle, it would then also apply it to the family home. Otherwise it is being applied for the wrong reasons, such as populism or just out of envy to penalise people who have worked hard and provided for their retirement. In some states of Australia where the family home is exempt from capital gains tax, it has resulted in the unintended consequence of people pouring excessive money into the family home instead of investing in rental properties. This has resulted in larger homes being built, homes being extended and upgraded, with a consequent increase in the cost of owner– occupied homes. House Rentals If tax measures are directed at rental (investment) properties (including a capital gains tax), thereby making their ownership less attractive, there are two consequences. Firstly, the net return on the investment property reduces which means that rents will ultimately rise over time as the market finds a new balance to compensate for the tax measures. Secondly, some investors will exit the market, leading to a reduced supply of houses available for rent. The reduced supply then inevitably results in rent increases. This is not 5 just theoretical; it is widely acknowledged that recent policy and legislative changes that negatively affect residential property investment are already reducing supply and causing rent increases. Chris Wales, a tax expert appointed as an adviser by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, is quoted in Stuff Business News on 24 March 2018 saying: “People needed to be quite clear in their thinking about how any change in a capital gains tax would affect housing supply. I think if you introduce it there will almost inevitably be a reduction in the amount of future investment in residential real estate for investment purposes. Because it will constrain future supply, what it might do is add to price pressure, so you might see prices going up a little bit more”. Wales said he believed there was a supply issue with housing in New Zealand and he would be more concerned about making that worse by taxing capital gains on housing, than he would be about the money such a tax could raise”. So for the above reasons I do not believe that tax can generally make housing more affordable over the long term. History and international experience proves it. It might even fuel further price increases. 4. What Tax Issues Matter Most to You Noting the items that are listed under this heading on the Tax Working group website, I have answered this question in my responses above. Items 1 to 3 above should therefore be taken as my answer as to the question of which tax issues I consider matter the most. Thank you for considering my submission.

Tax Working Group Public Submissions Information Release Release Document September 2018 taxworkingroup.govt.nz/key-documents Key to sections of the Official Information Act 1982 under which information has been withheld. Certain information in this document has been withheld under one or more of the following sections of the Official Information Act, as applicable: \[1\] 9(2)(a) - to protect the privacy of natural persons, including deceased people; \[2\] 9(2)(k) - to prevent the disclosure of official information for improper gain or improper advantage. Where information has been withheld, a numbered reference to the applicable section of the Official Information Act has been made, as listed above. For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. John Trezise 25 April 2018 SUBMISSION TO THE TAX WORKING GROUP ON REDUCING INEQUALITY One of the goals of tax reform is, one assumes, to arrest and if possible reverse the increasing inequality in New Zealand between haves and have-nots. The obvious course would be to raise the top tax rate (now 33%, but in Australia 49% and in Britain 45%), introduce tax on accumulated wealth, and with the revenue gained reduce the burden of income and consumption taxes on the poor. But the terms the Government has laid down for the Tax Working Group specifically forbid it to entertain inheritance taxes, or taxing the family home or the land beneath the family home, or to recommend raising the top level of income tax. All of which leads one to suspect that the Government does not really want to reform tax at all. It is therefore necessary for any meaningful submission to the Tax Working Group to repudiate and contemn its terms of reference. Since the Second World War, the gradual elimination in New Zealand of land taxes, inheritance taxes, and gift taxes has increasingly quarantined real property, especially the family home, as a safe tax-free haven for the growth of family wealth. After the Buckle Tax Working Group’s recommendations in 2010 failed to lead to a capital gains tax or land tax (the John Key government instead reduced the top income-tax rate and increased GST), Gareth Morgan and Susan Guthrie published in 2011 The Big Kahuna. In it they argued for the broad imposition of a tax on the imputed, or implied, income from all wealth including the family home, and the introduction of an unconditional basic income to replace NZ Superannuation, Working for Families, and all other state transfers. The present Government has all the research it needs to reform New Zealand’s tax system, and it is difficult not to suspect that the present Tax Working Group is an excuse to do nothing except talk, and stall for time in the hope of winning another election. HOME OWNERSHIP “EQUIVALENCE” FOR OTHER FORMS OF INVESTMENT Nevertheless, within the absurd constraints of the terms of reference, there are things that can be done. A wealth tax, or a tax on land, still seems to be possible, for instance. But the introduction of any form of wealth tax that excludes the family home or the land beneath it, and that also excludes inheritance tax (and presumably gift tax), is fundamentally unfair to all who are not yet home- owners, or who are home-owners in an area where housing has little value. It also seems likely to continue and increase the incentive to invest in the family home rather than other forms of investment. This will push prices higher, ever further beyond the reach of those who do not have the means to buy into the housing market. I submit that a person who does not own, or part-own, and occupy a “family home”, should be allowed a tax-free investment of an amount equivalent to the value of the average inner-city Auckland house; say $1 million. To be fair to the owner-occupier of a modestly priced house in \[1\] Raetihi or Mataura, let’s say every taxpayer is entitled to tax-free savings or investment (in any vehicles in New Zealand or overseas) of $1 million minus the value of their owner-occupied-home investment. So the single person who owns no home would be able to grow his or her savings tax- free till it reached $1 million; the married half-owner of a $100,000 home would be able to invest $950,000 and pay wealth and tax only on the capital above that; the half-owner of the $3 million house in Remuera would incur wealth tax on every dollar invested elsewhere, as his or her $1.5 million share surpasses the tax-free investment allowance. Such a tax-free allowance, by allowing investors elsewhere in New Zealand the tax advantage of the poorer half of Auckland home-owner-occupiers, would reduce the disparity between the capital- growth advantage of investing in the family home and the land beneath it (excluded from the tax reform group’s consideration) and other forms of investment. This might encourage New Zealanders to look beyond the family home to more productive investments, which might help to reduce the rate of price increase in homes; and people who did not yet have enough money to buy a house, or who did not want to own a house, would enjoy tax advantages similar to many home-owner- occupiers. (If the investment limit for tax exemption were set at the valuation of the most expensive Auckland houses New Zealand would go bankrupt, which demonstrates how the Tax Working Group’s terms of reference seem designed to protect the rich.) Of course, this does little or nothing to help the poor who have no assets; it simply extends the undeserved tax exemption of the home-owner-occupier to others with different assets up to $1 million. That is the fault of the terms of reference the Government has imposed on the Tax Working Group. It remains, however, that this might dampen enthusiasm for investing in homes rather than anything else, and that this might gradually lead to homes becoming more affordable. ABOLISH GOODS AND SERVICES TAX A consumption tax is an iniquitous burden on the poor, as it increases by 15% the cost of the necessities of life: food, clothing, housing. If it cannot be abolished, it should be greatly reduced. INTRODUCE AN UNCONDITIONAL BASIC INCOME It would be obvious to recommend that New Zealand introduce a zero tax rate on the first $20,000 of income, as is the case in both Australia and Britain. However, that does nothing to help those who may most need it: the people who earn less than $20,000 a year. As Gareth Morgan and others have comprehensively argued, the fairer solution is to pay every permanent resident present in New Zealand an unconditional, tax-free income, which (together with a universal child benefit) would largely replace all other welfare disbursements by the state. This UBI could be recouped from those who don’t need it by high tax rates on other income, whether actual or imputed. The Government has forbidden the Tax Working Group to recommend higher taxes, so any change in tax rates would need to be a mere book entry to recoup the disbursement of the UBI. OTHER WAYS TO HELP THE POOR Tax transfers in the form of truly free health care including dental care, truly free state education, including uniforms, all tools, and school meals, and universal free public transport, which would relieve the private-car burden on city roads. ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF TAX INCOME Extending the undeserved home-owner-occupier tax exemption to other investments would create a rather large hole in the Government tax base, without even considering a UBI. Other ways of gathering revenue would need to be found. Financial Transactions Tax: One answer, promoted by the late MP Jim Anderton, is a Tobin-style financial transactions tax. A tax of, say, 0.01 per cent ($1 in $10,000) on every transfer of money between any parties would be negligible in everyday life (even a $1 million house would be taxed only $100), but if all transactions around the world of New Zealand dollars could be captured, including the vast sums traded by international currency speculators, the revenue could be considerable. A financial transactions tax might require the abolition of cash and its replacement with a blockchain digital currency, so that every transfer of money would automatically and painlessly have its ticket clipped. Tight controls would be needed to stop transactions being transferred to foreign or crypto-currencies. Abolition of charity tax exemption, and of tax rebate on donations: A rule of thumb for taxation is to tax lightly, with few exceptions. There are 27,829 registered charities in New Zealand as I write, according to a Government website. Why are they registered? To avoid tax. News media, when they discuss charities and tax, tend to focus on the colourful: favourite targets are Gloriavale, the Destiny Church, Exclusive Brethren. What really needs to be questioned is the very idea of allowing tax exemption of every one of these 27,829 so-called charities. Tax revenue must come from somewhere: schools and hospitals must be maintained, roads must be built, the police force must be staffed. Every dollar that any charity is excused is an extra dollar that must be got from those who do pay tax. This is an infringement of rights: I as a taxpayer am forced to subsidise organisations whose purpose I may not like. The tax-exempt status of so-called charities and not-for-profits should be abolished. So too should be the ability for taxpayers to claim rebates on donations or fees to charities, not-for-profits, churches, schools whether private, integrated, or state, or any other purpose. Donations and fees should come from after-tax income without any indulgence.

TAX WORKING GROUP SUBMISSION S U M M A RY This submission is based on four principles: 1. Less tax is better provided that society is progressive and caring 2. It is better to incentivize people with rebates than to punish with tax 3. Helping the wage earner by taking from the wage payer is counterproductive. 4. The administration cost of collecting and reallocating tax is significant. Summary of submission: The basis of this submission is to incentivize people to reduce their need for govt/tax funded products and services such as: - Education - Health - Aged care - Superannuation - Clean energy - Support for the disadvantaged - Support of the environment - Accommodation This would be done by making a person’s spend on the above tax-deductible. Benefits to New Zealand - No change to tax rates, but high earners increased self-reliance would reduce costs to Government. - NZ’ers that are able, would look after themselves with their own money. - Government able to focus tax spend on those that need it. - Reduced tax administration costs H O W I T W O U L D W O RK The government would make provision for people to: - Opt-out of free education, their spend on education becomes tax deductible. - Opt-out of free health, health spend becomes tax deductible. - Opt-out of free aged care, aged care spend becomes tax deductible. - Opt-out of superannuation, and in return receive an increase in the percentage deductible off the other areas in this list. - Opt-in to clean energy usage, spend on clean energy becomes tax deductible. - Opt-in for support of others, any spend on charitable organisations becomes tax deductible. 2 - Opt-in for support of the environment, spend on environmental initiatives become tax deductible. - Rental 1 costs (up to a cap) become tax deductible e.g. up to $500 per week of rent payments would become deductible if money was auto-redirected into KiwiSaver. W H A T T H I S M E A N S T O I N D I V I D U A L S I M PA C T O N L O W E A R N E RS - There would be no reduction in services and benefits to low earners. - There would be more incentive for unemployed to get paid employment because once they start paying tax it can be off-set against accommodation costs... making home ownership more achievable. I M PA C T O N MI D D L E I N C O M E E A RN E RS - These earners would see opportunities to become more independent via self determination - Those middle income earners that want to pay for private medical or education etc could do so and would reduce demands on government funded services. I M PA C T O N H I GH I N C O M E E A RN E RS - High earners would see the logic and benefit in this approach. - It rewards those that already are independent but also incentivises those who are unnecessarily free-loading off the government for education, health etc. S U B M I T T ED B Y Chris Yates 27 April 2018 1 Excluding mortgages from this is like applying a capital gains tax on housing by stealth. It reduces the gap between the renter and the owner. It provides less incentive to owners while also making it easier to own if desired. It increases demand/supply for affordable housing but does not incentivise large property holdings.

We strongly  consider that our country’s tax settings and their everyday effects are central  to New Zealanders’ wellbeing, as individuals, and together as a society.  We think the Tax Working Group’s Background Paper is a clear, well-written  piece that accurately summarises the features of New Zealand’s tax system  and the challenges it faces. We agree with the Government’s objectives for  the tax system and the criteria for evaluating tax reform as outlined in the  Background Paper, though we would prioritise the objective of equal  treatment of all forms of income and assets over the objective of system  coherence. Indeed, we do not think that a tax system can be coherent if it  treats different investments inconsistently. For the reasons outlined below, we  would also put a premium on improving the vertical equity of the tax system,  particularly given the dominance that capital ownership and investment has  had over labour.  Our submission focuses primarily on what we consider to be the most  significant failing of the tax system, and the largest impediment to achieving  those objectives: the failure to tax wealth and the inconsistent tax treatments  of different investments – in particular, the treatment of housing as compared  with other investments. At a time when the nature of work is changing, and  meaningful work is becoming increasingly harder to come by, this  fundamentally advantages capital over labour. We have also responded to  some of the Working Group’s consultation questions in the appendix to this  letter.    Jude and Helen Murdoch  \[1\]     We echo the Working Group’s view that, if New Zealand’s broad-based,  low-rate system was working well, there should be only minor (or no)  differences in the tax treatment of different forms of investment. There should  ideally be no difference in marginal effective tax rates between different types  of investments. This ideal scenario is unfortunately a far cry from the reality of  our tax system today, which does not treat wealth or housing the same way as  it does other forms of income.   The marginal effective tax rate on owner-occupied equity in New Zealand is a  fifth of the tax rate on investing in any business assets or long term savings  vehicles. The tax rate on investing in rental properties is around half the rate of  investing elsewhere. This combined with the ability to leverage the investment  of equity in either one’s own home or rental properties means there is just no  contest. Our tax system effectively directs anyone with spare money to invest  it in housing to make super-charged, tax-free capital gains. Indeed, as  commentator Bernard Hickey points out, for such people to do otherwise  would be economically irrational.  The effects of this unbalanced tax treatment have been well documented and  are becoming more visible in New Zealand every day: rampant house-price  inflation relative to wage growth; woeful productivity due to systematic  underinvestment in everything except house purchasing and renovating; a  record of poor savings and current account deficits with net foreign debt at  over 55 percent of GDP; and increasing inequality and segregation of society  into those with houses and those without houses. It is hard to overstate the  seriousness of these effects. In practice, they manifest in the form of ever  increasing numbers of people sleeping in cars; astronomical prices for poor  quality housing; property managers auctioning off tenancies to the highest  bidding tenants; and nurses, teachers, social workers, and other essential  service employees being priced out of Auckland.  Worse yet, as housing entrenches itself as the main means of making it in New  Zealand, and more and more people put what money they have in houses, the  housing bubble inflates further, and the political pressure on the Government  to ​not​ alter the current policy arrangements mounts. This perpetuates the  negative effects mentioned above, and puts us in a worse position to respond  to the future challenges the Working Group correctly identifies, including the  increasing costs of caring for an aging population, falling company tax rates  around the world, and the need to invest (and divest) in response to  environmental challenges.   We are first home owners and we sympathise with those in our situation who  fear the undesirable hypothetical of government intervention reducing the  Jude and Helen Murdoch  \[1\]     value of their houses to below the cost of their mortgage. However, we do not  think this fear justifies total inaction in reviewing and revising the tax system,  particularly given the increasing severity of the negative effects noted above.  We applaud the Government’s Kiwibuild supply-side response to New  Zealand’s housing crisis. However, we strongly consider that a demand-side  response in the form of changes to the tax system is necessary to properly  address the distorted incentives and negative effects noted above. In  particular, we favour the adoption of a land tax or a comprehensive capital  gains tax that operates on an accrual basis rather than on realisation. Without  such a response, there is too much risk of Kiwibuild perpetuating the current  one-dimensional approach to investment, despite the safeguards the  Government would seek to put in place.   New Zealand is not alone in the world in facing the negative effects of untaxed  wealth and capital gains. In what is perhaps the most comprehensive analysis  of developed countries’ economic data, Thomas Piketty forcefully  demonstrates that the rate of capital return in these countries is persistently  greater than the rate of economic growth. Piketty concludes that this will  cause wealth inequality to increase. To confront this challenge, Piketty  proposes redistribution through a progressive global tax on wealth. We see  significant parallels in the negative effects of, and the most viable solution to,  New Zealand’s housing crisis.  Shamubeel Eaqub has said, “At its core, tax is about pooling our resources  and redistributing, so that society is better off. Tax is love.” We endorse that  view, but we sympathise with those who have felt little but anger at the unjust  nature of the current tax system. This is ultimately about the sort of society we  want for New Zealand. In that respect, changing the tax system in a manner  that helps address the negative effects discussed above, and equips New  Zealand to deal with the impending challenges of the future, would make our  society far better off.  Sincerely,  Jude and Helen Murdoch            Jude and Helen Murdoch  \[1\]       Appendix - responses to consultation questions from  Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper  Chapter 3: Purposes and principles of a good tax system   How would you define ‘fairness’ in the context of the tax system? What would  a fair tax system look like?  In principle, an effective tax system is one that meets the established criteria  set out on page 19 of the Background Paper. For the reasons outlined in the  body of our submission, we would actually put more weight on the criterion of  ‘fairness and equity’ ​–​ in particular, the equal treatment of all forms of income  and assets, and improving the vertical equity of our tax system ​–​ than the  other criteria.   One practical aspect of a fair tax system would be its consistent marginal  effective tax rates for different types of investments.  Chapter 4: The current New Zealand tax system   Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally  modify behaviour? If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes?  There ​may​ well be a greater role for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour,  particularly in targeting environmental externalities. ‘Polluter pays  proportionately’ can be a useful guiding principle in this regard. Care should  be taken to ensure such taxes do not themselves entail other harmful  externalities or unintended consequences. However, where there is a net  benefit from such taxes, externalities and potential unforeseen consequences  should ​not​ be treated as insurmountable hurdles. Instead, to the extent  possible, externalities and consequences should be catered for in tax design  and implementation.   Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system   Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the  productive economy and the speculative economy? If it does not, what would  need to change to achieve a better balance?  As outlined in the body of our submission, our tax system’s inconsistent  treatment of capital as compared with other types of investment effectively  directs anyone with spare money to speculate (unproductively) in housing and  make super-charged, tax-free capital gains. For such people to do otherwise  Jude and Helen Murdoch  \[1\]     and invest their money in the productive economy would be economically  irrational. In this respect, our tax system is entirely unbalanced in its favourable  treatment of the speculative economy as compared with the productive  economy.  Changing the tax system so that marginal effective tax rates are as consistent  as possible across different types of investments would greatly assist in  addressing this imbalance, and levelling the playing field for investment  decisions.   Does the tax system do enough to maintain natural capital?   No. The ​Living Standards Framework ​’s recognition of natural capital is a  positive step. However, alongside the alarming environmental statistics and  indicators noted in the Background Paper, we note the OECD’s findings from  its latest assessment of New Zealand’s environmental performance:  a) our nitrogen balance deteriorated more rapidly between 1998 and  2009 than any other OECD country, which poses a significant risk to  freshwater resources that are already under pressure  b) we have one of the highest species extinction rates in the OECD  c) we are losing soil at around 10 times the average global rate  d) we have the highest number of cars per capita in the OECD.  For a resource-based economy, these statistics and indicators show that our  policy arrangements, including our tax system, have not valued our natural  capital enough. The tax system can and should be part of the answer to this  state of affairs. In particular, the tax system can assist in aligning incentives  and ‘internalising’ externalities: those that benefit from the environment and  those that contribute to its degradation need to face the costs of doing so.   Chapter 6: Thinking outside the current system   What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? Which of these  inconsistencies are most important to address?  As outlined in the body of our submission, our tax system substantially favours  unproductive investment in (mostly) pre-existing capital, particularly housing,  over other forms of more productive investment such as growing business and  innovation. Resolving this situation is perhaps the most important policy matter  before the Government.  Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not  currently levied? Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced?  Jude and Helen Murdoch  \[1\]     We favour whatever changes are necessary to bring our tax system into line  with the established criteria noted in the Background Paper, and to address  the negative effects discussed in the body of our submission. Provided such  changes brought about consistent marginal effective tax rates across different  types of investments, it would be appropriate to lower taxes on productive  activities (such as income) to at least partially offset increased revenue from  the other tax changes. The problems giving rise to the negative effects noted  above are not about how much we tax, but about what we tax, and what we  don’t tax.  Chapter 7: Specific challenges   How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for  owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote  greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend?  As detailed in the body of our submission, the unbalanced tax treatment of  housing (and wealth) compared to other forms of investment has substantially  reduced housing affordability for owners and, consequently, renters. This in  turn has resulted in the negative effects discussed in the body of our  submission. There is clearly a case for reform to close this tax loophole and  promote greater housing affordability. We favour whatever changes are  necessary to bring our tax system into line with the established criteria noted  in the Background Paper, and to address the negative effects discussed in the  body of our submission.   Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax or a land tax (that excludes  the family home)? If so, what features should it have?   We favour the adoption of a land tax or a comprehensive capital gains tax that  operates on an accrual basis rather than on realisation.   We understand the political unpalatability of a tax on the family home.  However, to exempt the family home would substantially miss the point, and  not deal with the negative effects outlined in the body of our submission. The  vast majority ​– ​some 60% ​–​ of those benefiting from the loophole at the heart  of our unbalanced tax system are people that own their own homes.  Exempting the family home would therefore deal with less than half of the  problem.    Using an example to illustrate, if we saved to buy a house or simply had idle  money in the bank, we would receive interest which itself would be taxed. We  could spend the remainder of the income from the interest on whatever we  chose, however, we would have paid income tax on the money we saved and  Jude and Helen Murdoch  \[1\]     tax on the interest those savings generated. However, if we had enough  savings to buy a house, we would avoid the second of two taxes noted above.  The savings we invested in the house would return us at least two significant  benefits: firstly, a house to live in ​– ​imputed rent ​–​ and secondly, the untaxed  capital gains if the house appreciated in value. No money changed hands, so  no tax is paid. In aggregate, this seriously distorts how New Zealanders,  including us, invest our savings.   A capital gains tax that included the family home would be a step in the right  direction. However, such a tax would only capture an appreciation in the  house price, while the owner’s benefits from imputed rent would go untaxed.        Jude and Helen Murdoch  \[1\]

VERSION 10 Submission by Alan Brown accountant .I am a member of an accounting organisation I have two accountancy practices - one in Auckland and one in Whangarei. The majority of my clients are small businesses. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I have asked a number of my staff and clients the following questions: If I said “Inland Revenue” to you what is the first thing that comes into your mind? - Most responses were – taking tax I also asked the question - Inland revenue friendly: T or F? The responses (which I can print are) – “no way”, and “We need the equivalent of a banking ombudsman for the Revenue - directly reporting to the Inland Revenue Minister, to deal with complaints.” The summary is that the I.R.D. is feared (but not respected)- The tax System does not reward good behavior. Just waves a big stick if you do not comply. That’s not fair. So change the name , let’s call them C.G.I. Collecting (the ) Governments Income ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The desire to conquer death and destruction was one of the reasons that the Kings of England created the need for taxes. Then as mankind evolved the reasons for taxes changed. Democracy evolved, and social changes were made to the spending government made - as politics changed the face of government and how they earned and spent our money. I would be surprised if the average man in the street could get their head around how the government spent their money let alone how they extracted it from the country’s economy. \[1\] Should we have additional tariffs – I guess we have been trumped there, but is it a way of the future?? or is it just a bargaining tool? The fundamental error in the questions you have presented to the tech savvy population is that it doesn’t foresee the future habits of spending and earnings by the populous. So, what will happen in the future.? Let’s take cars for example, today we can UBER them, have petrol or electric or any combination. Now let’s extrapolate: Today we have 98% petrol but let’s say in the future we have 50%. How on earth is the government going to plug the gaping hole in the petrol tax revenue? It’s not income tax or associated revenues but it is tax. Tax the electric pumps? How will the future generations want to work? Today’s new generation - the entitled generation- expect to be employed on their terms eg later starts, fewer hours but a livable wage. Is that cynical or real? I guess the tax system would cope as the p.a.y.e. or withholding tax would be deducted from their wage/ contract earnings. But what if they are self- employed on the net, being paid for content on their site perhaps banked into their PayPal account overseas - or paid by crypto currencies or some future concept. Future changes will occur rapidly, and we need a future tax system with that flexibility. How will the family cope, and how can the tax system help them? The nature of the family and relationships are constantly changing in our community and the tax system doesn’t seem to be keeping up. Working For Families is great – but when is the mother/father/parent in a relationship? When do you account for it in her/his calculation for WFF? How do you determine whether a relationship exists? Check on the rental agreement to see if both parties are named could be part of the answer. Check on the house title to see if both names are on it? What other avenues are available to generate tax income? Currently in most states in America there is some form of legislation that is making it’s way through the legislative process to allow for the consumption of marijuana, in small amounts, legally. The state taxes the weed and could collect large sums. Have you considered this? What other changes are on the horizon? In the medical world there is a thing called the “God key” which people believe could do away with the national health system. Once you take this magic pill you will never be ill? Fact or fantasy? Would the national health system buy the product – and, if so, who would they give it to? and for how much? a tax or a gift? If this is true, then the funding for health care say 70% of it could be allocated to the super fund. See below for a paragraph from an investment letter I receive. “you see, there are only a few companies that hold the key patents to this entire technology... so as this breakthrough soars, three small companies could potentially go even higher. all the details on this brand-new biotechnology are in my new video presentation, "the biggest medical breakthrough since antibiotics." in this presentation, i'll introduce you to the biotech breakthrough i call the "god key." and i'll show you why right now is the best time to get involved. getting in early can make a world of difference, and I show you exactly what you need to do today. click here to access my new video presentation. Regards, What about the future of robotics and the change in the way we work? Robotics and AI are the buzz words of the moment. If jobs disappear because robots are replacing human beings how will the state deal with the lack of p.a.y.e. income? Tax the robotic companies?? Well how about taxing the businesses that use them and charge them (the P.A.Y.E) the same amount they would be paying a real person. The Revenue and Audits. Another issue that is not covered is the way the Revenue actually deals with an average member of the public when they have an audit. Most of the audits appear to be standardised and solved within a 4-5-week period. But others drag on and on. This is a disadvantage to the taxpayer- and certainly not fair- as it involves them paying large sums of money to resolve the issue. During this process the Revenue insists that the taxpayer or agent responds almost immediately but when you request the same response from the IRD , they say it will take between 4-5 weeks!! That is grossly unfair. What I would like to see is a commitment by the IRD to respond to all businesses/individuals on matters that are not complex (oops that might be a problem- how would you define this?) To resolve the audit within say 12 weeks , where both parties are required to respond to correspondence within 2 weeks of receiving it, and accepting email as a means of corresponding. \[1\] One strange thing under the income Tax Act There are a few anomalies in the Income Tax Act , but there is not enough time to list them all. BUT there is one I would love you guys to fix. The main principle with the Income Tax Act is to collect as much tax as possible. There are many self-employed people that are slow paying their personal income Tax From N.D Salaries .( No Tax deducted) Within my business we try to encourage our client to pay. So what we do is to put them onto a salary when they own the company. Plus give them an N.D salary as well. This is strictly wrong. But achieves the goal of them regularly paying tax. In some case if this did not happen they would not be able to pay the tax. Generally , people live up to their income. So what I would ask of you is to :- ENSURE THE INCOME TAX ACT HAS AN AMENDMENT TO ALLOW A SHAREHOLDER EMPLOYER TO BE PAID A SALARY AS WELL AS A N.D. SALARY WHEN WE PREPARE THE YEAR END ANNUAL ACCOUNTS FOR THE COMPANY. Why do we need any more taxes? Haven’t we got enough?? Or is there a social agenda?? SEE APPENDIX RE HOW TAXES ARE AND HOW I WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE. APPENDIX 1 AND 2 As shown above there are so many direct and indirect ways the members of society are taxed by the government of the day not just income tax, GST or company tax. But surely you must also ask the question of how does Government spend what the IRD have collected? There are many cases for independent reviews of the government departments that spend money like water. If we have a review of the tax system we should also have a review of how the government spends the money. Why increase the collection of taxes when more effective allocation of the tax money can produce a better result? I acknowledge the Audit office is supposed to do some of this work – but that’s a Government Department. I would prefer to see an independent entity undertaking this task. One where the senior staff hold office for a limited time . One that has teeth , that can stop or fine a Government department for overspending. There must be a carrot and stick approach for the Government as well ! So, we are all crystal ball gazing and when it gets too hard, we come back to the old chestnuts. The five pages of documents provide a too simplistic view of the tax system but at the same time, you are channeling the majority of the submissions into dealing with these limiting questions. So here goes let’s try and deal with some of the questions you have raised in your 5 tax pages. What we tax and what we don’t no : 1 A brief review of the taxes, then a brief suggestion of what other things should be taxed. I say the system is fine, don’t add any more direct taxes. What tax issues matter to me most. no 2 Again, here your website briefly shows what is and isn’t taxed. Capital gains tax O.k. the overseas treatment is different but, what’s wrong with being different? This attracts investment and strengthens our economy helping our construction and associated industries, I believe that whichever party brings this in will be a one term government. Don’t go there for property. Well actually Government already has, and it’s called the bright line test! For gold – hey why not, but how do you keep a record of who has what? I don’t want another department created to monitor it unless it is run effectively and efficiently. I have no idea how you would monitor this form of tax. Land tax Why? Don’t we have enough revenue off land already? Rates --- no. Progressive company taxes Interesting concept, so why have the Aussies back tracked on it? Be kind of fun if we can run it better than the Aussies. But here you would have to make sure it is targeted to the right group. Small businesses have many difficulties to face, so a helping hand by say an education wing of the government could help, and not the i.r.d., as they instill fear into a lot of people. I suggest you look at a rate of 10% for new companies, in a new business, (not existing businesses) for a maximum of 5 years. In addition to this the government, using big data, could determine the cause of failure in small businesses and provide education material to trusted advisors such as accountants to run educational seminars. As part of accepting the registration for a new company there would be a requirement to attend one of these seminars , then within the 5-year window a minimum of one seminar each year. A voucher could be given by the government for the first 3 years, then after year 3 the companies would have to pay a market rate. But they could not be able to renew their company registration unless they got a third party confirmation that they have attended a training seminar. Taxing the environment What a lovely idea, but I can see six green people in a room and no-one can make up their mind how it works!! So, what is the social, environmental goal here? to tax the farmers? to keep our streams clean? Isn’t that a local body concern not a tax concern?? How do you quantify the fart (methane) emissions from farm animals and how do you tax it? we all do it, do we all have to pay a tax? So, my suggestion is that you look at a natural solution. There must be some plants that absorb methane, so there could be incentives to plant these to offset the gases. In Saturday’s Herald (dated 14-4-18) there is an article about the green initiative, they have been given 100 million already. I guess this has come from the main pool of taxes collected. So, the Green party has their source of funds already. GST Love it on everything with a few exceptions, otherwise it creates a job for lawyers and accountants trying to fit everything into the exceptions. It is still not perfect but not far from it. Keep it as it is , or increase it by 1-2% Although a small selection of our clients constantly getting it wrong. hopefully by mistake. We correct it and advise out clients. no 3 What is the purpose of taxes? As mentioned earlier the purposes change over time, depending on the government goal and policy commitments, so is this a political question? If so, why is it here? I believe I am in a democracy – well – I hope I am. So, I want to make my own choices about what I do. A tax should be something that we can firstly choose to accept then be adopted by the Government of the day. Hopefully most people will accept it as we like our hospitals, our roads etc. If they do not see the connection than it should be part of the school curriculum. To me taxes are a way to fund government, not an open cheque book, but a limited resource that should be allocated effectively and efficiently. Naturally the system should be simple Where things such as drugs (tobacco) and alcohol are involved a form of tax should be applied as they appear to be high users in our hospital system. but I would want a direct flow of the tax money to go into hospitals and drug rehabilitation. For future targeted taxes an internet-based referendum could be appropriate I don’t think everyone is happy when the government says this is bad, so we will heavily tax it. With the sugar thing If there is an argument to say sugar is bad for us, then there should be a change in the quantities of sugar in the products. It should not be an excuse for another tax. So, I do not believe taxing high levels of sugar is the right thing to do. Hopefully the consumer will see it is not good and change their buying behavior. So, no, but educate. no 4 The future environment Changing demographics- it has always been known! I guess this is how we tax the old to be able to maintain good level of supporting services. This age group have paid their taxes, for over 15 years each Government in power knew of this bump In the population . So why didn’t they contribute more to the super fund? So that the generation who would benefit were taxed accordingly . Surely it is better to increase the number of people that are of working age than to tax the older age group who have already been taxed. My suggestion is: - Make Kiwisaver compulsory so that future generations depend on this and use the superannuation fund to pay for the older group. Please note that previous governments have not contributed to the super fund and decided to spend our money in a different way. So, government, contribute more into the super fund for this age group. Don’t tax them. If you must tax, then delay super so people receive this when they are say 70 onwards. Encourage older people to work longer, provide them with an annual tax refund using a rebate system. As confirmed by an Article in the Herald dated the 16-4-18 page A3 –“Kiwis can’t afford to quit”-work longer . Tax the politician’s pensions , the people that made these decisions , not to put the correct funding into the Super fund . Maori and the future. I guess we are talking about the Treaty of Waitangi issues here. Surely Maori values should be New Zealand values. Are we not all new Zealanders? Recently it has been said “The Tainui iwi body, a significant landholder with a thriving corporate business, is one of the wealthiest registered charities in New Zealand. Announcing a $137.8 million profit for the 2017 financial year, Waikato-Tainui has come under fire from some parts of society for paying $12,000 income tax in 2016.” So , they too should not be charities and be taxed like every other business. At a trust tax rate , that’s 33 c in the dollar. The changing nature of work As indicated earlier in this paper the methods of payment may vary in the future. If you are paid by bitcoin today can the revenue track it? Rather, support the bitcoin exchange so you can capture the data and tax the income? The tax system must be adaptable and move quickly with the future changes. If people are paid via PayPal, then you need to gain access to the PayPal accounts and see if the individuals or companies are trading. If so, then tax their income. Environmental challenges Do you mean climate change or pollution in the streams and oceans? What are you trying to achieve? With climate change we need to first acknowledge it, perhaps teach it in schools so that people understand the reasons behind the tax if any. With streams and the ocean - again aren’t you covering an area that local bodies should act upon? Not a tax issue. With the oceans, send out the navy to collect the masses of plastic, put on a plastic tax on companies that manufacture plastic items. Then use this money to reward people to recycle the plastic. Charge overseas fleets that fish in our oceans, legally, an environmental tax for the mess they dump back into the sea. Locate, and impound ships that illegally fish in our waters. Then sell the ships providing a percentage to the navy and a percentage to environmental purposes. Technology As mentioned earlier the tax system must be flexible and able to change with the changing times. So, any new business model imported from overseas must be licensed in some way for the government/local body to be aware of the effect on the current economy. With Uber, registration and thus tax on the income With Air B&B a charge to the owner/user that is put back say into tourism. It is impossible to foresee the changes, but someone needs to monitor the trends. We are not, normally the first to use something new so look at the economies around the world. See what is developing and be proactive not post active. Improved productivity What is wrong with relatively poor productivity? Robots should increase productivity . If we are low, in global terms, and this is seen as an important issue then the government must, in some way help business in some way . Perhaps through the business owners trusted advisors, such as accountants. Inequality Through time immemorial there is always someone who feels that they are not equal. Once it was the serfs, then the middle class, then women and gosh now the gay community. There is no quick fix to solve these issues. Over time the government did not support the suffragette movement , they raised their profile and overtime establish their identity. In our current society social media is used to raise concerns. Trump’s organisation used it to win an election. Why doesn’t the state use big data to establish the county’s concerns. Then, depending on the ruling government use the various arms of government to identify the issues and assist financially and educationally to help resolve the inequality. With any legislation the concept is good, but the delivery is difficult. Working For Families is a social piece of legislation to help those in need and hopefully the children. Great in concept but hard to recover the money for partners that will not pay a fair share. Education should play a part, instill in people that if they have children then they have an obligation to support them. If not in person then financially. Enable the Revenue to use a number tools to encourage defaulters to pay their rightful obligations. To act promptly, not months or years after the debt has accumulated. Globalisation Well it’s not new, everyone loves a deal so if it is cheaper by buying from overseas everyone should have this choice. My solution to the potential loss of tax revenue (gst) is to legislate so that any overseas purchase the individual would be charged the g.s.t. by the bank. They do it with an overseas charge at the moment so why can’t they add the g.s.t.? then pay this to the Revenue. The hole in this, would be if the individual or company has an account overseas and use these funds to pay for the imported items. So as mentioned earlier you need access to these accounts. Can tax make housing more affordable? I guess this is the hot potato of this current and past government What has it got to do with tax?? Property has always been hard to buy, you have to give up a little of your lifestyle to have a future benefit of a mortgage free home. I sometimes wonder if the current generation can’t give up anything but they can find the money to pour into their cars!! So, they want to be given the funding for a home! Is this the entitled generation speaking? Perhaps you could bring back the capitalisation of the family benefit. as a deposit on a home. As well as providing a deduction of the interest from the first home mortgage for a limited time period. No more than 3 years. This interest deduction could also be given to the parents if they funded their children into homes - Enable Kiwisaver’s to use the total value of their Kiwisaver Account in full , without question to purchase a new home. Capitalise the family benefit and give an interest deduction incentives to new home owners and their parents Don’t tax houses - particularly those owned for investment. Who else provides a home for someone who cannot or does not wish to buy their own house?

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Tax Working Group Submissions from Allen Cookson What d oes the future of tax look like to you? Tax rates might eventually be lower, mainly because of reduced defensive expenditures (crime, avoidable health problems, etc.), more efficient monitoring of adherence to regulations and reduced circular money flows in the public sector. Tax to pay for reforms which will in time greatly reduce defensive expenditures can be regarded as sound investments with good returns. However Statistics NZ projected NZ’s total dependency ratio (sum of the 0–14 and 65+ dependency ratios) to increase from 53 per 100 in 2016, to be in the range of 60 –70 per 100 in 2035. Without dramatic changes such as automation and administrative efficiencies, this portends high tax, unless defensive costs can be greatly reduced. What is the purpose of tax? 1. Providing government with money to carry out its tasks. 2. Deterring undesirable economic, environmental and social activities and raising revenue to encourage and subsidize desirable environmental and social activities. Are we taxing the right things? It may be possible to reduce or remove some taxes such as company tax, personal tax and GST by establishing or increasing road tolls, visitor tax, fuel tax, royalties It would be worth considering removing GST on local government rates. Financial transactions tax (FTT)(<ca.0.1%) might raise $1B per annum if the rate is low enough. Flight of capital from the country could be deterred by reducing company tax. We approve of investment because it creates wealth and employment. Speculation shifts wealth from some people to others. There may be no gain from this. There are too many skilled people involved in sometimes too active share and money markets. What tax issues matter most to you? Kiwis travelling overseas are appalled to see ads inviting investors to make tax-free capital gains on real estate in NZ. Non-residents should be forbidden to purchase land or existing houses/flats/apartments. Opening housing and land to a global capital market inflates the price of these. Overpriced farms are less profitable because of the debt servicing burden. There should be a substantial capital gains tax (CGT) payable on sale of a residential property which was bought subsequent to introduction of the tax. This tax should be applied to family homes and rental housing. Exclusion of family homes would weaken the \[1\] price-controlling effect of CGT. CGT would diminish the present practice of using covenants in housing developments which maintain unaffordability of houses. Such practices include approving only large houses (They have a low cost per area, but their large size makes them unaffordable.) Covenants also ban kitset houses which are cheaper and can include several models which provide variety. Local geography such as slope and aspect will require some variety even in kitset homes. I think the guidelines to the working group seem to imply that the nature and level of tax can be decided to fit a budget without considering non-tax measures which could relieve fiscal stress. Following here are more detailed suggestions including non-tax measures for limiting or reducing tax while increasing welfare. Alcohol abuse A 2009 report by BERL (Business and Economics Research Limited) commissioned by the Ministry of Health and ACC, estimated the social costs of alcohol abuse conservatively at $4.8 billion, not much less than total agricultural output at the time. An additional $661M social cost was attributed to joint alcohol and other drug use which could not be separated. Methodological considerations in the research make it almost certain that the true cost is significantly higher. Revenue from the alcohol excise is $795M a year, so non-drinkers and moderate drinkers are generously subsidizing the liquor industry and alcohol abusers though personal and other taxes which are passed on to consumers of goods and services in general as higher prices. If the social costs of alcohol abuse were reduced by preventing excessive individual consumption, tax/excise that is spent on dealing with harmful consequences of over indulgence could be reduced, eliminated or deployed in more beneficial directions. BERL hasn’t attempted to estimate benefits of alcohol consumption. They were castigated for this by then University of Canterbury economist Eric Crampton, and of course the liquor industry. (Crampton was later hired by the liquor industry.) The government hadn’t contracted BERL to quantify the benefits. If we want to estimate the benefit of alcohol consumption we could use the willingness to pay (WTP), i.e. how much is spent on alcoholic beverages. This wouldn’t impress someone with permanent pain and brain damage as a result of an encounter with a drunk driver. If you regard WTP as a valid measure of benefit, to be consistent you would have to consider use of illegal drugs cocaine and P as possibly having net benefit as in a place controlled by drug cartels. Suppose liquor purchases could only be made with a special EFTPOS card which rejected exceeding a weekly alcohol cap which could not be accumulated from week to week. There would be a separate bar code giving the alcohol content of each item. The objective of preventing excessive consumption would almost certainly be achieved. Some would save up their allowance for a splurge at one weekend, but they should be wary of any criminal behaviour linked with alcohol consumption, which would see the offender unable to purchase alcoholic beverages for the rest of their life, though friends would be allowed to share small portions of their own purchases with the offender. A card’s issue would depend upon age, criminal record and not assisting problem drinkers without a card to become intoxicated. Banks would charge card holders setting up and running costs. A card would be deactivated at a bank if the holder were convicted of an alcohol related offence. The present situation, where irresponsible adults supply teenagers, would cease, firstly because the adults have a very limited purchase right, and secondly, they know they prejudice their own right to purchase if they supply underage drinkers. Special applications for large purchases by card holders who wish to supply alcohol at a function could be covered by a bond refundable if no guests committed alcohol related offences. Trouble would see the card holder denied further such purchases. Along with the above reform the alcohol excise should be greatly reduced or even abolished, so that moderate drinkers manufactures and retailers gain some extra benefit from the much larger reduction in abuse costs. This, unlike increasing alcohol tax, reduces the incentive for illegal /importing or manufacture of alcoholic beverages and would make the proposal more politically acceptable to consumers, local manufacturers and the Hospitality Association. I would see hobby brewers and wine makers having a permit which forbids sale of the product. Supply would be limited to family and close friends. Breach of the conditions of the permit would result in a fine, loss of the permit and confiscation of equipment. In short this suggestion reduces consumption of a harmful substance by regulation, not price. The evidence is clear that addicts are undeterred by high price. No matter if their kids starve! The liquor industry would produce and sell less alcohol at higher net price. This legislation would not affect liquor exports but would affect imports. Reducing Crime 55% of New Zealand prisoners report experiencing domestic trauma. “The recently completed survey on the comorbidity of substance use disorders and mental health disorders among New Zealand prisoners showed that 52 percent of female prisoners, and 22 percent of male prisoners have a lifetime diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).”Bevan,Marian 2017.New Zealand Prisoners’ Exposure to Trauma. Practice: The New Zealand Corrections Journal. Vol. 5. The cost of New Zealand domestic violence (probably linked to alcohol consumption) has been estimated to exceed the value of the agriculture, forestry and fisheries industries combined The authors claim robustness of their evidence for this statement. Herbert, Ruth and MacKenzie, Deborah.2014.The Way Forward. An Integrated System for Intimate Partner Violence and Child Abuse and Neglect in New Zealand. Impact Collective. It is commonly stated that the cost of imprisonment is about $100,000 per prisoner per annum. Research has revealed heritable changes in the expression of a person’s underlying genome. This epigenetics can include switching on expression of alcohol addiction and obesity. So, exposure of a foetus to alcohol or a high blood sugar environment in utero can produce heritable alcoholism or obesity. As research continues, harmful inherited damage from recreational drugs such as p and cannabis can be expected to be revealed. In many cases there is no prospect of undoing the damage done. Those who care for such children know the difficulties they face. Even the most skilled carers are challenged. Some foster children become dangerous to other children and adults. Without government action, epigenetic damage will impose multibillion dollar extra economic costs on NZ. Sugar taxes, abolition of alcopops, and sterilization of binge drinkers and users of banned recreational drugs must be given serious consideration. Otherwise a dependency ratio insupportable by productive taxpayers is unavoidable. Diabetes and Obesity Opponents of a sugar tax appear to favour heavy taxation of responsible, healthy, productive people to fund treatment of unproductive, obese, accident-prone and/or diabetic people whose condition was self-inflicted or the result of irresponsible parenting. Sugar tax is best regarded as health insurance and supported living payment premiums not as a means of reducing sugar consumption. Those who pay the most will be most likely to draw upon government funded medical treatment for themselves and their children. If there were a single importer of sugar who supplied the NZ food industry and sugar retailers, administration of a sugar tax on the bulk imports would be simple. Testing for sugar in imported biscuits, chocolate, etc. would involve costly sampling and testing. This cost should be added to the sugar excise/tax levied on the importer. According to medical professionals working in the field excessive sugar consumption will probably impose multibillion dollar health and other costs on our economy in the near future. Intergenerational Morbidity The present situation of family generation of epigenetic damage and parental abuse and neglect-induced trauma is a positive feedback loop. Children born to a mother using harmful substances at dangerous levels may be mentally damaged. If their childhood experience is of a chaotic, violent home, these children are more likely to model this in their adulthood than children from peaceful, nurturing homes. This follows in succeeding generations. In some such homes the malignant positive feedback is magnified by there being a large number of children with a number of fathers most likely absent. Several studies around the world have shown that children of unplanned pregnancies are more likely than those from planned pregnancies to be abused or neglected The advent of birth control methods has brought about demographic transition where average family size has dropped. There are several medical products which can be implanted in women/girls to render them infertile for several years. It seems likely that a corresponding procedure for men/boys will soon be available. My view is that in the most serious cases where potential parent(s) are clearly unable to provide a safe environment for children, the state should have the power to temporarily sterilize potential mothers. Legal and medical oversight to prevent exceeding of reasonable rights of the girl/ woman would be part of the system. If a woman demonstrates incorrigible irresponsibility, this indicates a need for repeat compulsory sterilization until menopause. The most important reason for this policy is prevention of children being born into a life of misery. It will produce a positive feedback where child abuse and neglect declines at an increasing rate. This will in turn strengthen the economy, enabling lower taxes or more expenditure to increase welfare. ENDS

Page 1 of 10 Submission to the Tax Working Group (“TWG”) “It doesn’t matter whether a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice”-Deng Xiaoping From: Arthur Jacobson Enrolled Barrister and Solicitor of the High Court of New Zealand Chartered Accountant (CAANZ) My Experience I have worked in Tax for 40 years including 28 years for the Big 4 in New Zealand, London and Hong Kong and for 12 years with Reuters Ltd, an FTSE 100 company, latterly as Group Tax Manager, responsible for Group tax affairs in all OECD economies (and many others). My submission is made on the basis of this practical experience and hence deals with all the set criteria except “equity and fairness”; while I fully understand that this is as important as the other 5 criteria, my lack of expertise means that I cannot usefully comment on it. Summary of Major Points and Recommendations 1. As a general observation and as noted by the TWG, our current system is simple (in tax everything is relative!), broad based and low rate. It stands up well against other OECD tax regimes and, almost uniquely, produces a budget surplus and impressively low debt/GDP. In other words; it works. Why would we want to break it in a quest for an unattainable perfection? Specific submissions follow. 2. A capital gains tax will introduce commercial inefficiencies and technical complications out of proportion to its fiscal benefits. If the real target is the widely referenced “speculator”, then enforcing the current law relating to acquisitions subsequently “flipped” would go a long way towards meeting the objective. A useful simplifying change to ensure compliance would be to replace the current (hard to prove) subjective intention test with a rollout of the real estate bright line test across all asset categories. If real estate is the specific target, ring-fence income losses. 3. However, if a full capital gains tax must be introduced, it should be on a realised basis with capital losses ring-fenced. The tax rate imposed should decrease with length of holding and/or a system of rollover relief should be utilised. 4. A global wealth tax would not meet the noted criteria, particularly “revenue integrity”. If a diversification away from income and consumption taxes is absolutely essential, a land tax is preferable, albeit flawed. 5. A narrowing of GST should be avoided at all costs. The complexity and inefficiencies of boundary issues outweighs any benefits. Any social relief from perceived unfairness should be addressed by increased benefit payments perhaps funded by a rise in the GST rate. Page 2 of 10 6. Some or all input from Treasury will be based on macro-economic cycle impacts on societal wholes or classes. To this extent it is inapplicable to the detail of annual/transactional tax assessed at the micro-level on individuals and single legal entities. Treasury submissions on micro issues should, therefore, be carefully critiqued. Similarly, consideration of submissions from professionals (such as lawyers and accountants) should bear in mind that their income is inversely proportional to the “efficiency”, “integrity” and “coherence” of the tax system! 7. Lastly, a general warning. Introducing necessarily complicated capital gains tax, wealth tax or revised GST regimes would threaten self-assessment by increasing complexity. It would encourage non-compliance, both deliberate and inadvertent: how many taxpayers fully understand the current realised/unrealised capital gains tax on financial arrangements or the FDR/CV FIF regimes; both of which taxpayers have a legal obligation to self-assess? How would even an expanded IRD cope? Page 3 of 10 Detailed Submissions Capital Gains Tax/Stamp Duty • In my experience, where there is a capital gains tax, all planning activity is around how to avoid/minimise this rather than achieving a rational economic structure. Thus a large amount of commercial activity is wasted for a tax which, typically, collects insubstantial revenue. • If the target of a capital gains tax is the widely referenced “speculator”, then current law exists in the form of subjecting to income tax any profit on the sale of property acquired with the intention of disposal. The current problem with this law is proving requisite intent. An easy fix to this problem is a rollout, across all asset classes, of the bright line test now applicable to real property only. This would obviate the need for a capital gains tax targeted at speculators. • If the specific target is real estate arbitrage between income losses and capital gains, then ring fence income losses. At a minimum this would prevent any income tax subsidisation of capital gains. • Thus, I believe, there is no cost/benefit basis for a general capital gains tax and it should be avoided unless absolutely required on “equity and fairness” grounds (which I do not comment on). • My remaining submissions assume that a capital gains tax will be introduced and are suggestions on how to design this to ensure minimum economic and personal disruption: o It should only be imposed on a realised basis. Unrealised taxation might currently cope (just) for financial arrangements where interest rate, and hence market value, movements are glacial and the assets are typically liquid. But for other assets it could be ruinous; think bitcoin volatility and see my attached real world example as submitted to the FEC in 2006. For the draft foreign equity FIF rules, Treasury had opined that an unrealised tax on market value changes was merely an appropriate proxy for income over time. This completely ignored the annual assessment scheme of our tax system and that losses cannot be carried back (only forward). My real world example showed that, in the context of the 2000 dotcom crash, by merely holding all the Reuters shares that I acquired while employed by Reuters (ie. no acquisitions or sales), I would hold shares worth $36,000 but have a tax bill of $100,000. Luckily, The Hon. Shane Jones, then FEC chairman, saw the absurdity of the Treasury position and introduced the 5% FDR alternative to unlimited market value changes/CV. I trust the TWG will likewise see through nonsensical ivory tower submissions by Treasury and its ilk (see below). o To avoid ossification of asset holdings, bright line tests such as are currently used for real property should be introduced but in bands; eg owned up to 12 months-100% taxed; 12- 36 months-75% taxed;36-60 months-50% taxed and so on. Clearly, a necessary component of such a system, to avoid gaming, would be a ring fencing of capital losses. Page 4 of 10 o Alternatively, or additionally, a wide rollover relief basis could be used. By way of analogy you might buy an apple tree to make income off the fruit. You then find your soil is no good for an apple tree, so you want to buy a pear tree of equal value but prices of fruit trees have generally risen and capital gains tax payable on a sale of the apple tree prevents changing. So you are forced to remain engaged in sub-optimal apple growing. Rollover relief ameliorates this position and tax is typically collected as assets are cashed in, say on retirement or death. This is more equitable and prevents distortion of economic activity but revenue collection is delayed. • A stamp duty likewise ossifies both commercial and private (real estate, vehicles etc) transactions. It would require a costly new enforcement regime to prevent commercial avoidance by, eg, overseas signature of commercial contracts. Also, in the professional units of my legal qualification (mid-1970’s) it was noted that “gentlemen don’t make stamping objections”; ie. unstamped documents were not enforceable in Court but blind eyes were turned to this. In practice only resident individuals are punished by a stamp duty making it even harder to afford a house (see recent UK developments as an example) or other stampable assets. Wealth/Land Tax • A wealth tax on all assets would be complicated and, with exchange controls long abolished, could lead to assets being hidden abroad. This, in turn, could lead to reductions in other tax collection (ie no declared dividends or rent from hidden shares/property). NB: The 5% FDR rate on FIFs is effectively a current wealth tax on foreign holdings of equities. • Thus, again, a wealth tax should be avoided unless absolutely required by “equity and fairness”. • If required, it should take the form of a Land Tax on New Zealand land only. While less fair than a whole of wealth tax, collection would be simple and uncomplicated with no evasion possible. Presumably those paying this tax could spread it over the economy generally through increased rents etc but this area is outside my field of expertise. A Narrowing of GST • Increasing exemptions from GST to lower the cost of food, sanitary products etc should be avoided at all costs. This leads to interminable boundary issues, ie large “compliance and administration costs”. Rather, if absolutely necessary, GST should be increased and the extra revenue collected passed, via some mechanism, to those suffering from the GST imposts on the targeted items. • Boundary issues cannot be avoided. While I worked in the UK, there were court cases over whether a traditionally named “Jaffa Cake” was, in fact, a “cake” and therefore exempt “food” or, rather, taxable “confectionary”. Also, to tax takeaway food, there was a rule that food sold above ambient room temperature was taxable. Supermarkets and bakeries put Page 5 of 10 bread straight from the oven onto their shelves to lure customers with baking aromas. Was it taxable for the 1 st 30 minutes while hot and thereafter exempt?; always taxable?; always exempt? In another case cold food consumed on premises was taxable but if taken home to eat was exempt. So what happens if a sandwich shop customer tells the counter staff they are taking the sandwich out (therefore exempt) but then sits at the counter and eats it. Do they have to accost the customer and demand VAT/GST? There are endless examples! Treasury and Professional Firms: A Warning • I have encountered a number of economic bodies including the nonsense produced by NZ Treasury in support of 100% annual unrealised taxation of FIFs as an earnings proxy (see appendix). The problem appears to be that Treasuries (the EDB in Singapore is an exception) think over multi-year economic cycles and fundamentally consider the macro impact of these on society or societal classes/groups as a whole. Tax is an annual (or, for GST, transaction by transaction) impost charged at the micro level on individuals and other single legal entities. In my view, Treasury economists have no understanding of any of the 6 noted criteria necessary in a real world tax regime. The production of graphs, flow charts and endless strings of equations does not affect this assertion. • The issue with professional firms (lawyers and accountants) is almost the opposite. They fully understand the criteria and, in particular, “efficiency”, “revenue integrity” and “coherence”. The issue is that their level of earnings from tax advice services is inversely proportional to a tax regime meeting such criteria. Any submissions from professional firms should bear in mind the inherent underlying financial motivation and should be particularly assessed in light of the criterion of “compliance and administration costs”. Complexity/Threat to Self-Assessment • Any of the above-mentioned considered changes (except a land tax) would inevitably increase the complexity of the NZ tax system which, currently, relies on self-assessment with selected IRD audits to keep taxpayers honest. • A large number of taxpayers would not comprehend that the new taxes affect them and would just ignore them (as do a lot of cash basis taxpayers with the current financial arrangement rules). Given IRD resources, in the vast majority of cases there would be no consequences. The net result would be that diligent taxpayers who understood their liabilities would be penalised relative to the ignorant who just ignored any new taxes. • Partially as a result of this, the current self-assessment system would be under threat. The IRD would need returns from stockbrokers as to share transactions, from banks regarding all off-shore transactions (assets hidden from wealth tax) etc. but would struggle to collate all this data to determine who should be subject to the exponentially larger number of audits necessary. Page 6 of 10 Summary • We are a small country with a limited IRD resource. We cannot afford or effectively administer an overly complicated tax regime. We have a current tax regime that is fair to taxpayers and produces government surpluses at appropriate points in the economic cycle and has, relative to jurisdictions with capital gains and wealth taxes and with stamp duties, produced low government debt to GDP • Fine-tuning is appropriate such as rolling out bright line tests in order effectively to tax speculation. However, it would be ruinous to overreact and destroy the working tax system we currently have. “Plain goose lays gold eggs Wring neck, buy preening peacock Siren call! no eggs!” With apologies to Basho Matsuo Page 7 of 10 Appendix: 2006 Submission to FEC re Proposed FIF Regime To the Finance and Expenditure Committee on the Taxation (Annual Rates, Savings Investment, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill Introduction 1 This submission is from Arthur Jacobson. 2 I wish to appear before the Committee to speak to my submission and can be contacted as per the letter attaching this submission. 3 In 1997, after 17 years abroad, I returned to New Zealand on the basis of being able to fund my retirement with a balanced diversified portfolio under then existing tax laws. While abroad, I largely practiced in the field of international tax and am a Chartered Accountant (NZICA) and a Barrister and Solicitor (High Court of NZ). 4 I, therefore, believe that I am qualified to comment on the Offshore Investment rules being proposed from both professional and personal points of view. Submission 1 I have spent 14 years working as a tax consultant for “Big 8”/Big 4” accounting firms in New Zealand, Hong Kong and London and also 12 years in the London based Head Office tax department of Reuters Ltd, the final 6 as Reuters “Group International Tax Manager” in which position I was responsible for the tax function in all major OECD economies. 2 Some countries have capital gains taxes and some do not. 3 Those that do, levy them on a full range of assets, not on a narrow class which distorts rational retirement planning. Page 8 of 10 4 Where there is a capital gains tax, it is levied on actual capital gains. It is not, by voodoo economics, called a tax on proxy earnings and then levied on unrealised changes in value. If proxy earnings were truly what is being taxed, then a standard return or published “earnings per share” approach could readily have been adopted. 5 I am often consulted by UK based colleagues who I know from my time there, both New Zealand expats and Brits, about emigrating to New Zealand. 6 In the past, I have been enthusiastic about recommending New Zealand. Now I tell them that if they are happy to invest exclusively in the volatile Australasian equities market or in real estate, they will be welcome. 7 If, on the other hand, they wish to maintain a balanced international equity portfolio, they must suffer vicious and discriminatory taxation and be prepared to be marginalised by the government as “high net worth individuals ready to take out full page advertisements in the major dailies”, ie not “real New Zealanders” worthy of equitable treatment. 8 “Real New Zealanders”, lulled into the sense that the new rules only affect undeserving fat cats, then fall into the trap by putting their money into diversified managed funds. These funds then, “under the sheets”, pay the government the same unrealised capital gains tax and also deduct fund manager fees, generally levied on gross funds rather than profits. 9 The “real New Zealander” then reaches retirement and wonders why her/his investments have lagged market indices by such a huge margin and why they are unable to afford a comfortable retirement. 10 This treatment will not be tolerated for long. Eventually even more people will realise that, with real estate, they can pay no tax due to depreciation, there is no capital gains tax and, if they use agents, they will pay fees of a single digit percentage of actual revenue, not a fee based on the gross value of the property. It really is a no-brainer! 11 Turning to my personal position, during my 17 years in the UK, I built up a portfolio of diversified international funds. As UK tax resident but not UK domiciled, I could hold non-UK funds entirely tax free. I also acquired shares in my employer, Reuters Ltd. 12 I decided to return to New Zealand because of a young family and checked that tax on diversified investments, while more than in the UK, was fair: due to the Grey List, it was. 13 Upon my return in 1997, I put my funds into a family trust. This was to protect my family; not for tax reasons, as 33% was then also the top tax rate for individuals. 14 When the new rules appeared in the Discussion Document, I checked how they would have affected an actual core holding of 12,500 shares in Reuters. The answer is that, under the new rules, even though my family trust had held the shares throughout with no sale, it would have faced a tax bill for either $126,845 (based on cost) or $83,110 (based on MV at date of return to Page 9 of 10 NZ) but the same Reuters shares would have a value of only $35,981 to meet this bill. Details are set out in the attached appendix. 15 How would it benefit the New Zealand economy to ruin taxpayers with a corrupt tax like this? All it will do is encourage evasion which, once started (and successful due to non-enforcement by IRD even of the existing FIF rules), will spread even to equitable taxes. 16 Personally, I do not want the hassle of acquiring and managing a real estate portfolio and do not want to risk my retirement to the volatile Australasian share market. Luckily, I have a flat in the UK and have right of entry. I can therefore bail when family circumstances permit; others might not be so fortunate. 17 In closing, I note that it is not a pretty sight for ministers and their allies, secure in their guaranteed taxpayer funded inflation linked pensions, to deprive any New Zealander of the opportunity of a similarly secure retirement. Page 10 of 10 Appendix Just before returning to New Zealand, I purchased 12,500 shares, under employee share schemes, in my employer of 12 years, Reuters Group PLC, intending to hold them long term in my family trust in view of the excellent dividend payout;  these cost me $55,000 (Stg 2(cost)\*12,500\*2.2(Stg/NZ$ on 30/4/96).  On the date of my return to NZ these were worth $210,917 (Stg 7.06 (MV) \*12,500\*2.39(Stg/NZ$ on 7/1/97).  On 31 March 2000, at the height of the dot.com boom, these were worth $507,210 (Stg 12.72(MV)\*12,500\*3.19(Stg/NZ$ on 31/3/2000).  On 31 March 2003, after the crash, they were worth $35,981 (Stg 1.01 (MV)\*12,500\*2.85(Stg/NZ$ on 31/3/03). Under the new rules, even though my family had held the shares throughout with no sale, it would have faced a tax bill for either $126,845 (based on cost) or $83,110 (based on MV at date of return to NZ) but had only related assets of $35,981 to meet this bill (the post 2000 losses would be useless as they could not be carried back).
