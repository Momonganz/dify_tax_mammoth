It is intended that Pillar One will replace unilateral digital services taxes.  Pillar Two aims to limit the ‘race to the bottom’ for large MNEs, where countries compete to attract mobile income (for example, interest, dividends and royalties) through offering low tax rates and tax incentives. It is also known as the global minimum tax. The Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules are the main component of Pillar Two. The rules are designed so that MNEs with annual revenues above €750 million pay a minimum 15% effective tax rate on their mobile income in every country where that income is earned. The GloBE rules are intended to apply to every in-scope MNE in the world, no matter where it has its headquarters, operations or sales. The design of the rules means this intention can be achieved even if many, or indeed most, countries do not adopt the rules, provided a critical mass of countries implement the GloBE rules (that is, enough adopt the rules that domestic MNEs cannot escape the tax by earning income only in countries that do not adopt them). The rules do this by allowing countries that adopt them to tax mobile income arising in other countries if that income is not subject to a 15% effective tax rate. This creates an incentive for countries to adopt the rules or increase their taxes on mobile income. The Bill gives legislative effect in New Zealand to the GloBE rules. The proposals in this Bill were subject to public consultation in May 2022. The term used in the Bill to describe New Zealand’s GloBE rules is the ‘Applied GloBE rules’, and the term used in the Bill for tax imposed under New Zealand’s Applied GloBE rules is the ‘Multinational Top-Up Tax’. The Applied GloBE rules consist of an Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) and an Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR). Together they will ensure that if a critical mass of other countries adopt the GloBE rules, such that New Zealand MNEs will need to comply with and pay GloBE tax whether New Zealand adopts the rules or not:  New Zealand will not lose GloBE tax revenue it is entitled to collect to other countries if it enacts the rules, and Date: May 2023 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  administration and compliance costs for in-scope New Zealand MNEs and the Government will be reduced. The application date for the Applied GloBE rules will be set by Order in Council once the Government determines that a critical mass of countries has adopted the GloBE rules. Such adoption seems very likely, though is not certain. This application date will not be earlier than 1 January 2024 for the IIR and 1 January 2025 for the UTPR.

Whether an MNE has obligations for Applied GloBE rules filing and (potentially) paying Multinational Top-Up Tax is determined by applying the OECD published Model Rules 1 as modified by schedule 25B to the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA), the Commentary, 2 and the Agreed Administrative Guidance, 3 which define what type of MNEs are in scope and what are the operative rules. The OECD, through the Inclusive Framework, will continue to publish Agreed Administrative Guidance, which will become part of New Zealand law. The proposed Applied GloBE rules have implications for both MNEs headquartered inside New Zealand and those outside New Zealand. For an MNE headquartered in New Zealand, or with a constituent entity (including a branch) located in New Zealand, t he proposed Applied GloBE rules require the MNE to:  Determine whether it is in scope for the GloBE rules, i.e. if it has an international presence and over €750 million in consolidated revenues in any two of the preceding four years (see proposed section HP 1(1) of the ITA and Chapter 1 of the Model Rules).  Determine whether any de minimis or safe harbour applies in each country where it operates (see Chapters 5 and 8 of the Model Rules and the OECD document “Safe Harbours and Penalty Relief” for the transitional safe harbours that apply to fiscal years ending on or before 30 June 2028).  Calculate its effective tax rate (ETR) in each country where it operates and a safe harbour does not apply ( see Chapters 3 to 7 and 9 of the Model Rules). 1 OECD (2021), Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two), available at www.oecd.org 2 OECD (2022), Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy – Commentary to the Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two), First Edition, available at www.oecd.org 3 OECD (2023), Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy – Administrative Guidance on the Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two), available at www.oecd.org Date: May 2023 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  Calculate mobile income by calculating the GloBE income in each country and reducing it by the substance-based income exclusion (SBIE). The SBIE is a carve-out based on tangible assets and payroll costs in a country (see Chapter 5 of the Model Rules).  Calculate the top-up tax if the ETR in a country is less than 15%. The top-up tax will bring the ETR on the MNE’s mobile income in that country up to 15% (see Chapter 5 of the Model Rules).  Pay Multinational Top-Up Tax to Inland Revenue for: o Foreign operations under the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR), 4 which applies when a New Zealand MNE earns the undertaxed income in another country (see Chapter 2 of the Model Rules). o New Zealand operations under the Domestic Income Inclusion Rule (DIIR), which applies when a New Zealand-headquartered MNE has undertaxed mobile income in New Zealand (see proposed schedule 25B of the ITA and Chapter 2 of the Model Rules). MNEs headquartered outside New Zealand could also be subject to a Multinational Top- Up Tax liability if they have an intermediate parent located in New Zealand or a liability under the Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR) 5 (see proposed schedule 25B of the ITA and Chapter 2 of the Model Rules). The Bill includes consequential amendments to deal with how the GloBE rules would interact with New Zealand tax law. These amendments propose that:  the Applied GloBE rules would apply, notwithstanding the terms of a tax treaty, unless those terms expressly refer to the GloBE rules (see proposed section BH 1(4C))  imputation credits would not be available for top-up taxes paid under the IIR and UTPR but would be available for taxes paid under the New Zealand Domestic Income Inclusion Rule (DIIR) (see proposed sections OB 7BB and OP 11BA), and  foreign tax credits would be available under subparts LJ and LK for top-up taxes paid under a foreign Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax (QDMTT) but not for top-up taxes paid under an IIR or UTPR (see proposed section LJ 3). 4 The IIR applies on a top-down basis, giving the ultimate parent entity country, or an intermediate parent entity country, the right to collect GloBE top-up tax for underlying foreign operations, unless the tax is collected in the foreign country under a Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax. 5 The UTPR is a back-up rule that applies when no parent is subject to the IIR. It allocates top-up tax to countries in proportion to the group’s payroll costs and tangible asset values in each country that adopts the GloBE rules. This ensures that if the country where an MNE has its headquarters does not implement GloBE rules, the MNE will still have to pay top-up tax.

They were released in December 2021 as the Model Rules and provide a template that jurisdictions can translate into domestic law. The release of the Model Rules was followed by the release of detailed commentary (the Commentary) to the rules in March 2022 and the first tranche of Agreed Administrative Guidance in February 2023. In some instances, the Commentary and Agreed Administrative Guidance modify provisions in the Model Rules. Further tranches of agreed administrative guidance will be periodically issued by the IF to supplement the Commentary by providing additional guidance on the interpretation and operationalisation of the Model Rules (including safe harbours). The further tranches of agreed administrative guidance may also effectively modify the Model Rules. If a country adopts the GloBE rules, it must adopt the Model Rules, Commentary and Agreed Administrative Guidance. Where a country’s legislation departs from the Model Rules, there is a risk its GloBE rules will not be “qualifying”, and other participating jurisdictions will continue to apply GloBE top-up tax to the country’s in-scope MNEs under the UTPR. To mitigate this risk in New Zealand, the GloBE rules will be incorporated into New Zealand legislation by reference to the Model Rules, Commentary and Agreed Administrative Guidance. In the limited areas where the rules need to be adapted, for example, to reflect concepts in New Zealand law like imputation credits and foreign tax credits, the adaptation will respect the intended outcomes agreed in the IF. Key features The key features of the proposed Applied GloBE tax rules include:  Incorporating the Model Rules, Commentary and Agreed Administrative Guidance developed by the OECD-sponsored Inclusive Framework into the ITA. This is done by reference to the rules, rather than by repeating or translating them in New Zealand law.  Changes to the ITA necessary to support the interpretation and implementation of the GloBE rules in New Zealand.  Consequential changes to the ITA necessary to ensure the Applied GloBE rules are “qualifying”.  A regulation-making power enabling the Governor-General to make Orders in Council providing for the GloBE rules to come into effect in New Zealand and to make regulations providing for the cancellation, reversal, or non-application of the Commentary or Agreed Administrative Guidance (including future tranches of agreed administrative guidance).

The application date for the Applied GloBE rules would be set by Order in Council once the Government determines that a critical mass of countries has adopted the GloBE rules. This would not be earlier than 1 January 2024 for the IIR and 1 January 2025 for the UTPR. Detailed analysis The proposals in the Bill would affect:  New Zealand-headquartered MNEs and their constituent entities (including branches) with over €750 million in global consolidated revenues, and  Foreign-headquartered MNEs with over €750 million in global consolidated revenues that have New Zealand operations or a New Zealand intermediate parent entity if a top-up tax is due to New Zealand under the UTPR or IIR in accordance with the GloBE rules. Multinational Top-Up Tax will be an ancillary tax Proposed section BF 1(b) provides that Multinational Top-Up Tax will be an “ancillary tax”, not income tax. As such, a separate administrative regime is proposed to deal with Multinational Top-Up Tax (see Item: “Amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994” below for further detail). This also means it will not fall in scope of the provisional tax regime. Multinational Top-Up Tax will override our double tax agreements The OECD has stated that the IIR and UTPR are both compatible with OECD model-based tax treaties, such as New Zealand’s. To avoid any uncertainty on this point, proposed section BH 1(4) provides that the GloBE rules adopted by New Zealand will apply notwithstanding the terms of a tax treaty, unless those terms expressly refer to the GloBE rules. Multinational Top-Up Tax will be payable by in-scope MNE Proposed section HP 1 is the charging provision for the Multinational Top-Up Tax. Proposed section HP 2 provides that top-up tax would be payable 20 months after the end of the first fiscal year in which the MNE becomes in-scope of the New Zealand rules. Thereafter, top-up tax will be payable 16 months after the end of an MNE’s fiscal year.

Section HP 3 is modified by schedule 25B. The Applied GloBE rules are treated as applying at a time consistently with the most recent commentary and guidance on the interpretation or administration of the GloBE rules published by the OECD before the start of the fiscal year in which the time falls. The Model Rules (Article 8.3.1) provide that the tax administration of an implementing jurisdiction shall, subject to any requirements of domestic law, apply the GloBE rules in accordance with any Agreed Administrative Guidance. This provision has been removed in schedule 25B to the ITA because proposed section HP 3 requires the Model Rules to be applied consistently with the Commentary and the Agreed Administrative Guidance. Consequently, where there is an inconsistency between the Model Rules and the Commentary or Agreed Administrative Guidance, it is the Commentary and Agreed Administrative Guidance that take precedence. For example, the Model Rules provide that Article 7.4.1 only applies to investment entities. The Commentary provides that Article 7.4.1 applies to investment entities and insurance investment entities. The correct outcome is that Article 7.4.1 applies to investment entities and insurance investment entities. Proposed section 226G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that the Governor- General, by Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue, shall make regulations providing for the cancellation, reversal, or non-application of a change to the Commentary or the Agreed Administrative Guidance (including future tranches). Although it is unlikely that this power will be used, it makes explicit the power of the New Zealand Parliament in the future to reject, in whole or in part, changes to the rules occurring at the level of the OECD. The Model Rules This Guidance Material item provides an overview of the Model Rules and how they would be implemented in New Zealand. Further detail on the Model Rules, Commentary and Agreed Administrative Guidance is available at the OECD website. 6 6 https://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/tax-challenges-arising-from-the-digitalisation-of-the-economy- global-anti-base-erosion-model-rules-pillar-two.htm Date: May 2023 19 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Chapter 1: Scope This Chapter discusses which types of entities are in scope for the Model Rules. The GloBE rules apply to MNEs that have consolidated annual revenues of at least €750 million in at least two of the last four fiscal years. The fiscal year is the period covered by the MNE group’s consolidated financial statements. Special rules exist to address situations when:  an MNE does not prepare consolidated financial statements  an MNE does not have four years of consolidated financial statements  one of the four preceding fiscal years is for a period other than 12 months, or  an MNE has undergone a merger or demerger. MNE groups The Ultimate Parent Entity (UPE) of an MNE group is the entity that owns – directly or indirectly – a controlling interest in any other entity but is not controlled – directly or indirectly – by another entity. The UPE is important because the IIR is applied at the UPE level in the first instance (if the UPE’s jurisdiction has a qualified IIR), and the UPE’s consolidated financial statements determine what entities are within the group. An ‘MNE group’ is a group with at least one entity or permanent establishment (PE) that is not located in the jurisdiction of the UPE. Regardless of size, a group that is located entirely within one jurisdiction with no offshore subsidiaries or PEs is therefore outside the scope of the GloBE rules. A member of an MNE group is referred to as a ‘Constituent Entity’ of the group. Excluded entities The following entities are excluded from the GloBE rules:  Governmental entities.  International organisations.  Non-profit organisations.  Pension funds.  Investment funds that are UPEs.  Real estate investment vehicles that are UPEs. An entity owned by an excluded entity can also qualify as an excluded entity if it meets certain criteria relating to its ownership, assets and income.

The key operative rules cover the steps required to determine whether top-up tax is payable and where this would be paid. The first step is to determine the profit in a jurisdiction. This is calculated by simply adding together the GloBE income and GloBE losses of all the Constituent Entities in the jurisdiction. If the result is positive, the Effective Tax Rate (ETR) will need to be calculated for that jurisdiction. The only exceptions to this are when the jurisdiction qualifies for a GloBE safe harbour (in Chapter 8 of the Model Rules) or the de minimis exclusion (in Article 5.5 of the Model Rules). The latter will be when the average GloBE revenue (that is, gross income before expenses) and GloBE income (that is, net income) in the jurisdiction for the current and two prior years are below €10 million and €1 million respectively. The Effective Tax Rate This section explains the different components of the ETR calculation in Chapters 3 to 5 of the Model Rules. It sets out the main features of the rules and notes special rules that apply in particular circumstances. The ETR for a jurisdiction is the total tax divided by the total profit in that jurisdiction. There are detailed rules prescribing what taxes can be included in this calculation, which are referred to as ‘covered taxes’, and how to calculate the profit in the jurisdiction, which is referred to as ‘GloBE income’. In-scope MNEs must calculate their ETRs for each jurisdiction annually. Calculating the ETR for a jurisdiction broadly involves four steps:  First, the MNE must identify its constituent entities in the jurisdiction. The Model Rules set out how to work out which jurisdiction an entity is located in.  Second, the MNE must work out the ‘GloBE income’ or profit of each constituent entity in the jurisdiction. This starts with an entity’s accounting profit. Adjustments are then made to the accounting profit to reflect the agreed GloBE base. Some adjustments are mandatory, while others are elective. There are also rules for allocating profit between jurisdictions.  Third, the MNE must determine the covered taxes of the constituent entities in the jurisdiction. This requires consideration of the types of taxes that count as ‘covered taxes’ and which year those taxes are allocated to. The starting point for calculating covered taxes is the accounting current tax expense. Adjustments are then made to the current tax expense, including an adjustment based on deferred tax, to address timing differences between accounting and tax. There are also rules for allocating covered taxes between jurisdictions.

The total taxes are divided by the total net GloBE income to get the ETR for the jurisdiction. These steps are discussed in more detail below. Step 1: Identify the constituent entities in a jurisdiction The GloBE rules calculate the ETR for a jurisdiction as a whole. This ensures that an MNE with a high ETR in a jurisdiction does not become liable for a top-up tax because of an isolated low-tax entity whose low level of taxation could be a function of its relationship with other entities in the jurisdiction. Chapter 10 of the Model Rules determines where an entity is located. Most constituent entities will be located in the jurisdiction where they are tax resident. Where a constituent entity is not tax resident in a jurisdiction, it will be located in the jurisdiction where it was created, for example, where it was incorporated. Specific rules locate tax transparent entities, like partnerships and permanent establishments (PEs), for the ETR calculations and charging provisions. Step 2: Calculate the GloBE income for each constituent entity The starting point is the entity’s financial accounting profit. T his is then subject to adjustments that IF countries agreed are desirable to reconcile the most important and common differences between accounting and tax definitions of profit. These adjustments are intended to bring the GloBE base more into line with a measure of taxable profit so that the ETR provides a reasonable measure of the level of effective taxation in that jurisdiction. There are also rules to appropriately allocate certain types of income between jurisdictions. Accounting profit The calculation of a constituent entity’s GloBE income starts from its financial accounting income. The general rule is that this income should be calculated according to the accounting standard of its UPE and therefore reflects the amount that feeds into the UPE’s consolidated financial statements before consolidation adjustments. This is subject to a requirement that the UPE prepares its accounts under an acceptable accounting standard, or that it adjusts any material differences in its accounting treatment of an item that could result in the MNE obtaining an unfair competitive advantage when compared with the IFRS treatment. NZ IFRS is an acceptable accounting standard for the GloBE rules. The Model Rules recognise there are situations when it may not be practicable to accurately calculate the entity’s accounting profit under the UPE’s accounting standard.

These adjustments generally reflect significant differences between accounting and tax measures of profit that do not reverse out over time. Separate rules address timing differences in the recognition of income and expenses for accounting and tax, which are covered further below. Certain elective adjustments are also available to the MNE group. These include an election to o ffset a net realised gain on local tangible assets against a net realised loss on local tangible assets in the four preceding years and spread any remaining net realised gain equally over the current year and four preceding years. The election to spread back a net realised gain on local tangible assets should be useful in a jurisdiction, such as New Zealand, that does not tax some capital gains (though gains on sales of shares in companies more than 10 percent owned are already excluded from the GloBE base). The election will allow untaxed gains to be matched against prior year untaxed losses. It will also allow tax to be imposed at greater than the 15% rate in the spread-back years to reduce or eliminate any GloBE liability that would otherwise arise from the untaxed gain. Special rule for incentive tax credits A special rule prescribes the treatment of government incentives delivered as credits via the tax system. This rule is intended to apply to incentives to engage in certain activities, such as research and development. When an incentive tax credit is designed so that it must be paid in cash or cash equivalents within four years, it can be treated as GloBE income for the GloBE rules instead of as a reduction to covered taxes. New Zealand’s research and development tax credit is designed so that it must be partially refunded within four years. The portion that must be refunded within four years is the amount calculated under section LA 5(4B)(a) of the ITA and referred to as the ‘maximum limit of the person’s refundability cap’ for the year in which the associated research and development expenditure is incurred. Officials’ view is that under the Model Rules this amount can be treated as GloBE income and any remaining credit must be treated as a reduction to covered taxes (even if it gives rise to a tax reduction or other benefit within the four-year period). The mandatory adjustments and remaining elective adjustments are described in Chapter 3 of the Model Rules.

Special rules for Ultimate Parent Entities that are subject to a tax neutrality regime There are also special rules in Chapter 7 of the Model Rules for calculating the GloBE income of a UPE that is subject to a tax neutrality regime, that is, a regime that achieves a single level of taxation on business income. Article 7.2 applies to a UPE that is subject to a deductible distribution tax regime. This Article will be relevant to a New Zealand co-operative UPE. It allows such a UPE to reduce its GloBE income (but not below zero) by the amount that is distributed as a deductible dividend within 12 months of the end of a fiscal year if the dividend recipient is:  subject to tax on the dividend at a nominal rate that equals or exceeds 15% within 12 months of the end of the group’s fiscal year  a natural person who is a tax resident in the UPE country, or has a fixed establishment in the UPE country, and holds an ownership interest in the UPE of 5 percent or less, or  resident in the UPE country and is a governmental entity, international organisation, non-profit organisation or pension fund that is not a pension services entity. Allocating income between jurisdictions The GloBE rules are designed to ensure that MNEs pay tax at a rate of 15% on their profits in each jurisdiction (after taking into account a substance-based carve-out). This means tax imposed at a high rate on profits in one jurisdiction cannot be used to credit low-taxed profits in another jurisdiction. Consequently, allocating profits appropriately between jurisdictions is integral to the GloBE rules. The Model Rules achieve this through:  valuing cross-border intragroup transactions in accordance with the arm’s length principle, when this is different to the transfer price used for accounting  requiring financial accounting profits to be allocated between a PE and its head office entity based on the attribution of income and expenses to the PE for tax purposes (special allocation rules apply to PEs of entities subject to a worldwide tax system, such as New Zealand’s), and  allocating the income of a tax transparent constituent entity (when not attributable to a PE) to its owners to the extent the owners also treat the entity as tax transparent (that is, tax the income) or are not members of the MNE group.

This limitation reflects that the GloBE rules are intended to ensure a minimum level of tax is paid on the profit in each jurisdiction. It follows taxes should only be included in covered taxes when they are levied on a measure of income. This means corporate income taxes will generally be covered taxes. However, when an income tax is refundable or creditable to the beneficial owner of a dividend distributed by a constituent entity (for example, by way of imputation), it will only qualify as a covered tax if the credit is provided:  under a foreign tax credit regime by a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction that imposed the income tax  to a beneficial owner of the dividend that is subject to tax on the dividend, at a rate that equals or exceeds the minimum rate, in the jurisdiction that imposed the corporate income tax  to an individual beneficial owner of the dividend who is tax resident in the jurisdiction that imposed the income tax and who is subject to tax on the dividend, or  to a governmental entity, international organisation, resident non-profit organisation, resident pension fund, resident investment entity that is not a group entity, or a resident life insurance company to the extent the dividends are received in connection with a pension fund business and subject to tax in a similar manner as a dividend received by a pension fund. The Model Rules refer to an income tax that is charged under a qualifying imputation system as a Qualified Imputation Tax. New Zealand’s corporate income tax meets the definition of a Qualified Imputation Tax and is therefore a covered tax. Australia’s corporate income tax is similarly a covered tax. Withholding taxes and other taxes that are imposed in lieu of a corporate income tax are also covered taxes. Taxes on payroll or sales will not be counted. New Zealand’s goods and services tax is not a covered tax, as it is not charged on a measure of income. Calculating covered taxes for the relevant year Having established which taxes qualify, the next step is to determine the amount of those taxes in the relevant year. The Model Rules look first to the current tax expense recorded in the financial statements to determine the amount of covered taxes that have been paid.

An adjustment is also required when an amount of covered tax is refunded or credited to a group entity and the refund or credit is not treated as a reduction to the current tax expense in the financial accounts. An example of this in a New Zealand context is a tax credit for a supplementary dividend, which is typically accounted for directly in equity instead of as a reduction to the current tax expense. An adjustment would be required for GloBE purposes to reduce the current tax expense by the amount of this credit. The remaining adjustments are described in Chapter 4 of the Model Rules. Refundable tax credits As discussed above, the treatment of incentive tax credits in the Model Rules depends on their refundability. Tax credits designed in such a way that they must be refunded within four years are referred to as Qualified Refundable Tax Credits and are treated as GloBE income. Refundable tax credits that do not satisfy this refundability requirement are referred to as Non-Qualified Refundable Tax Credits and are treated as a reduction to covered taxes. This means an adjustment must be made to increase covered taxes when a Qualified Refundable Tax Credit is accounted for as a tax credit or to reduce covered taxes when a Non-Qualified Refundable Tax Credit is accounted for as income. Timing differences The Model Rules also include rules designed to address circumstances when the period in which profits are taxed is different to the period in which they are recognised in GloBE income. This difference typically arises from differences between when income and expenses are recognised for accounting and tax purposes. For example, capital assets are often depreciated at different rates. Without rules to address these differences, an MNE could suffer a top-up tax because it appears to be low-taxed, when in fact the income has been taxed in a different period from the one in which it has been recognised for the ETR calculation. While this deferral can be of significant benefit if it is long term, the Model Rules have been designed generally (but not always) so that timing benefits do not give rise to the imposition of tax. At least in part, this was to avoid the need to provide refunds of GloBE tax. The Model Rules address this issue using an approach based on deferred tax accounting. Deferred tax accounting is an accounting concept that seeks to match taxes to the period in which the income or expenses are recognised for accounting purposes. It does this by shifting the tax expense from the year the tax is paid to the years in which the income or expenditure is recognised in the financial statements.

Example 1: Timing differences A constituent entity accrues a current tax expense of $10 for fiscal year 1 and a deferred tax expense of $5 due to a temporary difference between accounting and tax. The deferred tax expense of $5 is added to the current tax expense of $10 to give $15 of covered taxes for Fiscal Year 1. The temporary difference reverses in Fiscal Year 2, resulting in an increase to the current expense for that year of $5 and a decrease to the deferred tax expense of $5, that is, the deferred tax liability of $5 unwinds. The decrease in the deferred tax expense in Fiscal Year 2 offsets the increase in the current tax expense. So, if there was a current tax expense for Fiscal Year 2 of $10, the decrease in the deferred tax expense in that year would be deducted from this to give covered taxes of $5. Recognising the deferred tax expense in each year effectively brings forward the $5 of tax relating to the temporary difference to the year when the deferred tax liability is first recognised (rather than the year when the tax is actually paid). Some modifications to an entity’s deferred tax accounting used in its financial statements ensure the outcomes are appropriate for the GloBE rules. Revaluing deferred taxes The Model Rules require the deferred tax expense for financial reporting purposes to be valued at the lower of the minimum rate and the applicable tax rate. This ensures there is no top-up for the timing difference when the local tax rate is above the minimum rate without enabling additional upfront credits for deferred tax liabilities to shelter other exempt income in that year. Example 2: Revaluing deferred taxes A constituent entity has a temporary difference between accounting and tax of $100 for the Fiscal Year due to immediately expensing an asset under the local tax rules where it is resident. The local tax rate is 28%. Therefore, the constituent entity recognises a deferred tax liability of $28 for accounting purposes, which increases the deferred tax expense by $28. This deferred tax expense must be recast to the minimum rate for GloBE purposes ($100 temporary difference x 15% = $15), which means covered taxes can only be increased by $15 due to deferred tax.

These include deferred tax movements for income or expenses excluded from GloBE income and deferred tax from uncertain tax positions. The recapture A recapture rule applies for deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) when a DTL has not unwound within five years of the Fiscal Year in which the DTL was originally recognised. Under this rule, the MNE group is required to recompute its ETR in the year the DTL was originally recognised. This ETR is recalculated without the DTL. If the revised ETR results in a top-up, this top-up is added to the top-up in the current year. Some types of timing difference are exempt from the recapture rule. These include those for:  Accelerated depreciation on tangible assets.  Fair value accounting.  Research and development expenses. These timing differences do not need to be recaptured even if it takes longer than five years for the DTL to unwind. Losses The timing difference rules also address tax losses. These rules are also based on deferred tax accounting, which means covered taxes are reduced (potentially to a negative number) in the year the local tax loss arises and a deferred tax asset (DTA) is recognised. Covered taxes are then increased in the year the loss is used and the DTA unwinds. This is done by taking account of the deferred tax expense accrued in the financial accounts, which could be a positive or negative figure. Example 3: Losses A constituent entity has a tax loss and GloBE loss of $100 in Fiscal Year 1. The local tax rate is 15% so the constituent entity recognises a loss deferred tax asset in this year of $15 ($100 tax loss x 15%). In Fiscal Year 2, the constituent entity earns $100 of net income for local tax purposes (before tax losses brought forward) and $100 of GloBE income. For accounting purposes, there is no current tax expense in Fiscal Year 2 because the tax loss brought forward of $100 reduces taxable income to zero, but a deferred tax expense of $15 is recognised because the loss deferred tax asset is written off when the tax loss is used. The deferred tax expense increases covered taxes by $15 in Fiscal Year 2. As a result, there would be no top-up tax in Fiscal Year 2 (or Fiscal Year 1).

For example, the DTA could be based on an economic loss that would also be recognised in the GloBE income or loss. These losses are recognised in the Model Rules to prevent top-up taxes being applied in a later (profit) year when the MNE has not made an economic profit over time. The loss could also be created by a timing difference between the accounts and the local tax system, in which case the accounting will recognise both a DTA and a DTL. However, the local tax loss could also be caused by certain features of that jurisdiction’s tax rules – for instance, if the jurisdiction exempted certain types of income from tax or provided tax deductions in excess of the cost incurred (‘super deductions’). These local tax concessions are not intended to be recognised in the GloBE base and should ordinarily reduce the ETR when there is net GloBE income in the jurisdiction. However, without further rules, they would be incorporated in the GloBE base if they produced a local tax loss and the related DTA could be used for GloBE purposes. Consequently, a special rule identifies the amount of loss relief that would have been available in the jurisdiction if the DTA was based on the GloBE base rather than the local tax rules. Any excess losses are deemed to be losses arising from permanent differences and give rise to an additional top-up for that year under Article 4.1.5 of the Model Rules. This ensures that MNEs receive appropriate relief in the GloBE rules for economic losses and for those created through timing differences, while preventing excessive relief when the loss arises from a permanent difference. Example 4: Losses and permanent differences An MNE has one constituent entity in a jurisdiction that has a tax rate of 15%. This constituent entity has a GloBE loss for the fiscal year of $100 but a local tax loss of $200 because $100 of income earned is exempt for local tax purposes. The constituent entity recognises a DTA of $30 ($200 tax loss x 15% tax rate) in the fiscal year. Absent an adjustment, this DTA would increase covered taxes by $30 for GloBE purposes (when the tax loss is used in the future), sheltering $200 of GloBE income. This would not be appropriate because the constituent entity has only suffered an economic loss of $100. The Model Rules address this issue by charging additional top- up tax of $15 in the fiscal year (that is, in the year there is $100 of exempt income for local tax purposes). Where additional top-up tax arises under Article 4.1.5, an MNE can elect to apply the Carry- forward of Excess Negative Tax Expense administrative procedure. Under this procedure, the MNE avoids the immediate cash impost by carrying forward the Excess Negative Tax Date: May 2023 29 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Expenses to future periods. Further guidance on this procedure is available in the Agreed Administrative Guidance. An election also allows an MNE to create a DTA for the GloBE rules based on the GloBE loss in the jurisdiction multiplied by the minimum rate. This may be useful for MNEs with operations in zero tax countries, where the MNE would get no benefit under a system based on deferred tax. Assigning taxes to a jurisdiction As with the rules allocating income between jurisdictions, the Model Rules contain similar rules allocating certain covered taxes. These generally seek to assign the tax to the jurisdiction to which the income is allocated so that all the taxes paid on this income are taken into account. For example, taxes paid by a (head office) entity on the profits of its permanent establishments are assigned to the jurisdiction where the permanent establishment is located. Similarly, controlled foreign company ( CFC) charges are ‘pushed down’ to the CFC so that the tax and income are aligned. There are similar rules to assign taxes for transparent entities, hybrid entities and reverse hybrids. There is a limit on the extent to which CFC tax charges and taxes on hybrid entities can be pushed down when the tax is charged for passive income. In these cases, the tax can only be pushed down to achieve the minimum rate on that income. Any tax that is not pushed down is included in the covered tax calculation for the owner that was subject to the tax charge. Withholding taxes are generally assigned to the constituent entity that recognises the income in its financial accounts rather than the entity that deducts the tax on payment. An exception exists for withholding taxes on dividends paid to other constituent entities, and this also applies to net basis taxes on dividend income. Both these taxes are assigned to the entity that paid the taxable distribution. The logic is that these taxes can be seen as an additional tax on the profit of the distributing entity. Step 4: Calculate the ETR Finally, the ETR for a jurisdiction is calculated by dividing the total covered taxes for a jurisdiction (the aggregate of covered taxes in Step 3 for each constituent entity) by the total GloBE income in that jurisdiction (the aggregate of the GloBE income or loss in Step 2 for each constituent entity). Example 5: The ETR calculation An MNE has two constituent entities in Jurisdiction A. Constituent Entity 1 has covered taxes of $6 million and GloBE income of $80 million for the current fiscal year, and Date: May 2023 30 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Constituent Entity 2 has covered taxes of $4 million and GloBE income of $20 million. The MNE’s ETR for Jurisdiction A is 10% (covered taxes of $10 million/GloBE income of $100 million). On a standalone basis, Constituent Entity 1’s ETR is 7.5% ($6 million/$80 million) and Constituent Entity 2’s ETR is 20% ($4 million/$2 0 million). Constituent Entity 1’s low ETR is due to tax concessions in Jurisdiction A that apply to its business activity. The GloBE rules permit outcomes within a jurisdiction to be blended, which means Constituent Entity 2’s excess taxes (that is, taxes in excess of 15%) are used to increase the ETR for Jurisdiction A. When an MNE has GloBE income and negative covered taxes (that is, prima facie, a negative ETR), the Carry-forward of Excess Negative Tax Expense administrative procedure must be applied. Under this procedure, the MNE must ca rry forward the Excess Negative Tax Expenses to future periods, resulting in an ETR for the current year of 0%. Further guidance on this procedure is available in the Agreed Administrative Guidance. Further special rules for calculating ETRs Special rules exist for calculating the ETR of stateless entities, joint ventures and minority- owned constituent entities. Calculating the top-up tax When the ETR in a country is below the 15% minimum rate, the next step is to determine how much top-up tax is owed for each entity in the country. To do this, MNEs must work out the top-up tax percentage, which is the difference between the minimum rate and the ETR in the jurisdiction. That top-up tax percentage is applied to the MNE’s GloBE income in the jurisdiction, after deducting a substance-based income exclusion, to calculate the jurisdictional top-up tax. Finally, the jurisdictional top-up tax is allocated between the constituent entities located in the jurisdiction. This section explains these rules for calculating the top-up tax and allocating it between low tax constituent entities. They are in Chapter 5 of the Model Rules. The steps There are several steps in the top-up tax calculation in the Model Rules:  Compute the top-up tax percentage.  Calculate the substance-based income exclusion.  Deduct the substance-based income exclusion from the net GloBE income in the jurisdiction to determine the excess income.

These steps are explained in more detail in the remainder of this section. Compute the top-up tax percentage The top-up tax percentage must be calculated when the ETR is below the 15% minimum rate. It is calculated simply by subtracting the ETR from the minimum rate and represents the additional tax rate that needs to be charged on the low-taxed profits to bring the tax on those profits up to the minimum. Example 6: The top-up tax percentage Assume the same facts as in example 5 above. The MNE has two constituent entities in Jurisdiction A and its ETR for Jurisdiction A is 10% (covered taxes of $10 million / GloBE income of $100 million). The top-up tax percentage for Jurisdiction A is calculated by subtracting the ETR of 10% from the GloBE tax rate of 15%. This results in a top-up tax percentage for Jurisdiction A of 5%. Calculate the substance-based income exclusion The top-up tax percentage is applied to the net GloBE income in the jurisdiction that exceeds the substance-based income exclusion. This approach ensures the substance-based income exclusion does not inappropriately increase the ETR in the jurisdiction. The substance-based income exclusion is a formulaic carve-out that excludes a reasonable return to the level of substance in the jurisdiction from top-up tax. This is based on a percentage of the MNE’s payroll costs and tangible assets in the jurisdiction, on the grounds that employment costs and tangible assets tend to be relatively immobile factors of production and are therefore reasonable proxies for substantive economic activities. The percentage The substance-based income exclusion, or “carve-out”, will be 5 percent of the carrying value of the payroll costs and tangible assets in the jurisdiction. An increased amount applies in the transition period, which begins on 1 January 2023 and lasts for 10 years.

The carve-out for tangible assets is 8 percent in the first year, and then it is reduced by 0.2 percent per year for the next five fiscal years and 0.4 percent per year for the remaining four fiscal years. Payroll costs The payroll carve-out for a jurisdiction is based on payroll costs for a constituent entity located in the jurisdiction for employees and independent contractors that perform activities for the MNE in that jurisdiction. For this purpose, independent contractors include only natural persons and may include natural persons who are employed by a staffing or employment company but whose daily activities are performed under the direction and control of the MNE. Independent contractors do not include employees of a corporate contractor providing goods or services to constituent entities in the jurisdiction. The payroll costs include employee benefits that provide a direct personal benefit to the employee, like health insurance and pension contributions, as well as wages and salary costs. Payroll taxes and social security contributions borne by the employer are also included. Tangible assets The tangible asset carve-out is based on the average of the opening and closing carrying value (net of accumulated depreciation) of tangible assets in the financial statements. The tangible assets that qualify include property, plant and equipment, natural resources (including land not held for sale, lease or investment), as well as licences for the use of immovable property or exploitation of natural resources. The asset must be located in the jurisdiction of the constituent entity that owns it. Assets that are leased also qualify for the lessee, which provides consistency between owned and leased assets. Where an asset is leased from another group member, the asset will only be included in the jurisdiction of the lessee. Special rules to determine how the carve-out is allocated for permanent establishments and for transparent entities are included in Article 5.3.6 and Article 7.4.6 respectively.

Constituent Entity 1’s payroll costs for activities performed in Jurisdiction A is $30 million for the current fiscal year, and its tangible assets located in Jurisdiction A have an average accounting carrying value for the current fiscal year of $170 million. Constituent Entity 2 has no payroll costs or tangible assets. The substance-based income exclusion for Jurisdiction A is calculated as follows\* ((payroll costs of $30 million x 5 percent) + (tangible assets of $170 million x 5 percent)) = $10 million. Therefore $10 million would be deducted from the MNE’s GloBE income for Jurisdiction A when calculating the income subject to top-up tax. \* Assume the carve-out percentages have reduced to 5 percent in the year of the example. Compute the top-up tax in the jurisdiction The top-up tax for the jurisdiction is calculated by deducting the substance-based income exclusion from the net GloBE income in the jurisdiction and then multiplying the result by the top-up tax percentage. Example 8: Computing the top-up tax Assuming the same facts as in example 7 above, the MNE’s top-up tax for Jurisdiction A for the current fiscal year equals $4.5 million: (net GloBE income of $100 million – the substance-based income exclusion of $10 million) x the top-up tax percentage of 5% If an adjustment is made that results in a decrease to the liability for covered taxes in a prior year (for example, when a tax return is reassessed resulting in a reduction to the tax liability for a prior year), the GloBE rules require the ETR in the earlier year to be recalculated unless the decrease is less than €1 million, in which case it can be included in the current year. This includes when the recapture rule is applied to deferred tax liabilities that have not unwound within five years. When these recalculations result in an ETR falling below the minimum rate, the additional top-up tax for that year is added to the current year’s top-up tax and charged in the current fiscal year.

Constituent Entity 2’s Jurisdiction A income tax return for a prior year has been reassessed, resulting in a reduction in its local tax liability for that prior year of $1.2 million but no change in its GloBE income for that year. The Jurisdiction A ETR and top-up tax is recalculated for this prior year resulting in additional GloBE top-up tax for the year of $1 million.\* This additional top-up tax of $1 million is added to the $4.5 million top-up tax for the current fiscal year, resulting in total top-up tax for the current fiscal year of $5.5 million. The GloBE return for the prior fiscal year is not reassessed. \* The reduction in the prior year local tax liability doesn’t result in a Dollar-for-Dollar increase in top-up tax because of the impact of the substance-based income exclusion in the prior year. Allocation of a jurisdiction’s top-up tax to constituent entities The final step in calculating the top-up tax is to allocate the jurisdictional top-up tax to the individual constituent entities in the low tax jurisdiction. This paves the way for the final step in the GloBE tax process, which is for the tax allocated to the low tax entities to then be allocated under Article 2 of the Model Rules to the entities required to pay tax under the IIR and UTPR. This allocation between the low-taxed constituent entities is necessary to deal with situations when some of the top-up tax is charged to an entity that is not the UPE. For example, if the UPE is not subject to a qualified IIR, the top-up tax may be collected through a combination of the IIR applied at different levels of the group structure, the UTPR (as described in the next section) and the QDMTT. Allocating the top-up tax to individual constituent entities ensures the different charging rules can be coordinated. It is also necessary because the IIR is intended to collect top-up tax from a parent entity based on its interest in a low-taxed constituent entity. This means that where a parent applying the IIR does not wholly own a low-taxed constituent entity, it will only bear the cost of its proportional share of top-up tax. Allocating top-up tax to low-taxed constituent entities is an important step in achieving this outcome. The GloBE rules generally allocate the top-up tax for a jurisdiction between the constituent entities located in the jurisdiction based on their proportion of the jurisdictional GloBE income.

Constituent Entity 1 is allocated $4.4 million ((Constituent Entity 1 GloBE income of $80 million / jurisdictional GloBE income of $100 million) x top-up tax of $5.5 million). Constituent Entity 2 is allocated $1.1 million ((Constituent Entity 2 GloBE income of $20 million / jurisdictional GloBE income of $100 million) x top-up tax of $5.5 million). Special rules deal with situations when top-up taxes are payable and there is no GloBE income in the jurisdiction, for example, when all the top-up tax for the year relates to a recalculation of the ETR from an earlier year. Imposition of top-up tax As outlined above, the IIR and the UTPR both allocate the liability to pay top-up tax on foreign constituent entities between the MNE’s entities. The QDMTT (Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax) can be contrasted with the IIR and UTPR, as a QDMTT applies exclusively to domestic constituent entities. The IIR and the UTPR are designed to work together and are also coordinated to ensure the right amount of top-up tax is collected when multiple IIRs or UTPRs are applied at the same time in different jurisdictions. Therefore, both rules start from the same top-up tax calculation explained above, which allocates top-up tax amongst constituent entities in a low tax jurisdiction. This part of the Guidance Material sets out the ordering rules that prescribe how the QDMTT, IIR and UTPR operate together and how top-up tax is imposed on an MNE’s entities. The rules are in Chapter 2 of the Model Rules. QDMTT If the country where the income is earned has enacted a QDMTT, the top-up tax will be paid first to that country. A QDMTT is a minimum tax implemented and administered in a way that is consistent with the outcomes provided for under the GloBE Rules and Commentary such that it increases the MNE group’s domestic liability on domestic excess profits to the minimum rate. The definition also prohibits the provision of benefits to the MNE group related to the GloBE rules.

In some situations, imposing the whole amount of the jurisdictional top-up tax under a QDMTT will result in a greater tax charge than the tax charge that would otherwise have been imposed under the IIR, as the IIR takes into account minority ownership interests. A QDMTT excludes from the covered tax calculation:  taxes paid or incurred by a constituent entity owner under a CFC tax regime allocable to a domestic constituent entity, and  taxes paid or incurred by a main entity allocable to a permanent establishment located in the jurisdiction. This means taxes paid under the New Zealand CFC regime or by New Zealand h ead offices for their permanent establishments will not be creditable against a foreign QDMTT. However, taxes paid under a foreign QDMTT will give rise to a foreign tax credit in New Zealand under subparts LJ and LK of the Income Tax Act 2007. IIR ordering rules The IIR takes the top-up tax calculated for a low-taxed constituent entity (LTCE) and then imposes this tax on a parent entity in the LTCE’s group. When a parent applies the IIR, the amount of top-up tax it is charged is based on the amount of top-up tax calculated for the relevant LTCE multiplied by the parent’s allocable share of the LTCE’s income. The allocable share is a measure of the parent’s rights to the profit of the LTCE and is calculated based on accounting principles. The test works by determining the proportion of the LTCE’s GloBE income attributable to the parent (that is, after adjustment for interests held by other owners). The top-down approach There will often be MNE structures where more than one group entity has an interest in the LTCE. The GloBE rules establish:  which entities in the group apply the IIR, and  if more than one group entity applies the IIR for the same LTCE, what adjustments are made to avoid over-taxation. Which entities apply the IIR The GloBE rules include a priority order for applying the IIR.

This means the UPE jurisdiction will usually have the first right to charge the top-up tax for low tax jurisdictions (other than the UPE jurisdiction itself, unless it is in a country that has adopted a domestic IIR). If the UPE is not subject to a qualified IIR, intermediate parent entities located in other jurisdictions and held directly by it (second tier entities) will apply the IIR to LTCEs in other jurisdictions to the extent of their direct and indirect interest in those LTCEs. To the extent that the above steps do not result in the imposition of the full amount of top- up tax calculated under chapter 5 of the GloBE rules, third tier intermediate parent entities may have an IIR liability, and so on. Intermediate parent entities are entities that are controlled by the UPE and have an ownership interest in the LTCE, but investment entities are excluded. Unless the split ownership rules apply (see below), an intermediate parent entity (lower IPE) will not apply its IIR if:  the UPE is subject to a qualified IIR, 7 or  another intermediate parent entity (higher IPE) that owns, directly or indirectly, a ‘controlling interest’ 8 in the lower IPE is subject to a qualified IIR. If the higher IPE does not have a controlling interest in the lower IPE, the lower IPE’s IIR will not be switched off. As explained below, the lower IPE will charge its IIR, but the higher IPE must reduce its share of the top-up tax by the tax charged by the lower IPE. Adjustments if more than one group entity applies the IIR If more than one parent entity in a group applies the IIR for an LTCE, parent entities applying the IIR must reduce their own top-up tax liability by any top-up tax allocated to a parent entity further down the group structure. This prevents double allocation of the same top-up tax amount. 7 The exception to this is when there is a partially owned parent entity (POPE) lower down the group structure. A POPE is a parent entity where at least 20% of its shares are held by minority shareholders. 8 ‘Controlling interest’ is defined in the GloBE rules. Broadly, the GloBE definition means an ownership interest such that the parent is required to consolidate the subsidiary’s financials on a line-by -line basis in accordance with an acceptable financial accounting standard (or would have been required to, had it prepared consolidated financial statements). It does not mean an ownership interest over 50%.

The LTCE is 100 percent directly owned by Parent B. Parent A owns 20 percent of Parent B – it does not have a controlling interest. Both Parent A and Parent B are in jurisdictions with a qualified IIR. The UPE of the group is not in a jurisdiction with a qualified IIR. Since Parent A does not have a controlling interest in Parent B, both parents apply the IIR. However, since Parent B’s IIR will charge the full $100 of top-up tax, Parent A’s share of the top-up tax is reduced from $20 to nil. The full amount of top-up tax is charged to Parent B under the IIR. Exception: the split ownership rules The split ownership rules are an exception to the IIR’s general top-down approach. Under the GloBE rules, an intermediate parent entity that is more than 20 percent owned by minority investors outside the MNE group is called a partially owned parent entity (POPE). The POPE definition is satisfied even if minority investors indirectly own more than 20 percent of the ownership interests in the parent entity. A parent entity owned by a POPE will therefore usually also be a POPE. POPEs have priority rights to apply the IIR, notwithstanding the general top-down approach. The reason for this is that when there are substantial minority interests, some amount of the top-up tax would not be collected at all if the IIR were only applied by parent entities higher up the ownership structure. Example 12: Partially owned parent entities (POPEs) The amount of top-up tax calculated for an MNE’s LTCE is $100. The UPE indirectly owns the LTCE through A Co. The UPE owns 60 percent of A Co, and A Co owns 100 percent of the LTCE. Under the GloBE rules, A Co (and not the UPE) would apply the IIR and pay $100 of top-up tax. By charging all the top-up tax to A Co, the top-up tax is effectively borne 60 percent by the UPE and 40 percent by the minority shareholders. If this were not the case and only the UPE applied the IIR, the UPE would only be charged $60 of the top-up tax based on its allocable share. The remaining $40 would not be collected under either the UTPR or the IIR.

Example 13: POPE rules and corresponding tax reductions The amount of top-up tax calculated for an MNE’s LTCE is $100. The UPE indirectly owns the LTCE through a chain of POPEs. The UPE directly owns 75 percent of POPE A, with the remaining 25 percent held by minority investors outside the MNE group. POPE A directly owns POPE B (ownership percentage varies under the two examples below). POPE B directly owns 100 percent of the LTCE. POPE A owns 100 percent of POPE B If POPE B is 100 percent owned by POPE A, POPE A would apply the IIR and be charged $100 of top-up tax. POPE B would not be required to apply the IIR. UPE POPE A POPE B LT CE 100% Top-up tax = $100 75% ownership (25% minority owned) 100% POPE A owns 90 percent of POPE B, with the remaining 10 percent owned by outside investors If POPE B is only 90 percent owned by POPE A, both POPEs would apply the IIR. POPE B would be charged $100 of top-up tax. POPE A would also apply the IIR, but its top-up tax liability would be reduced to zero by the amount of tax charged to POPE B. As noted above, if a parent entity further down the group structure has applied the IIR, the liability of any parent further up the group applying the IIR must be reduced. The amount of the reduction is the top-up tax paid by the lower parent under an IIR multiplied by the higher parent’s ownership interests in the low-taxed entity held indirectly through that lower parent.

Example 14: Reduction for top-up tax charged to lower parent The amount of top-up tax calculated for an MNE’s LTCE is $100. The UPE indirectly owns the LTCE through a POPE Assume the POPE directly owns 100 percent of the LTCE, and the UPE directly owns 60 percent of the POPE, with the remaining 40 percent held by minority investors outside the group. UPE POPE LT CE Top-up tax = $100 60% ownership (40% minority owned) 100% Both the UPE and the POPE apply the IIR:  The POPE’s allocable share of the top-up tax is $100.  The UPE’s allocable share is initially $60, but this is reduced by the top-up tax paid by the POPE multiplied by the UPE’s ownership interest in the LTCE held indirectly through the POPE. This reduction equals $60 ($100 x 60% = $60), meaning the UPE has zero allocable share. This is appropriate because the top- up tax has already been fully charged to the POPE. The UPE owns the LTCE both directly and indirectly through a POPE Assume the POPE owns 50 percent of the LTCE, and the UPE owns the other 50 percent. As above, the UPE also directly owns 60 percent of the POPE with the remaining 40 percent held by minority investors outside the group.

The UPE reduces its top-up tax liability by $30 to $50, as the $30 from its indirect interest through the POPE has already been charged to the POPE.  The result is that the full $100 of top-up tax is collected. The UTPR Like the IIR, the UTPR allocates top-up tax. The UTPR primarily functions as a backstop to the IIR. 9 It aims to ensure that top-up tax for an LTCE is paid even if its parent entities are located in jurisdictions without a qualified IIR. This eliminates the incentive for an MNE to headquarter in a country without an IIR. As the UTPR is a backstop, the GloBE rules give the IIR priority over the UTPR in charging tax on low-taxed profits outside of the UPE jurisdiction. The UTPR therefore does not apply when all the interests in the LTCE are held by parent entities subject to a qualified IIR. The UTPR applies if some of the interests in an LTCE are not held by parent entities that are subject to a qualified IIR. However, any top-up tax collected under the UTPR is reduced by the amount that is charged under an IIR. This ensures the IIR takes priority. 9 It also ensures that any LTCEs in the UPE’s jurisdiction are subject to top-up taxation.

The MNE’s UPE indirectly owns 100 percent of the LTCE through two companies – A Co (which owns 60 percent) and B Co (which owns 40 percent). A Co is in a jurisdiction with a qualified IIR. B Co and the UPE are not. Applying the IIR, A Co’s allocable share of the top-up tax is $60. The remaining $40 of top-up tax is allocated to the MNE’s constituent entities under the UTPR. How the UTPR allocates top-up tax to different jurisdictions Unlike the IIR, which allocates top-up tax to entities by allocable share or ownership, the UTPR allocates top-up tax to jurisdictions based on where the group’s tangible assets and employees are located. The UTPR uses an allocation key to allocate the top-up tax between the different jurisdictions in which the MNE has constituent entities. The top-up tax is only allocated to jurisdictions that have implemented a qualified UTPR (a ‘UTPR jurisdiction’). The allocation is calculated at a jurisdictional level. The top-up tax is allocated based on the proportion of the tangible assets and number of employees in each UTPR jurisdiction. There are equal weights for the asset and employee factors. Example 16: UTPR allocation An MNE consists of one company in Jurisdiction P with permanent establishments in Jurisdictions A, B, C, D and E. The value of tangible assets and number of employees owned by the MNE located in each jurisdiction are:  Jurisdiction A: $400 million tangible assets, 500 employees  Jurisdiction B: $400 million tangible assets, 300 employees  Jurisdiction C: $100 million tangible assets, 200 employees  Jurisdiction D: $100 million tangible assets, no employees  Jurisdiction E: No tangible assets or employees. The MNE’s total value of tangible assets in all UTPR jurisdictions is $1 billion, and the total number of employees in all UTPR jurisdictions is 1,000.

Jurisdictions A, B, C, D and E have all adopted the GloBE rules and implemented the UTPR. The PE in Jurisdiction A is low tax, having a top-up tax amount under Article 5 of $100,000. The share of Jurisdiction A’s top-up tax allocated to Jurisdictions A, B, C and D under the UTPR is calculated as follows:  Jurisdiction A: 50% x (400m/1b) + 50% x (500/1,000) = 45%  Jurisdiction B: 50% x (400m/1b) + 50% x (300/1,000) = 35%  Jurisdiction C: 50% x (100m/1b) + 50% x (200/1,000) = 15%  Jurisdiction D: 50% x (100m/1b) + 50% x 0 = 5%  Jurisdiction E will not be allocated any top-up tax, even though it is a UTPR jurisdiction, as it has no tangible assets or employees. The data for this allocation can be taken from the MNE’s Country-by-Country report, provided the report is prepared in accordance with the GloBE rules’ definitions for Number of Employees and Tangible Assets. This will minimise the additional compliance burdens on MNEs and improve coordination by basing the calculation on existing, readily available and objective data.

The transitional Country-by-Country (CbC) Report safe harbour is designed as a short-term measure that would effectively exclude an MNE’s operations in certain lower-risk jurisdictions from the scope of the GloBE rules in the initial years. The safe harbour would allow an MNE to avoid undertaking full GloBE calculations in a jurisdiction where it can demonstrate, using a Qualified CbC Report and Qualified Financial Statement, that it meets one of the following tests. De minimis test The de minimis test applies where the MNE group reports total revenue of less than €10 million and profit (loss) before income tax of less than €1 million in the jurisdiction in its Qualified CbC Report for the fiscal year. A Qualified CbC Report is a CbC Report prepared and filed using Qualified Financial Statements. Qualified Financial Statements include:  the accounts used to prepare the consolidated financial statements of the UPE, or  financial statements of each constituent entity, provided they are prepared in accordance with either an acceptable financial accounting standard or, in some cases, an authorised financial accounting standard. 10 OECD, 2022, Safe Harbours and Penalty Relief: Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules (Pillar Two), available at www.oecd.org Date: May 2023 45 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Simplified ETR test The simplified ETR test applies where the MNE group has a simplified ETR that is equal to or greater than the transition rate in the jurisdiction for the fiscal year. The simplified ETR is calculated by dividing the jurisdiction’s simplified covered taxes by its profit (loss) before income tax as reported on the MNE group’s Qualified CbC Report. The simplified covered taxes is a jurisdiction’s income tax expense as reported on the MNE group’s Qualified Financial Statements, after eliminating any taxes that are not covered taxes and uncertain tax positions reported in the MNE group’s Qualified CbC Report. The transition rate is 15% for fiscal years beginning in 2023 or 2024, 16% for fiscal years beginning in 2025 and 17% for those beginning in 2026. Routine profits test The routine profits test applies where the MNE group’s profit (loss) before income tax in the jurisdiction under the CbC Report is equal to or less than the substance-based income exclusion amount for constituent entities located in that jurisdiction, as calculated under the GloBE rules. Note: the routine profits test uses revenue and profit (loss) before income tax from an MNE’s Qualified CbC Report, but MNEs would be required to perform a full substance-based income exclusion calculation to meet the routine profits test. Rules for using the transitional safe harbour If an MNE group has not applied the transitional CbC Report safe harbour in a jurisdiction in a fiscal year in which the MNE group is subject to the GloBE Rules, the MNE group cannot qualify for this safe harbour for the jurisdiction in a subsequent year. This is the “once out, always out” rule. An MNE that qualifies for the transitional CbC Report safe harbour on a jurisdictional basis is still subject to the GloBE Rules and the safe harbour does not discharge the MNE group from complying with group-wide requirements. For example, an MNE group would still need to prepare and file its GloBE Information Return during the transitional period. Special rules apply to certain entities and groups, including UPEs subject to deductible dividend regimes. If the conditions of the transitional CbC Report safe harbour are not met, then the general rules apply, and any potential liability to top-up tax must be computed under the ordinary GloBE Rules.

Some of these rules apply to all MNEs as they address transition issues arising because the GloBE rules are new. Other transitional rules apply to entities and groups when they first come within the scope of the GloBE rules (for example, through organic growth or a merger), even if that occurs after the GloBE rules have been in place for some time. An MNE’s transition year is determined on a jurisdictional basis. For a jurisdiction, the first fiscal year that the MNE comes within the scope of the GloBE rules is a “transition year” unless the MNE qualifies for a transitional safe harbour, in which case it would be the first fiscal year in which the relevant tested jurisdiction no longer qualifies for or applies the transitional safe harbour. An MNE may therefore have different transition years for different jurisdictions. The transitional rules described in this chapter of the Model Rules:  Allow higher percentages to be used in calculating the substance-based income exclusion in the first 10 years of the GloBE rules.  Allow for a longer filing deadline in an MNE’s transition year.  Address the treatment of losses and other timing differences.  Provide temporary relief from the UTPR for MNEs in the initial phase of international activity. Substance-based income exclusion As described above, the percentages used in the substance-based income exclusion are higher for the first 10 years of the GloBE rules. Longer filing deadline in transition year An MNE is normally required to file its GloBE return and other notifications within 15 months after the end of its accounting period. In an MNE’s transition year, this deadline is extended to 18 months. Losses and timing differences Once an MNE becomes subject to the GloBE rules, it will have to calculate its ETR in each jurisdiction where it operates. Losses and accounting-tax timing differences may occur before an MNE’s transition year that affect its ETR calculation in its transition year and later years. For example, if an MNE’s pre-transition year losses were not taken into account at all, the MNE could have an inappropriately low ETR in a year when those losses are used to reduce local taxable income.

This is done by taking into account existing deferred tax accounting attributes (including deferred tax assets from earlier losses) in the ETR calculation described in Chapter 5. Consistent with that treatment, the amount of deferred tax assets (DTA) recorded for the purpose of Article 9.1.1 shall be equal to the DTA accrued in the financial accounts if the tax rate used to determine the DTA is below the minimum rate. In any other case, such DTA shall be determined in accordance with the following formula: Deferred tax assets reflected in the financial accounts Applicable domestic tax rate The applicable domestic tax rate is the tax rate in the fiscal year preceding the transition year. More detail is available on this in the Agreed Administrative Guidance. The treatment of losses under the GloBE rules is described on page 15 and in Chapter 5 of the Model Rules. Deferred tax assets generated after 30 November 2021 from items that are excluded from the GloBE base must be disregarded for GloBE purposes. In addition, the GloBE tax basis in assets acquired in an intragroup transaction after 30 November 2021 must be based on historical carrying values, and related deferred tax assets and liabilities must similarly be determined based on historical carrying values. This is to prevent inappropriate tax planning transactions. MNEs in the initial phase of international activity There is temporary relief from the UTPR for MNEs in the initial phase of international activity. An MNE is in its “initial phase of international activity” if it has constituent entities in no more than six jurisdictions and has less than €50 million of tangible assets (by book value) outside of the jurisdiction in which it has the most tangible assets (again, by book value). The relief applies on an annual basis. Because it does not apply for the IIR, this relief is only relevant for groups that are headquartered in a country that does not have an IIR, and even then, the relief will be somewhat undercut if the group has a lower tier parent company in a country with an IIR. The temporary relief expires after the MNE has been within the scope of the GloBE rules for five years. This five-year period is not suspended if, for example, the MNE’s revenues decline so that it falls outside the scope of the rules during those five years.

Its consolidated annual revenues for the following four fiscal years are as follows:  2031: €780 million  2032: €600 million  2033: €640 million  2034: €720 million As explained above, the GloBE rules apply to MNEs that have consolidated annual revenues of at least €750 million in at least two of the last four fiscal years. The first year in which the GloBE rules apply to NewGroup is therefore 2032. Assuming NewGroup meets the other requirements for the initial phase relief from the UTPR, it will qualify for the relief in 2032, and the last year for which it can obtain the relief is the 2036 year. It does not matter that NewGroup’s annual revenues fell below the €750 million threshold from 2032 to 2034. Chapter 10: Definitions Chapter 10 of the Model Rules sets out the key definitions and the rules for determining where an entity is located for applying the key operative rules. Consequential amendments to the ITA Foreign tax credit rules Proposed new section LJ 3 would work in conjunction with section LJ 1(1) to provide that GloBE top-up tax paid under the IIR or UTPR would not be creditable for non-GloBE income tax purposes. This is because the top-up tax is determined after taking into account income tax imposed on the income attributable to a country, whether that tax is imposed by the country itself or another country (for example, under a worldwide or CFC tax regime). Similarly, proposed new section DB 1(1)(cb) would deny a deduction for these taxes. Foreign tax credits would be available for GloBE top-up tax paid under a QDMTT. This credit would be available against a New Zealand CFC tax liability and a head-office tax liability for a New Zealand MNE’s permanent establishments.

This is because the Model Rules state that if the payment of GloBE top-up tax under a country’s IIR or UTPR gives rise to a benefit, the IIR or UTPR will not be qualifying, and other participating countries will continue to apply top-up tax to the country’s in-scope MNEs under their UTPR. A payment of tax under a country’s DIIR that gives rise to an imputation credit will not result in a DIIR being non-qualifying. Schedule to the ITA adapting the OECD Model Rules to New Zealand tax law New Zealand’s Domestic Income Inclusion Rule (DIIR) The GloBE rules contemplate that countries may introduce a DIIR, which would use the same tax base as the GloBE rules but would apply to domestic LTCEs on domestic untaxed profits. Proposed Article 2.1.7 will be included in schedule 25B to introduce a New Zealand DIIR that would be imposed on New Zealand-headquartered in-scope MNEs. For these MNEs, top-up tax on undertaxed New Zealand profits would ordinarily be collected under a UTPR (including New Zealand’s). The UTPR allocation mechanism (based on tangible assets and number of employees in each UTPR country) means that, in many cases, much of this tax would be allocated to New Zealand, but this would depend on the level of overseas assets and employees. A DIIR would avoid New Zealand-headquartered MNEs having to pay any part of the GloBE top-up tax on undertaxed New Zealand income to other countries under the UTPR. There would also be no additional tax cost for these taxpayers, just a change in the country they paid the tax to. This is unlike a QDMTT. If a New Zealand UPE has a direct subsidiary that is low taxed when there is also a minority interest, the DIIR will only apply to the portion of the low-tax profits attributable to the New Zealand MNE’s ownership. Under a QDMTT, the top-up tax would need to be paid on the basis of 100% ownership. Proposed Article 2.1.8 will also be included to provide for initial phase relief, that is, if an MNE group is headquartered in New Zealand, a DIIR would not apply to it during the initial phase under the transitional rules in Chapter 9. That is because any undertaxed New Zealand profits would not be subject to any other country’s UTPR or IIR during the period.

For the UTPR, this charge would be capped by reference to taxable deductions and available tax losses for the fiscal year to meet the “equivalent adjustment” requirements in the Model Rules. However, it would be capped by the total deductions and available tax losses claimed by all New Zealand constituent entities. When the UTPR liability exceeds these amounts, it would be carried forward to the next fiscal year. The UTPR top-up tax liability would be a joint and several liability of all New Zealand entities in an MNE group.

As the Multinational Top-Up Tax is an “ancillary tax” under the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA), it does not fall within the scope of income tax. This means a specific administration regime is required, which nevertheless generally follows income tax procedures. Its features include:  All in-scope MNEs must register with Inland Revenue within six months of the end of the first income year they are in-scope of the Applied GloBE rules.  New Zealand-headquartered in-scope MNEs must submit a GloBE Information Return (GIR) to Inland Revenue in the prescribed electronic format. A GIR may also need to be submitted to Inland Revenue by in-scope MNEs that are headquartered in a foreign country.  All in-scope MNEs must file an annual top-up tax return. This is a separate tax return that will state the amount of Multinational Top-Up Tax payable. The first top-up tax return would be due to Inland Revenue two months after the GIR is due (in subsequent years, this will be one month).  In-scope MNEs must pay Multinational Top-Up Tax to the Commissioner by the due date. The due date is the same as the due date for the annual top-up tax return. The proposed amendments also introduce new penalties for late registration and incomplete and/or late filing of the GIR. The GloBE rules are closely linked to the Country-by-Country (CbC) Reporting rules – in particular, the same taxpayers are in scope and the GloBE transitional safe harbours rely on CbC Reports. As a result, proposed amendments would require CbC Reports to be submitted in the required electronic format, and new penalties would be introduced for incomplete and/or late filing. This Guidance Material also provides a summary of the Transitional Safe Harbours published by the OECD in December 2022. 11 11 OECD (2022), Safe Harbours and Penalty Relief: Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules (Pillar Two), available at www.oecd.org Date: May 2023 52 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Background Chapter 8 of the Model Rules provides for a coordinated and standardised approach to reporting that is designed to reduce the compliance burden for in-scope MNEs and facilitate the effective administration of the GloBE rules. It also provides for the design of safe harbours that deem a GloBE top-up tax liability for a jurisdiction to be zero when the conditions provided under the GloBE Implementation Framework are met for the relevant fiscal year. The Model Rules place an obligation on each constituent entity to file a GIR. The GIR will need to be provided in a global standardised format, which will be developed during 2023 as part of the GloBE Implementation Framework. The GIR provides information on the tax calculations made by an MNE group and contains the information a tax administration needs to evaluate the correctness of a constituent entity’s self-assessed GloBE tax liability and to perform an appropriate risk assessment. A constituent entity’s obligation to file a GIR will be relieved if its ultimate parent entity, or a designated filing entity in the group, files the GIR with a tax administration, and the Competent Authority in the filing jurisdiction has an agreement in effect to automatically exchange the GIR with the Competent Authority of the jurisdiction of the constituent entity. Chapter 9 of the Model Rules provides transitional timeframes for filing the GIR. For the first year an in-scope MNE has a GIR filing obligation, its GIR will be due 18 months after the end of its fiscal year instead of 15 months. Local tax return filing and penalty rules are left to the determination of the implementing jurisdiction. In New Zealand, the compliance regime for the GIR and the Multinational Top- Up Tax return are in the TAA. The GloBE Implementation Framework includes the provision of safe harbours. Permanent safe harbours are still being designed. However, transitional safe harbours have been published that apply for fiscal years beginning on or before 31 December 2026 but not including a fiscal year that ends after 30 June 2028. These safe harbours provide transitional relief for MNE groups in the initial years during which the GloBE rules come into effect. Key features The key features of the proposed amendments are:  All in-scope MNEs must register with Inland Revenue within six months of the end of the first income year they are in-scope of the Applied GloBE rules.  New Zealand-headquartered MNEs are required to submit a GIR to Inland Revenue.

Detailed analysis Registration Proposed new section 78H provides that MNEs would be required to notify Inland Revenue that they are within the scope of the GloBE rules. It is proposed that MNEs will be given six months from the end of the first fiscal year they are in scope of the rules to complete this registration. This process would apply to both New Zealand-headquartered MNEs and foreign MNEs with constituent entities located in New Zealand (including branches). As part of this registration process, MNEs would inform Inland Revenue of the identity and location of the entity that would be filing the GIR. This will provide Inland Revenue with notice of where the GIR will be received from (whether that is directly or through information exchange channels) and a point of contact if the forms are not received for some reason. If MNEs cease to be in scope of the Applied GloBE rules, they must notify the Commissioner within six months of the end of the first fiscal year that the rules do not apply. The GloBE information return Proposed new section 78I of the TAA provides that a constituent entity located in New Zealand must provide to the Commissioner, in the prescribed electronic format, the information set out in Articles 8.1.4(a) to (d) of the Model Rules (that is, the GIR). This does not apply where the GIR is submitted on time by the ultimate parent entity (UPE) of the constituent entity, or a designated filing entity of the constituent entity’s MNE group, to a foreign competent authority that is obliged to exchange that information with the Commissioner. However, where the UPE is located in New Zealand, the GIR must be filed locally. Foreign-headquartered MNEs proposing to file the GIR in another country must notify the Commissioner about this.

The Multinational Top-Up T ax return would include a constituent entity’s self- assessment of any top-up tax in a form prescribed by the Commissioner. The due date for the Multinational Top-Up Tax return would be one month after the GIR due date. This would allow foreign groups to arrange filing of the Multinational Top-Up Tax return. In the first year, this would be extended to two months. Paying the tax As the Multinational Top-Up Tax liability would be a separate tax type, payment of the tax would be due separately from any income tax liability of the MNE and would have its own payment date. Payment of Multinational Top-Up Tax would be due on the same day that the Multinational Top-Up Tax return is due with Inland Revenue. Payments under the GloBE rules would not be subject to provisional tax. The standard rules in Parts 7 (Interest) and 9 (Penalties) of the TAA would apply to GloBE payments that are paid after the due date. Example 18: Reporting dates World is my Oyster Limited (WOL) is the New Zealand-resident UPE of an MNE that produces specialist oyster fishing equipment. It has operations in 15 countries and meets the requirements to be subject to the GloBE rules. WOL has a June balance date, and the first fiscal year it will be required to report under the GloBE rules will be the year ended 30 June 2025. WOL has a New Zealand tax agent and an extension of time to file its New Zealand income tax return. WOL’s reporting and payment dates for the initial 30 June 2025 year will be as follows:  New Zealand income tax return – due 31 March 2026.  GloBE information return – due 31 December 2026 (18 months after balance date – normally this will be due 15 months after balance date on 30 September).  New Zealand Multinational Top-Up Tax return and payment – due 28 February 2027 (20 months after balance date – normally this will be due 16 months after balance date on 31 October).

New penalties The Model Rules provide that penalties or sanctions for non-compliance with the GIR be set by implementing jurisdictions. These should be commensurate with penalties or sanctions in respect of other information return filing obligations in the jurisdiction (for example, section 139AB of the TAA in New Zealand). Late and/or incomplete GloBE Information Return For information to be exchanged with other tax authorities on a timely basis, it is important that Inland Revenue receives a complete GloBE Information Return (GIR) on time and in the correct format. This will give time for the information to be checked before it is provided to other jurisdictions. Documents not filed electronically in the XML format would not be treated as filed for this purpose. Proposed new section 139ABB provides for a penalty for failing to comply with the GIR requirements under proposed new section 78I. The penalty will apply to:  New Zealand-headquartered MNEs.  Foreign-headquartered MNEs with operations in New Zealand that do not file a GIR in a country with which New Zealand has an exchange of information agreement.  MNEs that do not file their GIR on time in their UPE or designated filing entity country. The amount of the penalty would be an amount specified by the Commissioner that would not exceed $100,000. Late and/or incomplete New Zealand Multinational Top-Up Tax Return Proposed new section 139ABB also provides for a penalty if a constituent entity fails to comply with the requirement to provide an annual Multinational Top-Up Tax return to the Commissioner under proposed new section 78J.

Proposed new section 139AAB would introduce a penalty for a large multinational group with a New Zealand resident ultimate owner that fails to comply with the requirements under section 78G. The amount of the penalty would be an amount specified by the Commissioner that would not exceed $100,000. Late registration Under proposed new section 78H of the TAA, New Zealand-headquartered and foreign- headquartered MNEs will be required to notify Inland Revenue that they are in scope of the Applied GloBE rules within six months from the end of the first fiscal year they are in scope of the rules. If the MNE fails to comply with the requirements of proposed new section 78H of the TAA, the taxpayer would be liable to pay a penalty under proposed new section 139ABB for an amount specified by the Commissioner that would not exceed $100,000. Shortfall penalties: Unacceptable tax position The Inclusive Framework has agreed transitional penalty relief that reflects a common understanding amongst implementing jurisdictions in relation to shortfall penalties to provide MNEs with a “soft landing” during the initial years in which the rules are being introduced. The common understanding on shortfall penalties means no penalties or sanctions should apply in connection with the filing of a GIR during a transition period when a tax administration considers that an MNE has taken “reasonable measures” to ensure the correct application of the Model Rules. A tax administration may consider that an MNE has taken reasonable measures when the MNE can demonstrate it has acted in good faith to understand and comply with the relevant domestic application of the GloBE rules and the Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax. Inland Revenue will administer the Multinational Top-Up Tax rules on this basis. Consequently, during the transition period, the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty in section 141B of the TAA will not apply to Multinational Top-Up Tax. Proposed changes to section 141B would result in this shortfall penalty applying to Multinational Top-Up Tax for fiscal years starting on or after 1 January 2027. All other shortfall penalties would apply from commencement.

It also proposes special rules to buttress that rate and help prevent over-taxing estates (which are taxed as trusts) and trusts settled for disabled people (disabled beneficiary trusts). Current law Unless otherwise specified, the focus of this chapter of the Bill Commentary is on complying trusts. The annual income of a trust is taxed as it is derived, either to the trustees or to the beneficiaries of the trust. Trustees of a trust are treated as a single taxable unit and their trustee income is calculated separately from their personal income. 12 Beneficiary income Beneficiary income is all income earned by a trust in an income year that is paid or allocated to the beneficiaries before the trust has filed its tax return. 13 Income does not need to be paid to a beneficiary to be beneficiary income; the income can be allocated to a beneficiary. Provided the trustees cannot change their mind about the allocation (that is, the income is vested absolutely in the beneficiary), the income is considered beneficiary income and is taxed at the beneficiary’s personal tax rate unless it is subject to the minor beneficiary rule. The minor beneficiary rule applies to beneficiary income derived by a minor (a New Zealand resident natural person under 16 years old) from property settled on a trust by a relative or legal guardian, or an associated person of the relative or legal guardian. If the total beneficiary income derived by the minor is greater than $1,000 in an income year, the income is taxed at the trustee tax rate to prevent parents, other relatives, or guardians from splitting their income with children. 14 12 Sections HC 2 and YA 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 13 Section HC 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 14 Sections HC 35 to HC 37 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Income allocated to a beneficiary that is credited to the beneficiary’s current account The income is available to be called upon at any time by the beneficiary, although in practice it is usually paid to the beneficiary at the discretion of the trustee or settlor. Allocated amounts are available in a bank account for the beneficiary to draw upon at any time. Income that is allocated to a beneficiary for them to possess at a future date or event (future possession beneficiary income) This could include where income is allocated to a beneficiary for them to possess when they reach a certain age. Provided the income will go to the beneficiary’s estate if the beneficiary dies before the future date or event, the income is considered beneficiary income in the year it is derived by the trust and is taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate. Unlike beneficiary income credited to a beneficiary’s current account, future possession beneficiary income is not available to be called upon by the beneficiary until they become entitled to possess the income (either once the future date or event has occurred or when the income goes to their estate on their death). Allocated amounts are held in a bank account the beneficiary cannot access until they reach the age of 21. Trustee income Trustee income is all taxable income derived by a trust in an income year that is not beneficiary income. 15 Trustee income is taxed at a flat rate of 33%. Once income has been taxed as trustee income, subsequent distributions of that income to the beneficiaries are tax free. That is, trustee income is subject to a final tax imposed in the year the income is derived by the trust. 15 Section HC 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Distributions of any amounts other than beneficiary income, including corpus, capital gains, or trustee income from prior years, are exempt from tax to the receiving beneficiary. 17 Social policy implications unchanged Under existing law, distributions of beneficiary or trustee income to a beneficiary of a trust are generally considered income for social policy purposes. 18 As a result, if Government support is means-tested (such as the Working for Families tax credit) or is otherwise calculated by reference to a person’s income (such as child support and student loan obligations), distributions of trust income can impact upon that Government support. Beneficiary income is generally considered “income” for social policy purposes in the year the income is allocated to the beneficiary, which is the year in which that income is derived by the trust. On the other hand, trustee income is normally only taken into account once it has been distributed to the beneficiary, which could be some time after the income was first derived (and tax was paid) on the income. The Bill does not propose to change when distributions from trusts are considered income for social policy purposes. Background and policy rationale The trustee tax rate of 33% has been in place since 1989 and was intentionally chosen to align with the (then) top personal tax rate. In 2020, a new top personal tax rate of 39% for income over $180,000 was introduced. The trustee tax rate was not increased at that time. Since the trustee tax rate is a final tax, it is possible for individuals to obtain a tax advantage by earning income through a trust, thus circumventing the 39% top personal tax rate. Previous rate misalignment resulted in behavioural change From 2000 to 2010, the top personal tax rate was 39%, which was higher than the trustee tax rate. During this period, significant amounts of income were diverted into trusts and taxed as trustee income. Much of the growth of trustee income was in the form of dividends.

Figure 1: Income reported on trust tax returns 1997-2021 After the top personal tax rate was reduced to 33% in 2010, there was no longer misalignment between the trustee tax rate and the top personal tax rate. This meant there was no longer a tax advantage in passing dividends through trusts, although existing structures often remained in place. From 2022, the top personal tax rate has again been higher than the trustee tax rate. In advance of this taking effect, there were larger than usual dividend flows in the 2020–21 income year, resulting in a spike in trustee income. Policy rationale for addressing misalignment Aligning the trustee and top personal tax rates at 39% would help ensure that trusts cannot be used to circumvent the top personal tax rate. This would improve the fairness and progressivity of the tax system, protect the revenue base from erosion, and improve the Government’s ability to raise revenue. This will also help achieve one of the Government’s long-term revenue objectives, which is to “ensure a progressive taxation system that is fair, balanced and promotes the long-term sustainability of the economy, consistent with the debt and operating balance objectives”. 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 12,000 14,000 16,000 18,000 1997199819992000200120022003200420052006200720082009201020112012201320142015201620172018201920202021 $m Income year Dividend IncomeBeneficiary IncomeTrustee Income Date: May 2023 65 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Proposals to address under-taxation To ensure trusts cannot be used to circumvent the top 39% personal tax rate, the Bill proposes to align the trustee tax rate and top personal tax rate at 39% for the 2024–25 and later income years (beginning 1 April 2024 for most trusts). To buttress that rate, beneficiary income derived by certain companies would be taxed as trustee income. This integrity rule is targeted towards family trusts and would not affect the commercial use of trusts in large corporate groups. Proposals to mitigate over-taxation In making the proposed changes, it is important to balance preventing high-income earners circumventing the top 39% tax rate with not over-taxing trusts with lower-rate beneficiaries. Trusts with lower-rate beneficiaries would be able to continue to use existing rules to mitigate over-taxation, as outlined above. The Bill also proposes targeted measures to help prevent the over-taxation of trusts in certain situations, such as deceased estates and disabled beneficiary trusts. Current law provides for lower-rate settlors and beneficiaries to mitigate over-taxation. Income of a trust can be taxed at a beneficiary’s personal tax rate if the income is paid or allocated to the beneficiary as “beneficiary income”, but this may not always be feasible. To help address this, two sets of special rules are proposed:  Deceased estates: When a deceased person’s affairs are still being settled, an estate (which is taxed as a trust) may be unable to allocate income to beneficiaries. The proposed special rules for estates would allow income received by an estate to be taxed as though it were the deceased’s income for 12 months after the deceased’s date of death.  Disabled beneficiary trusts: Special rules are also proposed for certain trusts settled for disabled people. These rules would allow trustee income to be taxed as though it were the disabled beneficiary’s income, as beneficiary income is currently taxed, even though the income would still retain its character as trustee income. While the rate applied to trustee income of estates or trusts settled for disabled people may differ to the rate applied to other trustee income, the income would still retain its character as trustee income.

Effective date The proposed amendment would have effect for the 2024–25 and later income years (beginning 1 April 2024 for most trusts). Background Due to the trustee tax rate being lower than the top personal tax rate, and trustee income being subject to a final tax in the year it is derived (and not subject to tax when it is eventually distributed to a beneficiary, if it is), trusts can be used to shelter income from higher personal tax rates. If a trust has a 39% tax rate beneficiary (who could also be a settlor), income may be accumulated in the trust and taxed at the 33% trustee tax rate. T here is then no further tax when the tax-paid trustee income is later distributed to the beneficiary. Detailed analysis Addressing under-taxation of trustee income Increasing the trustee tax rate to 39% to align with the top personal tax rate will ensure that trusts cannot be used to shelter income from the top personal tax rate. Example 19: Sheltering income from the 39% personal tax rate Amena has personal income of $180,000 per annum and is a beneficiary of a trust. 33% trustee tax rate In the 2023–24 income year, $50,000 has been retained in the trust as trustee income (with a tax liability of $16,500 at the 33% trustee tax rate). In the following year, the tax-paid trustee income ($50,000 less $16,500 tax = $33,500) is distributed to Amena. This distribution is not subject to tax.

Beneficiary income allocations may therefore be used to mitigate over-taxation that could arise from the proposed 39% trustee tax rate. Example 20: Mitigating over-taxation Amy (an air traffic controller) and Anthony (a builder with his own company) have settled some income-generating assets on a discretionary family trust for the benefit of themselves, their children (both minors under the age of 16) and future grandchildren. Amy, Anthony and their accountant are the trustees. 2024–25 income year Anthony has personal income of $70,000 and Amy has personal income of $180,000. Their trust has income of $40,000. If the income is retained as trustee income, it will be taxed at the proposed 39% trustee tax rate. Any income allocated to their children as beneficiary income will also be taxed at 39% under the minor beneficiary rule. However, by allocating the income to Anthony as beneficiary income, it can be taxed at his personal tax rate. This amount can be credited to Anthony’s current account, available to be called upon at any time, or he can settle it on the trust if he wishes to do so. has only been subject to a 33% tax rate, and Amena does not need to pay the 6% difference between the 33% trustee tax rate and the 39% personal tax rate, despite earning over $180,000. If the $50,000 income was earned directly by Amena as personal income, the tax liability would be $19,500. 39% trustee tax rate The amendment to increase the trustee tax rate to 39% is proposed to apply for the 2024–25 and later income years. In the 2024–25 income year, $50,000 has again been retained in the trust as trustee income (with a tax liability of $19,500 at the 39% trustee tax rate). Amena no longer receives a tax advantage from earning income through the trust.

Since Bary is no longer a minor, he is not subject to the minor beneficiary rule. Income can be allocated to Bary as beneficiary income and taxed at his personal tax rate (for example, up to $14,000 at 10.5%, over $14,000 and up to $48,000 at 17.5%).

Effective date The proposed amendments would have effect for the 2024–25 and later income years (beginning 1 April 2024 for most trusts). Background A company can be a beneficiary of a trust. Beneficiary income paid to a corporate beneficiary is taxed at 28%. The real beneficiary of such an allocation of income is the ultimate natural person shareholder in the company. The beneficiary income allocation should be taxed at the marginal tax rate of that person or persons. There is no reason for taxing the income earned by a trust and allocated to a company in the same way as income earned directly by the company. If the shareholder of the corporate beneficiary is the trust that is making the allocation, the income allocation achieves nothing. The income effectively remains within the trust. The principal, or in many cases the only, effect of the allocation is to ensure that the income is taxed at 28% rather than the trustee tax rate. While a subsequent distribution of the income by the company to the trust will be taxable as a dividend (with imputation credits attached), such a distribution may never be made. Detailed analysis To buttress the 39% trustee tax rate, amendments are proposed to ensure that beneficiary income derived by corporate beneficiaries is treated as trustee income for the purposes of determining the rate of tax that applies, who pays the relevant tax, and who provides the return of income, if: Date: May 2023 70 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  the company is a “close company” (that is, five or fewer natural persons or trustees hold more than 50% of the voting interests in the company, when treating associated persons as one person)  the company is not a Māori authority or a tax charity 19 , and  a settlor of the trust has “natural love and affection” for a direct or indirect shareholder of the company under sections YC 2 to YC 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA). Proposed new section HC 38 of the ITA would ensure that trustees cannot allocate beneficiary income to such companies to circumvent a 39% trustee tax rate. Natural love and affection “Natural love and affection” is an existing concept in tax law. It is used to describe the motive of a person for an action driven not by a promise of something in return, but by the natural love and affection the person has for another. Natural love and affection is generally considered to exist between relatives, whether by blood, marriage, a non-spousal domestic relationship, or adoption. It can be present between close friends as well, although not ordinary acquaintances or colleagues. Limiting this rule to close companies where a settlor of the trust has natural love and affection for a (direct or indirect) shareholder of the company will help ensure that the proposal is targeted towards family trusts and would not affect the commercial use of trusts in large corporate groups. Mitigating over-taxation of trust income Taxing beneficiary income derived by certain close companies as trustee income will prevent the under-taxation that would otherwise arise if the income were taxed at the corporate tax rate. This should not give rise to over-taxation. A family trust will not make a beneficiary income allocation to a corporate beneficiary unless the company is owned by one or more of the other beneficiaries (or the trust itself). If one or more of those shareholder beneficiaries is on a lower personal tax rate, the trustees can allocate the income directly to that person as beneficiary income to mitigate over-taxation. If the corporate beneficiary has a real need for funds, either the shareholder beneficiary, or the trust on their behalf, can invest the money in the company, either by way of debt or some form of capital contribution. 19 “Tax charity” is defined in section CW 41(5) of the ITA and includes charitable entities registered under the Charities Act 2005.

This treatment would mirror the existing provision in section LE 4 of the ITA for income subject to the minor beneficiary rule in sections HC 35 to 37 of the ITA. Example 21: Sheltering income in a corporate beneficiary Meriope is the beneficiary of a trust. She has a personal tax rate of 39%. The trust has derived $100 of income (this is (1) in the diagram). To prevent the $100 being taxed at the 39% rate, the trustees of the trust allocate the income to a corporate beneficiary as beneficiary income (this is (2a)). The income is taxed at the 28% corporate tax rate. The trust then loans $100 to Meriope (this is (2b)). The $100 is not taxable income of Meriope. Overall, only $28 of tax has been paid on the income. However, $39 of tax should have been paid, since the $100 has actually gone to Meriope, a 39% tax rate individual (via the loan from the trust). Under the proposed amendments, the $100 allocated to the company would be taxed at the 39% trustee tax rate. $39 of tax would be paid on the income.

Effective date The proposed amendments would have effect for the 2024–25 and later income years (beginning 1 April 2024 for most trusts). Background Deceased estates are taxed as trusts, which means income they derive is taxed at the trustee tax rate to the extent it is not beneficiary income. 20 Income derived by some deceased estates is already over-taxed at the current 33% trustee tax rate when the deceased person (when alive) and/or the beneficiaries of the deceased estate are on lower tax rates. Any over-taxation already present at the 33% rate would be exacerbated by the proposed 39% trustee tax rate. As noted in the Overview section, most trusts can use existing rules to pay or allocate income as beneficiary income to mitigate over-taxation. This is because beneficiary income is taxed at the beneficiary’s personal tax rates. However, deceased estates cannot use beneficiary income allocations to mitigate over-taxation if the beneficiaries of the deceased estate are not yet known, which may be the case for larger or more complex deceased estates. Trustee income of a deceased estate would not be over-taxed at the proposed 39% trustee tax rate if the deceased was on the 39% personal tax rate and/or the deceased estate’s beneficiaries are on the 39% rate. 20 For more information on the taxation of estates, refer to IS 18/01 Taxation of trusts – income tax from \[9.25\].

The Bill proposes applying the following formula in section HC 8B(2) to calculate the rate of tax that applies to trustee income subject to the modification: (combined tax – pre-death tax) ÷ post-death income Combined tax is the total amount of tax that would be payable for an income year, applying the personal income tax scale, if the following amounts were combined and then taxed under the personal income tax scale:  trustee income derived by the trustees of the estate within 12 months after the deceased person’s date of death, and  the personal income that the deceased person derived before their death in that income year. Pre-death tax is the amount of income tax payable in respect of the income of the deceased person in the income year. This amount would be zero in the income year following a person’s death. Post-death income is the total of amount of trustee income derived by the trustee of the deceased estate in the income year and within 12 months of the deceased person’s date of death. Applying the proposed formula in section HC 8B(2) means that, effectively, income derived by the trustee of a deceased estate that chooses to apply the modification would be taxed as follows:  In the income year in which the person died, income derived by the trustee of the deceased estate would be taxed at the deceased’s marginal tax rate(s).  In the following income year, income derived by the trustee of the deceased estate within 12 months of the person’s death would be taxed under the personal income tax scale. Apart from the rate of tax, the income would remain trustee income for all other purposes and would continue to be returned by the trustee of the deceased estate as trustee income. Any income derived by the trustee of the deceased estate after this 12-month period would be taxed at the proposed 39% trustee tax rate.

In the two income years after Petunia’s death, the trustee of her deceased estate derives the following amounts of trustee income:  2024–25 income year: $30,000.  2025–26 income year (within 12 months of death): $10,000.  2025–26 income year (more than 12 months after death): $10,000. The trustee decides to apply the deceased estates modification in proposed new section HC 8B (the application of the individual components of the formula is covered in more detail in the further examples below). Income year Trustee income Does the modification apply? Income tax liability 2024–25 $30,000 Yes $11,020 2025–26 (within 12 months of death) $10,000 Yes $1,050 2025–26 (more than 12 months after death) $10,000 No $3,900 In the 2024–25 income year, the net outcome is the same as if the trustee income had been earned by the deceased directly while they were alive. The trustee has an income tax liability of $11,020 for this income. The trustee income derived in the 2025–26 income year, but within 12 months of Petunia’s death, has an income tax liability of $1,050. This is the amount of tax that would have been payable had Petunia been alive and received this income directly in the 2025–26 income year. The remaining trustee income derived in the 2025–26 income year, but more than 12 months after Petunia’s death, is taxed at the proposed 39% trustee tax rate because the modification only applies to income derived by the trustee within 12 months of Petunia’s date of death.

If they do not, trustee income would be taxed under ordinary rules at the proposed 39% trustee tax rate. Modification applies to trustee income derived within 12 months of death (section HC 8B(1)) The modification would only apply to trustee income derived by a trustee of a deceased estate within 12 months of the deceased person’s date of death. This helps ensure that income derived by a trustee of a deceased estate is not over-taxed while the affairs of the deceased person are being worked through, particularly when the trustee is still determining who the beneficiaries of the deceased estate are (so beneficiary income allocations cannot yet be made). The proposed modification would apply for a limited time so that it does not incentivise trustees to retain income rather than distributing amounts to the beneficiaries of the estate. Modification taxes income using personal income tax rates (section HC 8B(2)) If a trustee of a deceased estate chooses to apply the modification, trustee income derived within 12 months of the deceased person’s death would be taxed at the rate calculated using the formula in proposed new section HC 8B(2): (combined tax – pre-death tax) ÷ post-death income Combined tax (section HC 8B(2) and (3)(a)) “Combined tax” is defined as the total tax calculated under schedule 1, part A, clause 1, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) (that is, applying the personal tax scale) for each dollar of taxable income derived in the income year by the deceased person or the trustee within 12 months of the person’s date of death.

Example 26: Calculating the basic tax rate on trustee income (continuation of previous example) The basic tax rate that applies to trustee income subject to the deceased estates modification is: (combined tax – pre-death tax) ÷ post-death income The relevant amounts for Petunia’s deceased estate are: Income year Combined tax Pre-death tax Post-death income 2024–25 $20,620 $11,020 $30,000 2025–26 $1,050 $0 $10,000 Applying the formula, the basic tax rate in the 2024–25 income year is 32% (($20,620 - $11,020) ÷ $30,000). The basic tax rate in the 2025–26 income year for trustee income derived within 12 months of Petunia’s death is 10.5% (($1,050 - $0) ÷ $10,000). The further $10,000 derived in the 2025–26 income year and more than 12 months after Petunia’s death is not subject to the modification. It is therefore taxed at the proposed 39% trustee tax rate.

Effective date The proposed amendments would have effect for the 2024–25 and later income years (beginning 1 April 2024 for most trusts). Background To ensure the proposed 39% trustee tax rate does not result in over-taxation for trusts settled for disabled people, a modification is proposed for these trusts. Special regimes for disability trusts are a common feature of overseas regimes (such as in Australia, Canada, the UK, and the US). Key features To help ensure the proposed 39% trustee tax rate does not result in over-taxation, proposed new section HC 39 would enable trustee income derived by a trust settled for a disabled person (disabled beneficiary trust) to be taxed at the disabled beneficiary’s personal tax rate if the trust meets certain criteria. Table 3: Qualifying criteria for disabled beneficiary trust Qualifying criteria Further explanation Trust must have only one beneficiary, ignoring any residual beneficiaries. The disabled beneficiary must be the only person to whom distributions can be made, unless the disabled beneficiary has died and distributions are made on the dissolution of the trust. The trust deed must not allow any further beneficiaries, apart from residual beneficiaries, to be added.

A disabled beneficiary is a person who, for some, or all, of the income year, receives the supported living payment on the ground of restricted work capacity or had the child disability allowance paid. Trustee income of a disabled beneficiary trust would be taxed at the disabled beneficiary’s personal tax rate. This is achieved through applying the formula in proposed new section HC 39(2): (combined tax − tax on beneficiary’s income) ÷ trustee income Combined tax is the total amount of tax that would be payable if the trustee income were combined with the income derived by the disabled beneficiary in the income year, applying the personal income tax scale. Tax on beneficiary’s income is the amount of income tax payable in respect of the income derived by the disabled beneficiary in the income year (for example, tax on the supported living payment or child disability allowance, and employment or investment income). Trustee income is the total amount of trustee income derived by the trustee of the disabled beneficiary trust in the income year. Trustee income subject to the disabled beneficiary trust modification would remain trustee income for all other purposes. This means tax paid on the income would continue to be a final tax, with no further tax payable when funds are later distributed to the disabled beneficiary (or to another person, if the disabled beneficiary dies and funds are later distributed to residual beneficiaries on the dissolution of the trust). A trust may qualify for the disabled beneficiary trust modification in an income year, then cease to qualify for the modification in a subsequent income year (for example, because the disabled beneficiary ceases to receive the supported living payment in that year), and then requalify for the modification in a later income year. However, if a trust ceases to qualify for the modification because further beneficiaries are added to the trust (whether in replacement of, or supplementary to, the disabled beneficiary), the trust cannot qualify for the modification again in a later income year. This is to ensure that only the disabled beneficiary can benefit from the modification. If other beneficiaries were added to the trust, they might receive distributions of tax-paid trustee income that had been taxed at the disabled beneficiary’s personal tax rate, which would be inappropriate.

At current payment rates for a single person aged 18 years or over, Matilda receives $21,440 of taxable income each year. Matilda’s parents are retired and want to ensure Matilda will continue to receive a similar level of care once they have passed away. They decide to settle property on a disabled beneficiary trust for Matilda. They arrange for Matilda’s siblings, their lawyer, and their accountant to be trustees of the trust. Matilda is the only beneficiary of the trust. The trust satisfies the requirements of the disabled beneficiary trust modification for the 2024–25 income year. The trustees of the trust derive $50,000 of trustee income in the 2024–25 income year. Applying the formula in proposed new section HC 39(2) achieves the same net outcome as if the trustee income had been earned directly by Matilda. A 23% tax rate applies to the trustee income. This is because after taking into account the income Matilda receives because of the supported living payment, the trustee income is taxed at a combination of the 17.5%, 30% and 33% personal tax rates. Type of income Amount of income Tax rate Income tax liability Matilda’s personal income $21,440 13% (combination of the 10.5% and 17.5% rates) $2,772 Trustee income $50,000 23% (combination of the 17.5%, 30% and 33% rates) $11,723 The application of the individual components of the formula in section HC 39(2) is covered in more detail in the further examples below. Despite a different rate applying, the income to which the modification applies is still considered trustee income. The obligation to return and pay tax on the trustee income lies with the trustees of the trust. When the trustee income is later distributed to Matilda, no further tax will be payable.

The trust deed names Matilda’s siblings as residual beneficiaries of the trust, so when the trust is dissolved upon Matilda’s death, any remaining property in the trust is distributed to her siblings. When it is dissolved, the trust has $200,000 of trustee income that was taxed at Matilda’s personal rate in previous income years. When that income is distributed to Matilda’s siblings, no further tax is payable because tax paid on trustee income is a final tax. It does not matter if Matilda’s siblings are on different personal tax rates. Any other income derived between Matilda’s date of death and the date the trust is wound up is distributed to her siblings, the residual beneficiaries, as beneficiary income. This income is taxed as though it were her siblings’ personal income (in accordance with existing rules regarding the taxation of beneficiary income). Detailed analysis Definition of “disabled beneficiary trust” (section HC 39(4)) The Bill proposes defining “disabled beneficiary trust” to mean a trust with one beneficiary who, during each income year for which the modification applies, meets the definition of “disabled beneficiary” (proposed section HC 39(4)(a)). In addition, during each income year for which the modification applies, as well as all subsequent income years (regardless of whether the modification applies), the beneficiary:  must be the only person entitled to receive distributions from the trust (unless the distributions are made when the trust is dissolved and the disabled beneficiary has died) (proposed section HC 39(4)(b)(i) and (ii)), and  cannot be replaced, or supplemented, as the beneficiary of the trust (proposed section HC 39(4)(b)(iii)). Beneficiary must be “disabled beneficiary” (section HC 39(4)(a) and (5)) For a trust to qualify for the modification, the beneficiary of the trust would need to satisfy the definition of “disabled beneficiary” in proposed new section HC 39(5). This means the beneficiary must receive either of two Government support payments: the supported living payment on the ground of restricted work capacity, or the child disability allowance.

Supported living payment on the ground of restricted work capacity The supported living payment may be made to people who meet certain criteria, including disabled people. One ground for receipt of the supported living payment is “restricted work capacity”. This is essentially where a significant health condition, injury or disability is expected to impact upon a person’s ability to work for a period, or the person’s condition is terminal. People aged under 16 cannot receive the supported living payment but may receive the child disability allowance instead. Child disability allowance The child disability allowance is generally paid to the main carer of a child with a serious disability who is under 18 years of age. To qualify, the child must be a dependent child and must have a disability that requires constant care and attention, either permanently or for a period exceeding 12 months. The allowance is not means tested. However, it cannot be paid concurrently with the supported living payment (even though a person over 16 and under 18 could qualify for either the child disability allowance or the supported living payment). The existing exclusion for disabled minors from the minor beneficiary rule is also tied to receipt of the child disability allowance. Basing eligibility for the proposed modification on a minor beneficiary’s receipt of the child disability allowance is therefore consistent with the existing exclusion for disabled minors from the minor beneficiary rule. Support payments can be made for some, or all, of the relevant income year To qualify, a beneficiary would be required to have received either the supported living payment on the ground of restricted work capacity or the child disability allowance for at least part of the relevant income year. This means a trust settled for the care of a person who becomes disabled and commences receiving Government support part way through an income year could qualify for the modification for that year.

After the accident, Sam’s mum (his main carer) receives the child disability allowance. Sam’s accident occurred in December 2024, and his mum starts receiving the child disability allowance soon after. Sam’s grandparents decide to settle property on a trust for Sam so that there are extra funds available to help pay for his ongoing care. The trust meets the eligibility criteria for the modification. Some income derived by the trust is applied for Sam’s benefit, so it is considered (and taxed as) beneficiary income. The minor beneficiary rule does not apply because Sam qualifies for the exclusion for disabled minors. Therefore, Sam’s beneficiary income is taxed at his personal tax rate. The trust’s remaining income is retained as trustee income. The trustee income is also taxed at Sam’s personal tax rate because the modification applies. Trust must have only one beneficiary (ignoring residual beneficiaries) (section HC 39(4)) The modification would only apply to trusts with one beneficiary (ignoring any residual beneficiaries). Limiting this proposal to trusts with only one beneficiary minimises complexity by avoiding the need for rules regarding how trustee income should be taxed or apportioned if a trust has multiple beneficiaries. Further beneficiaries cannot be added (section HC 39(4)(b)(iii)) To ensure the requirement that disabled beneficiary trusts only have one beneficiary is adhered to, further beneficiaries (except residual beneficiaries) cannot be added to the trust once the modification begins to apply to a trust. Example 29: Trust not eligible because further beneficiaries can be added Charlie and Violet settle property on a trust for their son, Danny, who has a serious disability. The child disability allowance is paid for Danny for the income year. While Danny is the sole beneficiary of the trust, the trust deed allows further beneficiaries to be added. As a result, the modification would not apply.

Once a disabled beneficiary has passed away, no restrictions apply to whom the trust property can be distributed to. This means it would not matter if the residual beneficiaries were not disabled and/or were on higher personal tax rates. Example 30: Trust deed only allows residual beneficiaries to be added Same facts as example 29, except the trust deed only allows residual beneficiaries to be added to the trust. The deed specifies that any residual beneficiaries of the trust are only to receive trust property after Danny’s death. The trust would qualify for the disability trust modification. Modification taxes trustee income at the marginal rate(s) of the beneficiary (section HC 39(2) and (3)) Proposed new section HC 39(2) provides a formula for determining the tax rate that applies to trustee income derived by the trustee of a disabled beneficiary trust. (combined tax − tax on beneficiary’s income) ÷ trustee income Combined tax (section HC 39(2) and (3)(a)) “Combined tax” is defined as the total tax calculated under schedule 1, part A, clause 1, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (that is, applying the personal tax scale) for each dollar of taxable income derived in the income year by the disabled beneficiary or the trustee.

Example 31: Combined tax (continuation of example 27 above) In the 2024–25 income year, Matilda derives $21,440 of taxable income.

Effective date The proposed amendment would have effect for the 2024–25 and later income years (beginning 1 April 2024 for most trusts). Background “Corpus” for a trust means the settlement value of property settled on the trust, subject to certain exclusions. 21 Distributions of amounts of corpus to beneficiaries of the trust are exempt from tax. 22 A settlement by a trustee of a trust (Trust A) on another trust (Trust B) is excluded from corpus of Trust B to the extent to which, if it were distributed to a New Zealand-resident beneficiary of Trust A, it would be beneficiary income or a taxable distribution to that beneficiary. 23 This rule is intended to ensure that trustees cannot avoid paying tax on distributions of amounts accumulated in trusts simply by settling those amounts on other trusts and then distributing them as tax-free corpus. Detailed analysis Trustees can make resettlements on behalf of beneficiaries. This involves:  a payment made by the trustee to the beneficiary for the purposes of the definitions of “beneficiary income” 24 and “distribution” 25 , and 21 Section HC 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 22 S ections CW 53 and HC 20 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 23 Section HC 4(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007. 24 Section HC 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 25 Section HC 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Effective date The proposed amendments would have effect for payments made on or after 1 April 2024. Background A lump sum backdated payment to a person of their ACC or MSD entitlements could result in that person having to pay a higher amount of tax. This is because, for most individual taxpayers, income is taxed in the year it is received. This can be seen as unfair when the person was entitled to receive the payment in earlier years. Receipt of the lump sum can artificially push people into a higher tax bracket for a single year. This compounds the disadvantage suffered by the affected person who, in addition to having had a delay in receiving their entitlement, also receives a smaller net amount than if the amount had been paid over multiple years (that is, when it should have been paid). A fairness issue arises when all the following occur:  the amount is significant enough to move the taxpayer into a higher tax bracket  if spread over the relevant tax years, the taxpayer would have had a lower tax liability in relation to that amount  a backdated (or remedial) lump sum payment (BLSP) is made relating to two or more tax years, and  the delay or error has been caused by an action or inaction by the Crown. This issue has been raised repeatedly over several years for ACC and MSD payments in complaints to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, Ministerial correspondence, media articles and Select Committee submissions.

In some cases, whether a person is entitled to ACC compensation may be the subject of dispute or delay in awarding compensation and making payment to the person. Example 35: Taxation of Scotty’s ACC payment Montgomery Scott (Scotty) was a forklift operator for one of the major ports in New Zealand. In 2019, he was involved in a workplace accident that saw him suffer long- term damage to his leg. For a time, Scotty received weekly compensation under the Accident Compensation Act 2001 for loss of earnings. However, ACC stopped paying him weekly compensation in 2019 when it considered he was able to return to paid employment. Scotty disputed this decision, but it took some years to resolve this dispute as several investigations needed to be completed before final eligibility was established. In 2023, Scotty was awarded a payment of $50,000 per year. This was paid in a lump sum of $200,000 in March 2023. If Scotty had received this amount in the relevant years, his tax liability for the payments would have been as follows: 2020 2021 2022 2023 Total Income $50,000 $50,000 $50,000 $50,000 $200,000 Tax liability $8,020 $8,020 $8,020 $8,020 $32,080 However, for tax purposes the payment is only taxed on receipt of the full amount in 2023. This will result in income in the 2023 year of $200,000, and a tax liability for Scotty of $58,120. The difference between the two treatments is an additional tax liability for Scotty of $26,040. MSD backdated entitlements Backdated payments of MSD entitlements may also give rise to an increased tax liability if they are paid in a subsequent tax year. BLSPs are paid by MSD, for example, when there has been a past system error, or when incorrect or incomplete information was provided at the time of an assessment. They tend to be for smaller amounts (under $1,000) than ACC BLSPs.

MSD determine how much the recipient is entitled to in their hand and then gross up that amount for the tax payable. MSD calculate the tax to withhold as if the payments had been made on time (by reference to previous years). Since Inland Revenue taxes the BLSP in the year of receipt, this may result in a higher amount of tax payable for the recipient. For some recipients of MSD entitlements, a tax write-off is available for the difference in tax (between what was deducted and the tax owing). However, for those who receive Working for Families or those who are no longer on a benefit, this tax difference is payable. Example 36: Taxation of Sammy’s backdated MSD entitlement Sammy worked as a shepherd on a high-country farm in North Canterbury. In 2013, Sammy had to stop work after suffering extreme dizziness and fatigue over a prolonged period. Sammy was originally diagnosed with depression and was granted a sickness benefit when they left work. Years later, Sammy applied for a supported-living payment (also known as an invalid benefit) but their claim was denied. After years of trying to treat their illness, in 2022 they were diagnosed with a rare genetic condition. Following this new information, MSD granted Sammy the supported living payment and Sammy appealed to have this backdated to 2013. Sammy was awarded $10,000 in backdated benefits and $2,000 in ex-gratia payments for their pain and suffering. When calculating the tax owed on the payment, MSD wants to ensure that Sammy will get $10,000 by adding an extra amount (grossing up the payment) to account for Sammy’s tax liability. To do that, MSD work out the amount of the tax payable on the payments as if those payments had been taxed in the correct year, which works out to be $2,500. 26 MSD pays Sammy $12,500 gross and withholds and pays PAYE of $2,500 to Inland Revenue. Sammy receives $10,000 in the hand. However, when information about the payment comes through into Sammy’s annual income tax calculation at Inland Revenue, additional tax is owing on the BLSP. This is because it is taxed in the year of receipt and not as MSD has calculated the tax liability. This has flow-on effects to their social policy obligations. 26 This amount of tax deducted is for illustrative purposes.

The proposed tax treatment for each payment differs due to the way in which tax is calculated by MSD and ACC. Detailed analysis ACC compensation payments Proposed new section RD 20B of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) provides the method to calculate an alternative tax rate for ACC BLSPs (a multi-year compensation payment). A multi-year compensation payment is defined as an accident compensation earnings-related payment consisting of a lump sum and relating to more than one income year for a person. Under proposed section RD 20B(3), the tax rate that would apply to a multi-year compensation payment would be: a. 10.5% if the average basic tax rate is less than 10.5% and paragraph c. does not apply, or b. the average basic tax rate if neither of paragraph a. or c. apply, or c. the person’s basic tax rate for the income year they receive the payment if that basic tax rate is less than the average basic tax rate. Paragraph (a) - minimum tax rate Paragraph (a) in proposed new section RD 20B(3) introduces a minimum tax rate of 10.5% to recognise the tax required to be withheld from the payment if the payment was the person’s only income.

This formula is as follows: 0.25 x (basic rate 1 + basic rate 2 + basic rate 3 + basic rate 4) Basic rate 1 to basic rate 4 are defined in proposed section RD 20B(5), and they effectively mean the person’s basic tax rate calculated under schedule 1, Part A, clause 1 of the ITA for each of the four income years in the averaging period. Paragraph (c) – basic tax rate The proposed section also introduces a ‘lower of’ test to prevent recipients from being worse off under the alternative tax treatment compared to the status quo. This means that if the recipient has had a higher tax rate in the four years before receipt of the BLSP but has a lower tax rate in the year the BLSP is paid, the person’s basic tax rate for the current year would apply. Payment by ACC Under current information sharing provisions, ACC would be able to request the recipient’s correct tax rate before the BLSP is made and then apply that as the withholding rate on the payment. This would mean no additional amount of tax should be payable for the BLSP (assuming the recipient’s circumstances do not change). The rate determined under proposed section RD 20B would apply to the BLSP separately from the rate applied to the person’s other income in the year they receive the payment. Example 37: Taxation of Scotty’s ACC payment in 2024 (continuation of example 35 above) If Scotty was paid his payment on or after 1 April 2024, the proposed tax treatment would apply. If Scotty had no other income – minimum tax rate Assume that while disputing the claim with ACC, Scotty was able to live mainly on his savings and with support from his partner. Before ACC pays his BLSP, ACC contacts Inland Revenue for Scotty’s average basic tax rate over the previous four years.

If Scotty was earning other income Assume that while disputing the claim with ACC, Scotty was able to find a part-time office job. Before ACC pays his BLSP, ACC contacts Inland Revenue for Scotty’s average basic tax rate over the previous four years. His income and average basic tax rate, excluding the BLSP, for each year is as follows: 2020 2021 2022 2023 Income $18,000 $21,000 $26,000 $30,000 Basic tax rate 27 12% 12.8% 13.7% 14.2% Using the formula, Scotty’s average basic tax rate for the previous four years would be: 0.25 x (12 (BTR 1) + 12.8 (BTR 2) + 13.7 (BTR 3) + 14.2 (BTR 4)) = 13.175%. Therefore, instead of Scotty’s BLSP being included in his annual tax return for 2024, it would be taxed separately at his average basic tax rate. ACC can apply the average tax rate to the BLSP ($200,000 x 13.175%) and withhold the tax before making the payment to Scotty. Scotty’s tax liability on the BLSP would be $26,350. Assuming Scotty has $30,000 income from his part-time office job in 2024, he will continue to pay tax at the applicable rate on that income. However, no additional tax will be owed for the BLSP. Without the alternative tax treatment, Scotty’s BLSP would have been included in his taxable income for 2024 ($30,000 + 200,000). Under ordinary treatment, his tax liability would have been $69,820. 28 27 This is calculated by dividing tax paid by taxable income x 100. 28 This calculation assumes the marginal tax rates are unchanged in the 2024-25 income year from the 2022-23 income year.

A multi-year benefit payment is defined as a main benefit consisting of a lump sum that relates to more than one income year. For these purposes, a main benefit is as defined in paragraph (a) of the definition of “main benefit” in schedule 2 of the Social Security Act 2018, namely:  jobseeker support  sole parent support  a supported living payment on the ground of restricted work capacity, total blindness, or caring for another person  a youth payment  a young parent payment, or  an emergency benefit. The proposed formula for calculating the tax rate on the BLSP would effectively treat the tax deducted by MSD before paying the person as the correct amount of tax owed. This means there would be no further tax payable and the BLSP would be ignored for the person’s income tax liability. The BLSP would still be considered for social policy entitlements because these entitlements are, generally, calculated with reference to cash in hand. Example 38: Taxation of Sammy’s MSD payment in 2024 (continuation of example 36 above) If Sammy was paid their BLSP after 1 April 2024, the proposed alternative tax treatment would apply. This would mean that once MSD calculated the tax owing, this would be the final amount of tax payable on the BLSP. The tax rate on Sammy’s payment would be calculated as follows: $2,500 (tax deduction) ÷ ($10,000 (received amount) + $2,500 (tax deduction)) = 0.2 The calculated rate of 20% should equal the amount deducted, meaning no extra tax would be owing on the payment.

Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 1 July 2024. Key features  From 1 July 2024, the Government would pay a three percent KiwiSaver contribution to eligible PPL recipients.  To be eligible, PPL recipients would also need to contribute three percent of their PPL payments to their KiwiSaver accounts. Background The financial position of women at retirement is typically less secure than men. Although women tend to live longer than men, the average KiwiSaver balances of men are 20 percent higher than those of women. The reasons for this are varied and include overrepresentation in lower paid roles, lower rates of labour force participation, and time spent out of the workforce to raise children or care for family members. Paid Parental Leave (PPL) is a payment made to qualifying individuals and is intended to make up for lost income when a person takes time out of the workforce to have a baby. For the period 1 July 2022 – 30 June 2023, PPL payments will match a person’s weekly income up to a maximum of $661.12 per week before tax. Under the proposed amendment, the government would pay a three percent KiwiSaver contribution on amounts of PPL received by KiwiSaver members where the PPL recipient also paid a corresponding three percent KiwiSaver employee contribution into their KiwiSaver account. This would help to increase the KiwiSaver balances of PPL recipients, many of whom are women.

This relief would enable the profits and depreciation recovery income arising when insurance or compensation proceeds are received for business assets destroyed by the North Island flooding events to be deferred provided the assets are replaced. Similar temporary, time-limited relief was provided for assets destroyed by the Canterbury and Hurunui-Kaikōura earthquakes. The Bill also includes several minor associated amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA), particularly the depreciation rules. Si milar amendments were included as part of the earthquake tax relief packages. Effective date The proposed amendments would be effective for the 2022–23 and later income years, ceasing in the 2027–28 income year. Background Normally, the receipt of insurance proceeds for a destroyed business asset gives rise to either depreciation recovery income on a depreciable asset, or income on a revenue account asset. The resulting upfront tax liability means that a business seriously impacted by a North Island flooding event will have less cash available to pay for the replacement assets needed to recommence business. In many cases, it would also mean a windfall revenue gain to the Government from the events. While these taxable gains would normally have arisen if the assets were sold, the unexpected nature of the flooding destruction is a very different circumstance, and the resulting tax liability is unexpected. This issue was recognised in relation to the assets destroyed by the Canterbury and Hurunui-Kaikōura earthquakes and rollover relief was provided. Rollover relief defers the recognition of the depreciation recovery income or income on a revenue account asset, provided there is a commitment to rebuild or replace the destroyed assets. As part of the earthquake provisions, several associated amendments were made to clarify the timing around the deductibility of expenditure and recognition of income for the Date: May 2023 107 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] damaged assets. The Bill contains similar proposed technical amendments as part of the flood tax relief package. For more detail and examples on the Canterbury legislation, see Tax Information Bulletin Volume 24, No 10, December 2012. Key features The Bill contains a set of proposed amendments to the ITA as part of providing rollover relief for assets “destroyed” because of the January/February North Island flooding events. These amendments:  provide rollover relief for both revenue account assets and depreciable assets that are destroyed or uneconomic to repair  clarify that on-going expenses or losses can continue to be deducted when a business activity is so disrupted by a flooding event that there is no longer a sufficient nexus between the expenses and the income-earning activity  align the tax treatment of depreciable assets that are uneconomic to repair with the treatment of depreciable assets that have been “irreparably damaged” or are “useless for earning income” for tax purposes  limit the recovery income that arises under the tax rules when insurance proceeds have been received for a damaged asset that is repairable to the amount of depreciation deductions previously claimed for the asset  provide optional matching rules to smooth the timing of income and deductions/disposal losses when insurance proceeds have been received for flood affected (depreciable) assets  clarify that a depreciation deduction may be claimed on depreciable property when access to the property is temporarily restricted because of a flooding event, and  provide an optional adjustment rule for measuring group assets for the purposes of the thin-capitalisation rules. Detailed analysis The Bill proposes to insert new sections CZ 25C, DZ 20B, EZ 23BE, EZ 83 to EZ 87, and FZ 7B to the ITA. These provisions are based on the previous earthquake provisions. A key exception is that the proposed provisions do not include a requirement that replacement land and buildings be located in the same region in New Zealand.

In both cases, the rollover option requires the destroyed 29 asset to be replaced. If it is not replaced by the end of the 2027–28 income year, then the rollover relief would cease in that year. I f the business ceases operations or acquires the replacement asset in an income year before the 2027–28 income year, the rollover relief would cease in that earlier income year. The cost of the replacement asset for tax purposes is reduced to reflect the deferred income in the year the asset is replaced, or partially replaced if the replacement expenditure is incurred gradually. As rollover relief is optional, the taxpayer would need to elect to use the option and notify the Commissioner of their election. This must be done by the date their return of income is required to be filed for each income year that they elect to use rollover relief. Certain information is required as part of the notification. Its purpose is to ensure that the taxpayer turns their mind each year to deciding whether they still intend to replace the asset. Example 39 A taxpayer’s revenue account building located in the Hawke’s Bay is destroyed by a North Island flooding event. The building originally cost $1.5 million. The replacement insurance proceeds are $3 million, and the replacement building is completed on 15 June 2026. In the absence of rollover relief, the building owner will have taxable income of $1.5 million (under section CG 6). Proposed section CZ 25C would allow the owner to defer that income tax liability by allocating an amount of $1.5 million to the replacement building. As a result of negotiations between the building owner and the insurance company, the insurance proceeds can be reasonably estimated on 30 September 2023. In the tax return for the tax year ending on 31 March 2024, the building owner files an election to defer the $1.5 million of income pending replacement of the building. Provided the taxpayer continues to elect to defer the income, it remains suspended for the tax years ending on 31 March 2025 and 31 March 2026. 29 The asset has to be irreparably damaged/useless for income-earning purposes.

A notice will have to be filed with the tax return for the year ended 31 March 2027 advising that the deferred income has been rolled into the tax base for the replacement asset. The taxpayer must also give notice that the amount of unallocated suspended income has been reduced by $1.5 million to $0. When the replacement asset is eventually sold, the difference between the $1.5 million cost and the sales proceeds will be taxable, provided the building is sold for more than $1.5 million. Example 40 Plant and equipment (not previously depreciated under the pool method) destroyed by a North Island flooding event had a cost of $1 million. On the day of the flood, the plant and equipment had an adjusted tax book value of $700,000. The owner receives an insurance pay-out of $1 million. The net depreciation recovered is, therefore, $300,000, and this becomes the suspended recovery income. The replacement assets are acquired over two years at a cost of $400,000 per year. In year three, the owner decides to acquire no more replacement assets. Under proposed section EZ 23BE, the $300,000 suspended recovery income is allocated as follows: Year 1 ($400,000 x $300,000) / $1,000,000 = $120,000) Year 2 ($400,000 x $300,000) / $1,000,000 = $120,000) The cost of the replacement plant and machinery is reduced in total by $240,000. The remaining suspended recovery income balance of $60,000 (representing the portion of assets not replaced) is taxed in the year the taxpayer decides to make no further investment in replacement property. Deductibility of expenses when no income-earning activity Proposed new section DZ 20B addresses the situation where some taxpayers are no longer able to deduct their on-going expenses or losses relating to their income-earning activity. For example, when land is not physically accessible due to silt, resulting in the business activity being so disrupted by the flooding event that there is no longer a sufficient nexus between the expenses and the income-earning activity.

To qualify, the person must:  have an income-earning activity in the “affected area” immediately before the flooding event, and  in the current year, during the period of interruption, have incurred expenditure or loss in meeting an obligation relating to the income-earning activity and that interruption expenditure does not meet the requirements of the general deductibility permission in section DA 1, but would have done so but for the interruption, and  resume the income-earning activity in an income year before the 2028–29 income year. If all these conditions are met, the person is allowed to deduct the expenditure in the year their income earning is resumed. Damaged depreciation property that is uneconomic to repair The tax depreciation rules do not provide an appropriate outcome when an asset has been damaged by a North Island flooding event and the insurer or comparable qualified assessor considers it to be uneconomic to repair, even though the asset may be technically repairable. This is because the tax rules distinguish between assets that are repairable and those that are irreparably damaged or rendered useless for earning income. Assets that are uneconomic to repair are generally included in the former category. The consequence is that a taxpayer may face a significant unexpected tax liability when an insurance amount is received. To help overcome this problem, proposed new section EZ 83 would provide for a deemed disposal and reacquisition of assets that are damaged by a January/February North Island flooding event and are uneconomic to repair. This would better align their depreciation treatment with those of assets that have been irreparably damaged by a flooding event. Rollover relief would then be available for those assets. The asset would be deemed to be reacquired for nil consideration on the same day as the deemed disposal (which would be for the amount of insurance), meaning that the post- flooding event repairs would be capitalised rather than being treated as deductible expenditure.

It is damaged by a North Island flooding event and the insurance company decides it has an obligation under the insurance policy to replace it at a cost of $10 million because it is no longer fit for purpose and is uneconomic to repair. The damaged building is retained by the insured party and put to another, less productive, use. Proposed new section EZ 83 could be applied in these circumstances. Therefore, the building would be treated as being disposed of for $10 million and reacquired for nil consideration on the date of the flooding event that caused the asset to be uneconomic to repair. As the building would be treated as having been disposed of, the owner of the asset could apply the matching rule in proposed new section EZ 86 to smooth the timing of income calculated under existing section EE 48. Under section EE 48, the result will be: Original cost $5,000,000 Depreciation deductions $4,000,000 Adjusted tax value $1,000,000 Amount for disposal (consideration) $10,000,000 Depreciation recovery income $4,000,000 Capital gain $5,000,000 Rollover relief (under proposed new section EZ 23BE) would be available to the building owner for the $4 million of depreciation recovery income. Cap on depreciation recovery income Section EE 52 of the ITA treats as taxable any insurance proceeds in excess of an asset’s adjusted tax value and expenditure on repairing the asset. As a result, the tax rules may end up taxing more than the amount of earlier depreciation deductions allowed for the asset. In the context of the North Island flooding events, this means that some taxpayers may face significant unanticipated income tax liabilities in relation to damaged (but repairable) assets. Accordingly, proposed new section EZ 84 would limit depreciation recovery income to the amount of depreciation deductions previously taken when insurance proceeds are received for a repairable depreciable asset damaged by a January/February North Island flooding event.

However, proposed section EZ 84 would cap the amount of depreciation recovery income at $4 million. The remaining $1 million would be treated as a capital gain. Property that is available for use For an item of property to be depreciated for tax purposes, it must be used in a business or be available for use. However, it is not clear how this rule should be applied when access to depreciable property is temporarily restricted by a January/February North Island flooding event. Proposed new section EZ 85 would address this issue by treating the item as being available for use during the period of restricted access, provided it was available for use immediately before the restriction was imposed. Depreciation could therefore be claimed. Optional timing rule when damage results in a disposal Proposed new section EZ 86 would provide an optional rule to smooth the timing of income and deductions when insurance proceeds have been received for depreciable property that has been irreparably damaged or rendered useless for earning income because of a January/February North Island flooding event. The proposed timing rule would also apply to depreciable assets that are uneconomic to repair and to which proposed new section EZ 83 would apply. The optional rule would apply to individual items of depreciable property, in line with the general approach under the depreciation rules. The proposed section provides that any income or deductions are recognised at the earlier of:  the first income year in which o the insurance receipt is, or has been, derived or able to be reasonably estimated, and o the cost of disposing of the item is, or has been, incurred or able to be reasonably estimated, and Date: May 2023 113 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] o the consideration from the disposal of the item is, or has been, derived or able to be reasonably estimated, or  the 2027–28 income year. Whether insurance proceeds and other amounts can be reasonably estimated is essentially a question of fact, which will depend on the individual circumstances of each case. However, it is envisaged that some form of documentation would be required, for example, a written quote from an insurer. Proposed new section EZ 86 would override the normal depreciation timing rules. The section could also be applied to assets depreciated in a pool. A person who opts to use the matching rule would be required to use it for all their items of depreciable property that meet the criteria for applying the rule. This is to prevent taxpayers “cherry-picking” the assets to which they apply the rule. A taxpayer’s election to use the matching rule would be reflected in the tax position they take in their return of income for each tax year – no prior notice of election would be required. Example 43 Equipment originally costing $10,000 is irreparably damaged by a North Island flooding event. The asset’s tax book value is $7,000, with $3,000 of accumulated depreciation deductions. The disposal costs are reasonably estimated in 2022–23 to be $1,000. The insurance proceeds received for the asset are reasonably estimated in 2023–24 as being $9,000. The equipment has a scrap value of $100, which is reasonably estimated in 2022–23. Applying the proposed matching rule, any income or deductions would be recognised in the 2023–24 income year, as this is when all the insurance proceeds, disposal costs and disposal proceeds can be reasonably estimated. Accordingly, in the 2023–24 income year, section EE 48 would apply to determine the amount of depreciation recovery income or depreciation loss. Optional timing rule when damage does not result in a disposal Proposed new section EZ 87 would introduce an optional rule to smooth the timing of income and deductions when insurance proceeds have been received for a depreciable asset that has been damaged in a January/February North Island flooding event, but the asset is repairable. The rule is broadly similar to proposed new section EZ 86 in design, except in this case, the asset is economically repairable.

The timing rule provides that any income or deductions would be recognised at the earlier of:  the first income year in which o the insurance receipt is, or has been, derived or able to be reasonably estimated, and o the cost of repairing the asset is, or has been, incurred or able to be reasonably estimated; or  the 2027–28 income year. Proposed new section EZ 87 would override the timing rules in existing sections CG 4, EE 22 and EE 52 of the ITA. The section would also be applicable to assets depreciated in a pool. Example 44 Machinery originally costing $100,000 is damaged by a flooding event. The asset’s adjusted tax value is $60,000, with $40,000 of accumulated depreciation deductions. The insurance proceeds are estimated in 2022–23 as being $110,000. Repair costs are estimated in 2023–24 to be $20,000, and $10,000 is actually incurred in each of 2023– 24 and 2024–25. Applying the matching rule, any income or deductions would be recognised in the 2023–24 income year, as this is when the insurance proceeds and total repair costs can reasonably be estimated. Accordingly, in the 2023–24 income year, existing sections CG 4 and EE 52 would apply. The repair costs are deductible under the general deductibility rules. Section CG 4 would treat $20,000 of the insurance proceeds as taxable, as this is the amount of insurance proceeds that recovers deductible expenditure. Section EE 52 would apply to the insurance proceeds as follows: Adjusted tax value of $60,000 less ($110,000 – $20,000) = ($30,000) Accordingly, the adjusted tax value would be reduced to nil and depreciation recovery income under section EE 52 would be $30,000.

The adjustment would mitigate a timing problem that arises because insurance proceeds may be recognised for tax purposes at a later date than the damage caused by a North Island flooding event. The thin-capitalisation rules are based on accounting measures of assets. For accounting purposes, damaged assets are immediately impaired or derecognised. In contrast, insurance proceeds cannot be recognised until they are reasonably expected. Proposed new section FZ 7B is designed to mitigate this timing difference by allowing certain taxpayers to carry back known insurance proceeds to the date on which an asset was impaired or derecognised as a result of damage caused by a flooding event. The amount that can be carried back would be limited to the lesser of the amount of damage or the related insurance proceeds. Without this option, a business may be temporarily disadvantaged in terms of how much debt they can carry on their balance sheet under the thin-capitalisation rules, resulting in reduced interest deductions. A person who chooses to use this option would be required to notify the Commissioner and provide certain information. Definition of flooding events and affected area The recently enacted Severe Weather Emergency Recovery Legislation Act 2023 defines a series of weather events that occurred over January-February 2023 as “severe weather events”. It is proposed to replace the definition of “North Island flooding events” in section YA 1 of the ITA with a new definition to align it with the “severe weather events” definition. The proposed new definition of “North Island flooding events” provides that it means flooding and other damage that occurred in an affected area caused by any of the following weather events:  Cyclone Hale, which crossed the North Island of New Zealand during the period commencing on 8 January 2023 and ending on 12 January 2023.  The heavy rainfall commencing on 26 January 2023 and ending on 3 February 2023 in the Northland, Auckland, Waikato, and Bay of Plenty regions.  Cyclone Gabrielle, which crossed the North Island of New Zealand during the period commencing on 12 February 2023 and ending on 16 February 2023.

The Severe Weather Emergency Recovery Legislation Act 2023 extended the affected area to include the Manawatū and Rangitikei districts. This widened definition would be used for the taxation rollover relief provisions to provide regulatory consistency. The definition is intended to also cover an affected area where subsequent events exacerbate the damage caused by one or more of the above flooding events in that area. An example of such a subsequent event would be the Mangawhai floods.

Using in-country networks in India and Nepal, the main activity is to run one-teacher schools (known as Ekal Vidyalayas) that provide free education to children in over 80,000 remote rural villages. The Limapela Foundation The Limapela Foundation works primarily in Zambia. It provides education and support to children and teenagers in poorer communities. The Foundation runs two schools in Zambia, which support over 700 pupils in education and development. It also provides outreach and medical funds for struggling children in local areas. The Foundation aims to build up vulnerable communities through long-lasting support in education and self-sufficiency. Pasifika Safe Shelter Trust Pasifika Safe Shelter Trust was established to collect non-perishable food and material items to distribute to people in the Pacific region as they live through the effects of a natural disaster. Most recently, they collected farming equipment and tractors to be sent to Tonga. This was to assist in rebuilding the agricultural industry following damage caused to food production by the volcanic eruption and subsequent tsunami. The Make My Name Count NZ Charitable Trust The Make My Name Count NZ Charitable Trust (MMNC) primarily focuses on providing the basics of life for, currently, 172 orphaned children at the Orphanage of Hope in Uganda, a nationally recognised orphanage and charity.

Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 1 January 2025. Background Income derived by non-resident companies from operating offshore oil rigs and seismic vessels is covered by an exemption in section CW 57 of the Income Tax Act 2007. These rigs and vessels are used to drill for oil and gas and gather data on potential oil and gas finds. There is a worldwide market in rigs and seismic vessels. No New Zealand company owns offshore rigs or seismic vessels, so any company wishing to explore in New Zealand waters needs to use a rig or seismic vessel provided by a non-resident owner. Section CW 57 was introduced to deal with a problem created by our double tax agreements (DTAs). New Zealand generally taxes non-residents on income that has a source in New Zealand. However, our DTAs provide that non-residents are only taxable on their New Zealand-sourced business profits if they have a “permanent establishment” in New Zealand. Many of our DTAs (such as the New Zealand-United States DTA) have a specific rule providing that a non-resident enterprise involved in exploring for natural resources only has a permanent establishment in New Zealand if they are present for a particular period, often 183 days in a year. Once a non-resident has a permanent establishment in New Zealand, they are taxed on all their New Zealand business profits starting from day one. The issue caused by this DTA provision was that seismic vessels and rigs used in petroleum exploration were leaving New Zealand waters before the 183-day period had expired t o ensure they would not be subject to New Zealand tax. This meant that, in some cases, a rig would leave and a different rig would be mobilised to complete the exploration programme. This “churning” of rigs increased the cost for companies engaged in exploration and had the potential to delay exploration drilling and any subsequent discovery of oil or gas.

The proposed amendment would seek to reduce the inaccuracies by replacing the annualisation of the amount of PAYE income payments received in the four weeks preceding the date of the extra pay with the annualisation of the amount received in the last preceding two paid pay periods (that is, the last two pay periods for which payment was received). Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 1 April 2024. Background Section RD 17 governs the taxation of extra pay when it is received with other PAYE income payments. The amount of tax for the extra pay is currently based on:  the amount of the extra pay, and  the annualised value of all PAYE income payments made to the employee in the four- week period that ends on the date of the payment of the extra pay. However, this approach can understate or overstate the rate of taxation in the case of an employee termination. This is because the final payment received by the employee on termination is not representative of a typical PAYE cycle. Therefore, including that payment in the amount that is annualised can lead to a reduced or inflated annual figure for the employee. If, as a result, the amount of tax is understated or overstated, the taxpayer will have a liability or receive a refund, respectively, at the end of the tax year. The proposed amendment seeks to reduce the number of these inaccuracies by removing the reference to the prior four-week period. Instead, the amount of PAYE income payments received by an employee in the last two paid pay periods preceding the employee’s final PAYE income payment would be annualised. That is, the employee’s final PAYE income payment would not be included in the amount that was annualised, but rather the PAYE Date: May 2023 126 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] income payments received by the employee in the last two pay periods for which payment was made by the employer would be annualised instead.

One day, his long-time employee, Kelvin, advises Ben that he will be leaving to work at a rival store. Ben realises he will have to pay Kelvin the amount of $2,000 in extra pay on the termination of Kelvin’s employment on 3 June. Kelvin is paid weekly, and his hours can vary from one week to the next. Fortunately, Ben has the recent salary information below: Period end Status PAYE income payments 6 May At work $600.00 13 May At work $500.00 20 May Unpaid leave $0.00 27 May At work $550.00 To determine the amount of tax that applies to the extra pay, Ben knows he must annualise the two most recent periods for which payment was made. Ben sees that payment was made in connection with the pay periods ended 27 May and 13 May. He ignores the period ended 20 May because no payment was made for that period as Kelvin was on unpaid leave. He performs the annualisation calculation as follows:  Step 1: Ben adds together the amounts received for the pay periods ended 27 May and 13 May ($550 + $500 = $1,050).  Step 2: Because the sum of the two pay periods represents two weeks’ PAYE income payments, he divides the number of weeks in the year (52) by two to determine the number of fortnights in the year, for a total of 26 fortnights.  Step 3: Ben annualises the amount of Kelvin’s PAYE by multiplying the number of fortnights in the year by the amount determined in Step 1 ($1,050 x 26) for a total of $27,000.  Step 4: Finally, Ben adds the amount of extra pay to the amount determined in Step 3 ($27,000 + $2,000) for a total of $29,000.

Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 1 April 2024. Background The accounts of deceased KiwiSaver members can become dormant, no longer receiving contributions while still incurring KiwiSaver provider fees. In some cases, the scheme provider may not learn of the member’s death or know the contact details of the deceased member’s estate. In other circumstances, the executors or administrators may be unaware the deceased’s KiwiSaver account exists. In either case, the member’s account will not be distributed to the member’s intended heirs. Under current legislative settings, Inland Revenue is unable to offer KiwiSaver providers any information about the executors or administrators of the deceased member’s estate. The proposed amendment to section 220B of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 would allow the Commissioner to provide KiwiSaver providers with information relating to the administration of a deceased member’s estate. This would assist them in contacting the executors or administrators of the deceased member’s estate.

Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 1 April 2020. Background Since 1 April 2020, section 32E(1A) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has provided automatic RWT-exempt status for charitable trusts registered under the Charities Act 2005. This was a simplification change intended to reduce unnecessary compliance costs for registered charities. However, the Charities Act 2005 registers “charitable entities”, not just charitable trusts. The proposed amendment will align the legislation with existing practice and ensure that all entities (for example, companies) registered under the Charities Act 2005 automatically have RWT-exempt status for the duration of their registration.

Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. Background Sections 18K, 32 and 58 of the TAA are integrity provisions relating to “gift-exempt bodies”. They provide for a gift-exempt body to keep records, and provide returns, showing the sources and application of donations. Additionally, they allow the Commissioner to notify the Minister of Revenue if he believes the funds of a gift-exempt body are being applied for a purpose that is not charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural. A “gift-exempt body” is defined in section 3(1) of the TAA as any overseas donee organisation listed in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) or any person who has RWT-exempt status following an application made under section 32E(2)(k) or (l) of the TAA. 30 Thus, the definition of a “gift-exempt body” is currently limited to persons that apply for RWT-exempt status. Since charitable trusts registered under the Charities Act 2005 are automatically provided with an RWT-exemption without having to apply, they are unintentionally excluded from the gift-exempt body definition under current law. The proposed amendment to section 32E(1A) of the TAA (discussed in Item: “Charitable entities and RWT-exempt status” a bove) would also extend this automatic RWT-exempt status to all charities registered under the Charities Act 2005. Therefore, the current proposed 30 A person can apply for RWT-exempt status under section 32E(2)(k) or (l) of the TAA if they derive exempt income under sections CW 38(2), CW 38B(2), CW 39(2), CW 40 to CW 52, and CW 64 of the ITA or if they are a non-profit organisation to which section DV 8 of the ITA applies. Examples include public and local authorities, local and regional promotion bodies, charities registered under the Charities Act, friendly societies, amateur sporting bodies and community trusts.

The proposed amendment would also ensure that those exempt entities and not-for-profit organisations eligible to apply for RWT-exempt status under section 32E(k) or (l) of the TAA are included within the definition of a “gift-exempt body”, and therefore subject to the integrity rules, regardless of whether they have applied for RWT- exempt status.

Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on the date of introduction of the Bill. Background Most charities registered under the Charities Act 2005 receive tax benefits, including an income tax exemption. In 2014, new rules were introduced to impose income tax on the value of the net assets of charities that have been deregistered under the Charities Act 2005. These rules were designed to be a disincentive to transfer net assets out of the charitable base once they are settled there. The imposition of tax also ensured deregistered charities are held to account for the assets and income they built up while they enjoyed the benefit of the tax concessions. Section HR 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that one year after the day an entity is removed from the Charities Register (or one year after the day on which that entity exhausts all disputes and appeals in relation to its charitable status, whichever is the latter), certain net assets are included as income of that entity and subject to income tax. Adjustments are made to carve out assets that meet certain criteria, which reduces the net assets balance subject to tax. A carve-out exists for assets that, within the one-year period mentioned above, are disposed of or transferred for charitable purposes or in accordance with the entity’s rules contained on the Charities Register. This carve-out does not require assets to be disposed of or transferred to another registered charity. In practice, the breadth of this carve-out means assets may be transferred to entities that are not subject to regulatory oversight under the Charities Act 2005. With no regulatory oversight, the funds and their accumulated tax benefits may be used for non-charitable purposes or charitable purposes that do not benefit New Zealanders. The policy intent of the rules can therefore be undermined.

Net assets transferred by a deregistered charity to another entity are only carved out from the deregistration tax rules if the receiving entity is a charity registered under the Charities Act 2005. Assets transferred by a deregistered charity to an entity that is not a registered charity would be subject to the deregistration tax rules. Example 46: Transfer of assets to a charitable trust Grey Warbler Group is a charity registered under the Charities Act 2005. The charity voluntarily deregisters on 30 March 2025 because it no longer wishes to publicly report on its financial activities. Following deregistration, the Group decides to transfer all the assets it built up while enjoying tax concessions to Kōwhai Charitable Trust, a trust registered under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 but not registered under the Charities Act 2005. Trusts registered under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 are not subject to the same obligations as charities registered under the Charities Act 2005. Kōwhai Charitable Trust is not required to publicly report on its financial activities, and it cannot access the same tax concessions as Grey Warbler Group. Under the current rules, Grey Warbler Group would not be liable for deregistration tax on assets transferred to Kōwhai Charitable Trust. Therefore, the Kōwhai Charitable Trust would be able to access the benefit of accumulated tax concessions, even though it would not qualify for those tax concessions itself. The proposed amendment would ensure that the assets transferred by Grey Warbler Group to Kōwhai Charitable Trust would be subject to the deregistration tax. This is more likely to encourage Grey Warbler Group to choose to distribute its assets to another registered charity. However, if Grey Warbler Group does transfer its assets to Kōwhai Charitable Trust, it will not be able to transfer the benefits of tax-exempt status that were conferred on those assets. Example 47: Transfer of assets overseas Kingfisher Charitable Trust is a charity registered under the Charities Act 2005. The founders decide to deregister the charity from the Charities Register on 30 June 2024 and plan to wind up the trust. On deregistration, the trust has assets of $1.5m and no liabilities.

Before 30 June 2025, the trust transfers assets worth $500,000 to Albatross Association, another charity registered under the Charities Act 2005. The trust transfers the remaining $1m assets to Stingray Charitable Trust, a charity established in the Cayman Islands. Under the current rules, the Kingfisher Charitable Trust would have no deregistration tax liability as all its assets have been transferred to entities with charitable purposes within one year of deregistration. The proposed amendment would ensure that the $1m assets transferred out of the New Zealand charitable sector to Stingray Charitable Trust in the Cayman Islands would be subject to the deregistration tax. The Kingfisher Charitable Trust will not be able to transfer the benefits of tax-exempt status that were conferred on those assets to an overseas charity where there is no oversight by New Zealand regulators and no entitlement to New Zealand tax concessions. Example 48: Transfer of assets received from a Treaty of Waitangi settlement claim Kākāriki Charitable Trust is a charity registered under the Charities Act 2005. The Trust was established to administer assets received from the Crown from a Treaty of Waitangi settlement claim. Kākāriki Charitable Trust deregisters from the Charities Register on 1 January 2024 and transfers all its assets to Whio Incorporated, a company that is not registered under the Charities Act. Under existing rules, the deregistration tax does not apply to assets received from a Treaty of Waitangi settlement claim. The proposed amendment would not change this treatment.

Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. Background Section HC 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) provides that, in the trust rules, a trust is a “charitable trust” in an income year if:  all income derived or accumulated by the trust in that, or any earlier, year is held for charitable purposes, and  any income derived by the trustee in the income year is exempt income under either section CW 41(1) (Charities: non-business income) or CW 42(1) (Charities: business income) of the ITA. This definition is used to ensure that such trusts are excluded from rules relating to settlors’ liability to income tax (sections HC 29 and HD 12 of the ITA). It also ensures that settlors and trustees of such trusts are not associated persons (section YB 8 of the ITA). The section HC 13 definition is inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of “charitable trust”, as not all charitable trusts registered under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 are eligible to derive exempt income under either section CW 41 or CW 42 of the ITA. A trust must be a “tax charity”, as defined in section CW 41(5), to derive exempt income under section CW 41(1) or CW 42(1) of the ITA. The proposed amendments would repeal the definition of a “charitable trust” in sections HC 13 and YA 1 of the ITA and replace any reference in the ITA to a “charitable trust” with a reference to a “trust that is a tax charity”. These changes would simplify the legislation by using a consistent definition throughout for these trusts.

Effective date The proposed amendments would be effective for income years commencing on or after 1 July 2018. Background New Zealand taxes income on the basis of both residence and source. While New Zealand residents are generally taxed on their worldwide income, non-residents are only taxed on New Zealand-sourced income. In broad terms, income is treated as having a source in New Zealand when its connection with New Zealand is strong enough for New Zealand to exert taxing rights over that income. However, the point when a connection will be “strong enough” is not always clear and may involve judgement calls that appear arbitrary. The DTA source rule in section YD 4(17D) deems an item of income to have a source in New Zealand if New Zealand has a right to tax that income under a DTA. There are several exceptions to the DTA source rule. Before the introduction of section YD 4(17D), an item of income would only have a source in New Zealand if it was included in a specific domestic source rule. The rule was introduced with other anti-Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) measures to reduce risks of double non-taxation. It applies for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. The problem with the DTA source rule is that it can deem income to be sourced in New Zealand in unintended circumstances where the income’s connection with New Zealand is tenuous, and where New Zealand did not anticipate collecting tax on that income. Where officials have identified such overreaches, amendments have been made to ensure those amounts are not caught by the DTA source rule (for example, income falling under sections YD 4(15) to (17)).

Detailed analysis Technical services fees Income from personal services is usually treated as sourced in New Zealand under section YD 4(3) or (4) if the service is performed in New Zealand. Under the DTA source rule, fees for technical services provided by a non-resident to a New Zealand customer (payer) can be deemed to be sourced in New Zealand even if the services are performed overseas. However, it is unusual for personal services income to be treated as sourced in New Zealand when the services are neither performed in New Zealand nor connected to a New Zealand PE. This result occurs under New Zealand’s DTAs with India, Fiji and Malaysia only because of a special “fees for technical services” provision in those DTAs. Such a provision does not exist in New Zealand’s negotiating model and is not in our other DTAs. Further, it is difficult for taxpayers to understand and comply with the law, and for Inland Revenue to enforce the rules, when different source rules apply depending on which DTA applies. This may also disincentivise taxpayers from acquiring services from providers in particular countries, and so distort their economic decision-making. The proposed amendment would therefore exclude technical services fees from the DTA source rule. Certain payments connected to a third State PE As DTAs are bilateral in nature, issues can arise when arrangements involve three States. A technical issue arises when a New Zealand resident pays interest and royalties for its PE in a third State to a recipient in the other DTA country. New Zealand’s domestic source rules exclude payments made, or borrowed funds used, in connection with or for the purposes of a business carried on through a fixed establishment outside NZ (see sections YD 4(9)(a) and YD 4(11)(b)(i)). This ensures the payment does not Date: May 2023 138 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] have a New Zealand source when it is connected with a PE in another State. However, the DTA source rule inadvertently overrides these domestic source rule exclusions. This can result in the same income being sourced and taxed in both New Zealand and in the PE State. The DTA between New Zealand and the recipient’s State creates a source in New Zealand but does not provide relief when that income is connected to a PE in a third State. The below example illustrates the overreach in this scenario. Example 49: Overtaxation of income connected to a PE in a third State In this example, a New Zealand company borrows $1m from a US company to fund its PE activity in Canada. The New Zealand company pays interest to the US company on the $1m loan. Under the New Zealand/US DTA, 31 interest is deemed to have a source in the payer’s State (in this case New Zealand), even when it is connected to a PE in a third State. As a result, the interest payment will be treated as sourced in both New Zealand (under the DTA source rule) and likely Canada (under Canadian tax law) and taxable on that basis. It will also be taxable in the US on the residence basis, with relief provided to the US under the New Zealand/US DTA. 31 And most of our other DTAs, with the exception of our DTA with Australia.

This is because the DTA addresses the scenario when there is a PE in a contracting State but not when the PE is in a third State. If not for the DTA source rule, New Zealand’s domestic rules would not treat the interest as being sourced in New Zealand, since it relates to a fixed establishment outside New Zealand (a fixed establishment being similar to a PE). This would prevent the interest having a deemed source in both New Zealand and Canada, the PE State. The proposed amendment would exclude interest and royalties connected to a PE outside New Zealand from the DTA source rule.

Effective date The proposed amendments would be effective for financial arrangements if a base price adjustment is required to be completed after the date on which the Bill receives the Royal assent. Background The financial arrangements rules spread income and expenditure over the term of an arrangement and require a base price adjustment when the arrangement matures. However, the financial arrangements rules do not apply to non-residents (section EW 9(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007). To ensure the base price adjustment only includes gains and losses when the person is a New Zealand resident, there is a deemed acquisition of the arrangement when the person becomes a New Zealand resident. This deemed acquisition is currently provided for in sections EW 37 and EW 41. This deemed acquisition was amended in 2006 to include the transitional residence rules. The transitional residence rules were intended to encourage immigration to New Zealand by allowing qualifying residents to exclude their offshore assets from the New Zealand tax base for the first four years. The consequence of these rules is that, when a financial arrangement does not have a New Zealand source, a person will only have a deemed acquisition of the arrangement once the person’s transitional residence period expires rather than when they became a New Zealand resident. However, the changes made for the transitional residence rules did not consider that immigrating transitional residents may hold financial arrangements with a New Zealand source. Such arrangements are always subject to New Zealand tax, even when held by a non- resident – however, they are not taxed under the financial arrangements rules unless they are held by a New Zealand resident, so accrued gains and losses are not included.

Although the person is taxed correctly during the life of that arrangement, the base price adjustment incorrectly includes gains and losses in the period before the person became a New Zealand resident. This issue particularly arises for certain immigrants who are required to hold New Zealand assets (such as New Zealand government bonds) to meet their visa requirements and acquire these before moving to New Zealand. The proposed amendments are intended to correct this issue. Key features The proposed amendments would add an additional paragraph to each of sections EW 37(1) and EW 41(1). This paragraph will create a deemed acquisition of a New Zealand-sourced financial arrangement if that arrangement was held by a non-resident when they become a transitional resident. This deemed acquisition will only affect the tax position of the person once that arrangement matures by excluding from the base price adjustment any accrued gains and losses that arose before the person became a transitional resident. Detailed analysis It is proposed to add the same paragraph to each of sections EW 37(1) and EW 41(1). These sections have the equivalent effect, except that section EW 37 applies to accrued obligations (eg, borrowing from another person so there is an obligation to make payment) and section EW 41 applies to accrued entitlements (eg, lending to another person so there is an entitlement to receive repayment). Proposed new paragraph (ab) will apply when the following three requirements are met:  The person becomes party to the arrangement after 1 April 2008. This date is chosen to align with the start of the Income Tax Act 2007.  The person becomes a transitional resident after becoming a party to the arrangement. This ensures the deemed acquisition applies to arrangements held when the person becomes a transitional resident.  The person must calculate and allocate income or expenditure under the arrangement for an income year under the financial arrangements rules. The third requirement, in subparagraph (ab)(iii), is the most important and intentionally applies similar language to that in existing section EW 9(1), which covers the application of the financial arrangements rules to residents. This requirement is designed to ensure that financial arrangements with a New Zealand source are only captured once a non-resident Date: May 2023 142 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] becomes a resident (including a transitional resident). It will not apply to a foreign-sourced financial arrangement held by a person becoming a transitional resident. This is because such an arrangement is treated, under section HR 8, as if the transitional resident were non- resident, in which case section EW 9(1) does not apply. Foreign-sourced arrangements of a person becoming a transitional resident have been excluded from the proposed amendments as these already have a deemed acquisition under section EW 37(1)(d) or EW 41(1)(d) once the person ceases to be a transitional resident. Likewise, arrangements of a person becoming a New Zealand resident who is not a transitional resident are excluded from the proposed amendment whether those arrangements are New Zealand or foreign sourced, as these already have a deemed acquisition under section EW 37(1)(b) or EW 41(1)(b).

The relevant period for the 10% income interest test would be changed to the period of ownership within the accounting period, rather than the entire accounting period. Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 1 July 2011. Background Several different methods are potentially available to a person to calculate the FIF income or loss from their FIF interests. To use the AFI method a person is currently required to have an income interest in the FIF of 10% or more in the accounting period. Where there are variations in the income interest during the accounting period, a weighted average calculation is performed. However, this rule does not work as intended. An acquisition or disposal may result in an income interest below 10% for the entire accounting period (based on a weighted averaged calculation) even if the actual interest held during the period of ownership is 10% or more. As a result, a taxpayer may not be able to access the AFI method for that period and may have to apply a less favourable FIF calculation method instead. The proposed amendment would change the relevant period for application of the 10% income interest test to be the period of ownership within the accounting period, rather than the entire accounting period.

Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 1 April 2008. Background There are special rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) that deal with a situation where a taxpayer calculates their provisional tax liability with reference to the prior year and a reassessment of that prior year is subsequently made that changes that instalment amount after they have paid it. However, section RC 5(6) is currently limited to situations where the prior year (current year (CY) – 1) is reassessed. This creates an issue where a taxpayer is using the year preceding the prior year (CY – 2) to calculate their provisional tax liability and that year is subject to a reassessment. In that case, the taxpayer may be exposed to use of money interest and penalties where they have no knowledge of the actual liability. The treatment of the CY – 2 year is inconsistent with the treatment of the CY – 1 year and the policy intent. There is no policy reason why the two years (CY – 1 and CY – 2) should be treated differently. It appears this was a drafting error at the time the ITA was rewritten. The proposed amendment would restore the wording of section RC 5(6) before the rewrite of the ITA.

Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. Key features The proposed amendments would ensure the legislation works as intended by re-linking several provisions to other amended provisions and by correcting several outdated references.

Effective date The proposed amendment would be effective for the 2017–18 and later income years. Background Section RE 14C of the Income Tax Act 2007 deals with the situation where an intermediary, such as a custodian, receives a non-cash dividend from a foreign company and passes that non-cash dividend on to the owner of the underlying shares. This section provides that the intermediary does not have to pay resident withholding tax in respect of the dividend. However, some of the language used in the section does not reflect the custodial relationship correctly. Specifically:  the section refers to the custodian “deriving” the dividend, when legally the custodian has no shareholding in the underlying company, and  the ultimate shareholder is referred to as the “shareholder in the company”, which can be read as the custodial company rather than the underlying foreign company. The proposed amendment would clarify the wording of section RE 14C to ensure it works as intended.

Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 1 April 2020. Background Under the current depreciation rules, depreciation can be claimed on “non-residential buildings” but not “residential buildings”. Although the terms “residential building” and “non-residential building” are defined in the ITA, the word “building” is not. In the recently published Interpretation Statement IS 22/04: Claiming depreciation on buildings, Inland Revenue confirmed its view that, in a depreciation context, a “building” will, among other things:  be enclosed by walls and a roof,  be able to function independently of any other structure, and  have an appearance and function that fits with the idea of what a conventional building looks like and is ordinarily used for. This interpretation arguably leads to the conclusion that a part of a building owned under a unit title is not a “building” in its own right and is therefore not depreciable, even though it may be used predominantly for “non-residential” purposes. Such an outcome is not considered to be consistent with the policy intent of the depreciation rules. The proposed amendment would clarify the position with effect from 1 April 2020, the date on which depreciation for non-residential buildings was reinstated.

Effective date The proposed amendments would be effective for residential land acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and before 27 March 2021, regardless of whether the residential land has already been disposed of. Background Under the bright-line test, disposals of residential land are taxable for different periods depending on when the property was acquired. If residential land was acquired:  between 1 October 2015 and 28 March 2018, the bright-line period is two years  between 29 March 2018 and 26 March 2021, the bright-line period is five years  on or after 27 March 2021, the bright-line period is 10 years, unless the land qualifies for the shorter five-year new-build bright-line test. Main home exclusion For residential land acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and before 27 March 2021, an exclusion is available under section CZ 40 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) if the person disposing of the residential land predominantly used the property as their main home for most of the bright-line period. Note that this exclusion was previously located in section CB 16A. When the main home settings were updated on 27 March 2021, the previous settings that applied to residential land acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and before 27 March 2021 were relocated to section CZ 40. If the section CZ 40 main home exclusion applies, income derived from the disposal of the residential land within the bright-line period is not taxable under the bright-line test. If the exclusion does not apply, the income is taxable.

Problem definition If a person purchases their main home off the plan or constructs their main home, the construction period does not count as main home use, even if they subsequently only use the finished property as their main home. This is because, while the property was being constructed, they were not actually using it as their main home. This was unlikely to be a concern under the original two-year bright-line test or prior to COVID-19. However with disruptions to the construction sector because of COVID-19 lockdowns, labour shortages, and supply-chain issues, it is possible that someone may not qualify for the main home exclusion solely because of construction delays. This issue does not arise in relation to residential land acquired on or after 27 March 2021 as the way in which the main home exclusion now operates has changed and it includes a deeming rule for the construction period. Key features Proposed new sections CB 16A(1B) and CZ 40(2B) would ignore the period during which the person’s main home is constructed when determining whether the residential land was used as the person’s main home for most of the bright-line period. The two proposed sections are identical, except for specific terminology unique to section CZ 40. The proposed amendments would apply to residential land acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and before 27 March 2021, regardless of whether the residential land has already been disposed of. Section CB 16A was replaced in its entirety with effect on 27 March 2021. Proposed new section CB 16A(1B) would therefore only apply to disposals occurring before 27 March 2021, as the existing section CB 16A that applies from 27 March 2021 already deals with this issue. Proposed new section CZ 40(2B) would apply to disposals occurring on or after 27 March 2021. The ordinary meaning of “construction” would apply, as it does in existing section CB 16A(1C). Construction would encompass work to build or erect the main home, including the design phase.

However, the exact length of the construction period would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. Example 50: Off-the-plan main home and construction delays In December 2019, Ben entered into an agreement to purchase residential land “off the plan” in a new development. Construction was due to be completed in early 2021, but due to delays, construction was not completed until June 2022. Ben moved into the property immediately following settlement in June 2022 and used the residential land as his main home until December 2023. In December 2023, Ben enters into an agreement to dispose of the property. Under existing section CZ 39(5), Ben’s bright-line period starts in December 2019 (rather than when the legal title is registered in his name) as he purchased the residential property off the plan. Ben’s bright-line period ends in December 2023. Ben is subject to income tax under the five-year bright-line test. Under the current law, Ben does not qualify for the main home exclusion because he did not use the property as his main home for more than 50% of his total bright-line period. He lived in the property for approximately 18 months, but the construction period was 30 months. Under the proposed amendment to section CZ 40, Ben would ignore the 30-month construction period and only look at the period from June 2022 to December 2023 when determining whether he qualifies for the main home exclusion. Ben used the property as his main home for that whole period and therefore would qualify for the main home exclusion.

Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 26 October 2021. Background The Child Support Amendment Act 2021 (the Amendment Act) introduced a four-year time bar to reassessments of child support. Beyond the four-year period, reassessments will not occur, subject to specified exceptions. This was intended to provide more certainty for parents and reduce administration costs, while balancing equity concerns through specified exceptions. Currently, there is no exception to allow the Commissioner to grant a liable parent a temporary exemption in the time-barred period. Additionally, the Commissioner is not able to backdate a change to an existing exemption in the time-barred period. This is contrary to the original policy intent of the Amendment Act and inconsistent with the exemption relating to victims of sexual offending, which is specifically excluded from the time bar. Temporary exemptions from paying child support are available to liable persons when certain criteria are met. They are granted on the grounds that a person has limited income and limited capacity to earn income. These exemptions apply to liable persons who are:  in prison, hospital or a treatment facility for at least 13 weeks,  suffering a long-term illness or injury for at least 13 weeks and unable to do paid work because of the illness or injury, or  under 16 years old. It was intended that these exemptions could be applied or adjusted in periods that would otherwise be time barred but the Amendment Act does not achieve this outcome.

Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 8 January 2023. Background Between 8 January 2023 and 3 February 2023, a series of fronts crossed the upper North Island delivering extremely heavy rain, high winds, and widespread flooding in the Auckland, Bay of Plenty, Northland, and Waikato regions. Then, between 12 February 2023 and 16 February 2023, Cyclone Gabrielle moved across the North Island, also resulting in heavy rain, high winds, and flooding. These weather events impacted taxpayers’ businesses and livelihoods. In response to the events, the government enacted several provisions that provided tax relief from income tax and fringe benefit tax for certain aid in the form of cash and benefits provided by employers to flood-affected employees. In addition, the government enacted a provision that provides for the tax-free provision of accommodation to employees who are required to relocate and work on projects of limited duration for rebuilding or recovery in areas covered by the North Island floods. This existing provision extends the time limit for a “project of limited duration” from three to five years and applies to employees starting work at that workplace in the period commencing on the starting date of the relevant flooding event and ending six months after that date.

In addition, since the flooding provisions were enacted, other government legislation covering the flooding events has been enacted that uses a different definition of the flooding areas. This definition is wider than the one that was originally used in the tax legislation. The proposed amendments align the definition of “North Island flooding events” with the definition of the affected areas in the Severe Weather Emergency Recovery Legislation Act 2023 for consistency across government. See further at Item: “Taxation rollover relief – Definition of flooding events and affect area” a bove.

to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023–24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill. The proposed changes would: ▪ extend the deductibility of co-operative company distributions to include distributions on an additional category of shares, and ▪ ensure the bright-line and other time-related tests in the Income Tax Act 2007 do not apply when there is a Crown/local authority buy-out of a North Island flood affected property ▪ ensure that the main home exclusion from the bright-line test covers situations where a person vacates their home for more than 12-months so that repairs to damage caused by the North Island flooding events can be carried out. The proposed changes would amend the Income Tax Act 2007. This Commentary provides information on the proposed changes.

These deductions would be consistent with the deductions that would have been available had Fonterra continued to apply its previous constitution. Effective date The proposed amendment would be effective for the 2022–23, 2023–24 and 2024–25 income years. While the 2022–23 income year has already finished, the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023–24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill is expected to be enacted before the final date for filing an income tax return for the 2022–23 income year. Officials will develop a permanent solution to apply beyond the 2024–25 income year. Background Section CD 34B of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) provides the ability for a co-operative company to choose to treat distributions paid to its shareholders as a deductible expense that reduces the co-operative’s taxable income, and not to treat them as dividends. Fonterra historically required its shareholders to hold one share for each kilogram of milk solids they supply 1 to Fonterra but has recently changed its constitution so that farmers are only required to hold one share for each three kilograms of milk solids they supply. One share per kilogram continues to be referred to as the share standard, but now Fonterra suppliers have a minimum holding of 33% of the share standard. This allows, but does not require, farmers to hold fewer shares than under the previous constitution. However, it also reduces the linkage between supply and ownership. Inland Revenue has considered this scenario and concluded that, under the current legislation, distributions on the 33% of shares required to be held remain deductible, but that distributions on the 67% that farmers may (and often will) voluntarily hold have become non-deductible. 1 Generally based on average supply over the previous three years.

Key features The proposed amendment would introduce new section CZ 41, which would apply only to Fonterra for the 2022–23, 2023–24 and 2024–25 income years. Proposed section CZ 41 would: ▪ retain Fonterra’s existing deductions for distributions, and ▪ introduce deductions for two additional classes of shares that support supply, but suppliers are not required to hold. The proposed amendment would also introduce consequential amendments to sections CD 2, CD 34B and DV 11 to ensure proposed section CZ 41 operates in the same manner as CD 34B. Detailed analysis Proposed new section CZ 41 would determine the treatment of distributions made by Fonterra to a supplying shareholder for Fonterra’s 2022–23, 2023–24 or 2024–25 income year. It would specify that the distribution is not a dividend to the extent to which the distribution is for the supplying shareholder’s: ▪ Transaction shares – equivalent to the same term in section CD 34B – the number of shares that the supplying shareholder is required to hold for their supply to Fonterra. ▪ Projected transactions shareholding – equivalent to the same term in section CD 34B – the number of shares that the supplying shareholder would have had to hold if the supply they had projected had actually occurred. ▪ Qualifying non-transaction shares – shares held above the number of transaction shares but capped at 2.0303 times the number of transaction shares. ▪ Projected qualifying non-transaction shareholding – the number of qualifying non- transaction shares the supplying shareholder would have had to hold if the supply they had projected had actually occurred. The definitions of “transaction shares” and “projected transactions shareholding” do not exactly match the methodology Fonterra applies to calculate the number of shares each supplying shareholder is required to hold.

Officials are not aware of any difficulty of section CD 34B applying to Fonterra prior to its change in constitution. The 2.0303 number in the definition is based on Fonterra’s constitution setting the minimum holding (referred to as transaction shares in the legislation) at 33% of the share standard. 2.0303 is calculated as 1 ÷ 0.33 – 1. Officials do not expect Fonterra will change this 33% in their constitution during the three income years that the proposed section would apply for. By applying to distributions to the extent that they meet the above, the proposed new section covers the shares up to the share standard (one share per kilogram of milk solids). In contrast to section CD 34B, proposed section CZ 41 does not refer to limited non- transaction shares. This is because section CD 34B(3) ignores limited non-transaction shares where a member holds, or a constitution allows a member to hold, shares above those required to be held to enter trading transactions. As Fonterra’s constitution allows a supplying shareholder to hold more shares than the share standard it has not been able to include limited non-transaction shares in its calculation and, therefore, they have been intentionally omitted from proposed section CZ 41. “Supplying shareholder” is defined in proposed section CZ 41(4) as within the meaning of that term in section 34 of the Co-operative Companies Act 1996, in relation to Fonterra. A distribution to a shareholder who was not a supplying shareholder would continue to have the existing treatment consistent with prior to the constitution change (ie, a non-deductible dividend). Proposed section CZ 41(3) applies a consistent treatment to existing section CD 34B(9) to allow Fonterra to pay a distribution more than 20 days after the end of its year. This allows the distribution to be deductible in the year the income that supports that distribution was derived rather than the year in which that distribution is made. The proposed amendment also includes consequential amendments to sections CD 2 and DV 11 of the ITA. These changes ensure that a distribution that is not treated as a dividend under proposed section CZ 41 will apply that treatment consistently throughout the ITA. Proposed section CD 34B(1B) will ensure that section CD 34B will not also apply to a distribution that is covered by proposed section CZ 41. Further, consequential definitions are proposed to be added to section YA 1.

Effective date The proposed amendment would be effective for the 2022–23 and later income years. Background As part of its work to support the Future of Severely Affected Locations (FOSAL), the Government has announced its willingness to enter into a funding arrangement with councils in regions severely affected by the January 2023 Auckland flood events and Cyclone Gabrielle. Central government support is likely to include contributions towards property acquisitions (buy-outs). The ITA contains a set of time-based tests which, if not met, result in any gain or loss on disposal of the property being either taxable or deductible 2 : ▪ The most well-known test is the “bright-line”. For properties purchased on or after 27 March 2021, the minimum ownership period is 10 years unless it is a new build, in which case the minimum ownership period is five years. The main home is generally excluded from the bright-line test. ▪ Properties purchased between 29 March 2018 and 26 March 2021 (inclusive) continue to be subject to the previous 5-year bright-line test. (Given that property prices have declined over the last two years, losses on a buy-out are probably more likely to arise under this test.) ▪ Separate 10-year tests apply to properties that are owned by dealers in land, property developers/subdividers, builders, and their associates. 2 In the case of a bright-line loss deduction, it can only be applied against income from land, including bright-line gains.

Because the time-based tests have exclusions for the person’s main home, most buy-outs will not be impacted, but landlords of rental properties, for example, could be impacted. It is also feasible that such landlords may be property developers, builders or subdividers, or be tainted by association with such parties for tax purposes. If so, any gain over the purchase price as a result of the owner accepting the buy-out offer would be taxable. Under normal circumstances, the owner could have held on to the property for more than the minimum period. However, because of the weather events, the owner has, in effect, little option other than to sell to the local authority (or potentially, in some cases, the Crown). The normal tax policy approach is that the various time-based tests should potentially apply when there is a compensatory buy-out. However, given the nature of the specific flooding events, there are grounds for an exception, as was done for the Canterbury earthquakes where the Crown purchased properties under the Greater Christchurch Regeneration Act 2016. Key features New clause 18B proposes to insert new section CZ 26B into the ITA to ensure that the bright- line tests and other time-related tests in the ITA that tax disposals of land do not apply when there is a Crown or local authority buy-out of a property affected by a “North Island adverse weather event”. A “North Island adverse weather event” is defined in clause 59 as any of the following: ▪ heavy rainfall commencing on 26 January 2023 and ending on 3 February 2023 in the Northland, Auckland, Waikato, and Bay of Plenty regions ▪ Cyclone Gabrielle, which crossed the North Island of New Zealand during the period commencing on 12 February 2023 and ending on 16 February 2023. These are the two weather events that the FOSAL buy-out scheme is intended to cover. Detailed analysis Proposed section CZ 26B specifically turns off both the 5-year and 10-year bright-line tests (sections CZ 39 and CB 6A) and the timing tests in sections CB 9 (Disposal within 10 years: land dealing business), CB 10 (Disposal within 10 years: land development or subdivision business) and CB 11 (Disposal within 10 years of improvement: building business). Section CB 14 was also included in the equivalent Canterbury earthquake provision (section CZ 26) but has not been included in proposed section CZ 26B because it is considered unlikely to be relevant in this case. That section relates to disposals within 10 years of Date: September 2023 17 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] acquisition where the disposal results in a gain and at least 20 percent of the gain arises from a consenting or planning change. The proposed turning off of the timing tests for the buy-outs would mean that not only would there be no gains but also no losses for tax purposes. For example, some property owners who have bought their properties in the last couple of years may have wanted to utilise any losses from a buy-out against any land income, and that will not be possible if the legislation is amended as proposed. However, it is considered fairer to neutralise the timing test implications for all parties receiving a buy-out. The proposed amendments are intended to ensure that the timing tests are turned off irrespective of the legislative vehicle used to make the buy-out offers, provided that the disposal is as a result of a “North Island adverse weather event”. For example, councils could use their powers under the Public Works Act 1981 or the Local Government Act 2002 to buy out properties.

Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 8 January 2023. Background The bright-line test taxes gains from residential land acquired and sold within a specified timeframe. The timeframe is five years for properties acquired between 29 March 2018 and 26 March 2021 (inclusive) and 10 years for properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021. The main home is generally excluded from the bright-line test. Under current rules for the 10-year bright-line test, this exclusion can still apply even when the property owner has been away from their home for part of the period, provided they are away for no more than 12 months. This 12-month period can also be extended to any reasonable period when a person is constructing a dwelling used as a main home. This would cover cases where a property has been so irreparably damaged by a flood or cyclone that it needs to be rebuilt. However, the 12-month period cannot currently be extended when a person has been displaced from their home as a result of a flood or cyclone and they are repairing their home rather than rebuilding it. Key features New clause 9(1B) replaces the definition of “exempt main home period limit” in section CB 16A(1C) of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section CB 16A contains the main home exclusion from the 10-year bright-line test. The existing law is included as paragraphs (a) and (b)(i) of the proposed new definition. Proposed new paragraph (b)(ii) extends the “exempt main home period limit” to include a reasonable period in the case of a period during which a person remediates a dwelling affected by a North Island flooding event and that dwelling is used as a main home.

The following three events from early 2023 qualify: ▪ Cyclone Hale ▪ the heavy rainfall of late January (which was particularly associated with the Auckland floods), and ▪ Cyclone Gabrielle. This amendment is not expected to have wide application, as all the following criteria would need to be satisfied for it to apply: ▪ the property is residential housing ▪ it is the main (family) home of the person ▪ it was purchased on or after 27 March 2021 ▪ it was damaged by one of the North Island flooding events ▪ it is not rebuilt, but rather is repaired ▪ the owner is unable to occupy the property during the repair ▪ the repair takes longer than 12 months to complete, and ▪ the repaired property is then on-sold on or after 9 January 2024 and within the bright- line period. An equivalent amendment has not been made to the 5-year bright-line test. This is because it is considered unnecessary due to how the main home exclusion from the 5-year bright-line test applies. In that case, the main home exclusion is an all or nothing test, and it will apply provided a property is used as a main home for at least 50% of the time it is owned. The last day a property could have been acquired that would be subject to the 5-year bright- line test was 26 March 2021. By the time the first flooding event hit on 8 January 2023, the person would have been living in their main home for almost two years. In this case they will have at least 22 months to repair their main home. The earlier a person acquired their property during the 5-year bright-line period (29 March 2018 to 26 March 2021 inclusive), the longer they will have to repair and move back into their main home before triggering the bright-line test. It is considered unlikely that, in addition to meeting all the above criteria, the repair to their property would take more than 22 months to complete, such that the main home exclusion no longer applied, and that the person would then sell their property before the expiry of the 5-year bright-line period. However, officials would welcome submissions from any property owners who may be affected by the application of the 5-year bright-line test as a result of the North Island flooding events.

The Taxation Principles Reporting Bill is a step towards that objective by proposing a set of generally accepted tax principles and requiring the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (Commissioner) to report on how the tax system is tracking against those principles. Regular reporting will help the public to better understand how our tax system is performing over time, inform the public consultation process on tax policy proposals, and ensure that tax policy is developed in line with values which society considers desirable in a tax system. The tax principles proposed in this Bill are intended to be universally accepted principles that have been used in numerous tax reviews in New Zealand and abroad. The principles include horizontal and vertical equity, efficiency, revenue integrity, certainty and predictability, flexibility and adaptability, and compliance and administration costs. These principles are accompanied by a proposed reporting framework that would require the Commissioner to prepare and publish an annual report that considers the operation of the tax system measured against the tax principles. This report would supplement existing reporting on the administration of the tax system and the Government’s revenue strategy. The Bill also contains provisions covering Treaty and notification obligations and taxpayer privacy and confidentiality. If passed, the resulting Taxation Principles Reporting Act would become primary legislation alongside the Tax Administration Act 1994. This commentary provides detailed coverage of the Bill. Unless otherwise stated, the effective date for all measures contained in this Bill is 1 July 2023.

Commencement date Clause 2 of the Bill provides that, if passed by Parliament, the Bill would come into force on 1 July 2023. This means the Commissioner would be required to provide the Minister of Revenue with a report under the framework by the end of the calendar year following commencement, which would mean by 31 December 2023. Purpose Clause 3 of the Bill proposes that the purpose of the Bill would be to require the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to report on New Zealand’s tax settings measured against the principles listed in schedule 1 of the Bill. The reporting process would be guided by the approved taxation principles measurements set out in clause 13 of the Bill. These measurements would assist the Commissioner in determining the types of information that would be relevant to reporting on the tax system. Interpretation The interpretation clause of the Bill provides definitions for key terms within the Bill. This includes definitions for “Minister” and “Commissioner”.

Section 27(3) of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 reflects the intention that laws should apply to government as much as to individuals. The Crown is usually taken to include Ministers and public service agencies. This includes the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, who leads a department defined under the Public Service Act 2020, and the Minister of Revenue. The Bill proposes to impose an obligation on the Commissioner to report to the Minister of Revenue and an obligation on the Minister of Revenue to table a copy of the full Commissioner’s report in Parliament. Clause 5 of the Bill proposes to bind the Crown, which would align with these obligations on the Commissioner and the Minister. Te Tiriti o Waitangi obligations apply Clause 6 of the Bill proposes that it must be applied consistent with the public service’s obligations in relation to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. Most of the Bill proposes to impose obligations on the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The Commissioner, as a public service chief executive, is part of the public service. Under the Public Service Act 2020, the role of the public service includes supporting the Crown in its relationship with Māori under Te Tiriti o Waitangi. This includes developing capability to engage with Māori and to understand Māori perspectives. In the context of the Taxation Principles Reporting Bill, this could include engagement on the information to be reported over time.

If passed, this Bill would also become an Inland Revenue Act under the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). Clauses 7 and 8 make clear that the application of the reporting framework’s principles, measurements and reports is not intended to extend beyond the reporting framework itself. That is, the proposed principles and reports are to meet the objective of this Bill to inform the public and are not intended to influence the interpretation of, or obligations under, other Inland Revenue Acts. Revenue Acts not binding: no rights and obligations other than secrecy and privacy There are two parts to clause 7. The first outlines the application of the Commissioner’s duties under the TAA, while the second relates to the rights and obligations of taxpayers. Exclusion of the Commissioner’s duties The Commissioner’s duties are contained in sections 6 and 6A of the TAA. For example, section 6 requires the Minister and officials, including the Commissioner, to protect the integrity of the tax system. Under section 6A, the Commissioner has a duty of care and management and an obligation to collect the highest net revenue practicable. There are other obligations throughout the TAA, including those relating to the holding of taxpayer information. The first part of clause 7 of the Bill would exclude the Commissioner’s duties from applying to the proposed reporting framework (with an exception insofar as it relates to taxpayer information). This exclusion of the Commissioner’s duties is unique and reflects the proposed framework’s focus on the independent collection and publication of information related to the tax system. It is intended to be separate from the general administration of the tax system and the collection of tax revenue.

This would ensure that the duties to keep information confidential continue to apply. This is reinforced by clause 9 in the Bill, which relates to privacy (see discussion below). Taxpayer rights and obligations Clause 7 also proposes to clarify the relationship of the Bill to the wider tax system. The second part of clause 7 would ensure the content of the Bill would not affect the amount of tax a taxpayer is required to pay (“quantification of a taxpayer’s liability under a revenue Act”) or any other taxpayer right or obligation (except in relation to taxpayers’ information – see clause 9 below). Non-justiciability Clause 8 of the Bill provides that neither a report produced under the reporting framework nor the Act itself, including the taxation principles, may be used as evidence in any matter of law or fact (or in the interpretation of any matter of law or fact). This further emphasises both the framework’s information focus and that the principles and measurements within the Bill are intended to apply to the operation of the reporting framework only. The framework’s principles and measurements are not intended to apply more widely and, for example, would not assume constitutional status or influence the interpretation of other legislation.

Section 17 provides the grounds on which the Commissioner may collect information, including for the purpose of tax policy development. Clause 9(a) of the Bill would allow the Commissioner to use existing information that had been gathered for any purpose to prepare the reports required under the statutory framework. This would assist with minimising the impact of the reporting framework on taxpayers by reducing the need to collect information the Commissioner already holds for tax administration purposes. Clause 9(b) of the Bill would require all information in reports produced under the framework to be anonymised to ensure that individual taxpayers cannot be identified. This would ensure that the privacy and integrity of individual taxpayers’ data is preserved. The Bill does not propose providing the Commissioner with new information-gathering abilities beyond those already contained within the Inland Revenue Acts. Those existing provisions allow for the collection of information necessary to carry out any function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner and for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts. This Bill would confer a reporting function on the Commissioner, and schedule 2 would add this Bill to the list of Inland Revenue Acts. Clause 9 specifies that the information that may be used by the Commissioner includes information gathered specifically to help the Commissioner perform the reporting obligations contained in this Bill. The existing information-gathering provisions will therefore be sufficient for the purposes of this Bill.

This “hybrid” reporting model has been proposed on efficiency grounds. This would balance the value of maintaining a continuous annual data series on key measures with the likelihood that the findings of any given year will be broadly similar to those of the year immediately before. This approach also reflects that there can be a timing lag with some data due to extensions of time provided to some taxpayers to file information, meaning some information may not be available in the latest tax year for the relevant annual report. The three-yearly, more comprehensive, reporting can provide more complete information by picking up delayed information from previous tax years. Report timing Full report The effect of clause 11(2) of the Bill is that the Commissioner would be required to provide the Minister of Revenue with the full report by the end of the second calendar year of each Parliamentary term. This would start in the 2025 calendar year, being the second year of a Parliamentary term after the commencement date of the Bill. This more comprehensive full report would cover information from the previous 3 tax years. This timing has been selected to avoid publishing the report in the months leading up to a general election and to ensure the data produced within the report represents the tax system at the commencement of the Parliamentary term. Interim report Clause 11(1) of the Bill would require the Commissioner to provide the Minister of Revenue with a short-form interim report at the end of each calendar year. In years in which a full report was provided, the full report would cover the requirement to provide an interim Date: May 2023 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] report. Therefore, the annual interim reports are intended to cover each of the two years following the publication of a full report. If the Bill is enacted in 2023, an annual interim report would have to be produced by the end of the 2023 calendar year and again for the 2024 year. These would then be followed by a full report in 2025. The interim reports would only include information for the most recent tax year. Presentation and publication The presentation and publication requirements of the interim and full reports would be each governed by the separate subclauses of clause 12. Clause 12(1) of the Bill proposes that the Commissioner must publish the interim report at the Commissioner’s expense as soon as reasonably practicable after it has been provided to the Minister. Clause 12(2) of the Bill governs the publication of the full report. Although the proposed publication requirements of the full report are similar to the interim report, they contain an important difference in requiring the Minister of Revenue to provide a copy of the full report to the House of Representatives (that is, Parliament). The Commissioner would be required to publish the full report as soon as reasonably practicable following the Minister’s presentation of the report to Parliament. The form of publication the report must take has not been specified within the proposed legislation. The Commissioner could publish in whatever format is considered appropriate, including in hard copy or on Inland Revenue’s website.

These information measurements would allow governments and the public to draw inferences about the presence of the framework’s principles in New Zealand’s tax system. The reports produced would be required to include these approved taxation principles measurements (but may also include additional measurements as set out in clause 14). Clause 13 of the Bill contains the proposed “approved taxation principles measurements” relevant to the evaluation of current tax settings. These have been selected to align with the taxation principles set out in schedule 1 of the Bill and reflect information the Commissioner has available. The proposed approved taxation principles measurements are:  income distribution and income tax paid  distribution of exemptions from tax and lower rates of taxation  perceptions of the integrity of the tax system, and  compliance with the law by taxpayers. As noted above, clause 13 is focused on categories of information. This is intended to avoid limiting the Commissioner’s reporting to specific methods of analysis, allowing the Commissioner to use judgement in selecting the most appropriate analytical techniques. This would also help future-proof the framework by allowing officials to take advantage of new developments and best practice in economic research and data analysis as they become available. The data relevant to each indicator could be qualitative or quantitative. For example, “compliance with the law by taxpayers” could include quantitative analysis of trends in the number of taxpayer disputes with Inland Revenue, or the confidence with which taxpayers are able to determine their obligations. By contrast, assessing taxpayer perceptions of the integrity of the tax system would be likely to involve a qualitative analysis and could include the results of taxpayer surveys or focus groups.

Approval procedure for inclusion and exclusion Clause 14 of the Bill would allow the Commissioner to employ additional measurements beyond those listed in clause 13(a) to (d) in producing reports under the reporting framework. The objective in allowing the Commissioner to include additional measurements is to allow the framework to grow over time and maintain pace with future developments. Additional measurements could reflect the availability of new data or when data becomes available with sufficient quality to be suitable for publication. These additional measurements could be included on either a “one off” or a regular basis. However, the Commissioner’s ability to use additional measurements would be subject to the criteria contained within proposed clause 14(1)(a) to (c). In summary, it is proposed that the Commissioner may use additional measurements provided:  the Commissioner decides they are appropriate for inclusion  they are within the direct responsibility of the Commissioner in relation to the tax system, and  the Commissioner publishes a description of the measurements 2 months or more before the Commissioner uses them in a Commissioner’s report. Clause 14(2) of the Bill would also allow the Commissioner to exclude measurements considered inappropriate for use in reports, provided the decision to exclude the measurements is also published. The notification requirements assist with transparency of the reporting framework and provide an opportunity for public feedback to the Commissioner.

The proposed tax principles are:  Horizontal equity.  Efficiency.  Vertical equity.  Revenue integrity.  Compliance and administrative costs.  Certainty and predictability.  Flexibility and adaptability. These, or similar, principles have been articulated in several tax working group reviews both in New Zealand and overseas. They help to explain and frame tax policy discussions, and they could also contribute to the legislation’s wider objective of informing the public debate on the tax system. Precedent exists for referring to such principles within legislation. For example:  Section 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires Ministers and officials to use their best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system.  Part 2 of the Public Finance Act 1989 requires the Government to pursue its policy objectives in accordance with the principles of “responsible fiscal management”. These principles include “reducing debt to prudent levels”, “managing prudently the fiscal risks facing the Government”, and “ensuring the Crown’s resources are managed effectively and efficiently”.  The Public Finance Act 1989 also requires the Government to consider its revenue strategy having regard to efficiency and fairness, including the predictability and stability of tax rates.

The rules for such disposals are important because they protect the revenue base from the artificial reduction of business profits through transfers of trading stock. They have been the subject of various temporary, emergency policy measures taken over the past two decades, most recently in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 1.2 The paper distinguishes between two types of disposals below market value: disposals made in the ordinary course of business and disposals in the nature of a gift. 1.3 The distinction is important because each type of disposal engages different but overlapping policy frameworks and questions. In relation to disposals that are not gifts , there is a question of both base protection and potential overreach that should be analysed through the application of normal income tax principles. In relation to disposals in the nature of a gift there is a policy question about tax concessions and the role of the tax system in incentivising gifting behaviour. Background 1.4 Since before the COVID-19 pandemic, tax practitioners have sought revisions to the rules for disposals of trading stock at below market value. Our targeted engagement in 2020 highlighted a strong general perception of unfairness amongst practitioners and businesses in relation to the rules. 1.5 Although temporary measures put in place for the COVID-19 response and potential future emergencies did alleviate some of the more immediate concerns, we are aware that further consideration is required, particularly given the emergency provisions were developed under relative urgency. 1.6 A review is also warranted given the rules in question have been a part of the income tax settings for many decades. The rules address various avoidance concerns and so careful consideration is required before any changes are made. 1.7 The options outlined in this paper will be relevant to businesses and approved donee organisations. Document outline 1.8 This document discusses the disposal of trading stock at below market value by considering two aspects of the topic – trading stock disposals that are made in the ordinary course of business and trading stock disposals that are in the nature of a gift. Options for addressing these two aspects are in the chapters as outlined below. 1.9 Chapter 3 looks at other disposals of trading stock at below market value that are not gifts, and whether there might be overreach of the law in this area. 1.10 Chapter 4 focuses on disposals of trading stock that are gifts, and the appropriateness of current temporary policy considering the well-established framework for gifts of money. 6 | Page \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 1.11 Chapter 5 outlines the law as it relates to trading stock taken for private use. 1.12 The proposed policy options are summarised in Appendix A. Consultation questions 1.13 The consultation questions are at the end of Chapters 2, 3 and 4.

Any information withheld will be determined using the Official Information Act 1982. 7 | Page \[IN CONFIDENCE\] CHAPTER 2 Background and context 2.1 This chapter outlines the existing and historic policy and legislative settings for disposals of trading stock at below market value. The rationale for the current rules 2.2 The deemed market value rule in section GC 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies when a person disposes of trading stock at below market value. On disposal, the person is treated as deriving an amount equal to the market value of the trading stock at the time of disposal. Further, an amount equal to the market value of the trading stock at the time of disposal is treated as expenditure incurred by the other person in acquiring the trading stock. 2.3 A key rationale for the provision is the potential for tax minimisation arrangements to take place in its absence. For example: • stock can be taken for private consumption by the business owner or their family • stock can be sold at a deep discount to associated persons, or • there may be scenarios within a particular industry where exchanges of stock could take place at cost, or less, to generate timing or other benefits for both businesses involving creation of effective short-term deductions. 2.4 We consider it necessary to maintain rules to protect against transactions which would otherwise result in a net deduction for the business, despite the argument that the business has chosen to forgo the income from the trading stock. When does the deemed market value rule apply 2.5 The purpose of the disposal is not relevant to whether section GC 1 applies. Hence, the rule does not require a tax avoidance purpose or motive over and above the mere fact that tax will be reduced in any situation where a deduction is given for the acquisition of trading stock, but the disposal proceeds are not taxed. 2.6 The section has wide application. For example, it will apply to trading stock that is gifted, and where trading stock is taken by business owners for personal use. 8 | Page \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Example 1 Sam is a beef farmer and wants to support a local foodbank, which is a registered charity. Instead of giving cash to the foodbank, which would qualify for a 33⅓% donation tax credit, he gifts one of his steers to an organisation that wil l process it into meat for the foodbank. When Sam disposes of the steer, section GC 1 would apply. The steer is deemed to have been sold at its market value on the day of disposal. The price that is deemed to have been realised must be reported by Sam as gross income. At the end of the year of disposal, the steer is no longer in Sam’s closing stock. Sam must pay tax on a deemed profit margin, being the difference between the deemed market value on the day of disposal of the steer and the value of the steer at the start of the year. Trading stock definition 2.6 Trading stock is defined specifically for the purposes of section GC 1 – the Act’s general definition is extended. As well as property that a person holds for the purpose of selling or exchanging in the ordinary course of business, it includes anything produced or manufactured and anything acquired for the purposes of manufacture or disposal. It also includes timber, livestock and disposals of land that would result in income, commonly referred to as revenue account property. Problem definition 2.7 Many businesses perceive section GC 1 to be unfair in some circumstances. 2.8 For disposals made for business purposes, either for no consideration or consideration at below market value (for example, for marketing purposes), there is a view that the rule may “overreach” by taxing amounts that are never actually derived, and that it should not apply to transactions between non- associated parties. 2.9 For disposals made for charitable purposes, either for no consideration or consideration at below market value, there is a view that the rule may “overreach” by taxing amounts that are never actually derived, and that it can disincentivise the donation of trading stock. The rules for temporary emergency relief 2.10 To address concerns raised at the time of emergency events, t here have been three overrides of the rule. In 2004 a permanent override was put in place for donations to farming, agricultural or fishing businesses during an adverse event. From 2010 to 2012 a temporary override was put in place for an 18- month period in response to the Canterbury earthquakes. From 2020 to 2024 a temporary override was put in place for a four-year period in response to COVID-19. The latter override ends on 31 March 2024. 2.11 For the Canterbury earthquakes, section GC 1 was over-ridden for disposals of trading stock to a person who was not an associated person for the purpose of relief from the adverse effects of the Canterbury earthquakes. 9 | Page \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 2.12 For COVID-19, the override applied when trading stock was disposed of to approved donee organisations, public authorities and non-associated persons. 2.13 There was a complete override for disposals to approved donee organisations and public authorities. 2.14 Trading stock disposed of to non-associated persons (which were not approved donee organisations or public authorities) were not all eligible for a complete override. If the trading stock was not donated and instead was disposed of for business purposes to non-associated persons (such as for marketing purposes), the override applied. However, for trading stock donated to non-associated persons, the deduction a business would normally take for the trading stock, being either the cost or the value under section EB 3 at the end of the previous income year, was offset by an equivalent deemed income amount. 2.15 The rationale for the COVID-19 approach was to provide the same net tax effect as a gift of money when the trading stock was donated to approved donee organisations and public authorities (that is, there would be a net tax deduction). Gifts of trading stock to other persons that were not associated would result in neither a net tax deduction nor a deemed profit margin - the rule effectively removed the trading stock from the tax base with no tax impact. Disposals of trading stock for business purposes to persons that were not associated would effectively be eligible for a net tax deduction, given that there was a connection between the disposal and business income. 2.16 Under this relief, land and forestry were excluded from the definition of trading stock. The intention was to restrict the fiscal cost of the relief and to minimise unintended consequences (given that donations of land and forestry were unlikely to provide relief to people suffering from COVID-19). 2.17 The provisions enacted in response to COVID-19 contain a permanent relief rule. The COVID-19 relief can be switched on in future if the Minister of Revenue is satisfied that an event has occurred that meets the definition of emergency in section 4 of the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 and people in New Zealand were being significantly adversely affected. This provision will make it easier to provide relief from section GC 1 in circumstances where Parliament did not have time to respond in the past. 10 | Page \[IN CONFIDENCE\] No Yes No Yes Yes No Yes No (it is a gift) Yes No Yes No No 2.18 An example of how the provisions enacted in response to COVID-19 apply to both gifts of trading stock and disposals in the ordinary course of business is shown below. Example 2 A company in the business of selling food decides to donate $1,000 cash to a local marae and it also provides food (trading stock) to the marae that has a cost of $1,000 and a market value of $5,000. The flowchart below shows the income tax treatment under the current (temporary) emergency-time rules. Cash donation Trading stock disposal Did the company’s net income exceed the value of the gift ($1,000)? $1,000 gift deduction Partial or $0 gift deduction (the deduction is capped at the company’s net income) Is the marae a registered charity with approved donee status? $0 gift deduction Is the marae a registered charity with approved donee status? $1,000 net deduction (no deemed income) Is the disposal part of the company’s ordinary course of business? Are the marae and the company associated persons? $4,000 net taxable profit ($5,000 deemed gross income, $1,000 deduction) $1,000 net deduction (no deemed income) Are the marae and the company associated persons? $4,000 net taxable profit ($5,000 deemed gross income, $1,000 deduction) $0 net taxable profit/deduction ($1,000 deemed gross income, $1,000 deduction) 11 | Page \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Associated provisions Other deeming provisions 2.19 Section GC 1 is connected to other provisions, mainly in subpart GC. The other subpart GC provisions are not addressed in this issues paper, as they are specialised in their nature. Additionally, many other provisions in the Act deem transactions (for example, the granting of leases in some circumstances) to occur at market value. We touch on just three of these rules below. Section FC 2 2.20 There is one provision of a general nature, which overlaps with section GC 1 (deeming the disposal to take place at market value), that may require further consideration. That provision is section FC 2, which, together with section FC 1, captures a range of disposals of property. It was enacted in 2005 (following release of an officials’ issues paper, Tax Implications of Certain Asset Transfers, in April 2003), to resolve the tax treatment of “in-kind” or “in specie” transfers under insolvencies, trust settlements and estate distributions. 2.21 The scope of section FC 2 includes gifting of property. “Property”, though not fully defined, encompasses revenue account property such as trading stock. Therefore, where it is gifted, the transaction could be affected by both section GC 1 and section FC 2. 2.22 If any modifications were made to section GC 1’s application to trading stock disposals, it could mean making the same limitation apply to section FC 2. For instance, disposals of trading stock as gifts from an estate to a beneficiary could be required to be valued at market value. Section EB 24 2.23 This provision applies where trading stock is disposed of together with other assets of a business. It provides that a fair apportionment must be made, and the trading stock valued at market rates, which links it closely to section GC 1. As with section FC 2, we note that if permanent amendments are made to section GC 1, consideration should also be given to whether appropriate amendments to section EB 24 are required. Section GC 21: Purchase price allocation rules 2.24 These rules apply to agreements to dispose of and acquire property of differing categories (“mixed supplies”) (including trading stock) entered into after 1 July 2021. They seek to ensure consistency of pricing allocation where assets are sold as a bundle, between vendor and purchaser (similarly to section GC 1 in respect of trading stock – or section EB 24 above). We do not currently consider that changes are necessary, even if section GC 1 were amended. GST and disposals of trading stock 2.25 This officials’ issues paper does not review or otherwise consider the GST treatment of disposals of trading stock. The GST exemption that applies to supplies of donated goods and services by non-profit bodies is also outside the scope of this officials’ issues paper. 2.26 For completeness (and as a point of comparison), however, we note that the treatment of disposals of goods and services by GST-registered persons in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity is for the most part determined by 12 | Page \[IN CONFIDENCE\] the contractual price agreed by the supplier and the recipient. 1 If the consideration is nil, that is, the goods and services are supplied for free in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, the supplier’s input tax deduction entitlements (in respect of GST paid by the registered person to supply the free goods and services) is left undisturbed. However, in situations where the disposal is: • an “associated supply”, 2 GST is calculated by refererence to the market value of the goods and services (a rule equivalent to section GC 1), or • the subject of a “change in use” 3 adjustment (such as private use), the input tax originally deducted is denied (a rule equivalent to section GZ 5). Question for submitters • Are your concerns with section GC 1 adequately articulated in the problem definition section (paragraphs 2.7–2.9)? If not, what are your concerns with section GC 1? 1 If the supply is treated by the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 as an “exempt” supply of donated goods and services, GST does not apply and the supplier is unable to recover GST (for example, on overheads) incurred in making the exempt supply. 2 The GST Act generally requires associated supplies, such as supplies between associated persons, to be valued at market value, except transactions between GST-registered persons where the recipient is entitled to an input tax deduction. Broadly, the purpose of the market value requirement is to ensure the integrity of the GST base in respect of supplies to final consumers or deemed final consumers. 3 If there is a change from taxable to private use, or use in making an exempt supply, the GST- registered person needs to make an output tax adjustment (that is, pay GST) to reverse the input tax (or part thereof) they previously claimed. In these situations, GST effectively becomes a tax on the production of goods and services by GST-registered persons when the application or use of those good and services is not for the purpose of making taxable supplies. 13 | Page \[IN CONFIDENCE\] CHAPTER 3 Trading stock disposals that are not gifts 3.1 This chapter considers how section GC 1 could apply to disposals of trading stock at less than market value made in the ordinary course of business. 3.2 We consider that different outcomes could apply when there is no connection with a “business” purpose. In this paper, we treat “business” as meaning any context in which trading stock, as defined for the current purposes of section GC 1, is held. This includes some situations where revenue account property is involved, as well as the standard definition of trading stock in section EB 2. 3.3 One such outcome should arise where the disposition is a gift. This scenario is dealt with separately in Chapter 4 . 3.4 In all cases we consider it important to balance factors such as: • the degree of connection between the income earning process and the disposal of stock • any risks to the revenue base if market value is not recognised at the time of the disposal • relative compliance costs imposed on businesses • the types of trading stock in question, and • the relationship between the business and the person to whom the stock is disposed of. 3.5 We note that if any change is made, it would be necessary to consider consequential changes to section FC 2, see Chapter 2 above. This would need to ensure as far as possible that the amendments to section GC 1 were not essentially reversed, in whole or part, in the circumstances to which subpart FC applies. Where there is a business purpose for the transaction 3.6 Since the introduction of the first version of section GC 1 in 1949, it has been argued that there are legitimate business reasons (that is, not tax evasion) for selling stock at less than full market value (and therefore the rule should not be applied). 3.7 For instance, businesses may often dispose of trading stock for commercial purposes such as marketing or sponsorship arrangements, and in that case some direct profit on those disposals is foregone in the hope that the activities will generate greater future revenues. 3.8 When this happens, there may be an argument that the trading stock is not disposed of for less than market value because the business is receiving market value in advertisement and promotion in return. 3.9 It is common for some product lines to be sold at a discount in order to clear older stock or to accelerate cashflow for the business, even though viewed in a vacuum, such sales may be considered to be made at less than market value. 14 | Page \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 3.10 Attributing market value, or adequacy of consideration, is often subjective, likely to be inaccurate and expensive. 3.11 In situations of this type, it can be argued that requiring recognition of market value results in some legislative overreach. Further, there is also uncertainty whether section GC 1 applies in any given case. 3.12 Under the current temporary rules in section GZ 5 (suspending the section GC 1 provisions for the COVID-19 period until 31 March 2024) disposals to non- associates are not subject to the deemed income rule where the disposals have a business purpose. The legislation does not seek to define that term, but the Commissioner will accept that businesses sometimes forgo revenue in the hope that their actions will maximise the future value of the business. Some of the options below include that concept. (Note that section GZ 5 assumes section GC 1 applies in the first place, that is, the arguments that market value consideration has been received are assumed to be incorrect.) 3.13 It is possible that trading stock could be disposed of cheaply for no business purpose. This chapter does not specifically deal with that scenario, but the result is likely to be that section GC 1 as it currently stands, would continue to apply. Transactions with associated persons 3.14 Transfers to associated persons allow greater potential for tax planning which may undermine the integrity of the tax system. 3.15 This is because of the implicit scope for disposals made at a deep discount without a clear arms-length business reason, to benefit, for example, family members (or the owner of the business – see Chapter 5 below). This has the effect of using the tax system to generate a private benefit (existing deductions for the cost of the stock are not offset by the generation of a market value transaction, or even the recovery of that cost, unless a rule like section GC 1 is applied). 3.16 We have accordingly taken as a given that the section GC 1 principle would continue to apply in all scenarios involving transactions with associated pe rsons, and that as a minimum it will remain necessary to calculate, and pay tax on, the market value of trading stock transferred from the business. Policy options Option 3.1: Status quo – requirement to treat disposals as made at market value 3.17 Option 3.1 would continue to require businesses to report deemed income when trading stock is disposed of at below market value to both associated and non- associated parties. There would be no change to the law. 15 | Page \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Advantages 3.18 This option recognises that the trading stock rules generally require some form of rule to protect the revenue base from artificial reduction of business profits through transfers of trading stock in ways that result in an incorrect reflection of the real income generated by that business. Section GC 1 is that rule – it is also easier to understand and apply than the general anti-avoidance rule. 3.19 Retaining the status quo will ensure there is a backstop principle for goods exchanges. Without section GC 1, goods exchanges even between non- associated parties, for example, businesses in a similar industry, could be made by agreement at less than market value where parties see advantages in assisting each other. 3.20 Retaining the rule also ensures consistency with a variety of other rules that deem some transactions to take place at market value, such as transfers of revenue account property, transfers under the bright-line rules or sales of standing timber. If section GC 1 were to be amended, some attention would be required to achieve consistency. Section FC 2 is one example, discussed in Chapter 2 . Disadvantages 3.21 This option will not address the perceived overreach outlined in paragraphs 2.7– 2.9 (other than in times of emergency when section GZ 5 will apply). 3.22 Further, where a business purpose exists, a deduction should be available (in principle). In these situations, the trading stock has been used to acquire a business benefit. The status quo does not provide a net deduction for acquiring that benefit. Option 3.2: Make the temporary relief (for disposals made for business purposes to non-associated persons) permanent 3.23 Option 3.2 is to make the current temporary emergency regime permanent, meaning that it would also apply in normal, non-emergency times. This would mean: • removing the deemed income rule for disposals with a legitimate business purpose to non-associated persons, and • retaining a deemed income rule for transactions with associates (and for trading stock that is forestry and land), and for any transactions lacking any connection with the business (we do not expect this to be a common scenario). Advantages 3.24 This option has the advantage of relative simplicity given that the legislative regime is already established in the emergency context, and reasonably easy to understand. Disadvantages 3.25 This option has the disadvantage of still requiring application of a “business purpose” test to establish whether any amount of deemed income is to be added back. These types of calculations can involve some compliance costs, especially where it may be unclear (for example, i f there is a charitable and business component of the disposal). 16 | Page \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 3.26 Where there is no business purpose, or the transfer is to an associate, it is still necessary to calculate the market value of the trading stock disposed of. Option 3.3: Deemed income and deemed expense subject to deduction rules 3.27 Under this option, section GC 1 would be modified to deem the market value income adjustment to be an expense of the taxpayer. This expense would then be deductible if the expense met the general permissions (that is, there is a connection to business income). Example 3 • Deemed trading stock market value $1,000 • Deemed expense ($1,000) • Trading stock deduction (cost) ($900) • Taxable income could be either ($900) or $100. In this example, t he taxable income depends on whether the expense is deductible under ordinary principles. A $900 deduction is the same answer as for Option 3.2 – a deduction equal to the trading stock’s cost. The difference is that this option requires an explicit testing of the expense’s deductibility under ordinary principles. Advantage 3.28 This option makes the market value and business expense components of a disposal transparent. 3.29 This option also makes explicit the need for a business purpose for a net deduction to be available. Disadvantage 3.30 Compared to Option 3.2, which has an implicit requirement for a business purpose, there will be compliance costs – to establish the market value of the trading stock and to determine whether a connection exists for deductibility for the business advantage acquired. This may not be an issue for businesses that already recognise this treatment for their financial statements. 17 | Page \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Questions for submitters • What is your view on the options outlined in this chapter? What additional advantages or disadvantages of each option should officials consider? • Are there any other options you believe officials should consider in relation to disposals of trading stock that are not gifts? • Are there any issues with applying any option to revenue account property that is not business trading stock? (Note that “business purpose” includes a connection to income producing activity so assumes that the general permission would be satisfied.) 18 | Page \[IN CONFIDENCE\] CHAPTER 4 Gifted trading stock 4.1 This chapter considers whether there should be permanent relief for gifts of trading stock made by businesses to certain organisations during non- emergency times, and if so, in what form. 4.2 Our assumption is that the temporary relief developed with the COVID-19 emergency in mind will remain available in times of emergency. 4.3 However, outside of emergencies, the concerns raised in the problem definition at paragraphs 2.7–2.9 of this paper are still applicable. 4.4 This chapter outlines five possible policy options to address the above concerns as they relate to gifts of trading stock. 4.5 These options are being considered because the Government recognises that donee organisations make important contributions to the wellbeing of New Zealanders. One of the ways the Government supports donee organisations is by providing favourable tax treatment for donors, through gift deductions, donation tax credits and payroll-giving tax credits. However, that favourable tax treatment must be targeted and effective, both in meeting policy objectives and relative to alternative methods of aiding donee organisations. The gift deduction framework 4.6 A donation or gift is made voluntarily and provides no material advantage to the giver. In line with basic income tax principles, this means a true gift does not have a connection with income, and therefore, a business is not allowed a deduction for the cost of that gift. 4.7 However, in order to reinforce and encourage gifting, the income tax system allows businesses and Māori authorities to claim deductions for gifts of money in certain circumstances. Companies and Māori authorities who gift money to approved donee organisations are entitled to a deduction for the gift. There are limits on the available deduction to ensure the concession is appropriately targeted towards charitable or other public benefit giving and to contain fiscal cost. Namely: • The gift must be made to an approved donee organisation. • The total deduction taken cannot exceed the company’s or Māori authority’s net income in the corresponding tax year. This “net income cap” has been in place since the 2008/09 tax year. 4.8 Limiting deductions to gifts of money means there is no added compliance cost for donors, or administrative cost for Inland Revenue, in respect of the valuation of the donated goods or services. When tax concessions are available for non- cash donations, complex valuation rules may be required, and anecdotal evidence from other jurisdictions suggests this can give rise to tax planning opportunities. 4.9 The gift deduction concession also generally aligns with many charities’ preference for donations of money, which provide them flexibility to target their work where it is most needed. 19 | Page \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Current law Non-emergency times 4.10 As discussed in Chapter 2 , a business that gifts its trading stock is treated as deriving an amount equal to the market value of the trading stock at the time of disposal under section GC 1. In cases where the market value of the trading stock is greater than the cost, the business will be required to pay tax on a deemed profit margin as if the trading stock had been sold at market value. 4.11 The non-emergency settings for donated trading stock require businesses to determine the market value of trading stock at the point of gifting and include this as income in their tax return. 4.12 If the recipient of the gift is another taxpaying business, for tax purposes the recipient is deemed to have purchased the stock at its market value on the day of receipt. If the recipient of the gift is a registered charity, accounting standards for public benefit entities may require the charity to determine the fair value of that gift at the date of acquisition and record that value in its financial statements. Emergency times 4.13 There is scope under the current law to turn on relief for gifts of trading stock to approved donee organisations and public authorities in times of emergency. As discussed in Chapter 2 , this relief has two aspects: • a concessionary rule allowing a net deduction for donations of trading stock to approved donee organisations and public authorities, and • a rule deeming a person to derive income equal to the cost of trading stock gifted to non-associated persons (who are not approved donee organisations or public authorities). 4.14 This relief can be turned on in times of emergency as defined under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002. 4 4.15 The concessionary relief for gifts to approved donee organisations and public authorities is specifically targeted to the emergency gifting context. For example, unlike the gift provision for donations of money, the net deduction that arises from the temporary relief is not subject to a cap equal to the donor’s net or taxable income. The cap exists in the donations framework primarily to limit the fiscal cost of donation concessions. It means that a donation cannot give rise to a tax loss (which would raise base maintenance concerns). The charity deregistration tax rules 4.16 The charity deregistration tax rules in sections CV 17 and HR 12 impose income tax on the value of the net assets of certain charities that have been deregistered under the Charities Act 2005. These rules are intended to be a disincentive to transfer net assets out of the charitable base once they are settled there. 4 See section 4, definition of “emergency” paras (a) and (b). A key aspect is that the event may result in loss of life or injury, or general endangerment to the safety of the public in New Zealand or any part of it. 20 | Page \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 4.17 Under current law, the deregistration tax rules contain a carve-out for gifted assets that are not money. In other words, the deregistration tax will not apply to gifted assets that have not benefitted from a tax concession at the donor level. 4.18 If a change was made to allow businesses a permanent concession for gifts of trading stock to donee organisations, businesses would effectively be able to claim deductions for disposing of trading stock to registered charities. A consequential change to the deregistration tax rules may therefore be required to ensure that gifted trading stock that has benefited from a tax concession are not carved-out from the deregistration tax. This would generate compliance costs and a higher deregistration tax liability for some charities. Policy options 4.19 Officials have identified the following policy options in relation to gifts of trading stock that address, to differing extents, some of the concerns mentioned above. We welcome stakeholder feedback on the options and the related questions outlined at the end of this chapter. Option 4.1: Status quo – temporary relief in emergency times 4.20 Option 4.1 maintains the status quo in respect of donated trading stock. 4.21 The status quo consists of temporary relief that removes the deemed market value rule for gifts in limited emergency times. For businesses donating trading stock to approved donee organisations and public authorities, a concessionary (compared to a cash donation requirement) net deduction is allowed during the emergency period. For businesses donating trading stock to other persons that are no t associated, the business is instead deemed to derive income equal to the cost of the trading stock, resulting in neither a net deduction nor net income for tax purposes. Advantages 4.22 This option recognises that during times of emergency there may be a more pressing need for gifts of trading stock and a greater desire on the part of businesses to gift. This targets the relief to short periods of time and so generally maintains the broad base low-rate system. Disadvantages 4.23 While businesses can support approved donee organisations in non-emergency times by gifting money (from the sale of trading stock for example), some businesses have expressed a preference for donating trading stock. The current settings do not encourage this behaviour outside of limited emergency times. 4.24 Although approved donee organisations may generally prefer donations of money, which are incentivised under the current gift deduction framework, the receipt of trading stock in some cases will still be beneficial to them in carrying out their purposes. 4.25 Outside of emergency times, section GC 1 may be overreaching to the extent that a business derives deemed net income on gifted trading stock. 21 | Page \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Option 4.2: Make the temporary relief permanent 4.26 Option 4.2 makes the current temporary emergency relief permanent, meaning that it would also apply in normal, non-emergency times. This would mean making permanent two separate rules: • A rule that allows a business to have a net deduction for donations of trading stock to approved donee organisations and public authorities (with no deemed income). • A rule that allows a business to effectively remove trading stock from the tax base with no net deduction nor deemed income margin for donations to recipients that are not approved donee organisations or associated persons. This is achieved by deeming a business to derive income equivalent to the deduction a business would normally take for the trading stock, being either the cost or the value under section EB 3 at the end of the previous income year. Advantages 4.27 This option has the advantage of relative simplicity, given the legislative regime is already established. The tax rules would not be a disincentive for businesses donating trading stock. It also reduces compliance costs for businesses donating to donee organisations and public authorities because they are no longer required to determine and record the market value of their gifts on disposal. Disadvantages 4.28 Even if land and forestry remain excluded from the definition of trading stock for the purpose of this relief (as is the case for the temporary relief), there will be a very wide range of trading stock that will qualify for a tax concession. This may not be appropriate and may be detrimental to charities. For example, it may encourage the donation of goods that charities do not wish to receive or do not have the capacity to receive. 4.29 The emergency proposals were developed with a specific COVID-19 context in mind that may not be suitable for broader application. For example: • The temporary deduction available for gifts of trading stock is not capped. This is an important deviation from the donation framework, where company, Māori authority and individual donations are capped to the net income or taxable income of the donors. Without change, this would mean a greater tax benefit would arise for gifts of trading stock than gifts of money. • The temporary concession applies to gifts made to public authorities. This was put in place to ensure donations to public authorities, for example donations of hand sanitiser to hospitals, were covered by the relief. A permanent concession for public authorities would not align with the current donation framework, which limits concessions to donations to approved donee organisations. • Timber and certain disposals of land are excluded from the definition of trading stock, so that section GC 1 still applies. This exception from the relief reflects the nature of the COVID-19 response and aligns the concession with the types of goods being gifted at this time. The same exceptions may be justified on the grounds that these types of trading stock are unlikely to be of use to approved donee organisations in general, 22 | Page \[IN CONFIDENCE\] but there may in fact be more types of trading stock that fall into this category. 4.30 Although this option does reduce compliance costs for businesses, it does not align with the legislative approach that allows companies and Māori authorities to deduct gifts of money under sections DB 41 and DV 12 respectively. Under these sections, a deduction is specifically allowed, and the Commissioner requires companies and Māori authorities to report this information in their income tax return. The temporary measures do not allow for this because they merely switch-off a deemed income rule. This may reduce the transparency of the concession as well as Inland Revenue’s ability to collect important information about uptake, including whether any concession is in fact changing behaviours in line with the policy intent. Option 4.3: Make the temporary relief permanent, with several limitations 4.31 Option 4.3 makes the temporary relief permanent, with several limitations. 4.32 In order to align the trading stock concession with the concession for gifts of money, it could be limited to donee organisations (and not public authorities). Further, the total net deduction (of both money and trading stock) could be made subject to a cap so that it do es not exceed the net income of the company or Māori authority, or the taxable income of the individual, for that income year. 4.33 Alignment could also be achieved if the net deduction was made available through a provision similar to sections DB 41 and DV 12. To achieve this, section GC 1 would remain in place, requiring the donor to return as deemed income the market value of the gift on disposal. However, under a separate provision, a deduction for the market value of the gift would be allowed for the business where the gift was made to a donee organisation. The total deduction available under this provision and sections DB 41 and DV 12 in a tax year could then be made subject to the net income cap. 4.34 This concession could operate alongside a separate, more limited, concession for donations made to a person not associated with the business. In this situation, a deduction would be allowed for the difference between the market value and either the cost or opening value under section EB 3 if the trading stock was acquired in a prior year. As with the current temporary version of this rule, this removes the gift from the tax base, with neither a net deduction nor a net income outcome in the year of disposal. Advantages 4.35 The limitations included in this option would ensure the tax rules for gifts of trading stock to donee organisations align with the broad donation framework, and that they do not act as a disincentive for businesses donating trading stock to non-associated parties. 4.36 This option would minimise tax avoidance concerns relating to associated party transactions (where the associated person is not an approved donee organisation). These transactions would still be subject to a deemed income provision at market value. 4.37 This option also addresses the concerns raised above at paragraph 4.30. It would make the concession transparent and enable the Commissioner to monitor the use of the incentive, as is the case for deductions taken under sections DB 41 and DV 12. It would also support monitoring of the cap on net deductions taken for trading stock and gifts of money in the tax year. 23 | Page \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Disadvantages 4.38 There may be some complexity applying a cap to trading stock donations. 4.39 Compliance costs would arise if the business is still required to determine and return market value for their gifts and then additionally claim a market value deduction. These costs may, however, be proportionate given the importance of monitoring the use of tax concessions. 4.40 Similar to option 4.2, there will be a very wide range of trading stock that will qualify for a tax concession under this option. This may not be appropriate and may be detrimental to charities. 4.41 Having a separate rule deeming income at cost or opening value for gifts to non-associated parties that are not donee organisations would introduce more complexity to the donated trading stock rules. 4.42 In some cases, the full value of deductions claimed in relation to the gifted trading stock (such as deductions taken for overhead costs) will not be reflected in the cost or opening value of the gifted trading stock. In these cases, a deemed income adjustment equal to the cost of the trading stock may not remove all costs from the tax base. Option 4.4: Deem all donors to derive income at cost or opening value of the donated trading stock 4.43 Option 4.4 extends the temporary relief for gifts to non-associates who are not donee organisations or public authorities to all gifts of trading stock outside of emergency times. Under this option, all donors would be required to report deemed income equal to the lower of cost or opening value of the gifted trading stock on disposal. In effect, the deduction and income would cancel out so there is no net tax affect when trading stock is donated. Advantages 4.44 We have included this option because we are aware that adding further concessions comes at a fiscal cost, which this option would minimise. 4.45 Compared to the status quo, this option reduces compliance costs for businesses that would no longer be required to determine the market value of their gifts. 4.46 Although it is not concessionary, this option may address perceived unfairness with the tax settings as they relate to gifts. In particular, this option would address the concern where a person is required to pay tax when they make a gift due to the market value being greater than the cost of the gift. 4.47 This option is also consistent with the requirement that a donation is made in cash to qualify for a deduction. Disadvantages 4.48 Although it removes a disincentive, this option does not incentivise gifting behaviour. 4.49 As mentioned above at paragraph 4.4 2, deductions taken for overhead costs will not be reflected in the opening value of the trading stock therefore the deemed income adjustment may not remove all related costs from the tax base. 24 | Page \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 4.50 In cases where trading stock is gifted but stays within the tax base (because the donee also holds the assets on revenue account) there would need to be a new rule to clarify the value at which donees bring the gift into account. Option 4.5: Remove the deemed income rule for gifts of food made to approved donee organisations and non-associates 4.51 Option 4.5 provides a permanent trading stock concession for gifts of food to approved donee organisations and non-associated parties. This would affect, for example, farmers and other businesses that gift livestock or food to foodbanks or individuals in need. 4.52 In addition to incentivising pro-social behaviour, permanently allowing a net deduction for food gifted to approved donee organisations and non-associates may have environmental benefits. 4.53 Currently, section GC 1 acts as a disincentive to gifting food with a market value greater than zero (that is, food that is still fit for consumption and is not past its expiry date). This may result in increased food waste, particularly where a business has food surplus to requirements. 4.54 If surplus food is not gifted, it may expire and become unfit for consumption. In this case the market value of the trading stock on disposal will be zero, and the business will in effect get a net deduction for the expired stock. If the food was instead gifted ahead of its expiry date, the business would have a tax liability if the market value of the stock was greater than its cost. This tax setting inadvertently encourages food waste. Advantages 4.55 This option would provide relief for a narrow range of trading stock donations, which would help ensure the relief is appropriate and not detrimental to charities. 4.56 This option would minimise the fiscal cost of any relief. 4.57 This option would also align with the Ministry for the Environment’s waste strategy, which envisages New Zealand as a low-waste society by 2050. A guiding principle of that strategy is “enabling businesses to do the right thing”, which this option would encourage. 5 Disadvantages 4.58 Targeting a donation concession to one area such as food will raise the question as to why it is not extended to other charitable purposes with equal benefit to the community. 4.59 This option could result in boundary issues and disputes if, for example, the definition of food was not clear. 5 Ministry for the Environment, 2023.

What additional advantages or disadvantages of each option should officials consider? • Are there any other options or issues you believe officials should consider in relation to gifted trading stock?

Please provide examples and estimates of amounts involved, if possible. (Please be aware that the information you provide could be released publicly. Clearly indicate in your submission if any information should be withheld on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason.) 26 | Page \[IN CONFIDENCE\] CHAPTER 5 Trading stock disposals that are for personal use 5.1 Section GC 1 also applies where a person takes trading stock for their own personal use. Inland Revenue has a longstanding policy on this type of transaction. 6 It also aligns with the commentary above concerning dealings with associated persons. 5.2 The application of a rule such as section GC 1 is necessary in this context because of the deduction rules for trading stock. Those rules override the private limitation in section DA 2, so a person would, without a rule such as section GC 1, effectively be allowed a deduction for trading stock they later take for their own private use. To reflect the fact that the trading stock has been removed from the tax base, the person is therefore deemed to derive income at market value on disposal to themselves. 5.3 This policy is not proposed to be amended. 6 QB 14/01 Adjustments for trading stock (including raw materials) taken for own use or consumption, Inland Revenue qb1401.pdf (ird.govt.nz) 27 | Page \[IN CONFIDENCE\] APPENDIX A Trading stock d isposals: Policy o ptions summary The options outlined in the below table assume that the temporary relief in sections GZ 4 and GZ 5 are still available via Order in Council in times of national emergency ( see section 225ABA of the Tax Administration Act 1994).

This report recommends you approve and lodge the attached paper to Cabinet approving an Order in Council (the Order) to remit interest as a tax relief measure for taxpayers affected by the flooding and weather-related damage experienced in parts of the North Island between 8 and 12 January 2023 as a result of Cyclone Hale. The Order would declare the recent cyclone event as an emergency event for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts. 1 2. The Order would permit Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest (UOMI) charged on the late payment of tax. The current rate of UOMI on underpayments of tax is now 9.21% (from 17 January 2023). 3. We also recommend that the proposal be submitted directly to Cabinet to ensure the relief is timely for those affected taxpayers. 4. The Order would give Inland Revenue flexibility to allow affected taxpayers to pay their tax obligations on a later date without incurring UOMI. Background 5. Cyclone Hale made landfall in the upper North Island on 8 January 2023. It brought periods of high intensity, and in some places sustained, rain and winds across much of the North Island, and the top of the South Island, before moving offshore on 12 January 2023. 6. Northland, Coromandel, Gisborne, Hawke’s Bay (Wairoa), and coastal Wairarapa areas were particularly hit by heavy rain, with the result that some communities lost power, telecommunications, and essential road access. A state of emergency was declared for Gisborne. Other areas of the North Island, such as Auckland, Taranaki, and Marlborough were also affected but did not sustain material damage to key infrastructure. 7. The Minister for Rural Communities has declared a medium-scale adverse event for Gisborne and the Wairarapa districts. We note that areas affected by Cyclone Hale, such as Northland and Wairoa, are under coverage of earlier medium-scale declarations for events in 2022. 2 Impact of Cyclone Hale on taxpayers 8. The level of disruption resulting from Cyclone Hale has, or will, significantly adversely affect the ability of some taxpayers to estimate provisional tax or to make a required payment of tax before its due date. As a result of Cyclone Hale, t axpayers (rural and non-rural) in Northland, Coromandel, Gisborne, Wairarapa, and Wairoa need to focus on the immediate effects of this event rather than their tax affairs. Following Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation, taxpayers are encouraged to file returns and make payments electronically. This places a greater reliance on power and telecommunications and it is therefore that relief to be provided to 1 An emergency event for the purpose of the Inland Revenue Acts is different from an emergency event declared under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Framework. The Order discussed in this report deals with provision of tax relief for taxpayers affected by Cyclone Hale between 8 and 12 January 2023. 2 A medium-scale adverse event declared in March 2022 for Gisborne and Wairoa. A medium scale adverse event was also declared in August 2022 for the Far North and Top of the South Island. In Confidence IR2023/012: Order in Council: Tax Administration (January Cyclone Event) Order 2023 Page 2 of 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] taxpayers when these services are disrupted as a result of flooding or other weather-related damage. 9. There are several key tax payment dates in January. GST returns and payments, as well as provisional tax instalments were required by 16 January. PAYE payments are due by 20 January. Late payment of these tax types results in UOMI being automatically imposed. The number of taxpayers affected by the flooding is not yet known. 10. Relief from late payment and late filing penalties is already available for taxpayers affected by Cyclone Hale. However, this relief does not extend to the remission of UOMI charged to compensate the Crown for the loss of the use of revenue. This is because the remission of UOMI requires a higher threshold, such as a natural disaster, as well as Cabinet approval before UOMI relief can be provided. Order in Council: Tax Administration (January Cyclone Event) Order 2023 11. The Tax Administration Act 1994 3 provides for the making of an Order in Council to allow Inland Revenue to remit UOMI when: 11.1 an emergency event has, or will, significantly adversely affect a taxpayer’s ability to pay an amount of tax on time, or make an accurate forecast of provisional tax; 11.2 this non-payment results in the imposition of UOMI; and 11.3 the taxpayer is a member of a class of persons eligible for remission of UOMI, if the Order in Council declaring the emergency event describes such a class of persons. 12. The disruption caused by Cyclone Hale meets the criteria for remission. The Order would allow Inland Revenue to remit UOMI incurred by taxpayers whose ability to pay their tax on time, and/or accurately forecast provisional tax, was significantly adversely affected by the flooding and other weather-related damage. 13. For the purposes of the Order, the emergency event is defined as the floods and other damage that occurred in Northland, Coromandel, Gisborne, Wairarapa, and Wairoa districts as a result of Cyclone Hale, which crossed the North Island of New Zealand starting 8 January and ending 12 January 2023. Although the event definition includes some lesser affected areas, we recommend defining the area widely, as taxpayers in some areas are still experiencing the cumulative effects of adverse weather events occurring in the latter part of 2022. Our reasons for the districts covered by the Order are set out below: 3 Section 183ABA refers. In Confidence IR2023/012: Order in Council: Tax Administration (January Cyclone Event) Order 2023 Page 3 of 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] District Reason Coromandel Inland Revenue considers that there will be taxpayers who will be significantly adversely affected because of the cyclone’s impact on tourism and supporting industries and will be unable to make an accurate forecast of provisional tax. We also note that key infrastructure such as roads and communications are potentially at ongoing risk. Gisborne A medium-scale adverse event has been declared for this district. Northland This district is still recovering from a medium-scale adverse event from 2022. Federated Farmers advises that the area is under severe economic stress. They note that while conditions before C yclone Hale have been ideal for growing, the effect of the heavy rain has affected (destroyed) some yields with a corresponding effect on farmer cash flows. We understand that fruit and vegetable crops have been significantly affected. As such we consider that there will be taxpayers who will be materially affected and unable to make an accurate forecast of provisional tax. Wairoa This district is still recovering from a medium-scale adverse event from 2022. Cyclone Hale disrupted communications and power in the area. Wairarapa A medium-scale adverse event has been declared for this district. 14. While the Order allows Inland Revenue to remit amounts of interest incurred before the Order is made, it is desirable to authorise the relief as soon as possible. The reasons for this are taxpayer certainty and equity, and the efficient use of Inland Revenue resources. The practical effect of UOMI remission is that it allows affected taxpayers covered by the scope of the Order to focus on recovering from the event rather than on their tax affairs. 15. The Order will expire on 31 March 2023. Tax debts that remain unpaid from PAYE, GST or provisional tax obligations would incur interest from 1 April 2023. Other tax relief for taxpayers 16. Under existing administrative powers, Inland Revenue is offering relief from late payment and late filing penalties for taxpayers affected by the Cyclone Hale. Farmers with income equalisation accounts who have been affected by flooding in Gisborne and the Wairarapa are able to make late deposits and/or early withdrawals. 17. Some taxpayers may, under the circumstances, have lost some or all of their tax records. Inland Revenue is able to manage this situation under current law. 18. Changes made in 2021 which give favourable treatment to donated trading stock will also be of assistance to support recovery in affected districts. 19. Inland Revenue will take a considered, but sympathetic, approach to taxpayers that have been affected by localised flooding and damage from Cyclone Hale but are outside the areas specified in the Order. Administrative implications 20. We have not noticed an increase in taxpayer contacts requesting relief as a result of being affected by the recent weather events. However, experience suggests that taxpayers in these types of circumstances often do not turn their minds to their tax obligations until after other priority tasks have been attended to. 21. The Order does not have any implications for Inland Revenue’s technology systems.
1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Tax Administration (January Cyclone Event) Order 2023 Proposal 1 I seek Cabinet’s agreement to allow Inland Revenue to remit interest charges on late payments for taxpayers who have been significantly adversely affected by Cyclone Hale. 2 An Order in Council is required to allow Inland Revenue to remit this interest (the Order). Policy 3 Cyclone Hale made landfall in the upper North Island on 8 January 2023. It brought periods of high intensity, and in some places sustained, rain and winds across much of the North Island, and the top of the South Island, before moving offshore on 12 January 2023. Northland, Coromandel, Gisborne, Hawke’s Bay (Wairoa), and coastal Wairarapa areas were particularly hit by heavy rain, with the result that some communities lost power, telecommunications, and essential road access. 4 A medium-scale adverse event, in accordance with Government’s Primary Sector Recovery Policy, has been announced for the Gisborne and Wairarapa districts in response to the impacts of Cyclone Hale, between 8 and 12 January 2023. A local state of emergency was also declared for Gisborne on 10 January. 5 Independent of decisions made under the Government’s Primary Sector Recovery Policy, Inland Revenue officials have been in discussion with stakeholders regarding the level of disrupti on caused by Cyclone Hale to persons meeting their tax obligations. Based on these discussions, my officials advise that the flooding and weather-related damage caused by Cyclone Hale in Coromandel, Gisborne, Northland, Wairarapa, and Wairoa districts meets the statutory criteria for interest remission set out in the Tax Administration Act 1994 \[paragraph 8 refers\]. This is because some taxpayers in these districts have been significantly adversely affected to the extent that they have been unable to pay their tax on time and/or accurately forecast provisional tax. 6 There are several key tax payment dates in January. GST returns and payments, as well as provisional income tax instalments, were required for some taxpayers on 16 January. PAYE payments were also due on 20 January from many taxpayers in the affected areas. Given the extent of the damage in the affected areas, these returns and payments are likely to have been missed, resulting in interest charges and penalties. 2qddsziq5 2023-01-26 10:59:44 Doc 2 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7 Inland Revenue has the power to provide relief from late payment and late filing penalties for taxpayers affected by adverse events, at the Commissioner’s discretion. However, this relief does not extend to the remission of use of money interest charged by Inland Revenue to compensate the Crown for the loss of the use of revenue. T he remission of interest requires a higher threshold, such as a natural disaster, and requires Cabinet approval before the relief can be provided. The current rate of interest on underpayments of tax is 9.21%. Without relief, the late payment of tax results in the automatic statutory imposition of interest. 8 The Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for an Order in Council to allow Inland Revenue to remit interest where: 8.1 an emergency event has, or will, significantly adversely affect a taxpayer’s ability to pay an amount of tax on time, or make an accurate forecast of provisional tax; 8.2 the non-payment of tax results in the imposition of interest; and 8.3 the taxpayer is a member of class of persons eligible for remission of interest if the Order in Council declaring the emergency event describes such a class of person. 9 The flooding and damage caused by C yclone Hale meets the criteria for interest remission. The Order authorises Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest incurred by taxpayers whose ability to pay their tax on time, and/or make an accurate forecast of provisional tax, was significantly adversely affected by Cyclone Hale. For the purposes of the Order, the emergency event is defined as the floods and other damage that occurred in Coromandel, Gisborne, Northland, Wairarapa, and Wairoa districts as a result of Cyclone Hale, which crossed the North Island of New Zealand starting 8 January and ending 12 January 2023. 10 The Order will commence on its notification in the Gazette and will expire on 31 March 2023. Timing and 28-day Rule 11 A waiver of the 28-day rule is sought, to enable the regulations to come into force on their notification in the Gazette. Exercise of this power is taxpayer-friendly, and is not expected to affect anyone negatively. Further, the sooner the relief is effective the more certain taxpayers’ positions will be, and Inland Revenue’s processing of relief applications will be more efficient. Once in force, the Order will enable Inland Revenue to remit interest charged before the making of the Order. Compliance 12 Section 183ABA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides the statutory authority for the Governor-General by Order in Council to declare an event to be an emergency event and allow Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest. This event meets the Tax Administration Act’s qualifying criteria. 2qddsziq5 2023-01-26 10:59:44 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 13 The Order complies with the following: The principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Not applicable The rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993 Not applicable The principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993 Not applicable Relevant international standards and obligations Not applicable The Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee Compliant Financial Implications 14 The baseline forecasts do not include the emergency event, nor the potential use of money interest charges should the event trigger additional debt. Remission of use of money interest for significantly adversely affected taxpayers will not affect existing fiscal baselines. Regulations Review Committee 15 Officials believe there are no grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order to the attention of the House under Standing Order 327. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 16 The Order has been certified by the Parliamentary Counsel Office as being in order for submission to Cabinet. The regulations will come into force earlier than the 28 th day after the date of their notification in the Gazette. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 17 The Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that the proposed remission of use of money interest to assist taxpayers dealing with the impacts of Cyclone Hale is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the grounds that it is intended to alleviate the short-term impacts of a declared emergency event and it is required urgently to be effective (making a complete, robust and timely Regulatory Impact Statement unfeasible). Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 18 The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as the threshold for significance is not met. Publicity 19 I will announce Inland Revenue’s ability to remit use of money interest once the Order is in effect and notified in the Gazette. 2qddsziq5 2023-01-26 10:59:44 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Proactive Release 20 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 21 Inland Revenue officials have consulted with the Treasury, and the Ministry for Primary Industries, which agree with the proposal in this paper. Federated Farmers were also consulted and agree with the Order. T he Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand have been informed of the Order. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that Cabinet: 1 Note that the Tax Administration Act 1994 authorises the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to remit interest charged to taxpayers for late payment of tax, where the late payment is due to the effects of an emergency event declared by Order in Council. 2 Note that the event described as the January Cyclone Event meets the criteria specified in the Tax Administration Act 1994 for the declaration of an emergency event. 3 Authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (January Cyclone Event) Order 2023. 4 Note that this remission of interest will not affect fiscal baselines. 5 Note that a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought on the grounds that the exercise of the power will only positively affect taxpayers, and the power it confers will apply to events before the making of the Order. 6 Agree to the waiver of the 28-day rule so that the regulations can come into force on their notification in the Gazette.

This report recommends that you approve and lodge the attached paper to Cabinet authorising an Order in Council (the Order) to remit interest as a tax relief measure for taxpayers affected by the flooding and weather-related damage experienced in the upper North Island between 26 January and 3 February 2023. The Order would declare the flooding events as an emergency event for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts. 1 2. The Order would permit Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest (UOMI) charged on the late payment of tax. The current rate of UOMI on underpayments of tax is 9.21%. 3. We also recommend that the paper be submitted directly to Cabinet to ensure the relief is timely for those affected taxpayers. Background 4. Between 26 January and 3 February 2023, a series of fronts crossed the upper North Island delivering extremely heavy rain, high winds, and widespread flooding in the Northland, Auckland, Waikato (including Coromandel and Waitomo districts), and Bay of Plenty regions (t he January Flood Events). States of emergency were declared for Auckland, Waitomo, and Northland. 5. In addition, the Minister for Rural Communities has declared the above regions to be the subject to a medium-scale adverse event. New Emergency Order required 6. The UOMI relief Inland Revenue can provide is confined to late payments/inaccurate provisional tax forecasts that result from the defined emergency event. Therefore, although similar Orders in Council may still be in effect for the same areas, for example, the Order in Council made in relation to Cyclone Hale on 25 January 2023, a new Order in Council would take into account the impacts of the January Flood Events. 7. Given the complexity and intensity of the weather events currently affecting New Zealand, we consider that other areas could be affected in the coming weeks. If this is the case, subsequent Orders in Council may be required to allow the remission of interest for taxpayers affected by those events. Implications for taxpayers’ obligations 8. We have been in discussions with stakeholders regarding the level of disruption to persons meeting their tax obligations caused by the January Flood Events. Based on these discussions, we consider that the level of disruption resulting from the January Flood Events has, or will, significantly adversely affect the ability of some taxpayers to make a required payment of tax before its due date and/or to make accurate provisional tax forecasts. Because of the flooding, taxpayers in affected 1 An emergency event for the purpose of the Inland Revenue Acts is different from an emergency event declared under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Framework.

In Confidence IR2023/031: Order in Council: Tax Administration (January Flood Events) Order 2023 Page 2 of 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] areas will understandably be prioritising recovery rather than their tax affairs. The number of taxpayers affected by the flooding is not yet known. 9. There are several tax payment dates in January and early February. 30 January was a payment/filing date for some GST and provisional taxpayers. 7 February is a key payment date for a range of tax types including income tax, FBT, Working for Families overpayments, and PAYE. Payments after these dates result in UOMI being automatically imposed. Relief from late payment and late filing penalties is already available for taxpayers affected by the January Flood Events. However, this relief does not extend to the remission of UOMI. This is because remitting UOMI requires a higher threshold, such as a natural disaster, as well as Cabinet approval before UOMI relief can be provided. Order in Council: Tax Administration (January Flood Events) Order 2023 10. The Tax Administration Act 1994 2 provides for the making of an Order in Council to allow Inland Revenue to remit UOMI when: 10.1 an emergency event has, or will, significantly adversely affect a taxpayer’s ability to pay an amount of tax on time, or make an accurate forecast of provisional tax; 10.2 this non-payment results in the imposition of UOMI; and 10.3 the taxpayer is a member of a class of persons eligible for remission of UOMI, if the Order in Council declaring the emergency event describes such a class of persons. 11. The disruption caused by the January Flood Events meets the criteria for remission. The Order would allow Inland Revenue to remit UOMI incurred by taxpayers whose ability to pay their tax on time and/or accurately forecast provisional tax, was significantly adversely affected by the flo oding and other weather-related damage. 12. For the purposes of the Order, the emergency event is defined as the floods and other weather-related damage that occurred in the Northland, Auckland, Waikato and Bay of Plenty regions between 26 January and 3 February 2023. 13. While the Order allows Inland Revenue to remit amounts of interest incurred before the Order is made, it is desirable to authorise the relief as soon as possible. The reasons for this are taxpayer certainty and equity, and the efficient use of Inland Revenue resources. The practical effect of UOMI remission is that it allows affected taxpayers covered by the scope of the Order to focus on recovering from the event rather than on their tax affairs. 14. The draft Cabinet Paper that accompanies this report proposes the waiver of the 28-day rule so that the Order can come into force on the day it is notified in the Gazette. It is anticipated that this will occur on 8 February 2023. The Order will expire on 30 April 2023. Tax debts that remain unpaid from GST, provisional tax, income tax, FBT, Working for Families repayments, and PAYE obligations would incur interest from 1 May 2023. If the recovery period for Auckland requires more time, the Tax Administration Act provides for ability to extend the duration of the proposed Order, or otherwise replace it. Other tax relief for taxpayers 15. Under existing administrative powers, Inland Revenue is offering relief from late payment and late filing penalties for taxpayers affected by the January Flood Events. Because the Minister for Rural Communities has declared a medium-scale adverse 2 Section 183ABA refers. In Confidence IR2023/031: Order in Council: Tax Administration (January Flood Events) Order 2023 Page 3 of 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] event for Northland, Auckland, Waikato and the Bay of Plenty, farmers in those regions with income equalisation accounts who have been affected by flooding will be able to make late deposits and/or early withdrawals. 16. As a result of the January Flood Events, some taxpayers may have lost some or all of their tax records. Inland Revenue is able to manage this situation under current law. 17. Changes made in 2021 which give favourable treatment to donated trading stock will also be of assistance to support recovery in affected areas. We note that a proposal to extend the duration of the relief to 31 March 2024 is to be considered by the Cabinet Legislation Committee on 23 February 2023. 18. Inland Revenue will take a considered, but sympathetic, approach to taxpayers that have been affected by localised flooding and damage from the January Flood Events but are outside the areas specified in the Order. Auckland Council Charitable Purposes Fund 19. Auckland Council has advised that donations to support the relief effort in Auckland can be made to the Auckl and Council Charitable Purposes Fund, which is an approved donee organisation with Inland Revenue. As an approved donee organisation, donors to the Fund will be eligible for the donation tax credit, or tax deductions, in respect of monetary donations made. R&D tax credit reporting deadlines 20. We are also reviewing the impact of the January Flood Events on the ability of taxpayers to meet R&D Tax Incentive filing dates which are due 7 February. We will report to you separately on whether regulation is needed to extend the deadlines for these applications and returns. Administrative implications 21. As at 1 February 2023, Inland Revenue has received over 160 contacts from taxpayers about their tax filing and payment obligations (mainly in respect of GST). We expect those numbers will increase sharply over the coming days. 22. The Order does not have any implications for Inland Revenue’s technology systems. Revenue implications 23. The baseline forecasts do not include the emergency event, nor the potential UOMI charges should the event trigger additional debt. Remission of UOMI for significantly adversely affected taxpayers in the covered areas, will not affect existing fiscal baselines. Consultation 24. Our advice has been informed by advice from the Ministry for Primary Industries. The Treasury has been consulted as part of the preparation of this report. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has been informed. 25. We have consulted with Federated Farmers New Zealand. They support the proposed interest remission relief for the affected areas. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand has also been informed.

Local states of emergency were declared for Auckland, Northland, and Waitomo. The Minister for Rural Communities has also declared a medium-scale adverse event for these regions. 4Inland Revenue officials have been in discussions with stakeholders regarding the level of disruption to persons meeting their tax obligations caused by the January Flood Events. Based on these discussions, my officials advise that the flooding and weather-related damage caused in the Northland, Auckland, Waikato and Bay of Plenty regions meet the statutory criteria for interest remission set out in the Tax Administration Act 1994 \[paragraph 7 refers\]. This is because some taxpayers in these regions have been significantly adversely affected to the extent that they have been unable to pay their tax on time and/or accurately forecast provisional tax. 5There are several tax payment dates in January and early February. 30 January was a payment/filing date for some GST and provisional tax taxpayers. 7 February is also a key payment date for a range of tax types including income tax, fringe benefit tax, Working for Families overpayments, and PAYE. Payments after these dates result in use of money interest being automatically imposed. 6Inland Revenue has the power to provide relief from late payment and late filing penalties for taxpayers affected by adverse events, at the Commissioner’s discretion.

Therefore, although similar Orders in Council may still be in effect for the same areas, for example, the Order in Council made in relation to Cyclone Hale on 25 January 2023, a new Order in Council is required to support those taxpayers in regions affected by the January Flood Events. 9I also note that given the complexity and intensity of the weather events currently affecting New Zealand, other areas could be affected in the coming weeks. If this is the case, additional Orders in Council may be needed to allow the remission of interest for taxpayers affected by those events.

This report recommends that you approve and lodge the attached paper to Cabinet authorising an Order in Council (the Order) to remit interest as a tax relief measure for taxpayers affected by the flooding and weather-related damage experienced in the upper North Island between 26 January and 3 February 2023. The Order would declare the flooding events as an emergency event for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts. 1 2. The Order would permit Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest (UOMI) charged on the late payment of tax. The current rate of UOMI on underpayments of tax is 9.21%. 3. We also recommend that the paper be submitted directly to Cabinet to ensure the relief is timely for those affected taxpayers. Background 4. Between 26 January and 3 February 2023, a series of fronts crossed the upper North Island delivering extremely heavy rain, high winds, and widespread flooding in the Northland, Auckland, Waikato (including Coromandel and Waitomo districts), and Bay of Plenty regions (t he January Flood Events). States of emergency were declared for Auckland, Waitomo, and Northland. 5. In addition, the Minister for Rural Communities has declared the above regions to be the subject to a medium-scale adverse event. New Emergency Order required 6. The UOMI relief Inland Revenue can provide is confined to late payments/inaccurate provisional tax forecasts that result from the defined emergency event. Therefore, although similar Orders in Council may still be in effect for the same areas, for example, the Order in Council made in relation to Cyclone Hale on 25 January 2023, a new Order in Council would take into account the impacts of the January Flood Events. 7. Given the complexity and intensity of the weather events currently affecting New Zealand, we consider that other areas could be affected in the coming weeks. If this is the case, subsequent Orders in Council may be required to allow the remission of interest for taxpayers affected by those events. Implications for taxpayers’ obligations 8. We have been in discussions with stakeholders regarding the level of disruption to persons meeting their tax obligations caused by the January Flood Events. Based on these discussions, we consider that the level of disruption resulting from the January Flood Events has, or will, significantly adversely affect the ability of some taxpayers to make a required payment of tax before its due date and/or to make accurate provisional tax forecasts. Because of the flooding, taxpayers in affected 1 An emergency event for the purpose of the Inland Revenue Acts is different from an emergency event declared under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Framework. The Order discussed in this report deals with provision of tax relief for taxpayers affected by the January Flooding Event between 26 January and 3 February 2023. In Confidence IR2023/031: Order in Council: Tax Administration (January Flood Events) Order 2023 Page 2 of 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] areas will understandably be prioritising recovery rather than their tax affairs. The number of taxpayers affected by the flooding is not yet known. 9. There are several tax payment dates in January and early February. 30 January was a payment/filing date for some GST and provisional taxpayers. 7 February is a key payment date for a range of tax types including income tax, FBT, Working for Families overpayments, and PAYE. Payments after these dates result in UOMI being automatically imposed. Relief from late payment and late filing penalties is already available for taxpayers affected by the January Flood Events. However, this relief does not extend to the remission of UOMI. This is because remitting UOMI requires a higher threshold, such as a natural disaster, as well as Cabinet approval before UOMI relief can be provided. Order in Council: Tax Administration (January Flood Events) Order 2023 10. The Tax Administration Act 1994 2 provides for the making of an Order in Council to allow Inland Revenue to remit UOMI when: 10.1 an emergency event has, or will, significantly adversely affect a taxpayer’s ability to pay an amount of tax on time, or make an accurate forecast of provisional tax; 10.2 this non-payment results in the imposition of UOMI; and 10.3 the taxpayer is a member of a class of persons eligible for remission of UOMI, if the Order in Council declaring the emergency event describes such a class of persons. 11. The disruption caused by the January Flood Events meets the criteria for remission. The Order would allow Inland Revenue to remit UOMI incurred by taxpayers whose ability to pay their tax on time and/or accurately forecast provisional tax, was significantly adversely affected by the flo oding and other weather-related damage. 12. For the purposes of the Order, the emergency event is defined as the floods and other weather-related damage that occurred in the Northland, Auckland, Waikato and Bay of Plenty regions between 26 January and 3 February 2023. 13. While the Order allows Inland Revenue to remit amounts of interest incurred before the Order is made, it is desirable to authorise the relief as soon as possible. The reasons for this are taxpayer certainty and equity, and the efficient use of Inland Revenue resources. The practical effect of UOMI remission is that it allows affected taxpayers covered by the scope of the Order to focus on recovering from the event rather than on their tax affairs. 14. The draft Cabinet Paper that accompanies this report proposes the waiver of the 28-day rule so that the Order can come into force on the day it is notified in the Gazette. It is anticipated that this will occur on 8 February 2023. The Order will expire on 30 April 2023. Tax debts that remain unpaid from GST, provisional tax, income tax, FBT, Working for Families repayments, and PAYE obligations would incur interest from 1 May 2023. If the recovery period for Auckland requires more time, the Tax Administration Act provides for ability to extend the duration of the proposed Order, or otherwise replace it. Other tax relief for taxpayers 15. Under existing administrative powers, Inland Revenue is offering relief from late payment and late filing penalties for taxpayers affected by the January Flood Events. Because the Minister for Rural Communities has declared a medium-scale adverse 2 Section 183ABA refers. In Confidence IR2023/031: Order in Council: Tax Administration (January Flood Events) Order 2023 Page 3 of 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] event for Northland, Auckland, Waikato and the Bay of Plenty, farmers in those regions with income equalisation accounts who have been affected by flooding will be able to make late deposits and/or early withdrawals. 16. As a result of the January Flood Events, some taxpayers may have lost some or all of their tax records. Inland Revenue is able to manage this situation under current law. 17. Changes made in 2021 which give favourable treatment to donated trading stock will also be of assistance to support recovery in affected areas. We note that a proposal to extend the duration of the relief to 31 March 2024 is to be considered by the Cabinet Legislation Committee on 23 February 2023. 18. Inland Revenue will take a considered, but sympathetic, approach to taxpayers that have been affected by localised flooding and damage from the January Flood Events but are outside the areas specified in the Order. Auckland Council Charitable Purposes Fund 19. Auckland Council has advised that donations to support the relief effort in Auckland can be made to the Auckl and Council Charitable Purposes Fund, which is an approved donee organisation with Inland Revenue. As an approved donee organisation, donors to the Fund will be eligible for the donation tax credit, or tax deductions, in respect of monetary donations made. R&D tax credit reporting deadlines 20. We are also reviewing the impact of the January Flood Events on the ability of taxpayers to meet R&D Tax Incentive filing dates which are due 7 February. We will report to you separately on whether regulation is needed to extend the deadlines for these applications and returns. Administrative implications 21. As at 1 February 2023, Inland Revenue has received over 160 contacts from taxpayers about their tax filing and payment obligations (mainly in respect of GST). We expect those numbers will increase sharply over the coming days. 22. The Order does not have any implications for Inland Revenue’s technology systems. Revenue implications 23. The baseline forecasts do not include the emergency event, nor the potential UOMI charges should the event trigger additional debt. Remission of UOMI for significantly adversely affected taxpayers in the covered areas, will not affect existing fiscal baselines. Consultation 24. Our advice has been informed by advice from the Ministry for Primary Industries. The Treasury has been consulted as part of the preparation of this report. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has been informed. 25. We have consulted with Federated Farmers New Zealand. They support the proposed interest remission relief for the affected areas. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand has also been informed. In confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Tax Administration (January Flood Events) Order 2023 Proposal 1This paper seeks authorisation for submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (January Flood Events) Order 2023 (the Order). 2The Order is required to allow Inland Revenue to remit interest charges on late payments for taxpayers who have been significantly adversely affected by the flooding and weather-related damage that occurred across the upper North Island between 26 January and 3 February 2023. Policy 3Between 26 January and 3 February 2023, a series of fronts crossed the upper North Island delivering heavy rain, high winds, and widespread flooding in the Northland, Auckland, Waikato (including Coromandel and Waitomo districts) and the Bay of Plenty regions (the January Flood Events). Local states of emergency were declared for Auckland, Northland, and Waitomo. The Minister for Rural Communities has also declared a medium-scale adverse event for these regions. 4Inland Revenue officials have been in discussions with stakeholders regarding the level of disruption to persons meeting their tax obligations caused by the January Flood Events. Based on these discussions, my officials advise that the flooding and weather-related damage caused in the Northland, Auckland, Waikato and Bay of Plenty regions meet the statutory criteria for interest remission set out in the Tax Administration Act 1994 \[paragraph 7 refers\]. This is because some taxpayers in these regions have been significantly adversely affected to the extent that they have been unable to pay their tax on time and/or accurately forecast provisional tax. 5There are several tax payment dates in January and early February. 30 January was a payment/filing date for some GST and provisional tax taxpayers. 7 February is also a key payment date for a range of tax types including income tax, fringe benefit tax, Working for Families overpayments, and PAYE. Payments after these dates result in use of money interest being automatically imposed. 6Inland Revenue has the power to provide relief from late payment and late filing penalties for taxpayers affected by adverse events, at the Commissioner’s discretion. However, this relief does not extend to the remission of use of money interest charged by Inland Revenue to compensate the Crown for the loss of the use of revenue. The remission of interest requires a higher threshold, such as a natural disaster, and requires Cabinet approval before the relief can be provided. The current rate of interest on late payments of tax is 9.21%. Without relief, the late payment of tax results in the automatic statutory imposition of interest. 1 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 16:07:00 Doc 2 7The Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for an Order in Council to allow Inland Revenue to remit interest where: 7.1an emergency event has, or will, significantly adversely affect a taxpayer’s ability to pay an amount of tax on time, or make an accurate forecast of provisional tax; 7.2the non-payment of tax results in the imposition of interest; and 7.3the taxpayer is a member of class of persons eligible for remission of interest if the Order in Council declaring the emergency event describes such a class of person. 8The relief Inland Revenue is able to provide under this type of Order in Council is confined to late payments and/or inaccurate provisional tax forecasts that result from the emergency event as defined in the Order in Council. Therefore, although similar Orders in Council may still be in effect for the same areas, for example, the Order in Council made in relation to Cyclone Hale on 25 January 2023, a new Order in Council is required to support those taxpayers in regions affected by the January Flood Events. 9I also note that given the complexity and intensity of the weather events currently affecting New Zealand, other areas could be affected in the coming weeks. If this is the case, additional Orders in Council may be needed to allow the remission of interest for taxpayers affected by those events. Tax Administration (January Flood Events) Order 2023 10The flooding and weather-related damage caused by the January Flood Events meets the criteria for interest remission. The Order authorises Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest incurred by taxpayers whose ability to pay their tax on time, and/or make an accurate forecast of provisional tax, was significantly adversely affected by the January Flood Events. For the purposes of the Order, the emergency event is defined as the floods and weather-related damage that occurred in the Northland, Auckland, Waikato and Bay of Plenty regions between 26 January and 3 February 2023. 11While the Order allows Inland Revenue to remit amounts of interest incurred before the Order was made, it is desirable to authorise the relief as soon as possible. The practical effect of interest remission is that it allows affected taxpayers covered by the scope of the Order to focus on recovering from the event rather than on their immediate tax affairs. 12The Order will commence on its notification in the Gazette and will expire on 30 April 2023. The Tax Administration Act provides that the duration of the proposed Order can be extended or replaced if by the beginning of April, a longer period of interest relief is required to support the regions affected by the January Flood Events. Timing and 28-day Rule 13A waiver of the 28-day rule is sought, to enable the regulations to come into force on their notification in the Gazette. Exercise of this power is taxpayer-friendly and is not expected to affect anyone negatively. Further, the sooner the relief is effective the more certain taxpayers’ positions will be, and Inland Revenue’s processing of relief applications will be more efficient. 2 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 16:07:00 Compliance 14Section 183ABA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides the statutory authority for the Governor-General by Order in Council to declare an event to be an emergency event and allow Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest. This event meets the Tax Administration Act’s qualifying criteria. 15The Order complies with the following: The principles of the Treaty of WaitangiNot applicable The rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993 Not applicable The principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 2020Not applicable Relevant international standards and obligationsNot applicable The Legislation Guidelines (2021 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee Compliant Financial Implications 16The baseline forecasts do not include the emergency event, nor the potential use of money interest charges, should the event trigger additional debt. Remission of use of money interest for significantly adversely affected taxpayers will not affect existing fiscal baselines. Regulations Review Committee 17Officials believe there are no grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order to the attention of the House under Standing Order 327. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 18The Order has been certified by the Parliamentary Counsel Office as being in order for submission to Cabinet. The regulations will come into force earlier than the 28 th day after the date of their notification in the Gazette. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 19The Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that this proposal to provide interest remission relief for taxpayers who have been adversely affected by the January Flood Events is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement. This is granted on the grounds that it is intended to temporarily defer or extend legislative deadlines where a declared emergency has made compliance with the existing legislative requirements impossible, impractical or unreasonably burdensome. 3 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 16:07:00 Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 20The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as the threshold for significance is not met. Publicity 21I will announce Inland Revenue’s ability to remit use of money interest once the Order is in effect and notified in the Gazette. Proactive Release 22I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 23Inland Revenue officials have consulted with the Treasury, and the Ministry for Primary Industries. Federated Farmers were also consulted and agree with the Order. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand have been informed of the Order. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that Cabinet: 1Note that the Tax Administration Act 1994 authorises the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to remit interest charged to taxpayers for late payment of tax, where the late payment is due to the effects of an emergency event declared by Order in Council. 2Note that the event described as the January Flood Events meets the criteria specified in the Tax Administration Act 1994 for the declaration of an emergency event. 3Authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (January Flood Events) Order 2023. 4Note that this remission of interest will not affect fiscal baselines. 5Note that a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought on the grounds that the exercise of the power will only positively affect taxpayers, and the power it confers will apply to events before the making of the Order. 6Agree to the waiver of the 28-day rule so that the regulations can come into force on their notification in the Gazette.

This report seeks your agreement to an extension of filing deadlines for the Research and Development Tax Incentive (RDTI) in response to: 1.1 the January flood events throughout Auckland, Bay of Plenty, Northland, and Waikato; and 1.2 Cyclone Gabrielle. 2. This extension would be given effect to by an Order in Council, and we also seek your authorisation to issue a drafting instruction to the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft the Order. 3. This report also recommends that you authorise the lodgement of the attached Cabinet paper for consideration either at a Cabinet Legislation Committee meeting or directly at a Cabinet meeting. 4. A copy of this report and the attached Cabinet paper should be referred to the Minister of Research, Science and Innovation for their information. Background 5. Between 26 January 2023 and 3 February 2023, a series of fronts crossed the upper North Island delivering extremely heavy rain, high winds, and widespread flooding in the Auckland, Bay of Plenty, Northland, and Waikato regions (January flood events). Then, from 12 February 2023 and ongoing, Cyclone Gabrielle moved across the North Island, also resulting in heavy rain, high winds, and flooding. 6. These weather events have impacted the ability of some businesses enrolled in the RDTI to be able to file on time. Filing may be for either an approval (a general approval, a criteria and methodologies approval, or a variation of those approvals) or for a supplementary return to claim R&D tax credits. Both an approval application and a supplementary return must be filed in time to claim R&D tax credits for the year. The exact due dates for these filings vary depending on factors like the taxpayer’s balance date and whether they have an extension of time for filing their income tax return. Inland Revenue has no operational discretion it can apply in response to the weather events to accept late RDTI filings. 7. On 8 February 2023, you recommended to Cabinet the Tax Administration (January Flood Events) Order 2023 that effectively allows Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest charged to taxpayers that were unable to pay their tax in full and on time because of the January flood events (CAB-23-MIN-0018 refers). This measure does not help businesses enrolled in the RDTI as there is no interest charged for a late filing. An approval application or supplementary return filed after the applicable deadline is instead declined altogether, meaning the business would be denied the RDTI for the year. IR2023/040: Tax Administration (Research and Development Tax Credit Deadlines for Taxpayers Affected by Weather Events) Order 2023 Page 2 of 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 8. In addition to remitting use of money interest, we have previously indicated to you other tax relief being deployed for taxpayers more broadly than pertains to the RDTI, including relief from late payment and late filing penalties, concessionary treatment for donated trading stock, and early withdrawals from/late deposits into income equalisation accounts to assist farmers and growers (IR2023/031 refers). Order in Council 9. The Tax Administration Act 1994 contains a broad power to extend, by Order in Council, the time provided for doing something under the Act. This would include extending the deadline for businesses to file applications for approval or supplementary returns as required by the RDTI. 10. In accordance with this power, we recommend that you make an Order in Council extending the due dates for relevant RDTI filings. Specifically, we recommend that any RDTI deadline for approval applications, variations to those approvals, and supplementary returns that falls between 26 January 2023 and 7 March 2023 be extended to 31 March 2023. 11. We recommend that the eligibility criterion for businesses to be given an extension is that either or both of the January flood events and Cyclone Gabrielle significantly adversely affect the ability of the taxpayer to comply with the relevant RDTI filing deadline (falling between 26 January 2023 and 7 March 2023). This criterion would match the test used for use of money interest remission during emergency events, including for the Tax Administration (January Flood Events) Order 2023 that you recently recommended to Cabinet. 12. If this Order in Council is not agreed to, then R&D businesses that would otherwise have filed on time but for these weather events will instead be denied those tax credits for the year. The affected group is those taxpayers that are already being impacted by these weather events, so to deny them R&D tax credits due to their inability to meet the original filing deadline may be seen as harsh. 13. Some businesses have been in contact to notify that they will not be able to meet the original deadline for RDTI filing due to the weather events, or to request an extension for businesses that are affected. 14. As of 1 February 2023, there are 1,800 businesses enrolled in the RDTI. Most of those businesses use standard March balance dates, which do not give rise to any deadlines that are likely to be affected by the weather events. 1 15. Non-standard balance dates that give rise to potentially impacted RDTI deadlines include income years ending in January, July, August, September, and December. The number of businesses enrolled in the RDTI with one of these balance dates is 264 (mostly December). However, the actual number of taxpayers that are expected to make use of the proposed extension is likely to be much lower than 264 because some of these businesses: 15.1 are not intending to claim the RDTI for the relevant income year; 15.2 had already filed prior to the weather events; 15.3 are not based around the areas of the weather events or are otherwise not affected. 1 For example, the general approval application due date is the seventh day of the second month after the end of the income year. For a 31 March 2023 balance date, that due date would be 7 May 2023, which is unlikely to be affected by the weather events (and would not be covered by our recommendation). Therefore, not all taxpayers enrolled in the RDTI are affected; whether or not a business is affected depends on their balance date. IR2023/040: Tax Administration (Research and Development Tax Credit Deadlines for Taxpayers Affected by Weather Events) Order 2023 Page 3 of 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Timing 16. We are engaging with your office to determine the appropriate Cabinet committee or Cabinet meeting for this proposal to be considered at. Irrespective of the meeting type and date, we recommend that the Order in Council come into force as soon as possible. 17. Accordingly, the attached Cabinet paper seeks a waiver of the 28-day rule for Orders in Council coming into force. If a waiver is not agreed to, R&D businesses affected by the weather events will face uncertainty for a longer period as to whether they are approved to undertake certain R&D activities with the support of the RDTI. Alternatively, they may face a delay in receiving their tax credit altogether during a period in which those funds may be important for coping with the impact of the weather events. No waiver would also increase Inland Revenue’s processing backlog as applications/returns will not be able to be processed for a further 28 days. 18. We are also engaging with the Parliamentary Counsel Office to determine if the date of notification of the proposed Order in Council in the New Zealand Gazette can be brought forward. This would enable commencement of the Order to be brought forward as well. Financial implications 19. The proposed extension would not have a fiscal impact. 20. Baseline forecasts of RDTI disbursements do not factor in the occurrence of the weather events nor the consequent reduction in RDTI disbursements due to late filings ( in the absence of the proposed extension). Extending the relevant RDTI deadlines for taxpayers significantly adversely affected in their ability to comply with those deadlines effectively restores the baseline forecasts. Administrative implications 21. Inland Revenue will be able to administer the proposed extended RDTI deadlines without requiring any systems changes. Consultation 22. The Treasury, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, and Callaghan Innovation were consulted on this report and the attached Cabinet paper. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet was informed. 23. We have had communications from, and spoken to, some R&D businesses and advisors who are seeking an extension of relevant RDTI filing deadlines in response to the weather events. Next steps 24. If authorised, we will issue a drafting instruction to the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft an Order in Council giving effect to the proposed extension of RDTI deadlines. We will provide this Order to your office in advance of its consideration at the chosen Cabinet committee or Cabinet meeting. Attached to this report are speaking notes to accompany consideration of the Cabinet paper. 25. The attached Cabinet paper should be a uthorised for lodgement to the Cabinet Office for consideration by either the Cabinet Legislation Committee or by Cabinet. We will be in contact with your office to confirm the meeting type and timing.
In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet TAX ADMINISTRATION (RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT DEADLINES FOR TAXPAYERS AFFECTED BY WEATHER EVENTS) ORDER 2023 Proposal 1.This paper seeks Cabinet’s agreement to submit an Order in Council making the Tax Administration (Research and Development Tax Credit Deadlines for Taxpayers Affected by Weather Events) Order 2023 to the Executive Council. Background 2.Between 26 January 2023 and 3 February 2023, a series of fronts crossed the upper North Island delivering extremely heavy rain, high winds, and widespread flooding in the Auckland, Bay of Plenty, Northland, and Waikato regions (January flood events).

The exact due dates for these filings vary depending on factors like the taxpayer’s balance date and whether they have an extension of time for filing their income tax return. Inland Revenue has no operational discretion it can apply in response to the weather events to accept late RDTI filings. 4.On 8 February 2023, I recommended the Tax Administration (January Flood Events) Order 2023 be submitted to the Executive Council. This Order allows Inland Revenue to remit interest charged to taxpayers that were unable to pay their tax in full and on time because of the January flood events (CAB-23-MIN-0018 refers). However, this measure does not help businesses enrolled in the RDTI as there is no interest charged for a late filing; the business would instead be denied the RDTI for the entire year.

This includes 1 2qddsziq5 2023-02-21 16:15:11 Doc 2 extending the deadline for businesses to file applications for approval or supplementary returns as required by the RDTI. 6.I therefore recommend the making of the Tax Administration (Research and Development Tax Credit Deadlines for Taxpayers Affected by Weather Events) Order 2023. 7.This Order in Council would extend the due dates for relevant RDTI filings to 31 March 2023. This includes any RDTI deadline for approval applications, variations to those approvals, and supplementary returns that have a deadline falling between 26 January 2023 and 7 March 2023. 8.The eligibility criterion for an extension is that either or both of the January flood events and Cyclone Gabrielle significantly adversely affect the ability of the taxpayer to comply with the relevant RDTI filing deadline (falling between 26 January 2023 and 7 March 2023). This criterion would match the test used for the Tax Administration (January Flood Events) Order 2023. 9.If this Order in Council is not agreed to, then R&D businesses that would otherwise have filed on time but for these weather events would instead be denied those tax credits for the year. The affected group is those taxpayers that are already being impacted by these weather events, so to deny them R&D tax credits due to their inability to meet the original filing deadline would be harsh. 10. Some businesses have contacted Inland Revenue/Callaghan Innovation to notify that they will not be able to meet the original deadline for RDTI filing due to the weather events, or to request an extension for businesses that are affected. 11. As of 1 February 2023, there are 1,800 businesses enrolled in the RDTI. Most of those businesses use standard March balance dates, which do not give rise to any deadlines that are likely to be affected by the weather events. 12. Non-standard balance dates that give rise to potentially impacted RDTI deadlines include income years ending in January, July, August, September, and December. The number of businesses enrolled in the RDTI with one of these balance dates is 264. However, the actual number of taxpayers that are expected to make use of the proposed extension is likely to be much lower than 264 because some of these businesses: 12.1 are not intending to claim the RDTI for the relevant income year; 12.2 had already filed prior to the weather events; 12.3 are not based around the areas of the weather events or are otherwise not affected. Timing and 28-Day Rule 13. I propose that the Tax Administration (Research and Development Tax Credit Deadlines for Taxpayers Affected by Weather Events) Order 2023 comes into force as soon as possible. This would require a waiver of the 28-day rule for regulations coming into force. 2 2qddsziq5 2023-02-21 16:15:11 14. A waiver is sought on the grounds that it is in the best interests of both taxpayers and the Government. Not waiving the 28-day rule would lengthen the uncertainty faced by R&D businesses affected by the weather events regarding whether they are approved to undertake certain R&D activities with the support of the RDTI. Alternatively, they may face a delay in receiving their tax credit altogether during a period in which those funds may be important for coping with the impact of the weather events. No waiver would also increase Inland Revenue’s processing backlog as applications/returns would not be able to be processed for a further 28 days. Financial implications 15. The Order in Council does not have any financial implications. 16. Baseline forecasts of RDTI disbursements do not factor in the occurrence of the weather events nor the consequent reduction in RDTI disbursements due to late filings (in the absence of the proposed extension). Extending the relevant RDTI deadlines for taxpayers significantly adversely affected in their ability to comply with those deadlines effectively restores the baseline forecasts. Compliance 17. The Order in Council complies with: 17.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 17.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 17.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 17.4 relevant international standards and obligations; 17.5 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Regulations Review Committee 18. There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the attached Order in Council to the attention of the House. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 19. The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the attached Order in Council is in order for submission to the Executive Council, provided that the 28-day rule is waived. 3 2qddsziq5 2023-02-21 16:15:11 Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 20. The Treasury’s Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that the proposal to extend RDTI filing deadlines in response to recent weather events is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement. This exemption is granted on the grounds that it is intended to manage the direct actions taken to protect the public in response to a declared emergency event and intended to temporarily defer or extend legislative deadlines where a declared emergency has made compliance with the existing legislative requirements impossible, impractical, or unreasonably burdensome. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 21. The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as the threshold for significance is not met. Communications 22. Inland Revenue will publish an article about this Order in Council in its Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive Release 23. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers with appropriate redactions within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 24. Inland Revenue, the Treasury, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, and Callaghan Innovation were consulted on this paper. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet was informed. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that Cabinet: 1.note that the Research and Development Tax Incentive has a range of due dates by which businesses must file applications for approval and supplementary returns in order to be eligible for R&D tax credits; 2.note that the Tax Administration Act 1994 contains a broad power to extend, by Order in Council, the time provided for doing something under the Act; 3.note that the Tax Administration (Research and Development Tax Credit Deadlines for Taxpayers Affected by Weather Events) Order 2023 would extend the deadlines in recommendation 1 until 31 March 2023 for taxpayers with an RDTI filing deadline between 26 January 2023 and 7 March 2023 if either or both of the January flood 4 2qddsziq5 2023-02-21 16:15:11 events and Cyclone Gabrielle significantly adversely affect their ability to comply with the filing deadline; 4.authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (Research and Development Tax Credit Deadlines for Taxpayers Affected by Weather Events) Order 2023; 5.note that a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought: 5.1 so that the Tax Administration (Research and Development Tax Credit Deadlines for Taxpayers Affected by Weather Events) Order 2023 can come into force as soon as possible; 5.2 on the grounds that not waiving the rule will: 5.2.1 lengthen the uncertainty faced by R&D businesses affected by the weather events regarding their RDTI approval status; 5.2.2 delay receipt of R&D tax credits during a period in which those funds may be important for coping with the impact of the weather events; 5.2.3 increase the processing backlog for Inland Revenue as applications/returns will not be able to be processed for a further 28 days; 6.agree to waive the 28-day rule so that the regulations can come into force as soon as possible.

\[IN CONFIDENCE\] POLICY AND REGULATORY STEWARDSHIP Tax policy report: Donated Trading Stock – extension of current income tax concession period and next steps Date: 14 December 2022 Priority: High Security level: In Confidence Report number: IR2022/554 Action sought Action sought Deadline Minister of Finance Agree to recommendations 16 January 2023 Minister of Revenue Agree to recommendations 16 January 2023 Contact for telephone discussion (if required) Name Position Telephone Stewart Donaldson Principal Policy Advisor Brandon Sloan Principal Policy Advisor s 9(2)(a) Doc 1 IR2022/554: Donated Trading Stock – extension of current income tax concession period and next steps Page 1 of 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 14 December 2022 Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue Donated Trading Stock – extension of current income tax concession and next steps Purpose 1. We recommend that a COVID-19-related income tax concession to support businesses donating trading stock, due to expire on 31 March 2023, be renewed for a further 12-month period by way of an Order in Council. Alternatively, a 12-month extension could be achieved by way of a Supplementary Order Paper at the Committee of the whole House stage of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill No 2. 2. This report outlines integrity issues and fiscal costs with further extensions and recommends a review of policy settings. Context and background 3. A trading stock concession was introduced to support the Government’s economic response to the COVID-19 outbreak. 4. In 2020, stakeholders from both the charitable and commercial sectors informed the (then) Minister of Revenue about their concerns that an anti-avoidance rule in the Income Tax Act disincentivises businesses from donating goods. At the time a number of businesses were donating goods, such as medical consumables, hand sanitiser and food to assist with the immediate effects of the lockdown response to COVID-19. 5. The tax rule at issue requires businesses to report the disposal of trading stock at market value as part of their taxable income, even if it is donated or sold to unrelated parties at below market value. This means businesses are effectively taxed on a deemed profit margin for the trading stock they donate. This rule is designed to stop the transfer of business assets from the tax base for insufficient consideration. It also supports the policy setting that only gifts of money to certain approved donee organisations will qualify for tax gift concessions. 6. The rule is consistent with the policy setting that requires market value adjustments when other property is transferred out of the tax base. We also note that businesses have the option of reducing the rule’s effect if they sell their trading stock on the open market and donate the proceeds to charity. 7. However, we consider that this rule, which was introduced principally as an integrity measure, can overreach in some situations by imposing tax when tax avoidance is not a concern. The overreach is not limited to COVID-19 but has been exacerbated by it because some businesses made more donations of trading stock in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. 8. There was a precedent for temporarily switching off the rule, which occurred for an 18-month period in response to the Canterbury earthquakes in 2010-2012. 9. You agreed to amendments which were included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021. The IR2022/554: Donated Trading Stock – extension of current income tax concession period and next steps Page 2 of 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] amendments provided relief for disposals of trading stock, excluding land, forestry and other similar items, to the following classes of person: 9.1 Public authorities and donee organisations (the latter are organisations whose donors can claim a tax benefit, such as the donation tax credit, for monetary donations made to the organisation), and 9.2 Non-associated persons (which are not public authorities or donee organisations) if the business: 9.2.1 can demonstrate the disposal is made for business purposes (in this case a full deduction is permitted and a market-value income adjustment is not required) or 9.2.2 makes a gift (in this case no deduction is permitted and a market- value income adjustment is not required). 10. The amendments also authorised the making of an Order in Council to extend the relief if the Minister of Revenue is satisfied that people in New Zealand are significantly adversely affected by COVID-19 or if there is an emergency event that significantly adversely affects people in New Zealand. 11. Cabinet initially approved relief from the rule for a two-year period from 17 March 2020 to 16 March 2022 (CAB-21-MIN-0013.02 refers). Cabinet then approved relief for a further one-year period from 17 March 2022 to 31 March 2023 (DEV-22-MIN- 0015 refers). 12. There is public interest in this issue. We understand that members of the Corporate Taxpayers Group discussed the treatment of donated trading stock with the Minster of Revenue on 8 December 2022. A submitter has also raised the issue with the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee as part of the hearings on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No. 2). 13. Proposal 14. We recommend extending the temporary relief, for business taxpayers that dispose of trading stock at below market value, for a further 12-month period ending 31 March 2024. 15. The Income Tax Act 2007 allows the COVID-19 response measure to be extended by Order in Council if you are satisfied that people in New Zealand are likely to continue to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19 beyond 31 March 2023. 16. Alternatively, a 12-month extension could be achieved through primary legislation, by way of a Supplementary Order Paper at the Committee of the whole House stage of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill No 2. s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2022/554: Donated Trading Stock – extension of current income tax concession period and next steps Page 3 of 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Rationale for extending the relief New Zealand’s approach to COVID-19 relief measures 17. Under the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006, the Prime Minister declared by notice that COVID-19 was likely to significantly disrupt essential governmental and business activity in New Zealand. That Epidemic Notice was first issued in March 2020 and was renewed every three months until October 2022. In October, the decision was taken to allow the Epidemic Notice to expire, because significant disruption was no longer likely. 18. The current use of COVID-19 Orders has been authorised under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020. Some measures such as the seven-day isolation period for cases remain, based on evidence that there is a risk of an outbreak or the spread of COVID-19. 19. In addition, the Government is continuing to provide some financial support. For example, support is provided to people who are required to isolate through the Leave Support Scheme. People affected by COVID can also access support through the Care in the Community welfare response, which includes the provision of food parcels. 20. However, the emergency COVID provisions and almost all economic support schemes have been stopped. Inland Revenue’s approach to COVID-19 relief measures 21. Inland Revenue’s current position is that we are unlikely to extend other COVID-19 determinations. For example, for the purpose of remission of interest, the Minister of Revenue can only make an Order in Council to extend the time limit of the COVID- 19 concession if the Minister is satisfied that the ability of taxpayers to pay tax on time is likely to continue to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. Inland Revenue has taken the view not to extend the COVID-19 determinations on the basis that the consequences for taxpayers are not as severe as was the case during the lockdowns. Extending donated trading stock relief 22. The provision for donated trading stock deliberately takes a broader view and requires the Minister of Revenue to be satisfied that “people in New Zealand” are likely to continue to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. The Minister is not required to be satisfied that COVID-19 has impacted on matters directly relevant to their tax behaviour, nor is he required to be satisfied that the recipients of donations are significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. 23. At the time of preparing this report there has been an uptick in cases and hospitalisations (there are currently over 400 people in hospital with/for COVID-19, including 10 in intensive care). While there is no longer a significant adverse impact for people collectively, reflected in the decision to not renew the Epidemic Notice, there will be a significant adverse impact for a number of individuals and families (at any point in time, and over the course of a year). 24. Proportionate measures are still necessary to protect the most vulnerable. On balance, we consider that there are people in New Zealand who are significantly adversely affected by COVID-19 and this could justify an extension of the donated trading stock relief provision. IR2022/554: Donated Trading Stock – extension of current income tax concession period and next steps Page 4 of 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 25. We note that our recommended extension is likely to be the last one that can be permitted under current law, unless there is a further resurgence of COVID-19 or another national emergency occurs after 31 March 2024. Legislating donated trading stock relief for a 12-month period 26. If the current COVID-19-related Order in Council relief is not extended because the Minister of Revenue may not consider that the threshold (that people in New Zealand are likely to be significantly affected by COVID-19) is met, the Minister could authorise a Supplementary Order Paper to the current bill, extending the relief for a 12-month period. This will allow time for officials to develop, and recommend if appropriate, a permanent solution for donated trading stock. s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2022/554: Donated Trading Stock – extension of current income tax concession period and next steps Page 5 of 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Fiscal implications 32. The original fiscal cost of the tax relief provided by the changes enacted in 2021 was estimated to be $10 million, which was spread across the 2020/21 to 2022/23 fiscal years (the relief applied to one tax year, but the impact was spread across multiple fiscal years because taxpayers file at different times). The extension agreed to earlier this year, 1 had an estimated fiscal cost of $5 million spread across the 2022/23 and 2023/24 fiscal years. 33. The fiscal cost of the further extension recommended in this report is expected to have lower fiscal cost of $2.5 million spread over the 2023/24 and 2024/25 fiscal years. This is based on an assumption that gifting is slowly reducing to pre-COVID levels. For example, the Auckland City Mission provided us with the below graph, which shows that upticks in donated goods related primarily to the COVID-19 directed lockdowns (April 2020, August 2021). The volume of donated goods since then has fallen, but as at October 2022 remains about twice that of pre-COVID levels. Graph: Auckland City Mission – Pallets of donated food and toiletries 34. We recommend that the fiscal cost be charged against the Tax Policy scorecard. We consider the change assists with taxpayer compliance until such time as we complete policy work on whether tax relief on donated trading stock should become a permanent feature of the income tax system. 35. The Treasury has concerns about the accuracy of the costings (although data limitations mean that there may not be a way to improve these) and has not formed a position on the proposal's value for money. Administrative implications 36. There are no material administrative implications connected with extending the tax relief for donated trading stock to 31 March 2024. Consultation 37. Officials undertook targeted consulted on this issue in 2020, which was largely focused on a temporary solution at the time. Feedback from stakeholders was incorporated into the temporary solution. We have not formally consulted with 1 Tax Administration (Extension of Period of Relief for Certain Disposals of Trading Stock) Order 2022, SL 2022/55 s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2022/554: Donated Trading Stock – extension of current income tax concession period and next steps Page 6 of 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] stakeholders as part of the preparation of this advice, however we have had discussions with the Auckland City Mission over the last few weeks. 38. We have discussed the issues raised in this report with the Ministry of Health, 39. The Treasury was consulted in the preparation of this report. Next steps 40. If you agree with the recommendations in this report we will: 40.1 Either prepare a paper to the Cabinet Legislation Committee seeking its approval to an Order in Council that would extend the current relief for donated trading stock to 31 March 2024. We will instruct the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft an Order in Council, giving effect to the above, or 40.2 Draft a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022– 23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill No 2, to be included at the Committee of the whole House stage, and Recommended action 41. We recommend that you: (a)(i) EITHER Agree to use the existing COVID-19-related Order in Council process to extend the exclusion from the deemed income rule for trading stock disposed of at below market value to 31 March 2024, and that officials be directed to prepare a paper to Cabinet Legislation Committee seeking its approval to an Order in Council Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed (ii) OR Agree to extend the exclusion from the deemed income rule for trading stock disposed of at below market value until 31 March 2024 by way of a Supplementary Order Paper at the Committee of the whole House stage of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill No 2. Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed (b) Note the following change as a result of the decision in recommendation (a) above, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance and net core Crown debt. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv)
In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet EXTENSION OF END DATE FOR TAX RELIEF FOR DONATIONS OF TRADING STOCK MADE BY BUSINESSES IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19 Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet’s agreement to an Order in Council extending the end date of a tax relief measure for donations of trading stock. The extension is part of the Government’s wider COVID-19 relief strategy and is likely to be the last extension unless there is a further resurgence of COVID-19. Policy 2.The proposed Order extends a tax relief measure for trading stock donated by businesses in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, with the new end date being 31 March 2024. 3.As a relief measure, the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021 provided time limited relief so that the Income Tax Act did not disincentivise businesses from donating trading stock to mitigate the economic and social impacts of COVID-19. 4.A donation of trading stock is deemed to be a disposal. A deemed income rule in the Income Tax Act effectively reverses the deduction that was claimed when the trading stock was purchased and imposes tax on a deemed profit. 5.Cabinet initially approved relief from the rule for a two-year period from 17 March 2020 to 16 March 2022 (CAB-21-MIN-0013.02 refers). Cabinet then approved relief for a further one-year period from 17 March 2022 to 31 March 2023 (DEV-22-MIN- 0015 refers). As a result, 5.1 when a business donates trading stock to a donee organisation or public authority, taxable income does not arise and a deduction is available; and 5.2 when a business donates trading stock to a non-associated person (which are not public authorities or donee organisations) taxable income does not arise and a deduction is available if the disposal is made for a business purpose. 6.The current end date for this temporary relief measure is 31 March 2023. 7.This tax relief measure can be extended if people in New Zealand are likely to continue to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. While there is no longer a significant adverse impact for people collectively, there will be a significant adverse impact for a number of individuals and families (at any point in time, and over the course of a year). Proportionate measures such as this tax relief measure 1 2qddsziq5 2023-02-22 10:42:15 Doc 3 are still necessary to protect the most vulnerable. Businesses, including large corporates and Federated Farmers, whose members donate livestock to various charities and community foodbanks, have asked for the relief to be extended. Proposed Order in Council 8.The proposed Order, to be made under s 225ABA of the Tax Administration Act 1994, will extend the period of relief for certain disposals of trading stock. It will come into force on 1 April 2023 and extend the relief period so it ends on 31 March 2024. 9.I recommend this Order be made on the basis that the legal requirements of s 225ABA(4) of the Tax Administration Act have been met. In particular, I am satisfied that people in New Zealand are likely to continue, beyond the expiry of the existing period, to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. Stakeholders commented that the economic and social impacts of COVID-19 continue to impact for a number of individuals and families and this tax relief measure is a proportionate measure to support those groups. Timing 10. The proposed Order will come into force on 1 April 2023. Financial Implications 11. The estimated financial implications of extending the temporary relied period from the deemed income rule is shown in the table below. Over the forecast period 2022- 23 to 2026-27 the estimated fiscal cost is $2.5 million. This cost will be charged against the Tax Policy Scorecard. $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue 2022–232023–242024–252025–26 2026–27 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue (0.000)(0.000)(1.000)(1.500)(0.000) Total change in Revenue 0.0000.0001.0001.5000.000 Compliance 12. The order complies with: 12.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 12.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 2 2qddsziq5 2023-02-22 10:42:15 12.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 2020 (if the regulations raise privacy issues, indicate whether the Privacy Commissioner agrees that they comply with all relevant principles); 12.4 relevant international standards and obligations; 12.5 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Regulations Review Committee 13. Officials consider there are no grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order to the attention of the House of Representatives under Standing Order 327. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 14. The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified the Order as being in order for submission to Cabinet, provided that the Minister is satisfied that people in New Zealand are likely to continue, beyond the expiry of the existing period, to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. 15. The reasons that the Minister is satisfied on this point are outlined in paragraphs 7 and 9 of this Cabinet paper. Impact Analysis 16. Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that the extension of the end date for tax relief for donations of trading stock made by businesses in response to Covid-19 is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the grounds that it has been addressed by existing impact analysis \[CAB-21-MIN-0013 and RIA Pack for Supplementary Order Paper No 23 to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill (March 2021) (ird.govt.nz)\]. Communications 17. I will issue a media statement once the Order in Council is made by the Executive Council. 18. Inland Revenue will publish an article about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive Release 19. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers with appropriate redactions within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. 3 2qddsziq5 2023-02-22 10:42:15 Consultation 20. In November 2021 officials consulted a group of interested stakeholders which included the Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand, Federated Farmers, Fonterra, EY, PwC, The New Zealand Law Society, and Auckland City Mission. This is the same group of stakeholders consulted on the introduction of the relief measures as a part of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020- 21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021. All responses we received were in favour of an extension to provide certainty for businesses and donee organisations. 21. An extension of this relief was raised by the Corporate Taxpayers Group and Federated Farmers in 2022. In late 2022 officials discussed the matters raised in this report with the Ministry of Health, DPMC, the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor and Auckland City Mission. 22. The Treasury was consulted on extending the temporary relief and its fiscal implications. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that Cabinet: 1.note that the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021 introduced temporary relief from a deemed income rule that is due to expire on 31 March 2023. 2.note that the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows the temporary relief from the deemed income rule to be extended by Order in Council. 3.authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (Extension of Period of Relief for Certain Disposals of Trading Stock) Order 2023. 4.note that section 225ABA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires that the Minister of Revenue be satisfied that people in New Zealand are likely to continue, beyond the expiry of the existing period, to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. 5.note the advice of the Minister of Revenue that this requirement has been met. 6.agree that the proposed Order should come into force on 1 April 2023 and extend the period of relief until 31 March 2024. 7.note that agreeing to recommendations 3 and 6 has the following estimated fiscal costs, which will be charged against the Tax Policy Scorecard. $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue 2022–232023–242024–252025–26 2026–27 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: (0.000)(0.000)(1.000)(1.500)(0.000) 4 2qddsziq5 2023-02-22 10:42:15 Tax Revenue Total change in Revenue 0.0000.0001.0001.5000.000 Authorised for lodgement Hon David Parker Minister of Revenue 5 2qddsziq5 2023-02-22 10:42:15

This report outlines integrity issues and fiscal costs with further extensions and recommends a review of policy settings. Context and background 3. A trading stock concession was introduced to support the Government’s economic response to the COVID-19 outbreak. 4. In 2020, stakeholders from both the charitable and commercial sectors informed the (then) Minister of Revenue about their concerns that an anti-avoidance rule in the Income Tax Act disincentivises businesses from donating goods. At the time a number of businesses were donating goods, such as medical consumables, hand sanitiser and food to assist with the immediate effects of the lockdown response to COVID-19. 5. The tax rule at issue requires businesses to report the disposal of trading stock at market value as part of their taxable income, even if it is donated or sold to unrelated parties at below market value. This means businesses are effectively taxed on a deemed profit margin for the trading stock they donate. This rule is designed to stop the transfer of business assets from the tax base for insufficient consideration. It also supports the policy setting that only gifts of money to certain approved donee organisations will qualify for tax gift concessions. 6. The rule is consistent with the policy setting that requires market value adjustments when other property is transferred out of the tax base. We also note that businesses have the option of reducing the rule’s effect if they sell their trading stock on the open market and donate the proceeds to charity. 7. However, we consider that this rule, which was introduced principally as an integrity measure, can overreach in some situations by imposing tax when tax avoidance is not a concern. The overreach is not limited to COVID-19 but has been exacerbated by it because some businesses made more donations of trading stock in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. 8. There was a precedent for temporarily switching off the rule, which occurred for an 18-month period in response to the Canterbury earthquakes in 2010-2012. 9. You agreed to amendments which were included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021. The IR2022/554: Donated Trading Stock – extension of current income tax concession period and next steps Page 2 of 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] amendments provided relief for disposals of trading stock, excluding land, forestry and other similar items, to the following classes of person: 9.1 Public authorities and donee organisations (the latter are organisations whose donors can claim a tax benefit, such as the donation tax credit, for monetary donations made to the organisation), and 9.2 Non-associated persons (which are not public authorities or donee organisations) if the business: 9.2.1 can demonstrate the disposal is made for business purposes (in this case a full deduction is permitted and a market-value income adjustment is not required) or 9.2.2 makes a gift (in this case no deduction is permitted and a market- value income adjustment is not required). 10. The amendments also authorised the making of an Order in Council to extend the relief if the Minister of Revenue is satisfied that people in New Zealand are significantly adversely affected by COVID-19 or if there is an emergency event that significantly adversely affects people in New Zealand. 11. Cabinet initially approved relief from the rule for a two-year period from 17 March 2020 to 16 March 2022 (CAB-21-MIN-0013.02 refers). Cabinet then approved relief for a further one-year period from 17 March 2022 to 31 March 2023 (DEV-22-MIN- 0015 refers). 12. There is public interest in this issue. We understand that members of the Corporate Taxpayers Group discussed the treatment of donated trading stock with the Minster of Revenue on 8 December 2022. A submitter has also raised the issue with the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee as part of the hearings on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No. 2). 13. Proposal 14. We recommend extending the temporary relief, for business taxpayers that dispose of trading stock at below market value, for a further 12-month period ending 31 March 2024. 15. The Income Tax Act 2007 allows the COVID-19 response measure to be extended by Order in Council if you are satisfied that people in New Zealand are likely to continue to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19 beyond 31 March 2023. 16. Alternatively, a 12-month extension could be achieved through primary legislation, by way of a Supplementary Order Paper at the Committee of the whole House stage of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill No 2. s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2022/554: Donated Trading Stock – extension of current income tax concession period and next steps Page 3 of 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Rationale for extending the relief New Zealand’s approach to COVID-19 relief measures 17. Under the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006, the Prime Minister declared by notice that COVID-19 was likely to significantly disrupt essential governmental and business activity in New Zealand. That Epidemic Notice was first issued in March 2020 and was renewed every three months until October 2022. In October, the decision was taken to allow the Epidemic Notice to expire, because significant disruption was no longer likely. 18. The current use of COVID-19 Orders has been authorised under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020. Some measures such as the seven-day isolation period for cases remain, based on evidence that there is a risk of an outbreak or the spread of COVID-19. 19. In addition, the Government is continuing to provide some financial support. For example, support is provided to people who are required to isolate through the Leave Support Scheme. People affected by COVID can also access support through the Care in the Community welfare response, which includes the provision of food parcels. 20. However, the emergency COVID provisions and almost all economic support schemes have been stopped. Inland Revenue’s approach to COVID-19 relief measures 21. Inland Revenue’s current position is that we are unlikely to extend other COVID-19 determinations. For example, for the purpose of remission of interest, the Minister of Revenue can only make an Order in Council to extend the time limit of the COVID- 19 concession if the Minister is satisfied that the ability of taxpayers to pay tax on time is likely to continue to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. Inland Revenue has taken the view not to extend the COVID-19 determinations on the basis that the consequences for taxpayers are not as severe as was the case during the lockdowns. Extending donated trading stock relief 22. The provision for donated trading stock deliberately takes a broader view and requires the Minister of Revenue to be satisfied that “people in New Zealand” are likely to continue to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. The Minister is not required to be satisfied that COVID-19 has impacted on matters directly relevant to their tax behaviour, nor is he required to be satisfied that the recipients of donations are significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. 23. At the time of preparing this report there has been an uptick in cases and hospitalisations (there are currently over 400 people in hospital with/for COVID-19, including 10 in intensive care). While there is no longer a significant adverse impact for people collectively, reflected in the decision to not renew the Epidemic Notice, there will be a significant adverse impact for a number of individuals and families (at any point in time, and over the course of a year). 24. Proportionate measures are still necessary to protect the most vulnerable. On balance, we consider that there are people in New Zealand who are significantly adversely affected by COVID-19 and this could justify an extension of the donated trading stock relief provision. IR2022/554: Donated Trading Stock – extension of current income tax concession period and next steps Page 4 of 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 25. We note that our recommended extension is likely to be the last one that can be permitted under current law, unless there is a further resurgence of COVID-19 or another national emergency occurs after 31 March 2024. Legislating donated trading stock relief for a 12-month period 26. If the current COVID-19-related Order in Council relief is not extended because the Minister of Revenue may not consider that the threshold (that people in New Zealand are likely to be significantly affected by COVID-19) is met, the Minister could authorise a Supplementary Order Paper to the current bill, extending the relief for a 12-month period. This will allow time for officials to develop, and recommend if appropriate, a permanent solution for donated trading stock. s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2022/554: Donated Trading Stock – extension of current income tax concession period and next steps Page 5 of 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Fiscal implications 32. The original fiscal cost of the tax relief provided by the changes enacted in 2021 was estimated to be $10 million, which was spread across the 2020/21 to 2022/23 fiscal years (the relief applied to one tax year, but the impact was spread across multiple fiscal years because taxpayers file at different times). The extension agreed to earlier this year, 1 had an estimated fiscal cost of $5 million spread across the 2022/23 and 2023/24 fiscal years. 33. The fiscal cost of the further extension recommended in this report is expected to have lower fiscal cost of $2.5 million spread over the 2023/24 and 2024/25 fiscal years. This is based on an assumption that gifting is slowly reducing to pre-COVID levels. For example, the Auckland City Mission provided us with the below graph, which shows that upticks in donated goods related primarily to the COVID-19 directed lockdowns (April 2020, August 2021). The volume of donated goods since then has fallen, but as at October 2022 remains about twice that of pre-COVID levels. Graph: Auckland City Mission – Pallets of donated food and toiletries 34. We recommend that the fiscal cost be charged against the Tax Policy scorecard. We consider the change assists with taxpayer compliance until such time as we complete policy work on whether tax relief on donated trading stock should become a permanent feature of the income tax system. 35. The Treasury has concerns about the accuracy of the costings (although data limitations mean that there may not be a way to improve these) and has not formed a position on the proposal's value for money. Administrative implications 36. There are no material administrative implications connected with extending the tax relief for donated trading stock to 31 March 2024. Consultation 37. Officials undertook targeted consulted on this issue in 2020, which was largely focused on a temporary solution at the time. Feedback from stakeholders was incorporated into the temporary solution. We have not formally consulted with 1 Tax Administration (Extension of Period of Relief for Certain Disposals of Trading Stock) Order 2022, SL 2022/55 s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2022/554: Donated Trading Stock – extension of current income tax concession period and next steps Page 6 of 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] stakeholders as part of the preparation of this advice, however we have had discussions with the Auckland City Mission over the last few weeks. 38. We have discussed the issues raised in this report with the Ministry of Health, 39. The Treasury was consulted in the preparation of this report. Next steps 40. If you agree with the recommendations in this report we will: 40.1 Either prepare a paper to the Cabinet Legislation Committee seeking its approval to an Order in Council that would extend the current relief for donated trading stock to 31 March 2024. We will instruct the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft an Order in Council, giving effect to the above, or 40.2 Draft a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022– 23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill No 2, to be included at the Committee of the whole House stage, and Recommended action 41. We recommend that you: (a)(i) EITHER Agree to use the existing COVID-19-related Order in Council process to extend the exclusion from the deemed income rule for trading stock disposed of at below market value to 31 March 2024, and that officials be directed to prepare a paper to Cabinet Legislation Committee seeking its approval to an Order in Council Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed (ii) OR Agree to extend the exclusion from the deemed income rule for trading stock disposed of at below market value until 31 March 2024 by way of a Supplementary Order Paper at the Committee of the whole House stage of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill No 2.

Order in Council: Tax Administration (Extension of Period of Relief for Certain Disposals of Trading Stock) Order 2023 3. On 14 December 2022 we reported to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue recommending an extension of tax relief for donations of trading stock made by businesses in response to COVID-19 which currently ends on 31 March 2023 (IR2022/ 554 refers). 4. The Minister of Revenue and the Minister of Finance directed officials to prepare a paper for Cabinet seeking approval to extend the tax relief for donations of trading stock until 31 March 2024. 5. The Minister of Revenue and the Minister of Finance also directed officials to instruct the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft an Order in Council to implement the extension. The attached Paper also seeks Cabinet approval to authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (Extension of Period of Relief for Certain Disposals of Trading Stock) Order 2023. Proactive release considerations 6. Officials recommend that the attached Cabinet paper should be proactively released without redaction after the Order is gazetted. Consultation 7. The Treasury have been informed of this report and consulted on the attached Cabinet paper and agree with its contents. In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet EXTENSION OF END DATE FOR TAX RELIEF FOR DONATIONS OF TRADING STOCK MADE BY BUSINESSES IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19 Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet’s agreement to an Order in Council extending the end date of a tax relief measure for donations of trading stock. The extension is part of the Government’s wider COVID-19 relief strategy and is likely to be the last extension unless there is a further resurgence of COVID-19. Policy 2.The proposed Order extends a tax relief measure for trading stock donated by businesses in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, with the new end date being 31 March 2024. 3.As a relief measure, the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021 provided time limited relief so that the Income Tax Act did not disincentivise businesses from donating trading stock to mitigate the economic and social impacts of COVID-19. 4.A donation of trading stock is deemed to be a disposal. A deemed income rule in the Income Tax Act effectively reverses the deduction that was claimed when the trading stock was purchased and imposes tax on a deemed profit. 5.Cabinet initially approved relief from the rule for a two-year period from 17 March 2020 to 16 March 2022 (CAB-21-MIN-0013.02 refers). Cabinet then approved relief for a further one-year period from 17 March 2022 to 31 March 2023 (DEV-22-MIN- 0015 refers). As a result, 5.1 when a business donates trading stock to a donee organisation or public authority, taxable income does not arise and a deduction is available; and 5.2 when a business donates trading stock to a non-associated person (which are not public authorities or donee organisations) taxable income does not arise and a deduction is available if the disposal is made for a business purpose. 6.The current end date for this temporary relief measure is 31 March 2023. 7.This tax relief measure can be extended if people in New Zealand are likely to continue to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. While there is no longer a significant adverse impact for people collectively, there will be a significant adverse impact for a number of individuals and families (at any point in time, and over the course of a year). Proportionate measures such as this tax relief measure 1 2qddsziq5 2023-02-22 10:42:15 Doc 3 are still necessary to protect the most vulnerable. Businesses, including large corporates and Federated Farmers, whose members donate livestock to various charities and community foodbanks, have asked for the relief to be extended. Proposed Order in Council 8.The proposed Order, to be made under s 225ABA of the Tax Administration Act 1994, will extend the period of relief for certain disposals of trading stock. It will come into force on 1 April 2023 and extend the relief period so it ends on 31 March 2024. 9.I recommend this Order be made on the basis that the legal requirements of s 225ABA(4) of the Tax Administration Act have been met. In particular, I am satisfied that people in New Zealand are likely to continue, beyond the expiry of the existing period, to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. Stakeholders commented that the economic and social impacts of COVID-19 continue to impact for a number of individuals and families and this tax relief measure is a proportionate measure to support those groups. Timing 10. The proposed Order will come into force on 1 April 2023. Financial Implications 11. The estimated financial implications of extending the temporary relied period from the deemed income rule is shown in the table below. Over the forecast period 2022- 23 to 2026-27 the estimated fiscal cost is $2.5 million. This cost will be charged against the Tax Policy Scorecard. $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue 2022–232023–242024–252025–26 2026–27 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue (0.000)(0.000)(1.000)(1.500)(0.000) Total change in Revenue 0.0000.0001.0001.5000.000 Compliance 12.

Regulations Review Committee 13. Officials consider there are no grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order to the attention of the House of Representatives under Standing Order 327. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 14. The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified the Order as being in order for submission to Cabinet, provided that the Minister is satisfied that people in New Zealand are likely to continue, beyond the expiry of the existing period, to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. 15. The reasons that the Minister is satisfied on this point are outlined in paragraphs 7 and 9 of this Cabinet paper. Impact Analysis 16. Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that the extension of the end date for tax relief for donations of trading stock made by businesses in response to Covid-19 is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the grounds that it has been addressed by existing impact analysis \[CAB-21-MIN-0013 and RIA Pack for Supplementary Order Paper No 23 to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill (March 2021) (ird.govt.nz)\]. Communications 17. I will issue a media statement once the Order in Council is made by the Executive Council. 18. Inland Revenue will publish an article about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive Release 19. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers with appropriate redactions within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. 3 2qddsziq5 2023-02-22 10:42:15 Consultation 20. In November 2021 officials consulted a group of interested stakeholders which included the Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand, Federated Farmers, Fonterra, EY, PwC, The New Zealand Law Society, and Auckland City Mission. This is the same group of stakeholders consulted on the introduction of the relief measures as a part of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020- 21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021. All responses we received were in favour of an extension to provide certainty for businesses and donee organisations. 21. An extension of this relief was raised by the Corporate Taxpayers Group and Federated Farmers in 2022. In late 2022 officials discussed the matters raised in this report with the Ministry of Health, DPMC, the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor and Auckland City Mission. 22. The Treasury was consulted on extending the temporary relief and its fiscal implications. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that Cabinet: 1.note that the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021 introduced temporary relief from a deemed income rule that is due to expire on 31 March 2023. 2.note that the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows the temporary relief from the deemed income rule to be extended by Order in Council. 3.authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (Extension of Period of Relief for Certain Disposals of Trading Stock) Order 2023. 4.note that section 225ABA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires that the Minister of Revenue be satisfied that people in New Zealand are likely to continue, beyond the expiry of the existing period, to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. 5.note the advice of the Minister of Revenue that this requirement has been met. 6.agree that the proposed Order should come into force on 1 April 2023 and extend the period of relief until 31 March 2024. 7.note that agreeing to recommendations 3 and 6 has the following estimated fiscal costs, which will be charged against the Tax Policy Scorecard. $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue 2022–232023–242024–252025–26 2026–27 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: (0.000)(0.000)(1.000)(1.500)(0.000) 4 2qddsziq5 2023-02-22 10:42:15 Tax Revenue Total change in Revenue 0.0000.0001.0001.5000.000 Authorised for lodgement Hon David Parker Minister of Revenue 5 2qddsziq5 2023-02-22 10:42:15 I N C O N F I D E N C E CAB-23-MIN-0032 Cabinet Minute of Decision This document contains information for the New Zealand Cabinet.

This report recommends you approve and lodge the attached paper to Cabinet authorising an Order in Council (the Order) to remit interest as a tax relief measure for taxpayers affected by the flooding and weather-related damage experienced across the North Island between 12 and 16 February 2023 as a result of Cyclone Gabrielle. The Order would declare the recent cyclone event an emergency event for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts. 1 2. The Order would permit Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest (UOMI) charged on the late payment of tax. The current rate of UOMI on underpayments of tax is now 9.21% 3. We also recommend that the proposal be submitted directly to Cabinet to ensure the relief is timely for those affected taxpayers. 4. The Order would give Inland Revenue flexibility to allow affected taxpayers to pay their tax obligations on a later date without incurring UOMI. Background 5. Cyclone Gabrielle made landfall in the upper North Island on 12 February 2023. It brought periods of high intensity, and in some places sustained, rain and winds across the North Island, before moving offshore on 16 February 2023. 6. A national state of emergency was declared to support local responses in Northland, Auckland, Bay of Plenty, Gisborne/Tairāwhiti, Hawke’s Bay, and Waikato regions, and the Tararua district. The Minister for Rural Communities has also declared a large-scale adverse event for entire North Island. We note, however, that areas such as the Wellington, Wairarapa, Manawatu/Whanganui (apart from Tararua district), and Taranaki regions have been able to weather the cyclone event without significant damage to telecommunications or other essential infrastructure. New Emergency Order required 7. The UOMI relief Inland Revenue can provide is confined to late payments/inaccurate provisional tax forecasts that result from the defined emergency event. Therefore, although similar Orders in Council may still be in effect for parts of the North Island, for example, the Orders in Council made in relation to Cyclone Hale on 25 January 2023, and the Auckland Anniversary Floods on 8 February, a new Order in Council is required to take into account the impacts of Cyclone Gabrielle. Implications for taxpayers’ obligations 8. We have been in discussions with stakeholders regarding the level of disruption to persons meeting their tax obligations caused by Cyclone Gabrielle. Based on these discussions, we consider that the level of disruption resulting from the Cyclone Gabrielle has, or will, significantly adversely affect the ability of some taxpayers to make a required payment of tax before its due date and/or to make accurate provisional tax forecasts. Because of the flooding and weather-related damage, 1 An emergency event for the purpose of the Inland Revenue Acts is different from an emergency event declared under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Framework. The Order discussed in this report deals with provision of tax relief for taxpayers affected by Cyclone Gabrielle between 12 and 16 February 2023. In Confidence IR2023/060: Order in Council: Tax Administration (February Cyclone Event) Order 2023 Page 2 of 4 taxpayers in affected areas will understandably be prioritising recovery rather than their tax affairs. The number of taxpayers directly affected is not yet known. 9. There are several key tax payment dates in February. PAYE payments are due by 20 February. GST returns and payments are required by 28 February, as well as a provisional tax payment. Late payment of these tax types results in UOMI being automatically imposed. The number of taxpayers affected by the flooding is not yet known. 10. Relief from late payment and late filing penalties is already available for taxpayers affected by Cyclone Gabrielle. However, this relief does not extend to the remission of UOMI charged to compensate the Crown for the loss of the use of revenue. This is because the remission of UOMI requires a higher threshold, such as a natural disaster, as well as Cabinet approval before UOMI relief can be provided. Order in Council: Tax Administration (February Cyclone Event) Order 2023 11. The Tax Administration Act 1994 2 provides for the making of an Order in Council to allow Inland Revenue to remit UOMI when: 11.1 an emergency event has, or will, significantly adversely affect a taxpayer’s ability to pay an amount of tax on time, or make an accurate forecast of provisional tax; 11.2 this non-payment results in the imposition of UOMI; and 11.3 the taxpayer is a member of a class of persons eligible for remission of UOMI, if the Order in Council declaring the emergency event describes such a class of persons. 12. The disruption caused by Cyclone Gabrielle meets the criteria for remission. The Order would allow Inland Revenue to remit UOMI incurred by taxpayers whose ability to pay their tax on time, and/or accurately forecast provisional tax, was significantly adversely affected by the flooding and other weather-related damage. 13. For the purposes of the Order, the emergency event is defined as the floods and other damage that occurred in Auckland, Bay of Plenty, Gisborne, Hawke’s Bay, Northland, and Waikato regions, and the Tararua district because of Cyclone Gabrielle, which crossed the North Island of New Zealand starting 12 February and ending 16 February 2023. Although the event definition includes some lesser affected areas, we recommend defining the area widely, as taxpayers in some areas are still experiencing the cumulative effects of adverse weather events occurring in the latter part of 2022 and early 2023. 14. While the Order allows Inland Revenue to remit amounts of interest incurred before the Order is made, it is desirable to authorise the relief as soon as possible. The reasons for this are taxpayer certainty and equity, and the efficient use of Inland Revenue resources. The practical effect of UOMI remission is that it allows affected taxpayers covered by the scope of the Order to focus on recovering from the event rather than on their tax affairs. 15. The draft Cabinet Paper that accompanies this report proposes the waiver of the 28-day rule so that the Order can come into force on the day it is notified in the Gazette. It is anticipated that this will occur on 20 February 2023. The Order will expire on 30 June 2023. We consider that the Order should apply for at least four months in recognition of the scale of the damage caused by the cyclone, and the cumulative effect that the recent weather events have had on affected areas and taxpayers since Cyclone Hale. 2 Section 183ABA refers. In Confidence IR2023/060: Order in Council: Tax Administration (February Cyclone Event) Order 2023 Page 3 of 4 16. Tax debts that remain unpaid from GST and PAYE obligations would incur interest from 1 July 2023. If the recovery period for affected areas requires more time, the Tax Administration Act provides for ability to extend the duration of the proposed Order, or otherwise replace it. Other tax relief for taxpayers 17. Under existing administrative powers, Inland Revenue is offering relief from late payment and late filing penalties for taxpayers affected by the Cyclone Gabrielle. The income equalisation scheme is also available for primary producer taxpayers as a large-scale adverse event was declared for affected areas. Farmers in those regions with income equalisation accounts who have been affected by Cyclone Gabrielle will be able to make late deposits and/or early withdrawals. 18. Inland Revenue will take a considered, but sympathetic, approach to taxpayers that have been affected by localised flooding and damage from Cyclone Gabrielle but are outside the areas specified in the Order. 19. Some taxpayers may, under the circumstances, have lost some or all of their tax records. Inland Revenue can manage this situation under current law. 20. Changes made in 2021 which give temporary favourable treatment to donated trading stock will also be of assistance to support recovery in affected districts. An extension to this relief to 31 March 2024 is to be considered at Cabinet on 20 February 2023. Other potential tax relief measures sought by stakeholders 21. As part our discussion with stakeholders about the proposed order, they have identified a range of other tax responses that could assist taxpayers affected by Cyclone Gabrielle. These measures involve changes to current tax policy settings and could have potential fiscal implications, such as, for example providing: 21.1 roll-over relief in the context of insurance payments received for tax depreciated commercial buildings that are damaged or destroyed, and 21.2 temporary tax relief for ex-gratia payments from employers to employees for income tax, and social policy purposes such as Working for Families. 22. We expect that other initiatives will be raised over the coming weeks, such as increasing the threshold for the immediate deductibility of low-value assets, or re- introducing loss-carry back for companies. We will consider these suggested policy responses, and their priority, if the Government advances a medium-term relief response to Cyclone Gabrielle. Key considerations if work is to be progressed on these issues are, the degree to which the tax relief is targeted to the regions in need, and whether the relief is timely and can be funded. 23. We are also reviewing the tax policy responses that were made for the 2010 Canterbury and the 2016 Kaikōura earthquakes. We will provide advice on those measures separately. Administrative implications 24. Taxpayer contact with Inland Revenue about the effects of the recent weather has been growing strongly following Cyclone Hale, and the Auckland Anniversary Floods. To date, taxpayers are requesting options to either defer tax payments or enter into instalment arrangements. 25. In respect of the current event, we expect that taxpayers will not turn their minds to their tax obligations until after other priority tasks have been attended to. O ur media communications are emphasising that taxpayers deal with the clean-up first
1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Tax Administration (February Cyclone Event) Order 2023 Proposal 1 This paper seeks authorisation for submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (February Cyclone Event) Order 2023 (the Order). 2 The Order is required to allow Inland Revenue to remit interest charges on late payments for taxpayers who have been significantly adversely affected by the flooding and weather-related damage that occurred as a result of Cyclone Gabrielle, which crossed the North Island of New Zealand starting 12 February and ending 16 February 2023. Policy 3 Cyclone Gabrielle made landfall in the upper North Island on 12 February 2023. It brought periods of high intensity, and in some places sustained, rain and winds across the North Island before moving offshore on 16 February 2023. A national state of emergency was declared to support local responses in Northland, Auckland, Bay of Plenty, Gisborne/Tairāwhiti, Hawke’s Bay, and Waikato regions, and the Tararua district. The Minister for Rural Communities has also declared a large-scale adverse event for entire North Island. 4 Inland Revenue officials have been in discussions with stakeholders regarding the level of disruption to persons meeting their tax obligations caused by Cyclone Gabrielle. Based on these discussions, my officials advise that the flooding and weather-related damage caused by Cyclone Gabrielle meet the statutory criteria for interest remission set out in the Tax Administration Act 1994 \[paragraph 7 refers\]. This is because some taxpayers have been significantly adversely affected to the extent that they have been unable to pay their tax on time and/or accurately forecast provisional tax. 5 There are several tax payment dates in February. 20 February is a PAYE payment date and 28 February is a payment/filing date for GST, and provisional tax. Payments after these dates result in use of money interest being automatically imposed. 2qddsziq5 2023-02-23 10:14:45 Doc 2 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 6 Inland Revenue has the power to provide relief from late payment and late filing penalties for taxpayers affected by adverse events, at the Commissioner’s discretion. However, this relief does not extend to the remission of use of money interest charged by Inland Revenue to compensate the Crown for the loss of the use of revenue. T he remission of interest requires a higher threshold, such as a natural disaster, and requires Cabinet approval before the relief can be provided. The current rate of interest on late payments of tax is 9.21%. Without relief, the late payment of tax results in the automatic statutory imposition of interest. 7 The Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for an Order in Council to allow Inland Revenue to remit interest where: 7.1 an emergency event has, or will, significantly adversely affect a taxpayer’s ability to pay an amount of tax on time, or make an accurate forecast of provisional tax; 7.2 the non-payment of tax results in the imposition of interest; and 7.3 the taxpayer is a member of class of persons eligible for remission of interest if the Order in Council declaring the emergency event describes such a class of person. 8 The relief Inland Revenue is able to provide under this type of Order in Council is confined to late payments and/or inaccurate provisional tax forecasts that result from the emergency event a s defined in the Order in Council. Therefore, although similar Orders in Council may still be in effect for the same areas, for example, the Order in Council made in relation to the Auckland Anniversary Floods on 8 February, 1 a new Order in Council is required to support those taxpayers in regions affected by Cyclone Gabrielle. 9 Given the instability and intensity of the weather systems currently affecting New Zealand, I am anticipating that future similar Orders in Council will be needed in response to each new event that affects the country. Tax Administration (February Cyclone Event) Order 2023 10 The flooding and weather-related damage caused by Cyclone Gabrielle meets the criteria for interest remission. The Order authorises Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest incurred by taxpayers whose ability to pay their tax on time, and/or make an accurate forecast of provisional tax, was significantly adversely affected by Cyclone Gabrielle. For the purposes of the Order, the emergency event is defined as the floods and weather-related damage that occurred in the Northland, Auckland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Gisborne, and Hawke’s Bay regions, as well as the Tararua district between 12 February and 16 February 2023. While other regions in the North Island have been affected, the regions specified above have been the most severely affected with telecommunications and other essential infrastructure being disrupted. 1 Tax Administration (January Flood Events) Order 2023 SL 2023/3 2qddsziq5 2023-02-23 10:14:45 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 11 While the Order allows Inland Revenue to remit amounts of interest incurred before the Order was made, it is desirable to authorise the relief as soon as possible. The practical effect of interest remission is that it allows affected taxpayers covered by the scope of the Order to focus on recovering from the event rather than on their immediate tax affairs. 12 The Order will commence on its notification in the Gazette and will expire on 30 June 2023. The Order will apply for a minimum of four months in recognition of the scale of the impact the cyclone has had on the North Island, and the cumulative effects of the recent weather fronts since Cyclone Hale. The Tax Administration Act provides that the duration of the proposed Order can be extended or replaced if, by the beginning of May, a longer period of interest relief is required to support the regions affected by Cyclone Gabrielle. Timing and 28-day Rule 13 A waiver of the 28-day rule is sought, to enable the regulations to come into force on their notification in the Gazette. Exercise of this power is taxpayer- friendly and is not expected to affect anyone negatively. Further, the sooner the relief is effective the more certain taxpayers’ positions will be, and Inland Revenue’s processing of relief applications will be more efficient. Compliance 14 Section 183ABA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides the statutory authority for the Governor-General by Order in Council to declare an event to be an emergency event and allow Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest. This event meets the Tax Administration Act’s qualifying criteria. 15 The Order complies with the following: The principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Not applicable The rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993 Not applicable The principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 2020 Not applicable Relevant international standards and obligations Not applicable The Legislation Guidelines (2021 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee Compliant Financial Implications 16 The baseline forecasts do not include the emergency event, nor the potential use of money interest charges, should the event trigger additional debt. Remission of use of money interest for significantly adversely affected taxpayers will not affect existing fiscal baselines. 2qddsziq5 2023-02-23 10:14:45 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Regulations Review Committee 17 Officials believe there are no grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order to the attention of the House under Standing Order 327. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 18 The Order has been certified by the Parliamentary Counsel Office as being in order for submission to Cabinet. The regulations will come into force earlier than the 28 th day after the date of their notification in the Gazette. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 19 The Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that this proposal to provide interest remission relief for taxpayers who have been adversely affected by Cyclone Gabrielle is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement. This is granted on the grounds that it is intended to temporarily defer or extend legislative deadlines where a declared emergency has made compliance with the existing legislative requirements impossible, impractical or unreasonably burdensome. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 20 The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as the threshold for significance is not met. Publicity 21 I will announce Inland Revenue’s ability to remit use of money interest once the Order is in effect and notified in the Gazette. Proactive Release 22 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 23 Inland Revenue officials have consulted with the Treasury, and the Ministry for Primary Industries. Federated Farmers were also consulted and agree with the Order. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand have been informed of the Order. 2qddsziq5 2023-02-23 10:14:45 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that Cabinet: 1 Note that the Tax Administration Act 1994 authorises the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to remit interest charged to taxpayers for late payment of tax, where the late payment is due to the effects of an emergency event declared by Order in Council. 2 Note that the event described as the February Cyclone Event meets the criteria specified in the Tax Administration Act 1994 for the declaration of an emergency event. 3 Authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (February Cyclone Event) Order 2023. 4 Note that this remission of interest will not affect fiscal baselines. 5 Note that a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought on the grounds that the exercise of the power will only positively affect taxpayers, and the power it confers will apply to events before the making of the Order. 6 Agree to the waiver of the 28-day rule so that the regulations can come into force on their notification in the Gazette.

This report recommends you approve and lodge the attached paper to Cabinet authorising an Order in Council (the Order) to remit interest as a tax relief measure for taxpayers affected by the flooding and weather-related damage experienced across the North Island between 12 and 16 February 2023 as a result of Cyclone Gabrielle. The Order would declare the recent cyclone event an emergency event for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts. 1 2. The Order would permit Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest (UOMI) charged on the late payment of tax. The current rate of UOMI on underpayments of tax is now 9.21% 3. We also recommend that the proposal be submitted directly to Cabinet to ensure the relief is timely for those affected taxpayers. 4. The Order would give Inland Revenue flexibility to allow affected taxpayers to pay their tax obligations on a later date without incurring UOMI. Background 5. Cyclone Gabrielle made landfall in the upper North Island on 12 February 2023. It brought periods of high intensity, and in some places sustained, rain and winds across the North Island, before moving offshore on 16 February 2023. 6. A national state of emergency was declared to support local responses in Northland, Auckland, Bay of Plenty, Gisborne/Tairāwhiti, Hawke’s Bay, and Waikato regions, and the Tararua district. The Minister for Rural Communities has also declared a large-scale adverse event for entire North Island. We note, however, that areas such as the Wellington, Wairarapa, Manawatu/Whanganui (apart from Tararua district), and Taranaki regions have been able to weather the cyclone event without significant damage to telecommunications or other essential infrastructure. New Emergency Order required 7. The UOMI relief Inland Revenue can provide is confined to late payments/inaccurate provisional tax forecasts that result from the defined emergency event. Therefore, although similar Orders in Council may still be in effect for parts of the North Island, for example, the Orders in Council made in relation to Cyclone Hale on 25 January 2023, and the Auckland Anniversary Floods on 8 February, a new Order in Council is required to take into account the impacts of Cyclone Gabrielle. Implications for taxpayers’ obligations 8. We have been in discussions with stakeholders regarding the level of disruption to persons meeting their tax obligations caused by Cyclone Gabrielle. Based on these discussions, we consider that the level of disruption resulting from the Cyclone Gabrielle has, or will, significantly adversely affect the ability of some taxpayers to make a required payment of tax before its due date and/or to make accurate provisional tax forecasts. Because of the flooding and weather-related damage, 1 An emergency event for the purpose of the Inland Revenue Acts is different from an emergency event declared under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Framework. The Order discussed in this report deals with provision of tax relief for taxpayers affected by Cyclone Gabrielle between 12 and 16 February 2023. In Confidence IR2023/060: Order in Council: Tax Administration (February Cyclone Event) Order 2023 Page 2 of 4 taxpayers in affected areas will understandably be prioritising recovery rather than their tax affairs. The number of taxpayers directly affected is not yet known. 9. There are several key tax payment dates in February. PAYE payments are due by 20 February. GST returns and payments are required by 28 February, as well as a provisional tax payment. Late payment of these tax types results in UOMI being automatically imposed. The number of taxpayers affected by the flooding is not yet known. 10. Relief from late payment and late filing penalties is already available for taxpayers affected by Cyclone Gabrielle. However, this relief does not extend to the remission of UOMI charged to compensate the Crown for the loss of the use of revenue. This is because the remission of UOMI requires a higher threshold, such as a natural disaster, as well as Cabinet approval before UOMI relief can be provided. Order in Council: Tax Administration (February Cyclone Event) Order 2023 11. The Tax Administration Act 1994 2 provides for the making of an Order in Council to allow Inland Revenue to remit UOMI when: 11.1 an emergency event has, or will, significantly adversely affect a taxpayer’s ability to pay an amount of tax on time, or make an accurate forecast of provisional tax; 11.2 this non-payment results in the imposition of UOMI; and 11.3 the taxpayer is a member of a class of persons eligible for remission of UOMI, if the Order in Council declaring the emergency event describes such a class of persons. 12. The disruption caused by Cyclone Gabrielle meets the criteria for remission. The Order would allow Inland Revenue to remit UOMI incurred by taxpayers whose ability to pay their tax on time, and/or accurately forecast provisional tax, was significantly adversely affected by the flooding and other weather-related damage. 13. For the purposes of the Order, the emergency event is defined as the floods and other damage that occurred in Auckland, Bay of Plenty, Gisborne, Hawke’s Bay, Northland, and Waikato regions, and the Tararua district because of Cyclone Gabrielle, which crossed the North Island of New Zealand starting 12 February and ending 16 February 2023. Although the event definition includes some lesser affected areas, we recommend defining the area widely, as taxpayers in some areas are still experiencing the cumulative effects of adverse weather events occurring in the latter part of 2022 and early 2023. 14.

Relation to Government Priorities 2 The income tax setting relating to disposals of trading stock at below market value contains an overreach, both for disposals made in the ordinary course of business and disposals in the nature of a gift. Developing a permanent solution to this overreach is a priority on the Government’s tax policy work programme. 3 Public consultation on possible solutions will support the development of tax settings that are fair and sustainable in the longer-term, in line with the Government’ revenue strategy. Background 4 In 2020 officials consulted on temporary changes to deemed income rules relating to disposals of trading stock. This was part of the Government’s COVID-19 response to concerns that the tax rules disincentivise businesses from donating trading stock. The rules causing this disincentive had been temporarily removed in response to the Canterbury earthquakes in 2010-2011. 5 The consultation highlighted a general perception of unfairness amongst tax practitioners and businesses in relation to the rules. Officials agreed that the rules can overreach in relation to some disposals. 6 The 2020 consultation led to the enactment of temporary relief from the deemed income rules for both COVID-19 and for potential future emergencies \[ CAB-23- MIN-0032 refers\]. The COVID-19 measures are due to expire on 31 March 2024. 7 Although the temporary measures alleviated immediate concerns raised by businesses, a permanent solution is necessary going forward. Further consultation is required, particularly given the emergency provisions were developed under relative urgency. Consultation is also important given the rules in question have been a longstanding aspect of the income tax settings and provide important integrity protections. Doc 1 2 8 Public consultation through the attached Paper will support the development of a coherent and fair set of permanent rules that maintains these protections. Current law 9 A rule in the Income Tax Act 2007 deems businesses disposing of trading stock to have income equal to the market value of those goods. 10 The deemed income rule was introduced in the late 1940s as an anti-avoidance measure intended to counter situations such as when a retiring farmer gifted livestock to a relative who was also a farmer. Income tax was avoided by the retiring farmer on the gift and the succeeding farming business could revalue the stock brought onto its books at market value. 11 The rule is important because it protects the revenue base from the artificial reduction of business profits through transfers of trading stock. 12 However, the provision was drafted broadly and applies in circumstances when tax avoidance is not a concern. This overreach occurs both for disposals made in the ordinary course of business and disposals in the nature of a gift. 13 For disposals made for business purposes, either for no consideration or consideration at below market value (for example, for marketing purposes), there is a view that the rule may ‘overreach’ by not allowing a net deduction for trading stock disposals when a business purpose exists, and by applying the rule to transactions between non-associated parties. 14 For disposals made for charitable purposes, there is a view that the rule may ‘overreach’ by taxing amounts that are never actually derived, and that it can disincentivise the donation of trading stock. 15 As part of the Government’s COVID-19 response, relief was provided to turn off the deemed income rule for certain gifts of trading stock as well as for disposals that were made for a business purpose. Officials’ Issues Paper 16 Because of the public interest in this matter and the different options which could be adopted for a permanent solution, I recommend that officials undertake consultation with interested stakeholders with a view to developing a permanent solution going forward. 17 The Paper consults on various policy options to change the rules permanently as well as retention of the status quo. The options relate to disposals in the nature of a gift for which there is no business purpose and other disposals that may or may not be made for a business purpose. Disposals of trading stock that are not gifts 18 T he Paper contains two new options that would in effect make the temporary relief for business disposals permanent, allowing a net deduction for trading stock disposed of to non-associated persons for a business purpose. 3 Disposals of trading stock that are gifts 19 The Paper contains four new options for the tax settings as they relate to gifts. The options include making the temporary relief permanent and making the temporary relief permanent but with certain limitations to align the rules with donations of money. 20 One of the options would allow a net deduction for gifts of food. This option was specifically suggested by the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor, who is concerned the current tax settings promote food waste. Risks 21 Stakeholders are anticipating this consultation on permanent options, following officials’ targeted consultation on the temporary extensions for COVID-19 relief. We expect the Paper to be welcomed by business groups as well as donee organisations, as all the proposed changes address the perceived overreach to some extent. 22 Given that the temporary relief ends on 31 March 2024, there will be an expectation from some stakeholders that policy decisions are made and legislation is enacted in a short timeframe. Financial Implications 23 There are no financial implications associated with this Cabinet paper. However, all options included in the Paper (apart from the status quo options) would have a fiscal cost if implemented. If these options progress into final recommendations their costs will be quantified and reported back to Cabinet. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 24 As requested by the Treasury, the Inland Revenue QA panel has reviewed the discussion document and determined that it contains sufficient impact analysis to support Cabinet's decision to release it. Therefore, a separate regulatory impact statement (RIS) is not required at this stage. A full RIS will be completed at a later stage to inform Cabinet's final decisions on this proposal. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 25 A Climate Implications of Policy Assessment is not required. Population Implications 26 T he options included in this Paper would primarily affect businesses and donee organisations. My officials will consider the exact impacts of the various options in later advice following consultation. 4 Consultation 27 The content of this paper has been informed by targeted consultation by my officials with taxpayer representatives that occurred in 2020 in response to COVID- 19. 28 The Treasury was consulted in developing the Paper. My officials will consult further with agencies in developing final policy recommendations. 29 My officials also engaged with the Chief Science Advisor to the Prime Minister in developing the option relating to disposals of food. Communications 30 If Cabinet agree, the attached consultation paper will be published for consultation on the Inland Revenue website. The consultation will remain open for a period of six weeks. Proactive Release 31 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers with appropriate redactions within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 1 note the contents of the attached officials’ issues paper; 2 approve the release of the attached officials’ issues paper for a six-week public consultation period; 3 note that I will provide a further Cabinet paper seeking final policy approvals if, following consultation, I prefer an option other than the status quo.

This would maintain the treatment of distributions consistent with previous years and should apply only for a transitional period while a permanent response is developed. Relation to government priorities 2 The proposal in this paper promotes Government priorities by maintaining the integrity of the tax system. Tax legislation needs to be regularly maintained and updated in response to changing technology and business practices. It is also important that tax legislation reflects the principles of fairness and certainty. Executive Summary 3 The Income Tax Act 2007 allows certain co-operatives to deduct distributions to their shareholders that would otherwise be a non-deductible dividend (the deductibility provision). A recent change in the constitution of Fonterra means that a majority of its distributions to shareholders will become non-deductible, even where there has been no change in the shareholding. The loss of a deduction will result in the over-taxation of the company and its shareholders and a reduction in the distribution to shareholders. 4 This paper proposes extending the deductibility provision, for the 2022–23 to 2024–25 income years only, so that distributions that would have been deductible under Fonterra’s previous constitution will continue to be deductible. This will provide time for officials to work with Fonterra to develop a permanent solution. 5 Without any legislative changes, the increase in tax revenue is forecast to be $60 million over the forecast period (subject to significant uncertainty). The proposed extension to the deductibility provision to 2024-25 is forecast to cost $58 million over the forecast period. The Minister of Finance and I have agreed to manage the cost of the proposed extension against the Tax Policy Scorecard. 6 This proposal should be included in a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023–24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Doc 1 2 Bill which is currently being considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee. Although this Bill is not expected be enacted until early 2024, the announcement of a proposed law change will support Fonterra to maintain its existing distribution policy. 7 This Supplementary Order Paper will also include an amendment that ensures the bright-line line and other time related tests in the Income Tax Act do not apply when there is a Government/local authority buy-out of a North Island flood affected property. This amendment is consistent with the policy intent of previous approvals for taxation rollover relief for flood affected assets and therefore does not require separate Cabinet consent. Background 8 An existing deductibility provision in the Income Tax Act 2007 allows certain co- operative companies to deduct distributions to their shareholders that would otherwise be a non-deductible dividend. In most circumstances this deductibility treatment provides an equivalent outcome to a non-deductible dividend that is paid with imputation credits. It is also equivalent to deductible rebates paid by other mutuals and co-operatives. 9 This deductibility provision was designed to reflect the linkage between shareholding and products or services supplied between a co-operative and its shareholders. For example, if a shareholder supplied 5% of the total supplies to a co-operative they would be required to hold 5% of the shares and would receive 5% of the distributions of profit. 10 A recent change in the constitution of Fonterra reduced the number of shares that shareholders are required to hold while still maintaining the ability to hold shares up to (and above) the level of supplies. In other words, the link between supplies and shareholding was weakened. For purposes of this discussion, the old level can be referred to as 1 share per 1 unit of supply , or 1:1. The new level is 1:3. This was done for commercial reasons, essentially to make it more attractive for suppliers to supply Fonterra (by reducing the amount of capital they were required to invest in order to supply a certain amount of milk solids). 11 Although individual shareholders can reduce their holding, the total number of shares on issue remains relatively constant. Shareholders reduce their holdings by trading amongst other shareholders rather than redeeming their shares with Fonterra. 12 Inland Revenue has confirmed that when the existing deductibility provision is applied to this new constitution only distributions up to the (newly reduced) level of shares that shareholders are required to hold (i.e. 1:3 units of supply) will be deductible. Distributions above this level will cease to be deductible. Distributions on shares above the level of supplies (i.e. on shares in excess of 1:1) have always been non-deductible and this is unchanged. 13 Due to the interaction of existing legislation and Fonterra’s constitution, it will also not be able to attach imputation credits to any dividends. The consequence of this is, without further intervention, the amount of cash distributed by Fonterra will reduce and income derived by Fonterra will be taxable at the co-operative 3 level and again where it is distributed to its shareholders. This is a higher level of tax than would be paid on income derived by a regular company and distributed to its shareholders. Analysis Link between supply and shareholding 14 Historically, a co-operative applying the relevant provision would have had an explicit link between shareholding and supply (for example, being required to hold one share per one unit supplied to the co-operative). This then provided a direct linkage between the co-operative’s production, profits and proportionate shareholding. 15 Following a change in Fonterra’s constitution this linkage has been partially lost. For example, a constitution could require a shareholder to hold one share per three units supplied instead of per one unit supplied while still allowing a supplier to hold three (or more) shares. The consequence of this is if two shareholders each provided 3% of a co-operative’s supplies one might continue to hold 3% of its shares while the second might reduce their holding to 1%. In this example both shareholders supply the same amount but the first shareholder would hold three times as many shares and therefore receive a distribution that is three times the size. Therefore, the link between supplies and distributions received is lost. Case for deductible distributions 16 Although a deductible distribution will, in most circumstances, provide the same final tax outcome as a non-deductible imputed dividend this will not always be the case. Examples of this are where a shareholder cannot utilise the imputation credit such as a tax-exempt charity, a non-resident or a shareholder with significant tax losses. The standard treatment of companies in New Zealand is imputed dividends and there needs to be good policy grounds for varying from this treatment. An example of where this is justified is a co- operative who can reallocate their return to shareholders between the price paid for supplies and an end of year dividend – applying a different tax treatment to these two economically equivalent payments would create a tax incentive to favour increasing the price of supplies which may not otherwise commercially exist. 17 Where the linkage between supplies and shareholding no-longer exists a co- operative cannot reallocate returns to shareholders in this manner. Increasing the price paid for supplies advantages shareholders who hold fewer shares over a shareholder who holds more shares and would therefore prefer a greater distribution. Accordingly, this ground for providing deductible distributions also no longer exists in this circumstance. Transitional deductible period 18 Without a legislative response Fonterra will pay a smaller distribution for the 2022–23 and subsequent years. As referred to in paragraph 13, this distribution will also not be imputed. This has two consequences: 4 18.1 The tax imposed on earnings ultimately distributed to shareholders will be higher than on other equivalent businesses as tax will be imposed at both the co-operative and shareholder level, with no reduction for imputation credits. 18.2 Shareholders will receive a smaller distribution than they are expecting based on advice from Fonterra over both the tax treatment of distributions under its new constitution and the amount of the distribution. 19 There is insufficient time to develop and introduce a permanent solution to this issue before Fonterra confirms and pays its 2022–23 distribution. This would require consultation with affected shareholders as not all shareholders would benefit equally from a potential solution. I recommend an extension of the previous deductibility treatment on distributions on shares up to the level of supplies. This should apply for the 2022–23 to 2024–25 years only. This will provide sufficient time for officials to develop a permanent solution in conjunction with Fonterra. Implementation 20 The proposal will have no systems implications for Inland Revenue, and other administrative implications (such as guidance) will fall within Inland Revenue’s existing change capacity. Cost-of-living Implications 21 This proposal will retain the distributions that shareholders would be expecting to receive for these years. Officials estimate that, based on the level of distributions for the 2021–22 year, if this proposal is not introduced the effect on an average shareholder may be a reduction in pre-tax distributions of approximately $3,000 per year. Financial Implications 22 Current baseline forecasts do not include any additional tax revenue from the impact of the change to Fonterra’s constitution. However, now Inland Revenue has come to a position on the correct tax treatment, any future forecasts would need to include an estimate of the increased tax revenue (in the absence of any law change but assuming Fonterra changes its constitution). Inland Revenue has estimated the increase in tax revenue as follows (subject to considerable uncertainty): $ m – increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 and outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue 54.000 2.000 2.000 2.000 23 Introducing the proposed extension would have the following fiscal implications: 5 $ m – increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 and outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue (54.000) (2.000) (2.000) 0.000 Total Operating 54.000 2.000 2.000 0.000 24 Without any legislative changes, the increase in tax revenue is forecast to be $60 million over the forecast period (subject to significant uncertainty). The proposed extension to the deductibility provision to 2024-25 is forecast to cost $58 million over the forecast period. The Minister of Finance and I have agreed to manage the cost of the proposed extension against the Tax Policy Scorecard. Legislative Implications 25 This proposal will require an amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007. I propose to include the necessary legislative changes in a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023–24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill which is currently being considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee. This Supplementary Order Paper will also include a remedial amendment to the bright line rollover relief rules that is consistent with the policy intent. 26 I will release this Supplementary Order Paper before Parliament is dissolved on 8 September. This timing will support the announcement of Fonterra’s 2022– 23 distribution shortly after this. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Statement 27 The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the regulatory impact assessment prepared by Inland Revenue. The reviewer considers that information and analysis summarised in the regulatory impact statement partially meets the quality assurance criteria. Due to time limitations, it has not been possible to consult with Fonterra’s shareholders and as a result some potential policy options have been ruled out of consideration at this time. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 28 The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as it not expected to result in any significant, direct emissions impacts. 6 Population Implications 29 The proposal will prevent a reduction in the distribution received by all shareholders of Fonterra. Fonterra has not supplied a breakdown of the population groups that make up its shareholders. 30 The mixture of groups that are shareholders that will include corporates, individuals, charities and Maori authorities. As this proposal will affect the level of cash distributions all shareholders will receive an equal reduction in their distribution in proportion to their shareholding. Human Rights 31 The proposal is consistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993. Use of external Resources 32 No external resources have been engaged in the preparation of this proposal. Consultation 33 Inland Revenue has consulted with the Treasury, the Ministry for Primary Industries and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in the preparation of this proposal. 34 Fonterra has been consulted throughout the development of this proposal. Communications 35 I will release this Supplementary Order Paper before Parliament is dissolved on 8 September. It will also be published on Inland Revenue’s policy website. This timing will support the announcement of Fonterra’s 2022–23 distribution shortly after this. Proactive Release 36 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper and associated Cabinet minute shortly after the proposed release of the Supplementary Order Paper. 7 Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Cabinet Economic Development Committee: 1 note that the Income Tax Act 2007 allows certain co-operatives to deduct distributions to their shareholders. 2 note that Fonterra has adopted a new constitution that has the following tax implications for the 2022–23 and subsequent tax years (absent any legislative change). 3 note the forecasted increase in revenue following the adoption of the new constitution (in the absence of any legislative change) is as follows (subject to significant uncertainty): $ m – increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 and outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue 54.000 2.000 2.000 2.000 4 agree to allow Fonterra to deduct distributions on shares up to their 1:1 share standard (the treatment that applied before the change to the constitution. 5 agree that recommendation 4 apply to the 2022–23 to 2024–25 years only. 6 note the following changes as a result of the decision in recommendations 4 and 5 above, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance and/or net debt. $ m – increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 and outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue (54.000) (2.000) (2.000) 0.000 Total Operating 54.000 2.000 2.000 0.000 7 note that the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue have agreed to manage the cost of the proposed extension against the Tax Policy Scorecard. 8 note that officials will consider what the appropriate tax treatment should be for the period from 2025–26 onwards. 8 9 agree to authorise the Minister of Revenue to release a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023–24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill, containing the measure referred to in recommendations 4 and 5.

1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Finance Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Economic Development Committee GLOBAL ANTI-BASE EROSION TAX RULES FOR NEW ZEALAND Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet Economic Development Committee’s agreement to introduce Global Anti-base Erosion Rules (GloBE rules) in New Zealand. 2.Cabinet approval is sought as this is a policy change that will in some circumstances impose tax on large multinational enterprises (MNEs) operating in New Zealand, where their income, in either New Zealand or other countries where they operate, bears an effective tax rate of less than 15%. 3.This paper sets out the estimated one-off and ongoing administration costs for Vote Revenue, covering the GloBE rules and country by country reporting (CbC 2.0). CbC 2.0 supports the implementation and ongoing implementation of the GloBE rules. Cabinet approval is sought to note these estimated costs and to delegate to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue the decision on funding sources for this initiative. Relation to Government Priorities 4.This proposal relates to the international tax workstream on the Government’s tax policy work programme. The Government is committed to ensuring that MNEs pay their fair share of tax. This includes participating in multilateral solutions to the challenge posed by economic globalisation to the international tax framework. Executive Summary 5.The GloBE rules are the main part of the G20/OECD-led Pillar Two proposal. The purpose of the GloBE rules is to ensure that large MNEs are subject to tax of at least 15% on their mobile income, in every country where that income is earned. This will reduce the incentive for them to take advantage of low tax rates and other tax concessions. 6.The success of this proposal depends on it being adopted by a critical mass of countries. At the moment, it appears that adoption by the EU, Japan, Switzerland and Canada is very likely, with adoption also likely in Australia and the UK. This is more than enough to be a critical mass. By adopting GloBE rules, New Zealand will contribute to that critical mass, as well as raise a modest amount of revenue and simplify compliance for New Zealand-based MNEs. Doc 1 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7. Subject to Cabinet approval, the changes recommended in this paper will be included in the next available omnibus tax bill, and apply from a date to be specified by Order in Council, giving Cabinet the flexibility to align the application date of our GloBE rules with other countries. 8. This initiative will require up to $17.300 million operating and capital funding which will be a mix of Crown Budget 2023 funding and Vote Revenue self-funding to be agreed as part of the Budget 2023 process 9. The estimated costs of $17.300 million includes $8.600 million capital and $8.700 million operating, over the forecast period (2022/23 to 2026/27) for the up-front build and on-going administration costs, covering the GloBE rules (Pillar Two) and the associated country by country reporting (CbC 2.0). 10. We currently estimate up to $25.000 million of additional tax revenue per annum beginning from 2026/27. This equates to $25.000 million in the forecast period (2022/23 to 2026/27). We recommend that the additional tax revenue be managed as a positive impact on the 2023 Budget operating allowance. 11. The net positive financial impact of this initiative over the forecast period (2022/23 to 2026/27) is $7.700 million (2022/23 to 2026/27) and $21.900 million per annum thereafter. Background 12. Pillar Two is a G20/OECD initiative seeking to address tax base erosion risks caused by profit shifting by large MNEs. These risks arise because these MNEs can choose to shift income, particularly from capital or intangible property, to countries which charge no or little tax on that income. Sometimes this is because of general low tax rates. Other times it is because of targeted tax incentives. 13. The main plank of Pillar Two is the GloBE rules. These rules will ensure that large MNEs are subject to tax of at least 15% on their mobile income, in every country where that income is earned, reducing profit shifting incentives. They apply to MNEs with annual revenues of €750 million or more. The OECD estimates that they will increase global corporate income tax by approximately 9%, or US$220 billion pa. 14. The GloBE Model Rules (the Model Rules) were finalised by the OECD in December 2021, with detailed commentary released in March 2022 and further guidance in February 2023. 15. The rules require an MNE to calculate its effective tax rate (ETR) by comparing its tax in a country with its accounting profit (with certain adjustments) for that country. If the ETR is less than 15%, it must calculate the GloBE top-up tax it has to pay. GloBE top- up tax is the tax required to bring the ETR on mobile income in a country up to 15%. An MNE calculates this by taking its adjusted accounting profit for the country, subtracting the substance-based income exclusion (broadly, a 5% return on the tangible assets and payroll expenses in the jurisdiction 1 ), and multiplying the result by the difference between 15% and its ETR. 1 For an initial 10-year period the rate is higher than 5% and will reduce over time to 5%. 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 16. The obligation to pay GloBE top-up tax is allocated between countries according to one of three rules. 16.1 First, if the country where the income is earned has enacted a domestic minimum tax (DMT) the top up tax will be paid to that country. 16.2 Second, the tax may be paid under the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) which applies on a top-down basis, giving the ultimate parent entity (UPE) country or an intermediate parent entity country the right to collect GloBE top-up tax for the country where the income is earned, if it has not been taxed under a DMT 16.3 Third, if no DMT or IIR applies to the under-taxed profits of a member of an MNE, the Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR) will allocate GloBE top-up tax in proportion to the group’s payroll costs and tangible asset values in each country with GloBE rules. This ensures that if the country where an MNE has its headquarters decides not to implement GloBE rules, the MNE will still have to pay top up tax if it operates in countries that have GloBE rules. 17. Approximately 20-25 New Zealand headquartered MNEs are in scope. GloBE Rules for New Zealand Should New Zealand adopt GloBE rules 18. New Zealand has a relatively high corporate tax rate and (with the exception of capital gains) a broad tax base. We have robust rules for ensuring income from New Zealand activities of foreign firms is taxed in New Zealand. We also have rules ensuring that New Zealand firms cannot easily avoid New Zealand tax on foreign income, except where that income arises from the conduct of an active business in the country where the income is taxable. 19. Despite our relatively strong rules for preventing profit shifting out of New Zealand, there remains some residual ability for foreign owned MNEs to shift taxable profits out of New Zealand to lower tax countries. Our strong rules also create a risk that companies will not want to be headquartered in New Zealand. 20. If the GloBE rules are adopted by a critical mass of countries, these risks will be significantly reduced. By adopting the GloBE rules, New Zealand will be contributing to the critical mass, supporting the success of the proposal internationally. Adopting the GloBE rules would also raise a modest amount of revenue, which would otherwise be collected by other countries under the UTPR. 21. s 9(2)(f)(iv) 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 22. We propose that New Zealand adopt GloBE rules, on the basis that they will come into effect only if a critical mass of other countries is also committed to bring GloBE rules into effect. 23. We propose that the GloBE rules application date is specified by an Order in Council. This will give Cabinet the flexibility to align the application date of our GloBE rules with their application date in other countries. Incorporation into New Zealand law by reference to the Model Rules 24. If a country adopts GloBE rules, it must adopt the OECD’s Model Rules, commentary and the administrative guidance (except for a domestic minimum tax, which is optional). Adoption is proposed to be by incorporation into domestic legislation (not by treaty). Where a country’s incorporating legislation departs from the Model Rules, there is a risk its GloBE rules will not be “qualifying” and other participating countries will continue to apply GloBE top-up tax to the country’s in-scope MNEs under the UTPR. To address the risk of our GloBE rules not being qualifying, we propose that the rules are incorporated into New Zealand law by reference to the Model Rules, Commentary and ad ministrative guidance. There will be limited areas where the rules need to be adapted or clarified, but the general approach will be to follow the agreed OECD Model Rules where possible. Where changes are required, these will respect the intended outcomes agreed in the OECD. 25. The effectiveness of the GloBE rules depends on consistency in their implementation in different countries. For example, there would be a high risk of over or under-taxation if implementing countries adopted different rules to measure the level of taxation and top-ups required in each country. Incorporating the rules into New Zealand law by reference to the Model Rules will reduce these risks. 26. It will be desirable, as a default position, for future changes to the OECD Model Rules to be automatically incorporated into New Zealand law, for periods beginning after those changes are made. That will reduce the burden of the GloBE rules on the New Zealand tax legislative process and maximise the likelihood of cross-country consistency and of our rules being qualifying. It will involve no substantive loss of sovereignty, since if it wants to, Parliament can enact law declaring that a change made at OECD level should not have effect in New Zealand. It will be important to ensure that as changes become effective, they are made publicly available to New Zealand taxpayers. 27. That said, we do propose that the 15% rate of tax under the GloBE rules is included in the proposed Bill. This will ensure that the fundamental issue of the tax rate, which sets the floor on the race to the bottom on taxes, can only be changed by Act of Parliament. No imputation credits for GloBE top-up tax under the IIR or UTPR 28. The Model Rules state that if the payment of tax under a country’s IIR or UTPR gives rise to a benefit, the IIR or UTPR will not be qualifying, and other participating countries s 9(2)(f)(iv) 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] will continue to apply GloBE top-up tax to the country’s in-scope MNEs under their UTPR. 29. Generally New Zealand income tax paid by a New Zealand company gives rise to an imputation credit, which can be passed on to the company’s shareholders when the company pays a dividend. However, if New Zealand’s IIR or UTPR give rise to an imputation credit, although sufficient tax will be paid at a corporate level under the IIR or UTPR, the entire GloBE top-up tax amount will be available as a dollar-for-dollar tax reduction to the shareholder’s tax liability and the imposition of the IIR or UTPR would be unwound on distribution. This benefit would result in our IIR and UTPR being non- qualifying, so we propose that GloBE top-up tax payable under the IIR and UTPR does not give rise to imputation credits. 30. A payment of tax under a country’s DMT which gives rise to an imputation credit, will not result in the DMT being non-qualifying. This is specifically provided for in the GloBE rules and reflects that, whilst the DMT must be based on the GloBE rules, it is a local tax on local profits. Charging tax allocated to New Zealand under the UTPR 31. The Model Rules include two approaches for charging tax allocated to a country by the UTPR. Individual countries are left to choose one of these approaches. The first approach denies an income tax deduction on otherwise deductible expenses of the MNE group. The second approach treats the GloBE top-up tax as a separate tax liability independent of income tax. The outcome of either approach must be to produce an additional cash tax impost in the country equal to the top-up tax allocated to it. The amount of this impost in a particular year is subject to the limit that it should not exceed the tax benefit of tax deductions otherwise available to entities in that country in that year. 32. We propose that this GloBE top-up tax be charged as a separate tax liability in New Zealand. This will ensure that the liability will not impact provisional tax. It will also eliminate some of the complexity of using the income tax system to impose a GloBE liability. We propose that the tax would be a joint and several liability of all New Zealand entities in an MNE group. Domestic minimum tax 33. The GloBE rules give countries the option to introduce a DMT, which would use the same tax base as the GloBE rules but give the local country priority in the collection of the GloBE top-up tax. For New Zealand, this tax would be closely based on the GloBE rules but would apply to undertaxed profits in New Zealand. 34. A DMT could be imposed solely on New Zealand headquartered in-scope MNEs or expanded to apply also to foreign headquartered in-scope MNEs operating in New Zealand. The likelihood of any MNEs being subject to GloBE top-up tax on their New Zealand income is low because of our high corporate income tax rate and general lack of tax preferences. However, we propose that a DMT be adopted for New Zealand headquartered MNEs as this will ensure that whatever happens, they do not need to pay tax under any other country’s UTPR. This will minimise their compliance costs. 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Denying a deduction or foreign tax credit for GloBE taxes in another country 35. The design of the GloBE rules makes it clear that GloBE top-up tax under the IIR or UTPR should not be either creditable or deductible for non-GloBE income tax purposes. The top-up tax is determined after taking into account income tax imposed on the income attributable to a country, whether that tax is imposed by the country itself or another country. 36. Given that the GloBE top-up tax is calculated after taking into account tax imposed under a worldwide or CFC tax regime, it would clearly not be appropriate for the GloBE top-up tax to be creditable or deductible when calculating those taxes. Therefore, we propose that taxpayers be denied a foreign tax credit or deduction for GloBE top-up tax paid in another country. This does not apply to tax imposed under a DMT. Additional policy decisions 37. This paper also seeks Cabinet’s agreement to delegate authority to the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue to make additional joint decisions on any policy and drafting issues arising as appropriate. Operational and financial impacts International tax work programme 38. There are currently seven proposed international tax initiatives on the government’s tax and social policy work programme which are expected to be implemented over the next four financial years and are at various stages of development. This international tax workstream aligns with OECD initiatives and is focused on people and businesses, including multinational companies, paying their fair share of tax. The initiatives are: • Taxation of the platform economy (included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2) • OECD Pillar One • OECD Pillar Two (Global anti-Base Erosion Rules – GloBE) • Country by Country reporting (CbC 2.0) – this supports the implementation and ongoing implementation of the GloBE rules • Crypto Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) • Common Reporting Standard schema (CRS 2.0) • 39. Because the initiatives are at different stages of development there is no overall picture of the financial impact. Officials’ current assessment is that once implemented, this work programme will be overall revenue positive – the tax revenue gains will exceed the implementation and on-going administration costs of the initiatives. Inland Revenue will update Ministers on the cumulative financial impact of this programme of international tax initiatives as the individual items are reported on for policy decisions and implementation. 40. The overall net financial gain (additional tax revenue less implementation and on-going administration costs) from the GloBE rules and Country by Country reporting 2.0 over s 9(2)(f)(iv) 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] the forecast period is $7.700 million (2022/23 to 2026/27) and $21.900 million per annum thereafter. OECD Pillar Two and Country by Country reporting Financial implications - Additional tax revenue 41. The proposed GloBE rules are expected to increase tax revenue. The following table sets out the estimated tax revenue increase. The estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty and are based on a number of assumptions including the final policies and rules. The timing of these revenue benefits will be dependent on policy implementation dates, and the timing of adoption by other countries. We currently estimate up to $25.000 million of additional tax revenue over the forecast period, with ongoing additional tax revenue of $25.000 million per annum. $million Crown revenue and receipts: Tax revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & outyears OECD GloBE rules - - - - 25.000 Country by Country reporting 2.0 - - - - - Total revenue - - - - 25.000 Total operating - - - - (25.000) 42. This estimate was arrived at by Inland Revenue with the help of the OECD’s global economic impact assessments (which continue to be updated). There are a high number of assumptions in this model, as it is dependent on the final rules (in particular safe harbours), how and which countries implement GloBE rules and the behavioural response of MNEs based on work done by the OECD. 43. It is expected that some additional revenue would be raised through applying the UTPR to foreign-owned MNEs with substance in New Zealand and the DMT to New Zealand headquartered MNEs. It is also possible that additional revenue will be raised from foreign headquartered MNEs who have a reduced incentive to shift profits out of New Zealand. However it is not possible to estimate the amount of this revenue. 44. An increase in New Zealand income tax is also forecast due to reduced profit shifting by New Zealand headquartered MNEs, as a result of a critical mass of other countries adopting the GloBE rules. This has been estimated at approximately $16 million per year after the GloBE rules have been adopted by the critical mass of countries. This benefit will arise whether or not New Zealand adopts GloBE rules itself. 45. It is proposed that this additional tax revenue be managed as a positive impact against the Budget 2023 operating allowance. 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Financial implications – up-front build costs and on-going administration 46. Inland Revenue has estimated that the up-front build costs and on-going administration of these two initiatives to be $17.300 million, $8.700 million capital and $8.600 million operating over the forecast period with on-going administration cost of $3.100 million a year. These estimates are subject to any significant changes in the final policies and rules that may materially change these estimates. The following table sets out the capital and operating costs for the up-front build and on-going administration. $million Vote Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & outyears Capital expenditure OECD GloBE rules - - 5.300 - - Country by Country reporting 2.0 - - 3.400 - - Total capital - - 8.700 - - Operating expenditure OECD Pillar Two - 0.200 1.500 2.300 2.300 Country by Country reporting 2.0 - 0.100 0.600 0.800 0.800 Total operating - 0.300 2.100 3.100 3.100 Total expenditure - 0.300 10.800 3.100 3.100 47. The up-front build and on-going administration costs involve system changes to support the standardised reporting by large multi-national groups and information exchanges between tax jurisdictions of key financial information (GloBE information return). In addition, system changes will be required to impose a standard top-up tax (a new tax) to ensure such group pay a minimum level of tax in each jurisdiction where they operate. Inland Revenue estimates that it will require an additional six staff to administer the proposed GloBE rules. 48. The Pillar Two initiative will leverage off the existing reporting requirements under the CbC rules. As part of the implementation of Pillar Two, Inland Revenue will incorporate the current CbC reporting into START and streamline the process. Leveraging off the current reporting requirements will minimise the additional compliance costs for impacted entities. Furthermore, it will provide a sustainable solution to ensure that Inland Revenue can meet its international obligations. Legislative Implications 49. Implementing these proposals requires changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 and Tax Administration Act 1994. It will also require an Order in Council to be agreed to by 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Cabinet in order to bring the rules into effect. This Order in Council will be prepared after a critical mass of countries have committed to implement the GloBE rules. 50. If approved, we propose including the legislative changes resulting from these recommendations in the next omnibus taxation bill, scheduled for introduction in early 2023. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 51. The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the OECD’s Pillar Two GloBE Tax Rules Impact Summary and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it meets the quality criteria of the Regulatory Impact Analysis framework. This issue has been subjected to wide consultation, including through a public issues paper. As identified in the Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis section, a difficulty with assessing the revenue implications of the various options has been establishing the administrative costs of adopting the GloBE rules without knowing aspects of the detailed design, and the extent to which behavioural changes occur if a critical mass of other countries adopt the GloBE rules. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 52. The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as the threshold for significance is not met. Population Implications 53. There are no population implications arising from the proposals in this paper. Human Rights 54. There are no human rights implications arising from the proposals in this paper. Consultation 55. Consultation has been undertaken with affected taxpayers, representative bodies and their advisors. They are broadly supportive of proposals. However, some stakeholders do not support the proposal to incorporate the GloBE rules into New Zealand by reference to the Model Rules, and most do not support the proposal to not provide imputation credits for top-up tax paid under the IIR and UTPR. 56. The Treasury and Inland Revenue have been consulted in the preparation of this paper and support the changes. Communications 57. Subject to approval from the offices of the Ministers of Finance and Revenue, Inland Revenue will make an announcement on this policy once Cabinet decisions have been made. The Minister of Revenue will also make an announcement about the 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] introduction of the bill which will contain this proposal. A commentary on the bill will be released at this time. Proactive Release 58. We propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in whole within 30 working days of the public announcement of Cabinet’s decisions. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 1. agree to adopt GloBE rules for New Zealand; 2. agree that the GloBE rules be incorporated into New Zealand law by reference to the OECD Model Rules, Commentary and administrative guidance; 3. agree that amendments to the OECD Model Rules, Commentary and administrative guidance be incorporated automatically into New Zealand law; 4. agree that no imputation credits be provided for GloBE top-up tax; 5. agree that GloBE top-up tax allocated to New Zealand by the Under-Taxed Profits Rule be charged as a separate tax liability; 6. agree to adopt a Domestic Minimum Tax for New Zealand headquartered MNEs; 7. agree that taxpayers be denied a foreign tax credit or deduction for GloBE top-up tax paid in another country; 8. agree that recommendation 1 to 7 should apply from a date to be specified by Order in Council; 9. agree to delegate authority to the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue to make additional joint decisions on any policy and drafting issues arising as appropriate; Financial and operational implications 10. note the following forecast changes to tax revenue resulting from the decisions at recommendations 1 – 9 to implement the GloBE rules, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance and net debt: $m – increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & Outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax revenue - - - - 25.000 Total operating - - - - (25.000) 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 11. note that after a critical mass of countries adopt the GLoBE rules, forecast revenue will increase by around $16 million a year, regardless of whether New Zealand adopts the GLoBE rules. 12. agree that the additional tax revenue in recommendation (10) should be managed as a positive impact against the 2023 Budget operating allowance. 13. note that the estimated costs of the up-front build and on-going administration of the GloBE proposal and the associated CbC reporting changes is $17.300 million, being $8.700 million capital and $8.600 million operating, over the forecast period (2022/23 to 2026/27) with an on-going administration cost of $3.100 million a year from 2025/26 onwards. 14. delegate authority to the Minister of Revenue and the Budget Ministers to approve up to $17.300 million funding for this initiative and to agree the mix of funding from Budget 2023 allowances and Vote Revenue as part of the Budget 2023 process.

On 5 May, Ministers approved the release of the officials’ issues paper OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand (IR2022/133 refers). This report summarises the submissions on the issues paper, our responses, and our recommendations for next steps. 2. If officials’ recommendations are accepted, we will come back to Ministers in October 2022 with a paper seeking Cabinet approval to introduce legislation implementing GloBE rules ( and a related domestic minimum tax) in the first quarter of 2023, with an effective date to be determined by order in council. The order in council is expected to make the rules effective for income years beginning on or after 1 January 2024 or 1 January 2025. Background 3. Pillar Two is an OECD/G20 initiative seeking to address tax base erosion risks caused by profit shifting by large multinationals (MNEs). The main plank of Pillar Two is the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules. These rules are intended to ensure that large MNEs are subject to tax of at least 15% on their mobile income, in every country where that income is earned. They apply to MNEs with annual revenues above €750 million. The GloBE Model Rules (the Model Rules) were finalised in December 2021, with detailed commentary released in March 2022. Further guidance (referred to as administrative guidance) is expected during 2022/23 with the GloBE rules expected to be adopted by participating countries in 2023 effective 2024. 4. The GloBE rules work first by requiring an MNE to calculate its effective tax rate (ETR) on mobile income in every country where it reports income. The ETR is essentially accounting tax expense divided by accounting income. If the ETR is below 15%, then there will be a top up tax obligation on the group. This top-up tax may be imposed by the country where the income is earned, as a domestic minimum tax (DMT). If that country does not impose the tax, then it will be collected under: 4.1 The Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) which applies on a top-down basis, giving the ultimate parent entity (UPE) jurisdiction (i.e. the country where the top company in the group is tax resident) the right to collect top-up tax. If that country does not adopt the GloBE rules, then countries where the group has intermediate holding companies may apply an IIR. 4.2 The Under-Taxed Profits Rule (UTPR) which applies as a back-up to the IIR. It is intended to protect the integrity of the IIR by discouraging MNEs from relocating their UPE to a country that does not implement Pillar Two. If no II R applies to a MNE, t he UTPR will allocate top-up tax to a participating country in proportion to the group’s payroll costs and tangible asset values in that country. IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 2 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 5. If a country adopts GloBE rules, it must adopt the OECD’s Model Rules, commentary and the (yet to be released) administrative guidance. Adoption is by incorporation into local legislation (not by treaty). Where a country’s incorporating legislation departs from the Model Rules, commentary and administrative guidance, there is a risk its GloBE rules will not be “qualifying” and participating countries will continue to apply GloBE top -up tax to the country’s in-scope MNEs. 6. 20-25 New Zealand headquartered MNEs are in scope for Pillar Two. Our current forecast is that the GloBE rules could raise circa $40-45 million in additional tax revenue for New Zealand per annum, though approximately $16 million of that will be due solely to the adoption of the GloBE rules by other countries, so does not require New Zealand’s participation. The issues paper 7. The issues paper sought feedback on whether, if GloBE rules are implemented by a critical mass of other countries, New Zealand should also implement them, and how. There were 11 submitters on the issues paper, from industry groups, multinationals, accounting firms and an individual. 8. The key points from the submissions are: • Adoption of GloBE rules The majority of submitters agreed that New Zealand should adopt GloBE rules if a critical mass of other countries adopt them. • Timing Submitters said that minimising compliance costs should inform the timing of New Zealand’s adoption of GloBE rules, given the low amount of tax expected to be collected. This could be achieved, they submitted, by following other countries’ adoption. • Safe harbours and simplifications Submitters were concerned about the potential for onerous compliance obligations especially as New Zealand multinationals are relatively small and not typically engaged in significant profit shifting. Submitters requested that officials push for effective simplifications and safe harbours at the OECD and that New Zealand adopt only the minimum standard of GloBE rules required. • Mode of incorporation o Submissions on whether New Zealand should rewrite the Model Rules into New Zealand legislation or simply refer to the OECD’s Model Rules were mixed. While rewriting the rules ensures they will mesh with New Zealand’s existing tax system, some submitters were concerned with the amount of additional law that would be needed and the potential for the rewrite to cause inadvertent variations. o A number of submitters said that any changes to the GloBE rules at OECD level made after the rules become effective in New Zealand should not become part of New Zealand law without amendment of the law by Parliament (the alternative is for such changes to be automatically incorporated unless Parliament disapproves them). • Domestic minimum tax Submitters were generally in favour of New Zealand adopting a DMT for in- scope New Zealand multinationals, Submitters did not consider that New IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 3 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Zealand should adopt a DMT for foreign headquartered multinationals operating in New Zealand, but did not provide a rationale. • Interaction with imputation regime Most submitters argued that GloBE top-up tax paid by New Zealand MNEs should give rise to imputation credits in the same way as ordinary corporate income tax. This was on the basis that the purpose of the imputation system is to avoid double taxation of income by New Zealand, and that imputation credits will very rarely reduce the ETR on distributed income below the 15% level (since very few shareholders who can claim imputation credits are on a rate below 15%). This seemed to be the issue submitters felt most strongly about. Officials’ recommendations Whether or not to adopt GloBE rules 9. In line with submitters, officials recommend that New Zealand should implement the GloBE rules, if a critical mass 1 of other countries does so. The recommendation is for two reasons. 10. First, as noted by submitters, it will be better both for New Zealand as a whole and New Zealand MNEs if that tax is collected by New Zealand and not other countries. 11. The second reason for our recommendation is that adopting GloBE rules aligns with New Zealand’s goals around strengthening and adapting the international tax system in response to the challenges posed by increasing globalisation and digitalisation of the economy. MNEs are currently incentivised to shift as much of their profits as possible out of high tax jurisdictions and into low tax ones. This is particularly an issue for income derived from intangible assets, as those assets and associated income are easily moveable across jurisdictions. 12. The global minimum tax is intended to reduce the benefit that MNEs get from shifting profits to low tax jurisdictions, as well as reduce the incentive for countries to use tax competition to attract foreign capital. Both of these impacts will help to reduce the incentive for MNEs that are operating here to shift profits out of New Zealand and into a low tax jurisdiction. 13. Implementing Pillar Two will also be a strong signal that New Zealand is taking active steps to ensure that large MNEs pay a fairer amount of tax. If implemented by a critical mass of other countries, the GloBE rules will prevent MNEs from being able to manipulate the existing international tax rules to pay little tax on much of their global income. This can be expected to improve social capital and public trust in the tax system by at least partially addressing public concerns that large MNEs are not paying a fair share of tax globally. Other recommendations 14. Officials’ recommendations on the other significant points are as follows: • Timing o In order to ensure the legislation is ready to go but not effective unless and until other countries’ rules are also effective, we recommend that it be enacted with an effective date to be determined by order in council. 1 Officials generally agree with the list of critical countries proposed by submitters, though note that failure by one of those countries is unlikely to be critical. IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 4 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] o It seems likely that other countries’ DMTs and IIRs will apply for income years beginning on or after 1 January 2024, but their UTPRs may apply from a year later. If so, this would give New Zealand a choice of dates for implementation. Going later will delay the date when the proposal generates tax revenue for New Zealand, but will also give New Zealand MNEs more time to prepare for application of the rules, which would likely be favourably received by them. o Of course, the order-in-council trigger also means that even once the rules are enacted, the Government retains discretion not to make GloBE rules effective in New Zealand, even if a critical mass of other countries does adopt them. • Safe harbours and simplifications Officials are engaged at an OECD level on this issue, and are advocating for rules that are sensible and pragmatic, but do not allow the objectives of the GloBE rules to be significantly undercut. The rules adopted by the OECD should be replicated in our domestic incorporation, but there is no scope for New Zealand to adopt more generous safe harbours or simplifications, as that would run the risk of New Zealand rules being non-qualifying. • Effect of Foreign Investor Tax Credits (FITCs) on the ETR Officials’ view is that when a company reduces its corporate income tax payable by claiming, under the FITC regime, a credit for non-resident withholding tax it pays on dividends to foreign shareholders, that must be reflected by a reduced ETR. To do otherwise would call into question the foreign shareholders’ ability to claim a credit for the withholding tax. • Implementation of UTPR as a separate tax rather than a deduction denial Officials recommend that this rule is not implemented by way of denying deductions for expenditure, but as a separate tax, just like the tax payable under the IIR. This will be administratively simpler and more effective. • Mode of incorporation o Officials intend to pursue incorporation of the rules by referring to the OECD Model Rules and associated documents so far as possible. o Contrary to most submissions, officials also recommend that amendments to the GloBE rules made at the OECD level are automatically incorporated into New Zealand law for the year following amendment. This will be the most cost-effective approach to ensuring New Zealand’s rules are the same as those in other countries. It will not prevent New Zealand enacting legislation to over-ride future OECD level amendments if it wishes to do so. This approach is likely to be opposed by submitters, who will make constitutional objections to it. • Domestic minimum tax In line with submissions, officials recommend a DMT for New Zealand MNEs but not foreign headquartered. • Interaction with imputation regime Contrary to submissions, officials recommend that tax paid under the GloBE rules does not give rise to an imputation credit. Giving an imputation credit would mean the tax would not be recognised by other countries, and New IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 5 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Zealand MNEs would be subject to GloBE top-up tax in those countries. This recommendation is not expected to give rise to significant tax consequences for any MNE, given the small amount of tax expected to be paid, and the rule allowing taxed profit to be distributed before untaxed profit Despite this, we expect strong criticism from the private sector for adopting this approach. Officials propose to discuss with the OECD whether it would be acceptable for an imputation credit to be given for tax paid under the DMT. • No deduction or foreign tax credit for GloBE taxes paid to other countries Because GloBE taxes are taxes of last resort, they should not give rise to a tax credit or a deduction under any other tax systems. While a deduction is already denied for foreign income taxes, New Zealand law does provide for a credit for foreign income taxes, so a law change will be needed to exclude GloBE taxes from this rule. This will need to include additional income tax paid in another country as a result of that country’s UTPR applying to deny deductions. Fiscal Implications 15. Our initial modelling, aided by the OECD’s global economic impact assessments indicate that the GloBE rules proposals will raise a modest amount of revenue. There are a high number of assumptions in this model, as it depends on the final rules (in particular safe harbours), how and which countries implement Pillar Two and the behavioural response of MNEs. 16. Our forecast estimate of GloBE top-up tax revenue from New Zealand adoption is approximately $25 million per annum made up of: • $25 million per annum from GloBE top-up tax from applying the IIR to New Zealand MNEs. This amount makes allowance for the possibility of other countries increasing their tax rates in response to Pillar Two to reduce the amount of top-up tax collected by us. We expect this revenue to increase over time as transitional concessions are unwound. • A further positive amount from the UTPR and the DMT, however it is not possible to estimate how much this will be. 17. Officials have also estimated that the adoption of GloBE rules by other countries is likely to lead to increased income tax revenue for New Zealand from New Zealand MNEs of approximately $16 million per annum due to reduced profit shifting. 18. From a cost perspective, the build and ongoing administration costs for Inland Revenue are dependent on the final design aspects, but have been provisionally estimated at $10.9 million, to deliver the GloBE rules and $5.1 million to deliver the associated Country-by -Country reporting change. We are preparing a separate briefing note that will bring together the funding requirements and funding options for all of the OECD driven initiatives. Consultation 19. The recommendations in this report follow public consultation and consideration of submissions from Air New Zealand, CAANZ, Cantin Consulting, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, Fonterra, KPMG, PwC, New Zealand Law Society, Tax Justice Aotearoa and an individual submitter.

Pillars One and Two are the second phase of the BEPS (“base erosion and profit shifting”) tax reform project launched by the OECD and G20 in 2013. 23. The Pillar Two GloBE rules are often referred to as the global minimum tax, as they seek to ensure that large MNEs pay tax at a rate of at least 15% on their mobile profits 2 in every country where those profits are earned. This is achieved by requiring MNEs to calculate their effective tax rate (ETR) in every country where they operate. The ETR is essentially accounting tax expense divided by accounting net income. If the ETR in a country is below 15%, then the countries that adopt GloBE rules will impose a top up tax, on MNE members in their country, to bring the rate on the low tax income up to 15%. Generally this top up tax will be imposed on MNE members outside the country where the low tax income arises. 24. In October 2021 136 members of the Inclusive Framework, including New Zealand, endorsed a high-level statement detailing the key building blocks for Pillar One and Pillar Two. In December 2021 the OECD released the GloBE Model Rules followed in March 2022 by detailed commentary to the rules. Administrative guidance is expected to be published by the OECD during 2022/23 with the rules expected to be effective in participating countries in 2024 (possibly the UTPR will be effective a year later). 25. The rules have two elements: 25.1 Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) which applies on a top-down basis, giving the ultimate parent entity (UPE) jurisdiction or an intermediate parent jurisdiction (if no UPE or intermediate parent further up the corporate chain has adopted the GloBE rules) the right to collect GloBE top-up tax for the MNE’s group entities that are below it in the corporate chain. 25.2 Under-Taxed Profits Rule (UTPR) which applies as a back-up to the IIR. The UTPR allocates GloBE top-up tax to participating countries in proportion to the group’s payroll costs and tangible asset values in each participating country. 26. The GloBE rules also allow a country to introduce a Domestic Minimum Tax (DMT) which applies the rules to income earned in the country. It gives a country priority in respect of domestic income over the IIR and UTPR, so that a country can collect the tax on any undertaxed mobile profits earned there. 27. If a country adopts the GloBE rules, it needs to adopt an IIR and UTPR that align with the OECD’s Model Rules, commentary and the (yet to be released) administrative guidance. Adopting a DMT is optional. Where a country departs from the Model R ules, there is a risk that its GloBE rules will not be “qualifying” and participating jurisdictions will continue to apply GloBE top-up tax to the country’ s in-scope MNEs. 28. We reported to you on 18 March 2022 seeking permission to consult publicly on whether and how New Zealand should implement the GloBE rules. This approval was given, and an officials’ issues paper was released for consultation in May 2022. 2 Mobile profit (called excess profit in the OECD documents) for a year is profit in excess of a percentage return on in-country tangible assets and payroll expense. The percentage return starts at 8% and 10% respectively and declines to 5% over 10 years. IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 10 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Officials’ issues paper 29. The officials’ issues paper sought feedback on whether, if GloBE rules are implemented by a critical mass of other countries, New Zealand should also implement them, and how to do so. The issues paper sought feedback on: 29.1 Whether there are any issues with the Model Rules including scope, calculating a taxpayer’s ETR and calculating top up tax. 29.2 Effective transitional, simplification and safe harbour measures. 29.3 The mode of implementation in New Zealand including whether the GloBE rules should be rewritten into New Zealand law or if the tax acts should incorporate the rules by reference to the OECD documents. 29.4 Tax administrative matters. 29.5 Implementation of the UTPR as a deduction denial or tax charge. 29.6 Whether a DMT should be adopted in New Zealand. 29.7 Interaction of the GloBE rules with New Zealand rules including the imputation and foreign investor tax credit (FITC) regimes. 30. 11 submissions were received on the issues paper. These submissions came from Air New Zealand, CAANZ, Cantin Consulting, the Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, Fonterra, KPMG, the New Zealand Law Society, PwC, Tax Justice Aotearoa and an individual. 31. Submissions are summarised below, divided by topic. For each topic there is a brief description of the issue, a summary of submissions received and officials’ response. Submissions received and officials’ response Should New Zealand adopt GloBE rules? Issue 32. Should New Zealand adopt GloBE rules if a “critical mass” of other countries adopts them? 32.1 Why or why not 32.2 If so, what is considered a “critical mass” 32.3 If so, when should New Zealand adopt the rules Submissions received Whether New Zealand should adopt GloBE rules 33. Submitters generally supported New Zealand adopting the GloBE rules if a critical mass of other countries does s o, on the basis that: 33.1 it is in New Zealand’s interests to adopt GloBE rules as the goal of the rules, to disincentivise profit shifting by MNEs, aligns with the Government’s priorities. Submitters also ac knowledged that the Government made a clear political commitment to the BEPS process and that it’s important to New Zealand’s international reputation that it is seen to be doing its part. 33.2 the operation of the rules means that were New Zealand not to adopt GloBE rules, but a critical mass of countries does adopt, taxpayers would incur the IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 11 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] compliance costs regardless and there is a risk of tax leakage to other jurisdictions. 33.3 adopting GloBE rules in New Zealand would streamline and simplify compliance for in-scope New Zealand businesses making it easier for them to pay top up tax once in New Zealand as opposed to paying tax under the UTPR to a number of other countries. There was a general preference for in- scope taxpayers to deal with Inland Revenue rather than other tax authorities. 34. Submitters were concerned about the potential for onerous compliance obligations arising from the GloBE rules compared to the tax revenue expected to be generated for New Zealand and given that New Zealand taxpayers weren’t the focus of the rules, since New Zealand has a high corporate tax rate and robust international tax settings. 34.1 KPMG said New Zealand based multinationals generally do not have the operating model attributes the GloBE rules are designed to target. In particular, New Zealand headquartered businesses will often prefer to hold their intellectual property and pay their corporate income tax in New Zealand due to for example the imputation credit regime. 34.2 Air New Zealand considered it likely that across New Zealand companies, the cost of complying with the GloBE rules will be more than the combined tax take. 35. Submitters suggested these concerns could be dealt with by : 35.1 Implementing the minimum requirements only and using any appropriate safe harbours or simplification measures made available. 35.2 Ensuring appropriate adaptation to existing New Zealand tax policy settings such that the GloBE rules work within New Zealand’s existing tax/fiscal preferences and settings. Officials’ views 36. Officials agree with submitters that if a critical mass of other countries adopt the GloBE rules, New Zealand should also adopt them. 37. On the basis that New Zealand MNEs are not generally earning significant amounts of low tax mobile income, officials expect that they will be able to use the safe harbours currently under development by the OECD to minimise the cost of compliance with the rules. 38. With respect to Air New Zealand’s comment that the cost of compliance with the GloBE rules will outweigh the revenue generated for New Zealand, this does not seem relevant to New Zealand’s decision, since those costs will have to be incurred in any case by virtue of other countries imposing GloBE rules. 39. Officials agree that implementing Pillar Two aligns with New Zealand’s goals around strengthening and adapting the international tax system in response to the challenges posed by increasing globalisation and digitalisation of the economy. There has been a long-standing issue with the current international tax framework whereby firms that operate in multiple countries are able to exploit low tax rates available in some countries by shifting income into those countries. 40. This is particularly an issue for income derived from intangible assets, as those assets and associated income are easily moveable across jurisdictions. The growth of intangibles, like patents and copyright, means that large portions of MNE profits are able to face little to no taxation. This is further exacerbated by the fact that IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 12 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] many countries are engaged in tax competition to incentivise MNEs to locate these intangibles in their jurisdiction. 41. The primary purpose of Pillar Two is to reduce the incentive for large MNEs to shift profits to low tax jurisdictions. If multinationals know they will have to pay tax of at least 15% on their mobile income, even if that income is derived from activities in a country with a tax rate substantially lower than 15%, they will be less likely to structure their activities so that most of their income is located in low-tax jurisdictions. While there will continue to be an incentive for MNEs to move profits to countries with a tax rate of at most 15% and away from countries with a higher tax rate, this incentive will be weaker than the current incentive that MNEs face to move their profits to countries that will impose a tax rate much lower than 15%. 42. Adopting Pillar Two will also be a strong signal that New Zealand is taking active steps to ensure that large MNEs pay a fairer amount of tax. While Pillar Two will not address the issue of MNEs not paying an appropriate amount of tax in market jurisdictions, if implemented by a critical mass of other countries it will prevent MNEs from being able to manipulate the existing international tax rules to pay little tax on much of their global income. This is likely to improve social capital and public trust in the tax system by at least partially addressing public concerns that large MNEs are not paying a fair share of tax. 43. By implementing these rules, New Zealand would be playing its part in a reform which goes a considerable way towards addressing MNE tax planning, by significantly reducing the tax benefit that MNEs can obtain by shifting income between countries. New Zealand has been consistent in the past in promoting strong international tax rules around profit shifting and base erosion (for example, the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018), and Pillar Two can be considered an extension of these rules. 44. In addition, there will be long-term benefits to New Zealand if Pillar Two is successful in stopping the global trend of decreasing corporate tax rates. While Pillar Two does contain a carve-out for income derived from “real” activities, limiting the incentive for countries to offer tax rates of lower than 15% on mobile income will substantially reduce the scope for tax competition between countries. What is a critical mass 45. Submitters said that the critical mass of countries was Australia, China, the European Union, Japan and the United Kingdom. Officials’ views 46. Having analysed the activities of New Zealand MNEs, officials’ view is that if the GloBE rules are adopted by Australia, the UK and the countries of the European Union, that would be sufficient to ensure that New Zealand MNEs (with one exception) would be subject to an effective UTPR if New Zealand did not impose GloBE top-up tax under an IIR. Officials therefore would exclude China and Japan from the necessary critical mass. Timing 47. Submitters’ general view was that New Zealand should not be an early adopter as this would compromise the long-term success and sustainability of the regime and put New Zealand businesses at a competitive disadvantage. 48. Submitters highlighted the previous experience with BEPS 1.0 as demonstrating the lack of consistency in implementation dates by participating jurisdictions. 49. Submitters considered that New Zealand should defer the implementation until: IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 13 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 49.1 it becomes apparent with a high degree of certainty that other jurisdictions, particularly our key economic partners, will implement the rules 49.2 there is certainty that another country’s UTPR will apply to tax a New Zealand MNE’s profits 49.3 Australia has adopted them, so we can learn from their experience 50. Given the modest amount of revenue for New Zealand, submitters considered that minimising compliance costs should inform the timing of New Zealand implementation of the GloBE rules. Officials’ views 51. Officials agree with submitters that New Zealand should not impose tax under the GloBE rules before other countries impose an IIR. There is also an argument for not imposing tax until other countries’ UTPRs are in force, since it is only at that point that Pillar Two becomes inescapable. Now that introduction of the IIR has been deferred to 2024, it is not clear whether there will in fact be any lag between the implementation of these two rules. 52. Officials propose that when legislation for the GloBE rules is prepared, it will provide for an effective date to be determined by order in council, so that the legislation can be enacted and ready to go, but not made effective until other countries have in fact made their rules (either the IIR or the IIR and UTPR) effective. Whether the revenue threshold for New Zealand’s GloBE rules should match the OECD’s Issue 53. Should the revenue threshold for New Zealand’s GloBE rules match the OECD’s €750M? 53.1 If so, why or why not? 53.2 If you think New Zealand should use an alternative domestic threshold, what should the threshold be based on and why? 53.3 Are there any difficulties in adopting a Euro threshold? Submissions received Alternative domestic threshold 54. Submitters unanimously agreed that New Zealand should follow the OECD threshold. There were concerns that if New Zealand departs from this it might: • Create a disproportionate compliance burden for smaller MNEs who may not be resourced to comply with such a tax • Create undue compliance costs because MNEs below the threshold would not be subject to Country-by -Country Reporting (CbCR) 3 • Remove the benefit of any CbCR safe harbours which may be introduced as smaller MNEs are not in-scope for CbCR reporting. Use of Euro Threshold 3 Country by Country reporting requirements have been published by the OECD as part of an agreed international tax reform package addressing base erosion and profit shifting. CbCR applies to corporate groups headquartered in New Zealand with annual consolidated group revenue of over EUR 750 million. IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 14 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 55. Submitters unanimously agreed that a EUR threshold should be used to ensure consistency with the OECD, and alignment with CbCR. General comments 56. Submitters requested Officials request confirmation from the OECD that the GloBE and CbCR threshold will be the same, or where different, further guidance is provided. As an example, CbCR guidance suggests that extraordinary income or gains from investment activity should be included in applying the CbCR threshold. However, such items may not constitute revenue for IFRS accounting purposes. 57. KPMG requested officials request an Indigenous E ntities exclusion, in particular, that we push for Māori Authorities to be excluded from the scope of the GloBE rules due to lower tax rate being attributable to underlying policy settings, not tax competition. Māori Authorities are currently subject to a tax rate in New Zealand of 17.5%, 2.5% above the GloBE minimum rate. They recognised that there are currently no Māori Authorities that are even close to being in scope of Pillar Two. Officials’ response 58. Officials: • agree with submitters that New Zealand should adopt the OECD threshold of €750M • will follow up with the OECD to ensure that the revenue thresholds for CbCR and the GloBE rules use the same measure of revenue • do not think that it would be worthwhile seeking an indigenous entities exclusion at this point in time, given that this is not and may never be a pressing issue, that Māori Authorities are currently taxed above the minimum rate, and that there is no general pressure in the OECD for such an exclusion. Issues identified with the Model Rules Submissions received 59. Few submissions addressed the substantive questions of whether there were any issues in the GloBE model rules themselves, acknowledging that the rules had been accepted by the Inclusive Framework and any adoption of the GloBE rules in New Zealand should follow the Model Rules as closely as possible to ensure they remain qualifying. 60. With respect to the application of the rules to foreign investor tax credits (FITCs) 4 provided to companies that pay supplementary dividends: 60.1 Submitters considered that no adjustment for FITCs should be required as they are not a reduction in tax payable at the corporate level 60.2 Submitters considered the objective of the FITC regime to be limiting New Zealand income tax on foreign portfolio investors to the prevailing tax rate for New Zealand companies by compensating such investors for the cost of 4 FITCs are the way that we ensure that the New Zealand tax paid by foreign portfolio (less than 10%) investors in New Zealand companies does not exceed 28%. For example, the company pays tax on $100 income at 28%. Subsequent distribution of the remaining $72 to the non-resident shareholder triggers a $12.70 tax credit (FITC) to the company, so its net tax payable is only $15.30. The company is required to distribute this credit to the shareholder as a supplementary dividend. Non-resident withholding tax on the dividend and supplementary divided is $12.70. The purpose is to ensure the shareholder can claim a foreign tax credit for the non-resident withholding tax while limiting the total tax paid on the income (by both the company on derivation and the shareholder on distribution) to 28%. IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 15 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] the NRWT impost. The end result of the FITC rules is no reduction in corporate tax and this should be reflected in any GloBE rules enacted. 61. The other points raised on the Model Rules themselves were very technical (these points were mostly raised by the Corporate Taxpayers Group and KPMG). Some of the points highlighted areas where further guidance on the Model Rules would be useful and others questioned some of the technical features of the rules from a policy perspective but did not go as far as identifying flaws that need fixing. Officials’ recommendation 62. Officials do not agree with the treatment proposed by submitters for FITCs. Submitters are correct to say that the purpose of the FITC regime is to ensure that the total tax rate imposed on the income of foreign portfolio investors in New Zealand companies is no more than the corporate rate. The more telling point is that this is achieved by way of imposing a reduced rate of corporate income tax plus non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) for distributions of that income. The integrity of the FITC regime requires that the NRWT is a real tax imposed on the shareholder. This would be called into question if the GloBE rules treated the company as having paid both the (reduced) corporate income tax and the shareholder level NRWT. Officials also note that the GloBE Model Rules specifically provide for the inclusion of only the FITC-reduced tax amount in the ETR calculation. 63. Officials plan to raise the technical points on the Model Rules themselves with the OECD as appropriate and, where needed, will advocate for clarifications from the OECD by way of administrative guidance (or develop guidance as part of the implementation process). Simplification and safe harbour measures Issue 64. Are there any simplifications that could be introduced to simplify the effective tax rate calculation? 65. What do submitters think of a safe harbour based on CbCR data? Submissions Simplification 66. Submitters generally focused on reducing the need for detailed calculations to determine whether a taxpayer is actually in scope of the Pillar Two rules and ensuring any calculations are based on existing data. 67. In acknowledging there would be a trade-off between accuracy and simplicity, a submitter proposed a simplified calculation based on adjustments arising from only the most significant items including dividends/gains and losses on non-portfolio and equity accounted interests as well as tax losses. Safe harbours 68. Submitters generally supported the introduction of a safe harbour based on country- by -country reporting (CbCR) with a higher tax rate to avoid making numerous adjustments. Officials’ response 69. Officials are continuing to engage with the OECD in the development of effective safe harbours, and will advance the submitters’ ideas as appropriate. IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 16 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Mode of implementation in New Zealand Issue 70. If adopted, a decision will need to be made on how to incorporate the GloBE Model Rules into New Zealand legislation. In particular, do we: 70.1 Rewrite the OECD’s Model Rules into New Zealand legislation (i.e., the Income Tax Act 2007) in full, with limited adaptation for New Zealand- specific concepts (‘repetition’), or 70.2 Draft legislation which so far as possible refers to, rather than repeats, the Model Rules and other dispositive documents (‘incorporation by reference’). 71. In addition, New Zealand will also need to decide how to adapt any changes to the Model Rules by the OECD into New Zealand law, in particular, do we: 71.1 Allow any changes adopted at the OECD level to automatically be incorporated into New Zealand law (‘ambulatory’), or 71.2 Require any changes made to be adopted into New Zealand law before becoming effective (‘static’). 72. These OECD-level changes may be made by way of changes to the Model Rules themselves or (more likely) by changes to the Commentary or Administrative Guidance, which have the effect of over-riding the Model Rules. Already there is some language in the Commentary which seems intended to take priority over the Model Rules. Submissions received 73. Submissions on both questions were mixed. Submitters generally favoured repetition over incorporation by reference. 74. The most common arguments in favour of repetition were that: 74.1 the process of writing the rules into New Zealand legislation would force officials to consider the New Zealand-specific issues with implementing the rules, and design legislation to deal with these appropriately. Submitters were concerned that incorporating by reference would mean New Zealand specific issues would only be considered once they created practical problems for taxpayers post-implementation. 74.2 There is a clear distinction between the automatic exchange of information rules ( where incorporation by reference is common) and the GloBE rules in that the GloBE rules create a taxing charge. As such, they needed to be housed in the Income Tax Act, not by reference to extrinsic material that the New Zealand government cannot guarantee will be readily available. 75. KMPG and CTG favoured using repetition assisted by reference to OECD materials for greater detail/aiding interpretation. 76. EY favoured using modified repetition to ensure consistency with New Zealand drafting principles. They gave as an example the fact that New Zealand drafting conventions allow for the use of flow-charts and other aids to assist comprehension and simplify complex concepts, which might be useful in relation to the GloBE rules. 77. Submissions favouring incorporation by reference highlighted the amount of drafting that would be required under an incorporation by repetition approach (considering rewriting the rules will add hundreds of pages to the Income Tax Act 2007), ensuring our rules are consistent with other jurisdictions and allowing for simpler future amendments to the rules. IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 17 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 77.1 NZLS highlighted that one of the main benefits of incorporating by reference was having globally consistent legislation but acknowledged that this could easily be negated if other jurisdictions opt for a repetition approach and heavily adapt the rules to their local circumstances. 77.2 PwC were concerned that adoption by repetition directly into legislation risks missing some of the intricacies of the rules and increases the risk of the rules being interpreted differently. They suggested Inland Revenue produce a New Zealand version of the GloBE rules commentary to demonstrate officials had considered New Zealand-specific issues arising from implementation. KPMG considered that any risks from inaccuracy arising from incorporation by repetition could be dealt with by having the OECD undertake a detailed peer review of the New Zealand rules. 78. Submissions on how to update New Zealand legislation in response to any future changes by the OECD were generally in favour of a static approach, where amendments would not automatically be incorporated into New Zealand law. While some submitters appeared to conflate a static approach with repetition, submitters stressed the need for New Zealand to retain its sovereignty in tax matters and ensure any changes made at the OECD are subject to close scrutiny by New Zealand legislators before being incorporated into law. 79. Submitting in favour of an ambulatory approach, PwC highlighted the need for New Zealand to remain aligned with the globally agreed position. They accepted the risk of a loss of sovereignty but suggested this could be countered by Inland Revenue closely monitoring changes made at the OECD and carving out undesirable OECD amendments and pointed to previous hybrids changes as an example of successful ambulatory legislation. 80. General comments included a desire for the policy process to follow the generic tax policy process. Submitters expressed dissatisfaction with the implementation of previous OECD initiatives, where they felt the drafting of legislation had been rushed and resulted in poorer quality law which created issues for taxpayers’ post- implementation. The desirability of reducing compliance costs by ensuring ou r rules will be interpreted consistently with the global standard was noted several times. Finally, almost all submitters agreed that whatever form of legislation is adopted should be included in the Income Tax Act 2007 rather than a separate Act, and almost all agreed the rules should be contained in their own part or part for ease of reference. Officials’ recommendation 81. Officials believe that in the interests of limiting the amount of policy and legislative drafting resource required, as well as ensuring our GloBE rules are qualifying and enhancing the likelihood that the rules will be the same in New Zealand as they are elsewhere, an incorporation by reference approach should continue to be explored in preference to incorporation by repetition. This will certainly involve ensuring taxpayers who are subject to the rules are able to access the OECD documents. Since these taxpayers and their advisers are the most well resourced and sophisticated, this should not be difficult. Flow charts and diagrams could be incorporated in the explanatory material that will accompany the legislation when it becomes effective. 82. Officials also believe that it would be desirable for changes to the OECD documents to be automatically incorporated into New Zealand law, at least for periods beginning after those changes are made. Again, that will reduce the burden of Pillar Two on the New Zealand tax legislative process and maximise the likelihood of cross-country consistency and of our rules being qualifying. It will involve no substantive loss of sovereignty, since Parliament can always enact law declaring that a change made at OECD level should not have effect in New Zealand (though the reasons for doing so are not obvious). IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 18 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Undertaxed profits rule Issue 83. The undertaxed profits rule (UTPR) is a backstop to the IIR and aims to ensure that top-up tax is paid even if an MNE group member is not directly or indirectly owned by a higher tier group member subject to a qualified IIR. The Model Rules do not prescribe how tax allocated to a jurisdiction by the UTPR should be brought to charge. This is left to individual jurisdictions. 84. Submitters were asked for their preference between two possible methods of charging the UTPR: • Denying income tax deductions on otherwise deductible expenses of the MNE group; or • Treating the GloBE calculation and any resulting tax liability as a separate tax liability independent of income tax (for both the UTPR and IIR). 85. Officials stated a preference for a separate tax liability in the issues paper. This is because: • It would be simpler to administer • It would avoid complex flow-on effects to other types of taxes which denying deductions would create, a nd • Denying a deduction will not result in an additional cash tax expense when the relevant New Zealand entity is in a loss position. Submissions received 86. Four submitters commented on this issue, and views were split evenly. Tax Justice Aotearoa and PwC favoured a separate tax liability for the same reasons as officials. 87. KPMG and CTG favoured denying deductions. CTG argued this was more consistent with the understood purpose of the UTPR to deny deductions for payments that are undertaxed to the payee, and that concerns regarding administrative complexity were overstated given other regimes exist which can deny deductions for income tax purposes. 88. Both submitters disagreed that denying deductions for a loss-making business would not create an additional cash tax expense, on the basis that this disregards the economic value of tax losses which can be carried forward or offset. 89. In general comments, both KPMG and CTG also submitted that because of the complexity involved and the relative flexibility the OECD has afforded countries to design their own UTPRs, New Zealand should conduct a separate consultation on the UTPR itself if New Zealand opts to adopt the GloBE rules. Officials’ recommendation 90. Officials recommend that the UTPR is implemented as a separate stand alone tax rather than denial of a deduction which would increase taxable income (or reduce losses). This is the simpler option. It is also completely consistent with the purpose of the UTPR. Initially the UTPR did attempt to impose tax only where the payee was undertaxed, but it now operates simply as a back-up to the IIR, allocating top- up tax to countries on a basis of the MNE’s relative physical substance in each country. Officials do not agree that reducing losses that may be used in the future or may expire unused is the same as imposing a current cash tax liability. They also note that the income giving rise to the current cash tax liability will in most IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 19 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] cases be income arising in another country. There is no reason to allow the liability for tax on that income to be offset against New Zealand tax losses. Tax administration impacts Issue 91. Several questions were put to submitters regarding how Inland Revenue should administer the GloBE rules in New Zealand. Questions covered practical concerns such as the format for returns, the desirability of aligning the country by country reporting with the GloBE information return, filing dates and the penalty for late or non-compliance. Submissions received 92. Few submissions addressed this section, of those that did, the submissions largely related to the penalties suggested and the format for submission: 92.1 CTG and PwC both consider the late filing penalty should be low. CTG suggested that Inland Revenue utilise the existing penalty available in section 139AB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (a maximum of $100,000) for a member of a large multinational group who fails to provide information when requested to do so under section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. P wC suggested the Commissioner be given power to serve notice of a penalty prior to enforcement, to provide the taxpayer time to remedy their late filing/payment. 92.2 PwC agreed with officials’ that an XML electronic format would be appropriate for both the GloBE return and the country by country reporting, and that (subject to the New Zealand return not requiring any further information than the GloBE return) a New Zealand filing date of one month after the GloBE return deadline is appropriate. PwC also submitted the payment date should be later than the filing date for the New Zealand GloBE return, to allow taxpayers time to coordinate funds, pointing out this was consistent with New Zealand’s terminal tax requirements. Officials’ response 93. Officials will continue to consult on the issue of penalties. Costing is being undertaken on the basis of an XML format report, which we propose will also be required for cou ntry by country reporting. Interaction with imputation Issue 94. New Zealand income tax paid by a New Zealand company gives rise to an imputation credit, which can be passed to the company’s shareholders when the company pays a dividend. Submitters were asked whether tax paid in New Zealand under the GloBE rules should give rise to an imputation credit. 95. In the issues paper Officials said that tax paid under the GloBE rules should not give rise to imputation credits, because: • Allowing them would unwind the effect of the IIR (which is to top up the amount of tax paid to a 15% rate) when income is distributed. • Allowing them would very likely mean New Zealand’s IIR would not meet the OECD’s requirements to be a ‘qualifying IIR”, meaning other countries UTPR’s would apply to New Zealand-headquartered MNEs. IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 20 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • The imputation system is not set up to deal with tax imposed at a rate other than 28%. Submissions received 96. Almost all submitters considered the issue, with a clear pr eference for allowing imputation credits for GloBE taxes paid. Tax Justice Aotearoa supported denying imputation credits, but did not provide a reason for its view. This was the issue submitters in favour of allowing credits felt the most strongly about. 97. Several arguments for allowing imputation credits were submitted, with some appearing in most submissions: 97.1 Doing so would not unwind the IIR or disqualify New Zealand’s IIR • The model rules have been designed for the classical tax systems in use in most of the rest of the world, not the imputation system used by New Zealand. Allowing imputation credits does not defeat the IIR, but merely equalises its effect to what will apply in other jurisdictions. Imputation is purely a means to ensure there is not double taxation, it is not a benefit, it achieves the same outcome as a jurisdiction with an exemption on dividend income (i.e. one level of tax). • Imputation credits relieve double taxation at the shareholder level – they do not refund tax at the corporate level and will therefore not concern the OECD or unwind the effect of GloBE top-up tax. The OECD’s concern is to prevent countries from implementing GloBE rules whilst at the same time creating new corporate tax kickbacks which are designed to undermine their effect. • Analysing the language of the Model Rules and Commentary shows that allowing imputation credits for IIR tax would not disqualify New Zealand’s IIR. Even if this may be the case, Officials should advocate at the OECD for New Zealand’s imputation system to be permissible, and only deny them if compelled to by the OECD. 97.2 Denying credits would be contrary to core New Zealand tax principles by subjecting New Zealand taxpayers to economic double taxation • Most submitters argued that preventing double taxation is a fundamental principle of New Zealand’s tax system, and imputation credits are a means of achieving this. To disallow credits would undermine this principle and impose double taxation on affected taxpayers thereby making New Zealand companies less competitive. • Tax imposed under the IIR is a New Zealand tax, it benefits the New Zealand economy and is available for New Zealand to spend on services in New Zealand. 98. Submitters argued that GloBE top-up taxes are not conceptually different from CFC taxes: 98.1 Officials stated in the issues paper that GloBE tax can be distinguished conceptually from CFC taxes (where imputation is allowed), and this negates the argument that similar treatment should apply. Several submitters disagreed with this distinction, arguing GloBE taxes should instead be viewed as an extension of the CFC rules and therefore also be allowed credits. 99. Submitters argued that the imputation system did not need to be modified to deal with tax rates other than 28%. IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 21 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 99.1 Several submitters disagreed with officials’ view that allowing credits would create additional complexity. CAANZ, KPMG and CTG submitted the concerns of officials were unfounded, as the imputation system does not require sources of income to be tracked, income from FIF interests is in effect not taxed at 28% (due to the fair dividend rate income calculation) and partially imputed dividends are effectively taxed at a rate other than 28%. 100. Submitters argued that disallowing imputation credits on GloBE income would lead to unfair and inconsistent treatment when compared to other countries 100.1 Several submitters said that by comparison with Australia, New Zealand denying imputation credits for IIR tax would be unfair. Fonterra gave the example of a New Zealand MNE which earns a large untaxed capital gain in another country. This untaxed gain could give rise to IIR tax in New Zealand but no imputation credits under officials’ proposals. If the same gain were earned by an Australian MNE, the Australian CFC rules would tax the gain, giving rise to franking credits for the Australian company which could be passed on to its shareholders. Accordingly shareholders in the New Zealand MNE would be taxed more harshly on the same type of gain than the shareholders in the Australian MNE. Officials’ recommendation 101. For the reasons set out in paragraph 95 above, officials do not recommend allowing GloBE tax to give rise to an imputation credit. Unfortunately, there is a conflict between the objectives of imputation and the objectives of the GloBE rules. If tax paid under the GloBE rules gives rise to an imputation credit, the imposition of that tax is effectively reversed, through a reduction in the tax that would otherwise be paid by the shareholder. That would be an impermissible benefit, that would disqualify New Zealand’s IIR from recognition by other countries, and would thus expose New Zealand MNEs to other countries’ UTPRs. Officials expect that Australia will take the same approach, i .e. will not allow a franking credit for tax imposed under the GloBE rules. 102. Officials continue to believe that this outcome is of little practical significance, and no submitters have pointed to cases which would disprove that. Despite this, we expect some criticism from the private sector if the Government adopts our recommended approach. Domestic minimum tax Issue 103. The GloBE rules contemplate that countries may introduce a domestic minimum tax (DMT), which would use the same tax base as the GloBE rules but take priority over the IIR and UTPR in respect of low taxed income earned in that country. For New Zealand, this tax would be closely based on the GloBE rules but would apply to undertaxed profits in New Zealand. It would mean that New Zealand would collect all of the top-up tax on such profits, rather than sharing it with other countries with Pillar Two rules. 104. Submitters were asked whether New Zealand should adopt a DMT, whether it should apply only to New Zealand headquartered MNEs, and if so, how it should operate. Submissions received 105. Submitters favoured New Zealand adopting a DMT. CAANZ did not express a final view but said New Zealand should strongly consider a DMT if a if a critical mass of countries enact the GloBE rules and DMTs. 106. Tax Justice Aotearoa, which opposed a DMT, did not provide reasoning. Those in favour generally pointed to a preference for dealing with Inland Revenue rather IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 22 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] than overseas revenue authorities and the reduction in compliance costs this would mean for taxpayers. However, most of those in favour caveated that they would want a DMT to be defensive-only, that is, to apply only where another countries’ UTPR would otherwise apply. This logic also extended to the timing of introducing a DMT, where three submitters argued New Zealand’s DMT should only come into effect once other countries’ UTPRs are in force. 107. Four submitters stated that imputation credits should be allowed for taxes paid under a DMT, for the same reasons as outlined in the submissions on imputation credits generally. 108. KMPG and CTG both considered a DMT should apply only to New Zealand- headquartered firms. The primary reason was that the benefit of a DMT for New Zealand headquartered MNEs (simplification for taxpayers) would not apply to foreign-headquartered businesses . PwC thought it should apply to all in-scope businesses, and pointed to a need for detailed analysis of the proposed costs and revenues associated with expanding a DMT to overseas-headquartered firms. 109. Several submitters commented that the proposed introduction of a DMT should warrant its own consultation process before implementation, considering the complexity involved. Officials’ recommendation 110. In line with most of the submissions, officials recommend that the GloBE proposals be progressed on the basis that a DMT will be adopted for New Zealand headquartered MNEs. This will ensure that they do not need to pay tax under any other country’s UTPR. Officials will also raise with the OECD the possibility of allowing this tax to give rise to an imputation credit. Treatment of foreign GloBE taxes in determining New Zealand income tax liability Issue 111. Whether or not New Zealand adopts GloBE rules, if other countries do so, the status of GloBE tax for purposes of calculating New Zealand tax on foreign earnings will need to be dealt with. 112. Officials stated in the issues paper their view that the payment of foreign GloBE tax should not give rise to a tax credit or deduction in New Zealand. This was on the basis that allowing a deduction or credit for a top up tax would be illogical (as it would effectively neutralise the top up tax) and give rise to circularity problems. Submitters were asked if they agreed with this view. Submissions received 113. Only three submissions were received on this point. All three agreed with officials that there should be no tax credit or deduction allowed. Officials’ recommendation 114. In line with submissions, officials recommend that payment of GloBE taxes overseas by New Zealand companies does not give rise to a deduction or credit for New Zealand income tax purposes. Fiscal Implications 115. Our initial modelling, aided by the OECD’s global economic impact assessments (which continue to be updated) indicate that the GloBE rules proposals will raise revenue. It is noted that there are a high number of assumptions in this model, as IR2022/385; T2022/2037: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand Page 23 of 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] it is dependent on the final rules (in particular safe harbours), how and which countries implement GloBE rules and the behavioural response of MNEs. 116. Our forecast revenue estimate for GloBE rules in New Zealand is approximately $40-45 million per annum made up of: • $25 million per annum from GloBE top-up tax from applying the IIR to New Zealand MNEs. We expect this to increase over time as transitional concessions are unwound. • $16 million per annum from an increase in New Zealand income tax paid by New Zealand headquartered MNEs due to reduced profit shifting. This benefit arises whether or not New Zealand adopts GloBE rules itself. • It is expected that additional revenue could be raised through applying the UTPR to MNEs with substance in New Zealand and the DMT to New Zealand headquartered MNEs. It is also possible that additional revenue will be raised from foreign headquartered MNEs who have a reduced incentive to shift profits out of New Zealand. However it is not possible to estimate the amount of this revenue. 117. The first payments made by MNEs under the GloBE rules are not expected to be made until the 2026/27 fiscal year, assuming the rules come into force from 1 January 2024. It is unusual in a New Zealand context for income tax relating to a year not to be received at all until 16 months (in the initial year, 20 months) after the end of the year in which the income arises. The reason for the delay is the status of GloBE rules taxation as a taxation of last resort. It can only be determined after all other taxes are determined. In some countries, determination of income tax obligations may take a relatively long time. Administration cost 118. From a cost perspective, the build and ongoing administration costs are dependent on the final design aspects. We will provide further detail on this following the finalisation of the following areas: • The content of the GloBE information and tax returns a nd details of validations that will be stipulated for these returns • Whether New Zealand adopts the domestic minimum tax for foreign headquartered multinationals • Safe harbours and simplifications • Content of the Country by Country information exchange schema. 119. Our current estimate is that it will cost around $10.9 million to deliver the GloBE rules and $5.2 million to deliver the associated Country by Country reporting change. A separate briefing note will be prepared that will bring together the funding requirements and options for all of the OECD-driven initiatives 120. Given the 18 month delay between the effective date of the rules and the first date that a return will be required to be filed, it should be possible for most of the build and administration costs to be deferred until it is certain that New Zealand will (along with a critical mass of other countries) implement the rules. This will also be dealt with in the separate briefing note.

On 22 September Treasury and Inland Revenue officials presented the tax policy report “OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand – summary of consultation and officials’ recommendations” (the Tax Policy Report). You agreed with officials that New Zealand should enact GloBE rules and that the design and delivery follow the recommendations in the Tax Policy Report. 2. On 13 October Inland Revenue officials submitted a Cabinet paper to be referred to the Cabinet Office which covered the recommendations you agreed to in the Tax Policy Report. This paper noted that the funding of the build and ongoing administrative costs required by the GloBE initiative, as well as other international initiatives, had not been determined and we would modify this paper if any changes were necessary, prior to referral to the Cabinet Office. 3. The funding decisions for the international initiatives have now been considered by Inland Revenue and the Treasury and the Cabinet paper has been modified to request Cabinet approval for the one-off and ongoing administration costs for Vote Revenue, covering the GloBE rules and country by country reporting (CbCR). 4. CbCR costs are included as Pillar Two leverages off the existing reporting requirements under CbCR. This is done to minimise the additional compliance costs for in-scope entities. Inland Revenue will incorporate the current CbCR into START and streamline the process. This provides a sustainable solution to ensure Inland Revenue can meet its international obligations. Capacity constraints 5. Inland Revenue is committed to deliver the current policy initiatives agreed to by Cabinet including the ones in this paper. We have assessed that the Government’s current tax and social policy work programme will use up most of our specialist design and delivery capacity over the next three years. Upcoming proposals in the next two omnibus taxation bills are also absorbing these same resources. In addition, if the initiatives that Ministers are currently seeking advice on proceed this will put further pressure on this capacity and will require reprioritisation and/or rescheduling of the existing work programme. Any further reduction in Inland Revenue’s Budget 23 cost pressure bid will likely exacerbate this pressure. 6. Inland Revenue is undertaking work to try to reduce its capacity constraints and continually looking at whether a reprioritisation of Inland Revenue’s existing and future commitments will be required to enable delivery of any new policy initiatives, in this timeframe, including this one. This means Inland Revenue may be unable to deliver on policy options that Ministers have already agreed to or wish to progress. Inland Revenue will report back to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue on options to reprioritise if this becomes necessary. Globe updates OECD updated economic impact assessment 7. On 18 January 2023, the OECD presented an updated economic impact assessment for the GloBE rules. The OECD estimates that the GloBE rules will increase global corporate income tax by approximately 9% or US $220 billion. This is up from 6- In Confidence IR2022/466: Global Anti-Base Erosion Tax Rules – Cabinet approval Page 2 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7.5% or US $130-180 billion from the 2021 economic impact assessment. The rationale for the increase is: • Better data on global low-taxed profit • Increase in low-taxed profit over time • Modelling a consistent application of GloBE rules across jurisdictions 8. The New Zealand revenue estimate from GlobE remains unchanged from our previous analysis. This is because we used CbCR data to calculate the expected New Zealand revenue from GloBE, which provides a more accurate picture for New Zealand, whilst utilising the underlying assumptions the OECD used in its estimate. As these underlying assumptions have not changed in the updated economic impact assessment our revenue did not need to be revised. OECD release of further technical guidance on the GloBE rules 9. On 2 February 2023 the OECD released further technical guidance on the Pillar 2 GloBE rules. Of note for the government is further detail on the mechanics of the domestic minimum tax (DMT). The DMT is calculated using the GloBE rules, but only on local (in-country) profits. It has priority over the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) and the Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR). 1 10. The DMT guidance confirms that, if an in-scope MNE pays a DMT which gives rise to an imputation credit, this will not result in the DMT being non-qualifying. Consequently, for NZ MNEs whilst GloBE taxes paid under an IIR or UTPR will not give rise to an imputation credit, GloBE tax paid under the DMT will attract an imputation credit. Country updates 11. On 15 December 2022, the Council of the European Union reached unanimous agreement to implement Pillar Two. The EU Directive requires Member States to transpose the rules into domestic law by 31 December 2023. The Directive states the IIR will be effective for periods on or after 31 December 2023 and the UTPR on or after 31 December 2024. Recommendations 12. We recommend that you sign the attached Cabinet paper and refer it to the Cabinet Office. The Cabinet paper is consistent in all respects with the recommendations you agreed to in the Tax Policy Report. 13. The Cabinet paper needs to be lodged with the Cabinet Office by 10am on Thursday 2 March 2023 for consideration by the Cabinet Economic Development Committee on Wednesday 8 March 2023. 1 The IIR applies on a top-down basis, giving the ultimate parent entity country, or an intermediate parent entity country, the right to collect GloBE top-up tax where the income is earned, if it has not been taxed under a DMT. The UTPR is a back-up rule which allocates GloBE top-up tax in proportion to the group’s payroll costs and tangible asset values in each country with GloBE rules. This ensures that if the country where an MNE has its headquarters decides not to implement the GloBE rules, the MNE will still have to pay top-up tax if it operates in countries that have GloBE rules.

This report seeks joint agreement to additional decisions necessary for the introduction into Parliament of legislation giving full effect to the GloBE rules in New Zealand. Background 2. On 3 April, Cabinet agreed to: 2.1 adopt the OECD’s Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules in New Zealand once a critical mass of other countries do so; 2.2 incorporate the GloBE rules into New Zealand tax law by reference to the OECD Model Rules, commentary, and administrative guidance; and 2.3 delegate authority to the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue to make additional joint decisions on any policy and drafting issues arising as appropriate \[ CAB-23-MIN-0111 refers\]. 3. The GloBE rules ensure that multinational enterprises (MNEs) with annual revenues above €750 million are subject to tax of at least 15% on their mobile income, on a country-by -country basis. Where income in a country is subject to an effective tax rate (ETR) of less than 15% it will be subject to a ‘top-up tax’ . A top-up tax can be collected, in the following order, by either: 3.1 the country in which the MNE derived the relevant income, under a Domestic Minimum Tax (DMT); 3.2 the country in which the MNE is headquartered, or an intermediate parent is located, under an Income Inclusion rule (IIR); or 3.3 all countries that have adopted the rules in which the MNE has operations, under an Under-taxed Profits Rule (UTPR). 4. The OECD Model Rules were approved by the more than 130 countries in the OECD- led Inclusive Framework in December 2021, with detailed commentary released in March 2022 and further administrative guidance released in February 2023. If a country adopts the GloBE rules, it must adopt the OECD Model Rules, commentary, and administrative guidance to ensure they are applied consistently across countries. The GloBE rules are expected to be adopted by participating countries in 2023, effective from no earlier than 2024 (for DMTs and IIRs) and 2025 (for UTPRs). 5. Cabinet has agreed to incorporate the GloBE rules into legislation by reference to the OECD Model Rules, commentary, and administrative guidance, rather than by converting them into New Zealand legislation. This significantly reduces the administrative cost for government and increases the likelihood that our Gl oBE rules will be considered “qualifying”, meaning locally headquartered MNEs will be subject to New Zealand’s IIR and not be required to pay top-up tax in other jurisdictions.

Officials have identified the following areas for ministerial decisions in addition to those already made by Cabinet. GloBE Registration 7. Officials consider that a registration requirement for in-scope MNEs with operations in New Zealand, similar to the system used for GST, would significantly lower the administrative burden of the GloBE rules for IR. This would give us a defined and regularly updated population to monitor. 8. However, the exact scope of the rules will not be clear until safe harbour negotiations are finalised. To allow for flexibility as the regime develops, GloBE registration details would take an electronic form to be prescribed by the Commissioner. 9. We recommend MNEs be required to register with IR within six months of the end of the first income year in which they are in scope of New Zealand’s GloBE rules and to deregister with IR within six months of the end of the first year in which they are out of scope of New Zealand’s GloBE rules. Top-up tax return 10. The GloBE rules stipulate that in-scope MNEs must file GloBE information returns (GIRs) in jurisdictions in which they operate, which will contain the information required to calculate any top-up tax the MNE must pay. However, it is up to each jurisdiction to determine the rules for filing a tax return for the top-up tax. 11. Officials consider that all in-scope MNEs with operations in New Zealand should be required to file an annual top-up tax return in New Zealand. If they have no top-up tax liability, the return would simply be nil. This would ensure that they all make a conscious and affirmative statement regarding their New Zealand top-up tax position. 12. To allow for flexibility as the regime develops, the top-up tax return would take an electronic form to be prescribed by the Commissioner. We envisage a short return. GloBE penalties 13. The commentary on the GloBE rules states that jurisdictions should make penalties or sanctions for non-compliance with the GIR commensurate with penalties or sanctions in respect of other information return filing obligations in the jurisdiction. 14. Once the GloBE rules are incorporated, and if you agree to introduce a top-up tax return, penalties for not filing or late filing of a tax return (up to $500) and shortfall penalties (from 20% to 150% of a shortfall in a tax position) already in the Tax Administration Act can be amended to apply to top-up tax. However, we consider two new penalties are desirable. 15. Officials believe a penalty should apply where an in-scope MNE with operations in New Zealand does not register on a timely basis. The administrative burden for IR of keeping track of which MNEs are in scope would be prohibitive. If IR do es not know who is in scope of the rules it cannot apply the GloBE rules effectively. 16. We believe a penalty should also apply where an in-scope MNE with operations in New Zealand does not file a complete GIR on a timely basis. That is because IR cannot determine whether an MNE has a top-up tax liability without the information in the GIR. Moreover, with respect to a New Zealand-headquartered MNE, New IR2023/105: OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules – Additional decisions Page 3 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Zealand is obliged to exchange certain information with other jurisdictions in which the MNE operates, fifteen months after the end of the MNEs’ fiscal year. If a GIR is incomplete or filed late, we will be unable to fulfil our information exchange obligations. 17. We have found two examples of penalties in the TAA that could be considered commensurate for non-compliance with these obligations, on the basis that they also apply to large MNEs. Both are civil penalties of up to $100,000. The relatively high penalty reflects the size of the taxpayers affected. We therefore recommend introducing equivalent civil penalties of up to $100,000 where an in-scope MNE with operations in New Zealand: 17.1 does not complete GloBE registration on a timely basis; or 17.2 does not file a complete GIR on a timely basis. 18. We note that, in Australia, a “significant global entity” who does not file a tax return by the due date can be liable for a late filing penalty of between $111,000 and $555,000, depending on how overdue the return is. Country-by-Country Report penalty 19. The Country-by -Country Reporting rules were implemented in 2016 as part of the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan to help jurisdictions risk assess large MNEs primarily as to their compliance with transfer pricing rules. They require MNEs with a combined revenue of €750 million or more (the same population that is subject to the GloBE rules) to provide an annual report that breaks down key elements relevant to their transfer pricing policies by jurisdiction. The Country-by -Country Report (CbCR) is the forerunner to the GIR. In addition to continuing to be used for transfer pricing risk assessment, it will be used for transitional safe harbour calculations under the GloBE rules and is therefore also necessary for the effective administration of the rules. 20. Currently, there is no penalty under New Zealand law for not filing a CbCR. Officials expect future OECD peer reviews of our GloBE and CbCR rules to note this and recommend a penalty be introduced to incentivise compliance, particularly given the flow-on impact to other jurisdictions with whom we are obliged to exchange information collected in the CbCR. Given this, and the size of the in-scope taxpayers, officials recommend applying an up to $100,000 civil penalty to in-scope MNEs with operations in New Zealand who do not file a complete CbCR return on a timely basis. This aligns with the penalty recommended for the GIR. Domestic Income Inclusion Rule vs Domestic Minimum Tax (DMT) 21. On 3 April Cabinet agreed to our recommendation to introduce a DMT alongside the GloBE rules (which mandatorily include an IIR and a UTPR) \[CAB-23-MIN-0111 refers\]. In the Cabinet paper, we explained that the DMT would ensure that if a New Zealand-headquartered MNE had an effective tax rate of below 15% on its New Zealand income in a given year (e.g., because it makes an untaxed capital gain), New Zealand would collect the top up tax rather than another country. 22. Following recent work by the OECD, it is now clear that the tax we described as a DMT is better described as a domestic IIR. This is because: 22.1 it is only intended to apply to New Zealand headquartered MNEs; and 22.2 if a New Zealand ultimate parent entity has a direct subsidiary that is low- taxed where there is also a minority interest, the tax is only intended to apply for the portion of the low-tax profits attributable to the New Zealand MNE’s ownership.

This change in name does not affect the policy conclusion relating to the DMT and imputation credits, i .e., that unlike other tax paid under the GloBE rules, tax paid under a DMT/domestic IIR should give rise to imputation credits. 24. As the domestic IIR matches the policy outcome Cabinet has agreed to for the DMT in all but name, we ask Ministers to note the change in the name (but not the substance) of this element of the GloBE rules that the omnibus bill will introduce. The GloBE rules in relation to tax treaties 25. The OECD has stated that the IIR and UTPR are both compatible with tax treaties, such as New Zealand’s, based on the OECD Model. Nevertheless, the compatibility of the UTPR with the OECD model treaty has been the subject of some debate. This is on the basis that the UTPR is effectively an income tax imposed by a country (say New Zealand) on non-New Zealand income earned by a non-New Zealand company , where no New Zealand person has an interest in the non-New Zealand company. Accordingly, it is possible that some companies, and also some governments, may not agree with the OECD position, and might deny our ability to tax under the UTPR relying on a tax treaty between New Zealand and another country. 26. Officials do not believe that this would be likely to succeed if challenged in court. However, we do believe that it would be desirable to eliminate any possible uncertainty in this respect. Accordingly, we recommend confirming in legislation that the GloBE rules adopted by New Zealand apply notwithstanding the terms of a tax treaty, unless those terms expressly refer to the GloBE rules. This is consistent with the intention of the rules, and with the consensus position adopted by the OECD-led Inclusive Framework which has developed and approved the Model Rules. Although tax treaties usually take priority over the provisions of the Income Tax Act, there is precedent for such an over-ride in the Act. Consultation 27. Officials have consulted with: • Australian tax officials on their administrative regime for tax reporting by large multinational groups; • the OECD on the distinction between a DMT and a domestic IIR. Next steps 28. Draft legislation will be prepared in accordance with Ministers’ decisions and included in the upcoming omnibus bill.
