Act 1993 (or under a foreign law that has the same or similar effect to Part 13 or 15) that causes two or more companies to amalgamate and continue as one company. Includes certain transfers between building societies under s 33 of the Building Societies Act 1965. Amalgamating company A company that amalgamates with one or more other companies under an amalgamation. Generally, it includes both the continuing company and any company that ceases to exist after the amalgamation. However, in this statement, unless otherwise specified, amalgamating company means only the company that ceases to exist after an amalgamation. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 4 of 49 Amalgamated company The company that continues or survives after an amalgamation or a new company (ie, the continuing company). Concessionary amalgamation An amalgamation that is a “resident’s restricted amalgamation” (as defined in s FO 3 the Act) and receives concessionary tax treatment under subpart FO. Non-concessionary amalgamation An amalgamation either that does not meet the criteria for a concessionary amalgamation or that the companies elect not to treat as a concessionary amalgamation. Summary | Whakarāpopoto 1. This interpretation statement provides guidance on the income tax and GST treatment of amalgamations. It does not address the tax treatment of losses on amalgamation or how an amalgamated company calculates its available subscribed capital. The following items consider those matters:  IS XX/XX: Tax treatment of losses on amalgamation; and  QB XX/XX How does an amalgamated company calculate its available subscribed capital following an amalgamation? 2. The amalgamation rules provide the income tax consequences when companies amalgamate. Subpart FO contains most of the amalgamation rules. 3. The amalgamation rules generally provide tax concessions when an amalgamation is a resident’s restricted amalgamation (concessionary amalgamation). The amalgamation rules may also apply to amalgamations that do not fit the criteria for a concessionary amalgamation (non-concessionary amalgamation). 4. This statement will indicate where tax treatment differs between concessionary amalgamations and non-concessionary amalgamations. 5. Table | Tūtohi 1 summarises the provisions in subpart FO for amalgamations. It also identifies the starting paragraph where each provision is discussed in more detail in th is statement. 6. Other provisions also apply to amalgamations. This statement considers those provisions under the heading “Other matters” (including matters such as dividends, provisional tax and imputation credit accounts) from \[97\], FBT from \[122\], GST from \[128 \] and administrative matters from \[141\].

Broadly, the Companies Act 1993 (CA 1993) allows two or more companies to amalgamate and continue as one company. That company may be one of the amalgamating companies or a new company. 8. The CA 1993 provides that an amalgamated company succeeds to all the property, rights, powers and privileges of each amalgamating company. It also assumes all of their liabilities and obligations. 9. Amalgamations may be either long form or short form under part 13 of the CA 1993:  The long-form amalgamation procedure is in ss 220 and 221 of the CA 1993. A long-form amalgamation is commonly used when companies are unrelated. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 8 of 49  The short-form amalgamation procedure is in s 222 of the CA 1993. Companies may use it if: o the amalgamating companies are a parent company and a wholly owned subsidiary, and the parent company becomes the amalgamated company, commonly referred to as an upwards amalgamation (s 222(1)) (see Figure | Hoahoa 1); or o the amalgamating companies are wholly owned by the same person, commonly referred to as a horizontal amalgamation ((s 222(2)) ( for an example, see Figure | Hoahoa 2 ). Figure | Hoahoa 1 – Upwards amalgamation Figure | Hoahoa 2 – Horizontal amalgamation 10. Amalgamations may also occur under part 15 of the CA 1993 for court-approved amalgamations and amalgamations involving a code company (broadly, certain companies that have financial products). IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 9 of 49 Income tax consequences of an amalgamation – general concepts 11. Subpart FO sets out the income tax consequences for when companies amalgamate. Most amalgamations that are subject to subpart FO will be amalgamations that occur under part 13 of the CA 1993. Section 225(a) of the CA 1993 provides that the amalgamation is effective on the date shown in a certificate of amalgamation. 12. However, “amalgamation” in s YA 1 also includes:  amalgamations that occur under a foreign law that has an effect that is the same as or similar to part 13 or part 15 of the CA 1993 and causes two or more companies to amalgamate and continue as one company; and  a transfer by a building society of all of its engagements to another building society under s 33 of the Building Societies Act 1965 if certain requirements are met. Resident’s restricted amalgamation 13. Generally, subpart FO provides tax concessions when a resident’s restricted amalgamation (concessionary amalgamation) occurs (s FO 1). 14. The broad principles of a concessionary amalgamation are:  the amalgamated company acquires most assets of the amalgamating companies at their tax book value;  the amalgamated company inherits the tax losses and imputation credits of the amalgamating companies if continuity and commonality tests are met; and  the amalgamating companies do not derive income or incur a loss. 15. To be a concessionary amalgamation, each of the amalgamating companies and the amalgamated company must, at the time of the amalgamation:  be New Zealand resident; and  not: o be treated as resident in another country under a double tax agreement; or o derive only exempt income (unless the exempt income is dividends from a foreign company (s CW 9) or dividends between wholly owned group members (s CW 10)). 16. If the amalgamated company is a qualifying company (a regime which is being phased out) immediately after the amalgamation, each of the amalgamating companies must IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 10 of 49 also be a qualifying company at the time of the amalgamation. However, a qualifying company can amalgamate into an amalgamated company that is not a qualifying company. 1 17. Section HF 3(2)(a) provides that a Māori authority must not amalgamate with a company that is not a Māori authority. 18. Companies can choose not to treat the amalgamation as a concessionary amalgamation by notifying the Commissioner under s 75 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). For example, the companies may want the assets of the amalgamating companies to transfer to the amalgamated company at market value. We discuss s 75 of the TAA further at \[141\]. 19. The provisions in subpart FO may apply to all amalgamations, to concessionary amalgamations only or to non-concessionary amalgamations only (depending on the context). Rights and obligations of amalgamated companies 20. Several amalgamation provisions in the Act refer to an amalgamating company “ending its existence” on amalgamation. This wording refers to an amalgamating company ceasing to exist as a separate entity, because it is removed from the register of companies under the CA 1993. 21. However, the rights and obligations of the amalgamating company continue to exist in the form of the amalgamated company for income tax purposes. For example, an amalgamated company could rely on a ruling previously issued to an amalgamating company. 2 22. When an amalgamating company ceases to exist on amalgamation, for the income year of the amalgamation and all earlier income years (s FO 4) the amalgamated company:  must comply with the obligations of the amalgamating company under the Inland Revenue Acts;  must meet the liabilities of the amalgamating company under the Inland Revenue Acts; and  is entitled to the rights, powers and privileges of the amalgamating company under the Inland Revenue Acts. 1 See s HA 23 for the treatment of tax losses on amalgamation where a company that is not a qualifying company amalgamates with a qualifying company and ends its existence on the amalgamation. 2 See IS0081: The impact of company amalgamations on binding rulings. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 11 of 49 23. These obligations and entitlements are mirrored in s 76 of the TAA. We discuss s 76 from \[143\]. 24. An amalgamated company notifies the Commissioner of an amalgamation by filing a Declaration of an amalgamation – IR 432. 25. The amalgamation rules set out in the following sections explain the specific tax consequences when companies amalgamate. Remitted liabilities (s FO 5) 26. On amalgamation, the amalgamated company assumes all the liabilities and obligations of each amalgamating company. 27. No income arises merely because the amalgamated company assumes the liabilities of an amalgamating company (s FO 5). This is because the amalgamated company will be responsible for paying the liabilities. Different rules apply where the liability is a financial arrangement (discussed at \[67\]). 28. Section FO 5 also modifies the effect of s CG 2C (remitted amounts). Section CG 2C provides that income arises to a profit company if:  the profit company has received the benefit of a loss from a loss company;  the loss company’s liability for the loss is remitted or cancelled; and  the loss company is removed from the register of companies. 29. If an amalgamating company incurred deductible expenditure that it was liable to pay and that was offset as losses to another group company, the amalgamated company is treated as if it were the amalgamating company from the amalgamation date until the liabilities are met. This treatment prevents group companies from avoiding the effect of s CG 2C by amalgamating the two companies and liquidating the amalgamated company. 3 Cancellation of shares (s FO 6) 30. Part 13 of the CA 1993 provides when shares of an amalgamating company must be cancelled without payment or other consideration. 4 31. Any shares an amalgamating company or amalgamated company (A Co) holds in another amalgamating company (B Co) that are cancelled on amalgamation are 3 Section FO 5(2). 4 Sections 220(3), 222(1)(b)(i) and 222(2)(b)(i) of the CA 1993. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 12 of 49 deemed to be disposed of at cost immediately before the amalgamation (s FO 6). This means no taxable gain or loss arises for A Co from the cancellation of B Co’s shares. 32. Example | Tauira 1 illustrates a situation where shares an amalgamated company holds in an amalgamating company are cancelled on amalgamation. Example | Tauira 1 – Cancellation of shares at cost B Co has issued 100 shares at $1 per share. A Co holds 20 of B Co’s shares on capital account. A Co and B Co undertake a long form amalgamation. A Co continues as the amalgamated company. Under s 220(3) of the CA 1993 the shares in B Co that A Co holds must be cancelled without payment or other consideration. A Co is deemed to dispose of its 20 shares in B Co for $20 (the cost of the shares). A Co has no gain or loss on disposal of the shares. 33. The outcome in Example | Tauira 1 would be the same if A Co held the B Co shares on revenue account. Section FO 6, because it is a specific provision for amalgamations, overrides any general market value disposal rules, such as s GC 1 (disposals of trading stock at below market value). 34. All shares in an amalgamating company that ceases to exist on amalgamation also cease to exist. As discussed at \[31\], s FO 6 applies to shares in an amalgamating company held by another amalgamating company or the amalgamated company. No specific rule in the amalgamation rules discusses the tax treatment where other shareholders hold shares in an amalgamating company. In that situation the tax treatment will be determined based on the general provisions of the Act. 35. The CA 1993 is flexible as to how amalgamations occur. For example, shares in the amalgamating company that are not required to be cancelled might convert to shares in the amalgamated company, or they might be cancelled (and new shares issued), or the shareholder might exit for cash. How the general provisions of the Act apply will depend on the particular facts. Income derived after amalgamation (s FO 7) 36. If an amalgamated company derives an amount after the amalgamation because of the actions of an amalgamating company, the amount is income of the amalgamated company where it would have been income of the amalgamating company but for the IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 13 of 49 amalgamation (s FO 7). The amount is income of the amalgamated company in the income year that it is derived. 5 37. Example | Tauira 2 illustrates a situation where an amalgamated company derives income as a result of an amalgamating company’s pre-amalgamation actions. Example | Tauira 2 – Income derived a result of an amalgamating company’s actions before amalgamation B Co (a furniture-making business) is in the process of designing furniture for a client. B Co amalgamates with A Co, and A Co continues as the amalgamated company. When A Co invoices the client for the furniture after it is completed, the amount derived is income of A Co. Bad debts and expenditure or loss (s FO 8) 38. An amalgamated company is entitled to a deduction for any debts acquired from an amalgamating company that it writes off as bad or for any expenditure or loss that it incurs as a result of the activities of an amalgamating company before the amalgamation (s FO 8) if all of the following requirements are met:  The amalgamation is a concessionary amalgamation.  A deduction would have been available to the amalgamating company if it had continued to exist.  A deduction is not otherwise available to the amalgamated company. 39. Example | Tauira 3 i llustrates an amalgamated company that can claim a deduction for the debt of an amalgamating company that the amalgamated company writes off after amalgamation. Example | Tauira 3 – Amalgamated company writes off amalgamating company’s debt after amalgamation B Co from Example | Tauira 2 invoiced a customer for furniture it sold before the amalgamation. The invoice was unpaid at the date of amalgamation. Following the amalgamation, A Co writes the debt off as a bad debt. 6 5 Section CV 4. 6 For guidance on when a debt is bad and which actions are sufficient to write off a debt as bad, see BR PUB 18/07: Income Tax and Goods and Services Tax – Writing off debts as bad. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 14 of 49 A Co can claim a deduction for the amount of the bad debt it wrote off. 40. Example | Tauira 4 illustrates a situation where an amalgamated company incurs deductible expenditure as a result of an amalgamating company’s pre-amalgamation activities. Example | Tauira 4 – Expenditure an amalgamated company incurs from an amalgamating company’s activities before amalgamation B Co from Example | Tauira 2 and Example | Tauira 3 ordered materials for making furniture before the amalgamation. B Co had not received delivery of the materials or received an invoice for the materials at the date of amalgamation. The manufacturer invoices A Co on delivery of the materials. A Co can claim a deduction for the expenditure it incurred on the materials. 41. Section FO 8 applies only where the amalgamation is a concessionary amalgamation. If an amalgamation is not a concessionary amalgamation, the ordinary tax rules will apply:  Generally, no deduction is available for acquired debts (as they are capital in nature).  Whether it is possible to deduct other expenditure an amalgamated company incurs for an amalgamating company’s pre-amalgamation activities depends on the facts. Unexpired portion of prepaid expenditure (s FO 9) 42. An amalgamating company must include as income any unexpired portion of prepaid expenditure in its final tax return prepared for the company to the date of amalgamation (s FO 9). The outcome of this treatment is that the amalgamated company can deduct the unexpired portion of the expenditure (as at the amalgamation date) in the year of amalgamation and must add back as income any unexpired portion of the expenditure at year end. 43. Example | Tauira 5 illustrates how s FO 9 applies where an amalgamating company has an unexpired portion of prepaid expenditure at the date of amalgamation. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 15 of 49 Example | Tauira 5 – Prepaid expenditure of an amalgamating company B Co advertises in a furniture magazine. On 1 April 2023, B Co prepays $24,000 for its advertising for the 2024 income year ($2,000 per month). B Co and A Co (both of which have a standard 31 March balance date) amalgamate on 31 December 2023. A Co continues as the amalgamated company. B Co must include the unexpired portion of the expenditure as income in its final tax return for the period 1 April 2023 to 31 December 2023 (which consists of the amounts prepaid for January, February and March 2024 , ie, 3 × $2,000 = $6,000). B Co has a net deduction of $18,000. A Co can claim a deduction for the $6,000 in its tax return for the period 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024 (ie, the total of the amounts prepaid for January, February and March 2024). Property passing on amalgamation (s FO 10) Concessionary amalgamation – general rule for property passing 44. The general rule for property (excluding financial arrangements) that passes on a concessionary amalgamation is as follows:  The passing of ownership of the property on amalgamation is treated as a disposal of the property by the amalgamating company and an acquisition by the amalgamated company (s FO 10(3)).  The amalgamating company is deemed to have disposed of its property to the amalgamated company immediately before the amalgamation (s FO 10(3)).  The amalgamated company is treated as having acquired the property on the date the amalgamating company acquired the property for the sum of (s FO 10(4)): o the original purchase price; plus o any expenditure incurred in purchasing or improving the property; plus o any expenditure incurred in securing or improving the amalgamating company’s legal rights to the property. 45. Broadly, the general rule has two effects: IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 16 of 49  The amalgamating company will not derive income or incur a loss from the disposal.  The cost base of the property is rolled over to the amalgamated company ( ie, the amalgamated company ‘steps into the shoes’ of the amalgamating company). 46. The general rule will most often apply to depreciable property. Some modifications to the general rule apply to amortising property (which includes depreciable property) (discussed from \[48\]) and land (discussed from \[ 53\]). 47. Different rules apply to the disposal of property that is trading stock of both companies (discussed at \[55\]) and to the disposal of revenue account property (if the property is revenue account property of the amalgamating company but not revenue account property of the amalgamated company) (discussed from \[56\]). Amortising property (s FO 16) 48. On a concessionary amalgamation, the following modified rules apply:  The amalgamating company will not derive any depreciation recovery income or incur a loss on disposal as a result of the deemed disposal (s FO 16(1B)).  The amalgamated company is deemed to have been allowed the depreciation or amortisation deductions taken by the amalgamating company (s FO 16(4)).  The amalgamating company is allowed a depreciation deduction for the property transferred to the amalgamated company for the period beginning on the first day of the income year of amalgamation and ending on the day before the date of amalgamation (s FO 10(7) and s DV 15(3)).  The amalgamated company is allowed a depreciation deduction for the property from the amalgamation date to the end of the relevant income year. 49. Example | Tauira 6 illustrates the tax outcome when depreciable property passes from an amalgamating company to an amalgamated company on a concessionary amalgamation. Example | Tauira 6 – Passing of depreciable property on a concessionary amalgamation A Co and B Co amalgamate on 1 April 2024. A Co continues as the amalgamated company. The amalgamation is a concessionary amalgamation. Both companies have a 30 June balance date. B Co owned the following depreciable assets before the amalgamation: IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 17 of 49 Asset Cost Date acquired Dep rate (DV) Closing tax book value at 30 June 2023 Depreciation deduction 2024 Full year 9/12 B Co 3/12 A Co Motor vehicle $25,000 1 July 2020 30% $8,575 $2,572 $1,929 $643 Laptop $2,800 31 March 2022 50% $1,166 $583 $437 $146 On amalgamation, the tax outcome is as follows: • A Co is deemed to have acquired the motor vehicle and laptop from B Co on the same date as B Co acquired them (1 July 2020 for the motor vehicle and 31 March 2022 for the laptop) and for the same cost ($25,000 for the motor vehicle and $2,800 for the laptop). • B Co has no depreciation recovery income or depreciation loss on the deemed disposal on the motor vehicle and laptop. • B Co can claim a depreciation deduction for the assets for the 9-month period beginning on 1 July 2023 (the beginning of its income year) and ending on 31 March 2024 (the day before the amalgamation) of $1,929 for the motor vehicle and $437 for the laptop. • A Co can claim a depreciation deduction for the assets for the 3-month period from 1 April 2024 to 30 June 2024 of $643 for the motor vehicle and $146 for the laptop. Pool property 50. Different rules apply to depreciable property that is subject to the pool method. Broadly, under the pool method, the following rules apply:  The taxpayer elects that a collection of low-value assets is treated as one asset and depreciated at the lowest diminishing value rate applicable to the assets in the pool.  When a pooled asset is disposed of, the sale proceeds are deducted from the adjusted tax value of the pool. If the sale proceeds: o are more than the adjusted tax value of the pool, the difference is income; or IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 18 of 49 o are less than the adjusted tax value of the pool, the difference is deductible.  Once assets are pooled, they are no longer treated as individual assets, so any capital gain made on the sale of any or all assets from the pool cannot be separated from depreciation recovered. The entire proceeds of any sale of pooled assets must be accounted for and any gains are taxable income. 51. If the depreciable property passing on amalgamation:  forms the whole of the pool property of the amalgamating company, no income or loss arises to the amalgamating company, because the disposal is deemed to occur at the pool’s adjusted tax value; or  forms part of the pool property of the amalgamating company, no income or loss arises to the amalgamating company, because the disposal is deemed to occur at either market value or the adjusted tax value of the pool, whichever is lower. 52. Example | Tauira 7 illustrates a situation where depreciable property that is subject to the pool method passes from an amalgamating company to an amalgamated company on a concessionary amalgamation. Example | Tauira 7 – Passing of pool property on a concessionary amalgamation A Co and B Co amalgamate on 1 January 2024. A Co continues as the amalgamated company. The amalgamation is a concessionary amalgamation. Both companies have a 31 March balance date. B Co pooled its depreciable property. The adjusted tax value of the pool was $500,000 on 31 December 2023. The entire pool passes to A Co on amalgamation. B Co claims depreciation on the pool for the period 1 April 2023 to 31 December 2023. Also, B Co has no income or loss on the disposal of its pool property ($500,000 less $500,000). The adjusted tax value of the pool property to A Co is $500,000. A Co claims depreciation on the pool for the period 1 January 2024 to 31 March 2024. Land (concessionary amalgamation) (ss FO 10 and FO 17) 53. In general, land passes from an amalgamating company to the amalgamated company on a concessionary amalgamation at cost or market value. Whether land passes at cost or market value depends on how the amalgamating company and amalgamated company hold the land. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 19 of 49 54. Table | Tūtohi 2 summarises when land passes at cost and when it passes at market value. In this table, any reference to “bright-line or 10-year rule” means the 2-year bright-line test under s CB 6A, or the 10-year rule for land under any of ss CB 9 to CB 11 and s CB 14.

If the property is trading stock for both the amalgamating company and the amalgamated company, the consideration for the disposal and acquisition is the value of the trading stock to the amalgamating company determined under subpart EB at the time of amalgamation. This means no gain or loss should arise on the deemed disposal of the trading stock. Revenue account property 56. Broadly, property is revenue account property if it is trading stock or property where a taxable gain or deductible loss arises when sold. Conversely, property is capital account property if the sale of the property results in a non-taxable, non-deductible capital gain or loss. 57. Property that is revenue account property of the amalgamating company, but capital account property of the amalgamated company is treated as disposed of and acquired at the property’s market value at the time of the amalgamation under s FO 10(6). 58. Section FO 10(6) does not apply to land that is revenue account property of the amalgamating company merely because of the bright-line test or the 10-year rule in the land provisions. 59. Section FO 10(6) ensures that any unrealised gains are income when an asset moves out of the tax base on amalgamation (ie, it moves from being held on revenue to capital account). Non-concessionary amalgamation – property passing (s FO 11) 60. Under a non-concessionary amalgamation, property of an amalgamating company is deemed to pass to the amalgamated company on amalgamation at market value (s FO 11(1)). This means the amalgamating company may derive income or incur a loss. “Property” is something capable of being owned and transferred and includes, for example, trading stock, revenue account property, land and fixed assets. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 21 of 49 61. Section EE 41 modifies this rule for depreciable property where the amalgamating company and amalgamated company are associated persons at the time of amalgamation. Broadly, s EE 41 prevents associated companies from using the amalgamation rules to increase depreciation deductions by transferring depreciable assets that have a market value greater than cost. 62. Most often, the cost of the property for the amalgamated company for depreciation purposes is the lesser of the following two amounts under s EE 41:  the market value of the property at the time the amalgamated company acquired it; and  the cost of the item to the amalgamating company. 63. Different rules apply where the depreciable property was not always used for the purpose of deriving assessable income and was later brought into the tax base. 7 64. Despite s EE 41, the cost of the item to the amalgamated company may be used if:  the property is not depreciable intangible property (eg, software) and the Commissioner approves the cost; or  the amalgamating company derives income from the transfer of the property to the amalgamated company (other than as depreciation recovery income). 65. The amalgamated company cannot depreciate the property at a higher depreciation rate than the rate that the amalgamating company used. 8 66. Example | Tauira 8 illustrates how s FO 11 applies to the passing of depreciable property between associated persons on a non-concessionary amalgamation. Example | Tauira 8 – Passing of depreciable property between associated persons on a non-concessionary amalgamation B Co and A Co are wholly owned. B Co amalgamates with A Co. A Co continues as the amalgamated company. B Co owned plant that cost $500,000 and had a tax book value of $250,000 and a market value of $700,000. B Co depreciated the plant at a 10% straight-line rate. The companies elect for a non-concessionary amalgamation. 7 See EE 41(2)(a). 8 S ee s EE 41(4). Where the amalgamated company uses a different depreciation method from the amalgamating company, the rate applied cannot be more than a rate equivalent to the rate that the amalgamating company used. Schedule 10 sets out the straight-line equivalents of diminishing value rates of depreciation. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 22 of 49 A Co must depreciate the plant using a cost of $500,000 under s EE 41. B Co is treated as disposing of the plant to A Co for its market value on the date of amalgamation under s FO 11 resulting in depreciation recovery income of $250,000. The current depreciation rate for the plant is 12% straight line. If A Co wishes to use the straight-line rate, it must use a depreciation rate of 10% straight line (as it cannot exceed B Co’s depreciation rate of 10%). Financial arrangements 67. The financial arrangements rules ( FA rules) govern the tax treatment of financial arrangements, such as a loan. Broadly, the FA rules:  require parties to a financial arrangement to spread income or expenditure from the arrangement over its term;  override the capital limitation; and  aim to stop the acceleration of deductions for expenditure and the deferral of income recognition. 68. A base price adjustment (BPA) is required when a financial arrangement matures to calculate the final income or expenditure arising from the financial arrangement (ie, a “wash-up” calculation). Generally, a BPA is also required when a financial arrangement is transferred to allocate income and expenditure in the year of transfer between the transferor and the transferee (unless an exception applies). 69. Different rules apply depending on whether the financial arrangement is with a third party or between companies that are involved in the amalgamation. Concessionary amalgamation – transfer of third-party financial arrangements (ss FO 12, 13 and 14) Transfer of third-party financial arrangements – default rule (s FO 12) 70. On a concessionary amalgamation, the amalgamated company can step into the shoes of the amalgamating company in relation to a financial arrangement that passes to it (s FO 12). This means there is no BPA on amalgamation, if all of the following requirements are met:  The FA rules apply to the financial arrangement. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 23 of 49  For the whole of the income year before the amalgamation, the amalgamating company and amalgamated company were part of the same wholly owned group .  The amalgamated company uses the same method of calculating income and expenditure for the financial arrangement (spreading method) as the amalgamating company used. For example, both use the yield to maturity method.  The amalgamating company does not have losses carried forward from an earlier year or years that could not be attributed to the amalgamated company. 9 71. If these conditions are met and the amalgamated company makes an election, the following outcomes apply:  The amalgamating company is treated as if it had never held the financial arrangement before the amalgamation. The amalgamated company is treated as if it had acquired the financial arrangement on the same date and for the same consideration as the amalgamating company.  The amalgamated company is deemed to have incurred all other expenditure and to have derived all gains that the amalgamating company has incurred or derived before the amalgamation. Further, it is deemed to have included these amounts of income and expenditure in its income tax returns. 72. The amalgamated company makes the election by including in its tax return in the year of amalgamation any income or expenditure the amalgamating company derived or incurred under the financial arrangement in the year of the amalgamation. 73. Section FO 12 applies regardless of:  s EW 42, which deems the acquisition of entitlements under a financial arrangement for no or inadequate consideration to be at market value; and  s GB 21, which deems arm’s length consideration where parties to a financial arrangement deal with each other in a way that defeats the intention of the FA rules. 74. Section FO 12 is the default rule. Example | Tauira 9 illustrates how it applies. Example | Tauira 9 – Transfer of a bank deposit (default rule) B Co and A Co are wholly owned companies. Both companies have a 31 March balance date. 9 For a discussion of the treatment of tax losses of amalgamating companies, see IS XX/XX: Tax treatment of losses on amalgamation. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 24 of 49 On 1 April 2023, B Co deposited $100,000 with a bank at an interest rate of 5% pa. B Co amalgamates with A Co on 31 December 2023. A Co continues as the amalgamated company. The amalgamation is a concessionary amalgamation. B Co‘s final tax return for the period 1 April 2023 to 31 December 2023 excludes any interest earned on the bank deposit. A Co’s tax return for the 2024 income year (ending 31 March) includes interest income of $5,000 earned on the bank deposit. Transfer of third-party financial arrangements – default rule not met but no change in spreading method (s FO 13) 75. Section FO 13 applies if the requirements for the s FO 12 default rule discussed from \[70\] are not met and there is no change in the spreading method after the amalgamation. For example, if the amalgamating company and amalgamated company were not in a wholly owned group of companies before the amalgamation. 76. Section FO 13 treats the amalgamating company as having disposed of the financial arrangement. The disposal triggers a BPA. The consideration for the disposal under s FO 13 is the amount that means the BPA gives a fair and reasonable allocation between the amalgamating company and amalgamated company in the year of amalgamation of the interest expenditure or income that the amalgamating company would have incurred or derived if the amalgamation had not taken place. This ensures that the FA rules give the correct amount of expenditure or income over the life of the financial arrangement. 77. The BPA formula is as follows (s EW 31(5)): consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted 78. Table | Tūtohi 3 defines each of the elements in this formula. Table | Tūtohi 3: Elements in the BPA formula BPA item Definition Consideration Plus all consideration that has been paid or is or will be payable to the person (Less all consideration that has been paid or is or will be payable by the person under the financial arrangement) IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 25 of 49 BPA item Definition (Income) (Less amounts derived by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years) Expenditure Plus amounts incurred by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years Amount remitted Plus an amount not included in the consideration paid or payable to the person because it has been remitted by the person or by law 79. Example | Tauira 10 illustrates how the rule in s FO 13 applies. Example | Tauira 10 – Bank deposit (default rule does not apply but no change in spreading method) On 1 April 2023, B Co deposited $100,000 with its bank at an interest rate of 5% per annum (interest payable annually in arrears). B Co amalgamates with A Co on 31 December 2023. A Co continues as the amalgamated company. The amalgamation is a concessionary amalgamation. Both companies have a 31 March balance date. B Co and A Co are not wholly owned but apply the same spreading method to the bank deposit. As B Co has held the deposit for 9 months before the amalgamation, a fair and reasonable allocation of the interest income for the year would be $3,750 ($5,000 × 9/12 months). A Co’s allocation would be $1,250 ($5,000 × 3/12 months). To arrive at this outcome, the consideration paid to B Co (and by A Co) will need to be $103,750 as demonstrated by the BPA calculation below.

If neither s FO 12 nor s FO 13 applies (ie, there is a change in spreading method), the transfer of the financial arrangement is deemed to be at market value (s FO 14). 81. Example | Tauira 11 illustrates the outcome where the obligations of an amalgamating company under a financial arrangement pass to an amalgamated company at market value. Example | Tauira 11 – Bank deposit in foreign currency (default rule not met and there is a change in spreading method) B Co deposited US$100,000 to a bank on 1 April 2023, which converted to NZ$142,000 on that day. Interest is paid monthly in arrears at a floating interest rate. B Co amalgamates with A Co on 31 December 2023. A Co continues as the amalgamated company. The amalgamation is a concessionary amalgamation. Both companies have a 31 March balance date. B Co and A Co apply different spreading methods to calculate income and expenditure under the US$ bank deposit. On 31 December 2023, the US$100,000 deposit converted to NZ$166,000 (due to exchange rate fluctuations). B Co is deemed to have disposed of the US$100,000 deposit to A Co on 31 December 2023 at NZ$166,000 under s FO 14. In B Co‘s final tax return for the period 1 April 2023 to 31 December 2023, B Co has income (foreign exchange gain) under the BPA calculation of NZ$24,000 (NZ$166,000 consideration paid to B Co less NZ$142,000 consideration paid by B Co) plus interest income received. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 28 of 49 A Co acquires the US$100,000 deposit for NZ$166,000. Non-concessionary amalgamation – transfer of obligations under third-party financial arrangements (s FO 15) 82. On a non-concessionary amalgamation, where an obligation that an amalgamating company has under a financial arrangement passes to the amalgamated company:  the consideration for the disposal of a financial arrangement obligation by the amalgamating company is the market price for assuming the obligation at the time of amalgamation; and  the amalgamated company acquires the financial arrangement for the same amount and is treated as assuming the financial arrangement obligation. 83. Example | Tauira 12 illustrates the outcome where the obligations of an amalgamating company under a financial arrangement pass to an amalgamated company on a non- concessionary amalgamation. Example | Tauira 12 – Transfer of financial arrangement obligation on a non- concessionary amalgamation B Co borrowed US$100,000 from a bank on 1 April 2023, which converted to NZ$142,000 on that day. Interest is paid monthly in arrears at a floating interest rate. B Co amalgamates with A Co on 31 December 2023. A Co continues as the amalgamated company. The amalgamation is a non-concessionary amalgamation. A Co and B Co have a standard 31 March balance date. On 31 December 2023, the US$100,000 loan converted to NZ$166,000 (due to exchange rate fluctuations). The US$100,000 obligation is deemed to be transferred at NZ$166,000 under s FO 15. In its final tax return for the period 1 April 2023 to 31 December 2023, B Co has a foreign exchange loss of NZ$24,000 (NZ$142,000 less NZ$166,000) plus interest expense incurred in the year. A Co acquires the obligation to repay the US$100,000 loan for NZ$166,000. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 29 of 49 Financial arrangements between amalgamating companies (s FO 18) 84. Where a financial arrangement is between companies involved in the amalgamation, the financial arrangement collapses on amalgamation (ie, the obligations and/or entitlements each party has under the financial arrangement merge). 85. Section FO 18 applies if s FO 21 does not apply. The following discussion on s FO 18 through to \[91\] assumes that s FO 21 does not apply. We discuss situations in which s FO 21 applies from \[92\]. 86. In applying s FO 18, companies need to consider whether:  the borrower is able to meet its obligations under the financial arrangement at the time of the amalgamation; and  the amalgamation is a concessionary amalgamation. Concessionary amalgamation – borrower can meet obligations 87. Under a concessionary amalgamation, if the borrower is solvent , or insolvent but likely to meet its obligations under the financial arrangement (because property of the borrower fully secures the debt), the financial arrangement is deemed to be discharged immediately before the amalgamation for the accrued balance of the financial arrangement (s FO 18(2)(a)(i) and (ii)). In general, this means no income under the FA rules (referred to in this interpretation statement as “debt remission income”) should arise to the borrower for unpaid amounts. 88. For example, for a loan, the accrued balance is the principal and unpaid interest accrued to the date of amalgamation. If any unpaid interest has accrued to the date of amalgamation, the deemed payment of this balance on discharge of the financial arrangement will give rise to income in the hands of the lender (and a corresponding deduction will arise in the hands of the borrower). Concessionary amalgamation – borrower unlikely to meet its obligations under the financial arrangement 89. Under a concessionary amalgamation, if the borrower is insolvent and unlikely to meet its obligations under the financial arrangement, the financial arrangement is deemed to be discharged immediately before the amalgamation for the market value of the financial arrangement on the date of amalgamation (s FO 18(2)(a)(iii)). In general, this means that remission income will arise to the borrower if the value of the financial arrangement has declined (unless s FO 21 applies, which relates to economic groups). Also, generally the lender cannot claim a deduction for the amount remitted. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 30 of 49 90. Example | Tauira 13 illustrates how s FO 18 applies on a concessionary amalgamation where the borrower is unlikely to meet its obligations under the financial arrangement. Example | Tauira 13 – Insolvent borrower B Co borrowed $1 million from A Co on 1 April 2022 for 2 years at an interest rate of 10% per annum, payable annually in arrears. B Co pays interest of $100,000 on 31 March 2023. By 31 December 2023, B Co is insolvent and cannot repay any of the $1 million loan or accrued interest to 31 December 2023 of $75,000. The loan has a market value of nil. A Co and B Co are not wholly owned. A Co and B Co amalgamate on 31 December 2023. A Co continues as the amalgamated company. The amalgamation is a concessionary amalgamation. The following tables outline the outcome of the BPA for B Co and A Co respectively. Outcome of the BPA for B Co BPA item Definition Calculation for B Co (borrower) Consideration Plus all consideration that has been paid or is or will be payable to the person (Less all consideration that has been paid or is or will be payable by the person under the financial arrangement) $1 million initial loan ($100,000) interest paid $0 market value deemed for discharge of loan (Income) (Less amounts the person derived under the financial arrangement in earlier income years) 0 Expenditure Plus amounts the person incurred under the financial arrangement in earlier income years $100,000 interest paid Amount remitted Plus an amount not included in the consideration paid or payable to the person 0 IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 31 of 49 because it has been remitted by the person or by law BPA outcome $1 million of income to B Co Outcome of the BPA for A Co BPA item Definition Calculation for A Co (lender) Consideration Plus all consideration that has been paid or is or will be payable to the person (Less all consideration that has been paid or is or will be payable by the person under the financial arrangement) $100,000 interest received ($1 million) initial loan $0 market value deemed for discharge of loan (Income) (Less amounts the person derived under the financial arrangement in earlier income years) ($100,000) interest income Expenditure Plus amounts the person incurred under the financial arrangement in earlier income years 0 Amount remitted Plus an amount not included in the consideration paid or payable to the person because it has been remitted by the person or by law $1.075 million principal and accrued interest 10 BPA outcome $75,000 of income to A Co 10 See ss FO 18(7) and FO 20. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 32 of 49 A Co would need to claim a bad debt deduction for the accrued interest of $75,000 under s DB 31(2) (if they meet the requirements of that section) to offset the BPA income of $75,000. Non-concessionary amalgamations 91. On a non-concessionary amalgamation, the financial arrangement is treated as having been discharged immediately before the amalgamation for the financial arrangement’s market value on the amalgamation date (s FO 18(2)(b)):  Where the borrower is solvent or likely to be able to meet its financial obligations under the financial arrangement, the same treatment applies as discussed at \[87\] relating to a solvent borrower and concessionary amalgamations. In general, this means no remission income should arise to the borrower for unpaid amounts.  Where the borrower is insolvent, the same treatment applies as at \[89\] relating to an insolvent borrower and concessionary amalgamations. In general, this means that remission income will arise to the borrower if the value of the financial arrangement has declined. Economic groups – s FO 21 92. Section FO 21 applies to amalgamations where the companies are in the same economic group and carries the effect of s EW 46C into the amalgamation rules. 93. The core rule in s EW 46C is that where a debt remission does not cause economic income and a corresponding increase in economic wealth (and does not amount to a dividend), no debt remission income arises to the borrower. For example, no debt remission income arises when a debt is remitted within a New Zealand resident wholly owned group of companies. Debt remission and associated amendments Taxation Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 5 (June 2017): 105 discusses the introduction of s EW 46C in detail (see 105–109 ). 94. Where s FO 21 applies, the debtor is treated as having paid, and the creditor is treated as having been paid, the amount of the financial arrangement on the amalgamation date. This means that no debt remission income arises to the debtor. 95. Section FO 21 applies to both concessionary and non-concessionary amalgamations. 96. Example | Tauira 14 illustrates how s FO 21 applies when the amalgamating company and amalgamated companies are within a wholly owned New Zealand group. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 33 of 49 Example | Tauira 14 – Financial arrangement between amalgamating companies within an economic group B Co borrowed $1 million from A Co on 1 April 2023. The loan is interest free and repayable on 1 April 2026. By 31 December 2023, B Co is insolvent and cannot repay any of the $1 million loan. The loan has a market value of nil. B Co and A Co have always been wholly owned New Zealand resident companies. A Co and B Co amalgamate on 31 December 2023. A Co continues as the amalgamated company. The following tables outline the outcome of the BPA under s FO 21 for B Co and A Co respectively. Outcome of the BPA under s FO 21 for B Co BPA item Definition Calculation for B Co (borrower) Consideration Plus all consideration that has been paid or is or will be payable to the person (Less all consideration that has been paid or is or will be payable by the person under the financial arrangement) $1 million initial loan ($1 million) effect of s FO 21(2) (I ncome) (Less amounts derived by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years) 0 Expenditure Plus amounts incurred by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years 0 Amount remitted Plus an amount not included in the consideration paid or payable to the person because it has been remitted by the person or by law 0 BPA outcome $0 to B Co IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 34 of 49 Outcome of the BPA under s FO 21 for A Co BPA item Definition Calculation for A Co (lender) Consideration Plus all consideration that has been paid or is or will be payable to the person (Less all consideration that has been paid or is or will be payable by the person under the financial arrangement) $1 million effect of s FO 21(3) ($1 million) initial loan (I ncome) (Less amounts derived by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years) 0 Expenditure Plus amounts incurred by the person under the financial arrangement in earlier income years 0 Amount remitted Plus an amount not included in the consideration paid or payable to the person because it has been remitted by the person or by law 0 BPA outcome $0 to A Co Other matters Dividends (s CD 35) 97. On a concessionary amalgamation, an amount derived by an amalgamated company from an amalgamating company is not a dividend (s CD 35) if it arises because the amalgamated company:  acquires property of the amalgamating company; or  is relieved of an obligation owed to the amalgamating company. 98. Without s CD 35, the amalgamation could have dividend implications for the amalgamated company if it is a shareholder of the amalgamating company (and if no other dividend exclusions apply). IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 35 of 49 Available capital distribution amount (s CD 44) 99. Section CD 44 provides for the calculation of a company’s available capital distribution amount (ACDA). Broadly, ACDA is the amount of any distribution made on the liquidation of a company that represents capital property or previously derived net capital gains. A company can distribute its ACDA tax-free on liquidation. 100. An amalgamated company inherits a capital gain amount of an amalgamating company that ends its existence on amalgamation to the extent that the amalgamating company’s capital gain amount (s CD 44(8)):  was available for distribution at the time of amalgamation; and  was not distributed to anyone other than the amalgamated company. For example, the capital gain amount was not distributed to a shareholder of the company as part of the amalgamation. 101. The amalgamated company is treated as deriving the capital gain amount of the amalgamating company at the time of the amalgamation. Interest deductibility (s DB 8) 102. A company can deduct interest incurred on money borrowed to acquire shares in another company that is part of the same group of companies (ie, at least 66% commonly owned) if the companies are members of the same group of companies at the end of the income year (s DB 8(1)). 103. If a company has borrowed funds to invest in an amalgamating company, the interest is still deductible (s DB 8(3)) if:  the amalgamation is a concessionary amalgamation; and  the two companies were part of the same group of companies immediately before the amalgamation. 104. Example | Tauira 15 illustrates a situation where an amalgamated company can continue to deduct interest on amounts borrowed to acquire shares in a subsidiary that it amalgamates with. Example | Tauira 16 illustrates a situation where a company not involved in the amalgamation can continue to deduct interest on amounts borrowed to acquire shares in a company that ends its existence on amalgamation. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 36 of 49 Example | Tauira 15 – Interest on amalgamated company’s borrowings to acquire shares in amalgamating company B Co borrows funds to acquire shares in C Co. B Co deducts interest on the borrowings as B Co and C Co are part of the same group of companies. B Co and C Co amalgamate, and B Co remains as the amalgamated company. The amalgamation is a concessionary amalgamation. B Co is able to continue deducting the interest on the borrowings under s DB 8 because:  the amalgamation is a concessionary amalgamation; and  B Co and C Co were part of the same group of companies immediately before the amalgamation. Example | Tauira 16 – Company deducts interest on borrowings to acquire shares in an amalgamating company D Co borrowed funds to acquire a 20% shareholding in C Co. D Co deducts interest on the borrowings as D Co and C Co are part of the same group of companies (D Co and C Co are 100% commonly owned by A Co). IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 37 of 49 B Co and C Co amalgamate, and B Co remains as the amalgamated company. The amalgamation is a concessionary amalgamation. D Co is able to continue deducting the interest on the borrowings under s DB 8 because:  the amalgamation is a concessionary amalgamation; and  D Co and C Co were part of the same group of companies immediately before the amalgamation. Environment restoration accounts (s EK 19) 105. Where an amalgamating company with an environmental restoration account (ERA) ends its existence on an amalgamation:  the contents of the ERA are transferred to an ERA of the amalgamated company on the date of amalgamation (s EK 19(a));  the amalgamated company is treated as having made all the payments to, and transfers from, the ERA that the amalgamating company made before the amalgamation (s EK 19(b)(i) and (ii)); and  the amalgamated company is treated as having received all the refunds that the amalgamating company received from the ERA before the amalgamation (s EK 19(b)(iii)). Farming, horticultural, aquacultural and forestry business improvements on a concessionary amalgamation (s DV 14) 106. Where, if the amalgamation had not occurred, an amalgamating company would have been allowed a deduction under any one of ss DO 4, DO 5, DO 6, DO 12 and DP 3 IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 38 of 49 (which relate to improvements and expenditure on certain land), the amalgamated company is allowed the deduction if:  the amalgamation is a concessionary amalgamation; and  the amalgamated company acquires land or a business from the amalgamating company. 107. The amalgamated company is allowed the deduction while it holds the land or carries on the business. Imputation credit accounts 108. On a concessionary amalgamation, imputation credits and debits of an amalgamating company recorded before the amalgamation date are treated as if they were recorded in the imputation credit account (ICA) of the amalgamated company with effect from the original credit and debit dates (s OA 9( 2)). 109. This treatment extends to credits and debits due to an amalgamating company but not recorded in its ICA before the date of amalgamation. In this situation, the credit or debit is recorded in the amalgamated company’s ICA (s OA 10). For example, an imputation credit attached to a dividend paid to the amalgamating company after the date of amalgamation is recorded in the amalgamated company’s ICA at the date the dividend is paid. 11 However, an amalgamated company does not include a debit in its ICA for the loss of shareholder continuity in an amalgamating company as a result of amalgamation (s OA 10(3)). 110. To carry forward imputation credits of an amalgamating company, there must be at least 66% continuity of shareholding from the date that the credit arose until the amalgamated company uses it. To determine whether continuity of shareholding exists for ICA purposes, the amalgamated company is treated for all times before the amalgamation as if it did not separately exist and was instead the amalgamating company, with the same shareholders and option holders. An amalgamated company must keep records of any imputation credits in its ICA that an amalgamating company contributed so it can determine whether continuity of shareholding is maintained for those credits. 111. Similar rules to those discussed above apply when all the companies in a consolidated group or consolidated imputation group amalgamate on a concessionary amalgamation and, as a result of the amalgamation, the group’s existence ends and an amalgamated company forms. 12 11 See s OB 9. 12 See s OA 14. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 39 of 49 112. On a non-concessionary amalgamation, an amalgamating company’s imputation credits are extinguished. 113. Example | Tauira 17 illustrates a situation where an amalgamated company can use an amalgamating company’s imputation credits after amalgamation. Example | Tauira 17 – Amalgamated company uses an amalgamating company’s imputation credits A Co and B Co amalgamate on 31 March 2024. A Co continues as the amalgamated company. The amalgamation is a concessionary amalgamation. A Co and B Co’s shareholdings have remained the same since incorporation. At the time of amalgamation, B Co has a credit balance in its ICA of $25,000. The entries in B Co’s ICA are as follows: Date Description DR CR Balance 28/08/23 Provisional tax $10,000 $10,000 15/01/24 Provisional tax $20,000 $30,000 28/03/24 Dividend paid ($5,000) $25,000 A Co wants to attach B Co’s imputation credits of $25,000 to a dividend it proposes to pay on 30 June 2024. A Co can attach B Co’s imputation credits of $25,000 if it has at least 66% continuity of shareholding from the date that the credits arose ($5,000 on 28 August 2023 13 and $20,000 on 15 January 2024)) until the date the credits are used (30 June 2024). To determine shareholder continuity, A Co is treated as if it had B Co’s shareholders before the amalgamation and its own shareholders after the amalgamation. The shareholdings of A Co and B Co are as follows: Shareholder – voting interest A Co (1 April 2024 to 30 June 2024) B Co (28 August 2023 to 31 March 2024) Continuity of voting interest Shareholder C 30% 30% 30% 13 See s OA 8(8), debits reduce credits in the order in which the credits arise. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 40 of 49 Shareholder D 20% 45% 20% Shareholder E 50% 25% 25% Total 75% As the continuity of voting interest in A Co is 75%, the required shareholder continuity is met from the date the credits arose until the time A Co uses them. Tax credits relating to attributed controlled foreign company (CFC) income 114. On a concessionary amalgamation, if an amalgamating company has a pre- amalgamation tax credit for tax paid on attributed CFC income, the tax credit is treated as a tax credit of the amalgamated company for the tax year in which the amalgamation occurs (s LK 13) if the tax credit could be made available to:  the amalgamated company (unless it is a company incorporated only on amalgamation); and  any company that has amalgamated with the amalgamated company. 115. If more than one amalgamating company contributes pre-amalgamation tax credits to the amalgamated company, the amalgamated company uses the credits in the order they arose. If the tax credits are for the same tax year, the amalgamated company can credit them in the order the amalgamated company chose if notified to the Commissioner. If the amalgamated company gave no notice, the amalgamated company uses the tax credits on a pro rata basis (s LK 14(3)). 116. An amalgamated company can only use the tax credits of another company if the other company and the amalgamated company were in a wholly owned group of companies (s LK 15). 117. Broadly, tax credits paid in relation to attributed controlled foreign company (CFC) income can be carried forward to future income years provided that 49% shareholding continuity is maintained or, if that requirement is not satisfied, no major change in the company’s business occurs (ss LK 4 and LK 5). Wholly owned group companies can also use a company’s tax credit relating to attributed CFC income in certain situations (s LK 6) 14 . That is, tax credits relating to attributed CFC income are subject to rules that are similar to the rules for the carry-forward and use of tax losses. 14 The group company must derive attributed CFC income from the same country in which the CFC generating the tax credit was resident (see s LK 6(3)). IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 41 of 49 118. On an amalgamation, for the purpose of determining whether a tax credit paid in relation to attributed CFC income can be carried forward or made available to another group company, the amalgamated company is treated as if it were the amalgamating company with the same shareholder profile as the amalgamating company (s LK 12). Non-standard balance dates 119. An amalgamated company can only use an amalgamating company’s non-standard balance date if the amalgamated company had that non-standard balance date before the amalgamation, or if the amalgamated company successfully applies to the Commissioner for consent to adopt that non-standard balance date. Example | Tauira 18 illustrates how non-standard balances apply on amalgamation. Example | Tauira 18 – Non-standard balance dates A Co has a 31 March balance date. B Co has a 30 June balance date. If A Co and B Co amalgamate and A Co continues as the amalgamated company, the amalgamated company (A Co) will have a 31 March balance date unless the Commissioner consents to a 30 June balance date. However, if B Co were the amalgamated company, it would continue to have a 30 June balance date. Provisional tax 120. An amalgamating company’s residual income tax (the amount of income tax payable after deducting tax credits but before provisional tax) is added to the amalgamated company’s residual income tax for provisional tax purposes (s RC 33). For example, an amalgamating company’s residual income tax is added to the amalgamated company’s residual income tax for the purpose of determining:  whether the amalgamated company is a provisional taxpayer in the year of amalgamation (see, eg, s RC 3(3), which is the $5,000 threshold for the preceding year); and  the amount of provisional tax payable. 121. Example | Tauira 19 illustrates how an amalgamated company calculates its provisional tax obligations. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 42 of 49 Example | Tauira 19 – Calculating provisional tax A Co, B Co and C Co amalgamate on 31 March 2023. A Co continues as the amalgamated company. Each company’s residual income tax for the year ended 31 March 2023 is as follows: A Co $10,000 B Co $12,000 C Co $6,000 A Co calculates its first provisional tax instalment for the 2024 year using the standard uplift method. Under this method, the amount of provisional tax payable for the tax year is based on 105% of the person’s residual income tax for the preceding tax year (here the 2023 year). A Co’s residual income tax for the 2023 year is $28,000, which consists of $10,000 + $12,000 + $6,000. A Co’s provisional tax payable for the tax year is $29,400 (105% of $28,000). Fringe benefit tax 122. An amalgamating company that ceases to exist on amalgamation must file a fringe benefit tax ( FBT) return to the date of amalgamation. The de minimis threshold for unclassified benefits and the threshold for paying FBT on an income basis are apportioned under the amalgamation rules. Applying the de minimis threshold to the amalgamated company 123. The FBT rules contain a de minimis exemption that allows employers to provide unclassified benefits to employees without triggering FBT. The de minimis exemption applies where:  the total taxable value of unclassified benefits provided to each employee is not more than: o $300 per quarter (for employers that pay FBT quarterly); or o $1,200 per annum (for employers that pay FBT annually); and  the total taxable value of unclassified benefits provided to all employees in the last four quarters, including the current quarter, is not more than $22,500 per annum (same threshold applies to annual FBT filers). IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 43 of 49 124. Section RD 46 apportions the de minimis thresholds for the period in which the amalgamation occurs according to the number of days after (Table | Tūtohi 4) or before (Table | Tūtohi 5) the amalgamation. Table | Tūtohi 4: De minimis threshold according to the number of days after amalgamation Amalgamating company pays FBT on: Amalgamating company’s $22,500 annual exemption is reduced by: Quarterly basis $22,500 × number of days in the quarter after amalgamation / days in quarter Annual basis $22,500 × number of days in the year after amalgamation / 365 Table | Tūtohi 5: De minimis threshold according to the number of days before amalgamation Amalgamated company is a new company and pays FBT on: Amalgamated company’s $22,500 annual exemption is reduced by: Quarterly basis $22,500 × number of days in the quarter before amalgamation / days in quarter Annual basis $22,500 × number of days in the year before amalgamation / 365 125. Example | Tauira 20 illustrates how s RD 46 apportions the de minimis threshold when the amalgamating company pays FBT on an annual basis. Example | Tauira 20 – Calculation of de minimis threshold on unclassified benefits where the amalgamating company pays FBT annually A Co and B Co amalgamate on 31 December 2023. A Co continues as the amalgamated company. B Co pays FBT on an annual basis. B Co has a 31 March balance date and provided unclassified benefits to its employees in the income year in which the amalgamation occurred (its 2024 income year). IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 44 of 49 To determine if B Co has to pay FBT on the unclassified benefits provided, the $22,500 de minimis threshold is reduced as follows: $22,500 × 91 15 (n umber of days in the year after the amalgamation)/365 = $5,610 $22,500 – $5,610 = $16,890 That is, for the de minimis exemption to apply, the total taxable value of unclassified benefits that B Co provided in its 2024 income year to the date of amalgamation must be no more than $16,890. Paying FBT on an income year basis – close companies 126. A close company can choose to pay FBT on an income year basis in certain situations. A close company means a company with five or fewer natural persons or trustees who hold more than 50% of the voting interests or market value interests in the company. All natural persons associated at the time are treated as one person. 16 127. One situation where a close company can choose to pay FBT on an income year basis is where its gross PAYE and ESCT deductions in the preceding income year do not exceed a stated threshold (currently, $1 million) (s RD 60(1)(a)). To determine whether the threshold has been met, the amalgamated company is deemed to have paid the gross PAYE and ESCT that the amalgamating company paid in the income year before the income year in which the amalgamation occurred. GST 128. An amalgamation may involve the supply of goods or services (eg, transferring an amalgamating company’s assets to the amalgamated company). 129. No GST implications arise where an amalgamating company supplies any goods or services to the amalgamated company on amalgamation, provided that either of the following conditions is met:  the amalgamated company is registered or liable to be registered for GST immediately after the amalgamation; or  the amalgamating company is not registered or liable to be registered for GST immediately before the amalgamation. 15 2024 is a leap year. 16 See the meaning of “close company” in s YA 1. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 45 of 49 130. Section 61A(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) achieves this outcome by deeming there to be no supply of goods and services by the amalgamating company and no consideration provided by the amalgamated company for the acquisition of those goods and services. The one exception relates to mixed-use assets – see \[134\]). 131. If both conditions described at \[129\] are not met, the amalgamating company is deemed to have supplied any goods and services to the amalgamated company at their market value at the date of amalgamation (s 61A(3) of the GST Act). 132. An amalgamating company that ceases to exist on amalgamation is deemed to end its taxable period when it ceases to exist. It must file a GST return for the taxable period ending on the date of amalgamation. 133. The GST Act contains other specific modifications relating to amalgamations, as outlined below. Mixed-use assets 134. A business can claim input tax deductions on purchases of goods and services it uses to make taxable supplies. Apportionment and adjustment rules apply in certain circumstances when a GST-registered person uses or intends to use goods and services for taxable and non-taxable purposes. Sections 21 to 21H of the GST Act contain the adjustment rules. Where goods have been transferred without GST consequences and later the use of the goods changes, the GST adjustment required is calculated as if the amalgamated company acquired the goods at the same time and for the same cost and purpose as the amalgamating company originally did (s 61A(2)(f) of the GST Act). GST, FBT and entertainment expenditure 135. Where an amalgamating company has provided fringe benefits or incurred entertainment expenditure in the period before amalgamation and is deemed to have made a supply after amalgamation under subs (3) or (4) of s 21I in the GST Act, the supply is deemed to be made by the amalgamated company (not the amalgamating company) on that date (s 61A(4) of the GST Act). 136. Example | Tauira 21 illustrates a situation where an amalgamated company is deemed to supply entertainment because an amalgamating company incurred entertainment expenditure before amalgamation. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 46 of 49 Example | Tauira 21 – Deemed supply of entertainment after amalgamation A Co and B Co amalgamate on 31 March 2024. A Co continues as the amalgamated company. Both A Co and B Co are registered for GST on the date of amalgamation. This means no GST implications arise from any goods or services that B Co supplied to A Co on amalgamation (eg, in transferring B Co’s assets to A Co). Before the amalgamation B Co incurred entertainment expenditure of $10,000 in its 2024 income year (of which 50% is deductible). Under s 21I(4)(a) of the GST Act, B Co is treated as having supplied entertainment with a value equal to the amount of the deduction prevented by ss DD 1 and DD 2 of the Act ($5,000). Section 21I(4)(b) deems the time of supply to be the earlier of the date B Co furnishes its 2024 tax return and the date by which it must furnish its 2024 tax return. B Co filed its tax return on 1 July 2024 (due on 7 July 2024). B Co is deemed to have supplied entertainment on 1 July 2024, a date after it ceased to exist. A Co is deemed to have supplied the entertainment on 1 July 2024. A Co must return the GST component of that supply ($652, being 3/23 × $5,000) as output tax in its GST return that covers the July 2024 period. Bad debts 137. A further modification applies where, if the amalgamation had not occurred, an amalgamating company would have been entitled under s 26 of the GST Act to a deduction against output tax for writing off a bad debt or deemed to have made a taxable supply on recovery of a bad debt. In these circumstances, the amalgamated company is entitled to that deduction or will be charged with that output tax (s 61A(5) of the GST Act). Registration 138. A person carrying on a taxable activity is liable to register for GST if the total value of supplies (ie, the amount of money made from selling goods or services) made in New Zealand was at least $60,000 in the last 12 months or is expected to be at least $60,000 in the next 12 months (s 51(1)(a) of the GST Act). 139. For the purposes of establishing whether an amalgamated company is liable to register for GST under s 51(1)(a) of the GST Act, all the supplies the amalgamating company IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 47 of 49 made before the amalgamation are deemed to have been made by the amalgamated company (s 61A(6) of the GST Act). 140. An amalgamating company that ceases to exist on amalgamation is deemed to end its taxable period when it ceases to exist. It must file a GST return for the taxable period ending on the date of amalgamation (s 15E(3) and (4) of the GST Act). Administrative matters 141. The amalgamated company must give notice of the amalgamation to the Commissioner within 63 working days of (s 75 of the TAA):  delivering the amalgamation documents to the Registrar of Companies (or the equivalent procedure if the amalgamation occurs under foreign law); or  in the case of an amalgamation of building societies, registering the notice of the transfer of all engagements. 142. The amalgamated company notifies the Commissioner of an amalgamation by filing a Declaration of an amalgamation – IR 432. 143. Companies wishing to opt out of the concessionary amalgamation rules must notify the Commissioner of this decision within 63 working days as discussed at \[141\] (s 75 of the TAA). 144. The amalgamated company must make a return of income for the amalgamating company and the tax year in which the amalgamation takes place (s 76(b) of the TAA). 145. If the amalgamation occurs on the last day of the income year, the amalgamating company’s final income tax return is for the full income year (including the day of the amalgamation).

Includes certain transfers between building societies under s 33 of the Building Societies Act 1965. Amalgamating company A company that amalgamates with one or more other companies under an amalgamation. Generally, it includes both any company that ceases to exist after the amalgamation and the continuing company. However, in this statement, unless otherwise specified, amalgamating company means only the company that ceases to exist after an amalgamation. Amalgamated company The company that continues or survives after an amalgamation or a new company (ie, the continuing company). Concessionary amalgamation An amalgamation that is a “resident’s restricted amalgamation” (as defined in s FO 3 the Act) and receives concessionary tax treatment under subpart FO. Non-concessionary amalgamation An amalgamation either that does not meet the criteria for a concessionary amalgamation or that the companies elect not to treat as a concessionary amalgamation. Amalgamation tax year The tax year corresponding to the income year in which the amalgamation takes place. Pre-amalgamation part year In the income year in which the amalgamation takes place, the part of the Page 4 of 40 income year ending with the date of amalgamation. Post-amalgamation part year In the income year in which the amalgamation takes place, the part of the income year that begins on the day following the date of amalgamation. Summary | Whakarāpopoto 1. The general loss rules allow a company with a tax loss component to:  carry forward a tax loss to a subsequent tax year – where the company will use that loss to reduce its net income (if any) or add it to the tax loss for the subsequent tax year; or  share a tax loss with a company in a group of companies that has net income. 2. Special provisions (in subpart IE) apply to tax losses when companies amalgamate. This interpretation statement explains how the provisions in subpart IE apply to the tax losses of an amalgamated company, amalgamating company or a non-amalgamating group company, that arise before amalgamation. 3. The general tax loss rules apply to the tax losses of an amalgamated company or group company that arise after amalgamation. 4. The provisions in subpart IE are closely aligned with the general rules on the carry- forward and grouping of tax losses. This means that the amalgamation rules do not allow a company to:  carry forward losses that would otherwise be lost; or  share its tax losses with a company that it would not otherwise be able to. 5. Subpart IE applies to tax losses including amounts of attributed controlled foreign company (CFC) and foreign investment fund (FIF) net losses on amalgamation. 6. To determine whether an amalgamated company can use a tax loss following an amalgamation, it is important that it maintain records tracking any tax loss components arising before the amalgamation. 7. For a detailed discussion of how the general loss rules apply, including carrying forward losses and sharing losses, see IS 22/07 : Company losses – ownership continuity, sharing and measurement. Because this interpretation statement refers to several of the concepts discussed in IS 22/07, for ease of reference it summarises these concepts in the appendix. Page 5 of 40 Tax losses of an amalgamating company Concessionary amalgamation 8. On a concessionary amalgamation, an amalgamating company’s tax losses survive the amalgamation and are inherited by the amalgamated company if:  the amalgamating company meets one of the continuity tests to the date of amalgamation; and  all of the following companies were at least 66% commonly owned (ie, have commonality) from the start of the income year that the tax loss component arose to the date of amalgamation: o the amalgamating company that incurred the tax loss; o the amalgamated company, unless it was only incorporated on amalgamation; and o any other company that amalgamated with the amalgamated company. 9. An amalgamated company can use a tax loss inherited from an amalgamating company after amalgamation if:  continuity is met for the continuity period; and  commonality is met for the commonality period where the inherited tax loss is shared with a group company after amalgamation. 10. For the purpose of determining if ownership continuity and commonality are met, the amalgamated company is treated for all times before the amalgamation as if it did not separately exist and was instead the amalgamating company, with the same shareholders and option holders. 11. An amalgamated company might undertake a subsequent amalgamation before it uses a tax loss inherited from an amalgamating company on an earlier amalgamation. In this situation, the amalgamated company can only use the inherited tax loss if all of the following companies have commonality for the commonality period:  the amalgamating company that incurred the tax loss that the amalgamated company inherited; and  any company that amalgamated with the amalgamated company before it used the inherited tax loss. Non-concessionary amalgamation 12. On a non-concessionary amalgamation, any tax losses of an amalgamating company that were not used before amalgamation are extinguished. Page 6 of 40 Tax losses of an amalgamated company 13. The treatment of an amalgamated company’s tax losses arising before amalgamation depends on whether they are used in the pre-amalgamation part year or the post- amalgamation part year. 14. In the income year in which the amalgamation takes place, the pre-amalgamation part year is the part of the income year that ends with the date of amalgamation. The post- amalgamation part year is the part of the income year that begins on the day following the date of amalgamation and ends on the last day of the income year. 15. An amalgamated company can use its tax losses arising before the date of amalgamation in the pre-amalgamation part year if it meets:  continuity for the continuity period; and  commonality for the commonality period where the amalgamated company shares the tax loss with a group company. 16. Tax losses of an amalgamated company arising before amalgamation can be carried forward past the date of amalgamation if, from the start of the income year that the tax loss component arose to the date of amalgamation, the following requirements are met:  the amalgamated company meets a continuity test; and  the amalgamated company and any company that amalgamated with the amalgamated company are at least 66% commonly owned. 17. The final requirement is modified for a tax loss component that is an attributed CFC net loss or a FIF net loss. In these cases, the amalgamated and amalgamating companies must be in a wholly owned group. Tax losses of a non-amalgamating group company arising before amalgamation shared with an amalgamated company 18. The commonality requirement is modified where a non-amalgamating group company wants to share tax losses that arose before the date of amalgamation with an amalgamated company. 19. The tax loss can only be shared with the amalgamated company if all of the following companies have commonality for the commonality period:  the group company that incurred the tax loss;  the amalgamated company; and  any company that amalgamated with the amalgamated company. Page 7 of 40 Ordering 20. Tax loss components included in a tax loss must be used in the order that they arose. 21. An amalgamated company may have tax loss components for the same tax year. Where this occurs, the amalgamated company can elect the order in which it uses the losses. The amalgamated company should make this election when it files its income tax return. If the amalgamated company does not make an election, it will use the losses on a pro rata basis. Introduction | Whakataki 22. The general tax loss rules are modified where companies amalgamate. The modifications apply to:  tax losses of an amalgamating company;  tax losses of an amalgamated company that arise before the amalgamation; and  tax losses of a group company that is not a party to the amalgamation where those losses arise before the amalgamation and are to be shared with an amalgamated company. 23. The provisions in subpart IE are closely aligned with the general rules on the carry- forward and grouping of tax losses. This means the concepts that are important in the context of the general loss rules (eg, “tax loss”, “tax loss component”, continuity and commonality) are also important in the context of an amalgamation. Analysis | Tātari 24. This statement considers the provisions in subpart IE. Subpart IE applies to the tax losses of an amalgamated company, amalgamating company or non-amalgamating group company that arise before amalgamation. 25. Different rules apply depending on whether the tax losses are losses of an amalgamating company, an amalgamated company or a group company that is not a party to the amalgamation. For this reason, this statement considers the tax losses of amalgamating companies, amalgamated companies and non-amalgamating group companies separately. Page 8 of 40 Tax losses of an amalgamating company 26. Where an amalgamating company has not used a tax loss before the date of amalgamation, the amalgamated company can use that tax loss after the amalgamation if the criteria in s IE 2 is met. 27. This section first considers when a tax loss of an amalgamating company is available to the amalgamated company (inherited). Second, it discusses when an amalgamated company can use an inherited tax loss after amalgamation. When an amalgamated company inherits the tax loss of an amalgamating company 28. An amalgamated company inherits the tax loss of an amalgamating company if the amalgamating company:  meets a continuity test;  ends its existence on a concessionary amalgamation;  has a tax loss for a tax year that it has not used before the date of amalgamation; and  has a tax loss that could be made available and subtracted from the net income for the pre-amalgamation part year of: o the amalgamated company, unless it was only incorporated on amalgamation; and o any company that amalgamated with the amalgamated company. 29. Each requirement is discussed further below. Additional considerations for an amalgamated company using a tax loss inherited from an amalgamating company are discussed from \[45\]. Meets a continuity test 30. Section IE 2 applies only where an amalgamating company has a tax loss. An amalgamating company will only have a tax loss if it meets the ownership continuity test or the business continuity test. The appendix describes these tests from \[A8\]. Ends its existence on a concessionary amalgamation 31. Section IE 2 applies only to an amalgamating company that ends its existence on a concessionary amalgamation. For a discussion of the requirements for an amalgamation to be a concessionary amalgamation, see IS XX/XX: Income tax and GST – Amalgamations guidance from \[14\] to \[18\]. This statement discusses the tax Page 9 of 40 treatment of an amalgamating company’s tax losses on a non-concessionary amalgamation from \[43\]. Amalgamating company’s tax loss has not been used before the date of amalgamation 32. Where an amalgamating company has not used a tax loss before the date of amalgamation, the amalgamated company can inherit that tax loss. 33. An amalgamating company might use a tax loss before the date of amalgamation. A loss balance carried forward to a tax year must first be used to reduce the net income (if any) of the company for the tax year. 1 Example | Tauira 1 illustrates an amalgamating company that uses some of its tax losses before the date of amalgamation. 34. An amalgamating company can use a tax loss in a few other ways. The main one is to share it with another company in the same group of companies. For information on this and the other ways of using a tax loss, see \[43\] in IS 22/07. Able to share the tax loss with the amalgamated company and any other company that has amalgamated with the amalgamated company 35. An amalgamating company’s tax loss must be one that “could” be made available and subtracted from the net income for the pre-amalgamation part year of:  the amalgamated company, unless it was only incorporated on amalgamation; 2 and  any other company that amalgamated with the amalgamated company. 3 36. The focus is on the ability of the amalgamating company to share its losses in a general sense. The amount of tax loss an amalgamated company inherits is not limited to the amount of net income of the amalgamated company (or any company that amalgamated with the amalgamated company) in the pre-amalgamation part year. 37. Generally, an amalgamating company’s tax loss could be made available if, from the start of the income year when the tax loss component arose to the date of amalgamation, 4 the following requirements are met: 1 Section IA 4(1). 2 Section IE 2(4). 3 Section IE 2(3). 4 Subject to the application of the part-year rules. Page 10 of 40  the amalgamating company is either incorporated in New Zealand or carrying on a business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand; 5  the amalgamating company meets a continuity test; and  all of the following companies are at least 66% commonly owned (ie, have commonality): 6 o the amalgamating company that incurred the tax loss; o the amalgamated company, unless it was only incorporated on amalgamation; and o any company that amalgamated with the amalgamated company. 38. Example | Tauira 1 illustrates a situation where an amalgamated company inherits the tax loss of an amalgamating company because it has the required commonality of ownership with the amalgamating company. Example | Tauira 2 illustrates a situation where an amalgamated company does not inherit the amalgamating company’s tax loss because it does not have the required commonality of ownership with the amalgamating company. Example | Tauira 1 – Amalgamated company inherits amalgamating company’s tax loss A Co and B Co amalgamate on 31 March 2024. A Co is the amalgamated company. The shareholdings of A Co and B Co have been the same since incorporation and are as follows: 5 Sections IC 5(1)(b) and IC 7. For further information on this requirement, see \[62\] to \[67\] of IS 22/07. 6 Sections IC 2, IE 2(1)(b) and IE 2(3). Page 11 of 40 B Co has a tax loss carried forward to its 2024 income year of $100,000. The tax loss arose in B Co’s 2023 income year. B Co has net income in its 2024 income year of $50,000. B Co’s use of its tax loss before the date of amalgamation B Co meets a continuity test (ie, ownership continuity) from the start of the income year when the tax loss component arose (1 April 2022) to the end of the 2024 income year (31 March 2024). B Co must use $50,000 of the tax loss carried forward of $100,000 to offset its net income in the 2024 income year. Inheriting tax loss The tax loss of B Co that it does not use before the date of amalgamation is $50,000. A Co will inherit B Co’s remaining tax loss balance of $ 50,000 if B Co meets a continuity test and A Co and B Co are at least 66% commonly owned from the start of the income year when the tax loss component arose (1 April 2022) until the date of amalgamation (31 March 2024). The diagram below shows the continuity and commonality tests required to be met. Based on the shareholdings of A Co and B Co above, A Co and B Co were at least 66% commonly owned (A Co and B Co were 70% commonly owned) and so A Co inherits B Co’s tax loss of $50,000. Shareholder A Co (1 April 2022 to 31 March 2024) B Co (1 April 2022 to 31 March 2024) Commonality of voting interests C 70% 70% 70% Page 12 of 40 D 30% 0% 0% E 0% 30% 0% 70% Example | Tauira 2 – Amalgamated company does not inherit the amalgamating company’s tax losses A Co and B Co amalgamate on 31 March 2024. A Co is the amalgamated company. A Co acquired 100% of the shares in B Co on 1 April 2023. Before 1 April 2023, the shareholdings of A Co and B Co were as follows: At the date of amalgamation, B Co has tax losses of $75,000. The tax losses arose in the 2022 income year and B Co carries them forward on the basis that it meets the business continuity test. A Co and B Co are 100% commonly owned from 1 April 2023 to the date of amalgamation. However, based on the shareholdings above, A Co and B Co were not at least 66% commonly owned from the start of the income year when the tax loss component arose (1 April 2021) until 31 March 2023 (A Co and B Co had no common ownership). It follows that A Co does not inherit B Co’s tax loss on amalgamation. Shareholder A Co (1 April 2021 to 31 March 2023) B Co (1 April 2021 to 31 March 2023) Commonality of voting interests C 100% 0% 0% D 0% 100% 0% 0% 39. An amalgamated company that is incorporated only on amalgamation does not need to have commonality with the amalgamating company that incurred the tax loss. Page 13 of 40 However, if the amalgamation involves more than one amalgamating company, the amalgamating company that incurred the loss must have commonality with the other company or companies that amalgamated with the amalgamated company. Example | Tauira 3 illustrates an amalgamation where the amalgamated company is incorporated only on amalgamation. Example | Tauira 3 – Amalgamating company’s tax losses inherited by an amalgamated company that is incorporated only on amalgamation B Co and C Co amalgamate on 31 March 2024. The amalgamated company (A Co) is a new company incorporated on amalgamation. The shareholdings of B Co and C Co have been the same since incorporation and are as follows: At the date of amalgamation, B Co has tax losses of $10,000. The tax losses arose in B Co’s 2022 income year. Based on the shareholdings of B Co and C Co above, B Co and C Co were at least 66% commonly owned (B Co and C Co were 66% commonly owned) from the start of the income year that the tax loss component arose (1 April 2021) until the date of amalgamation (31 March 2024). Accordingly, A Co inherits B Co’s tax loss of $10,000. Shareholder B Co (1 April 2021 to 31 March 2024) C Co (1 April 2021 to 31 March 2024) Commonality of voting interests D 80% 66% 66% E 20% 0% 0% Page 14 of 40 F 0% 34% 0% 66% 40. Sometimes an amalgamated company undertakes multiple separate amalgamations. In this case, the requirements go beyond the 66% commonality of ownership between the amalgamating company and amalgamated company described at \[37\]. Specifically, there must also be 66% commonality of ownership between the amalgamating company that incurred the loss and any other company that amalgamated with the amalgamated company before or on the date of amalgamation. 41. Example | Tauira 4 illustrates the continuity and commonality tests that must be met for an amalgamated company to inherit the tax loss of an amalgamating company where the amalgamated company has undertaken multiple amalgamations. Example | Tauira 4 – Inheriting an amalgamating company’s tax loss when the amalgamated company has undertaken multiple amalgamations A Co and B Co amalgamate on 31 March 2024. A Co is the amalgamated company. B Co has a tax loss than arose in the year ended 31 March 2023. A Co wants to know if it will inherit B Co’s tax loss. A Co will inherit B Co’s tax loss if from the start of the income year that the tax loss component arose (1 April 2022) to the date of amalgamation (31 March 2024):  B Co meets a continuity test; and  A Co, B Co and any other company A Co amalgamated with are at least 66% commonly owned. A Co undertook an earlier amalgamation. A Co amalgamated with C Co on 30 June 2023. A Co was the amalgamated company. It follows that A Co, B Co and C Co must be at least 66% commonly owned in the period from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2024 if A Co is to inherit B Co’s tax loss. The diagram below shows the continuity and commonality tests required to be met. Page 15 of 40 42. Sometimes the continuity or commonality test will be satisfied for part of an income year only (as opposed to from the start of the income year when the loss component arose). The outcome is that the amalgamated company might inherit some but not all of the amalgamating company’s tax losses. Example | Tauira 5 illustrates a situation where an amalgamating company and amalgamated company have commonality for part of an income year only. Example | Tauira 5 – Commonality met part-way through an income year A Co and B Co amalgamate on 31 March 2024. A Co is the amalgamated company. At the date of amalgamation, B Co had unused tax losses carried forward from the 2023 income year of $100,000. Since incorporation, C has had 100% ownership of A Co. From the date of incorporation to 30 June 2022, C held 50% of the shares in B Co and D held the other 50%. On 30 June 2022, C increased their shareholding in B Co to 70%. That is, A Co and B Co were at least 66% commonly owned from 30 June 2022. B Co determines that $40,000 of its net loss of $100,000 arose in the part of the year when A Co and B Co were commonly owned (ie, from 30 June 2022 to 31 March 2023). Page 16 of 40 A Co inherits the part of B Co’s tax loss ($40,000) that arose in the period where A Co and B Co were at least 66% commonly owned. Non-concessionary amalgamation 43. As discussed at \[28\], one of the requirements that must be met for an amalgamated company to inherit an amalgamating company’s tax loss is that the amalgamating company ends its existence on a concessionary amalgamation. 44. The tax losses of an amalgamating company on a non-concessionary amalgamation are extinguished. Example | Tauira 6 illustrates what happens to the tax losses of an amalgamating company on a non-concessionary amalgamation. Example | Tauira 6 – Extinguishment of an amalgamating company’s tax loss on a non- concessionary amalgamation A Co and B Co amalgamate on 30 June 2024. A Co is the amalgamated company. The companies notify the Commissioner of their decision to treat the amalgamation as a non-concessionary amalgamation. B Co incurs a tax loss of $2,000 in its 2024 income year that it cannot use before the date of amalgamation. A Co does not inherit B Co’s tax loss of $2,000 because the amalgamation is a non-concessionary amalgamation. Amalgamated company using an inherited tax loss 45. The general tax loss rules set out how a company can use a tax loss. They contain specific rules and concessions on measuring the continuity of ownership (eg, notional single person). Page 17 of 40 46. Section IE 2 modifies how these rules apply where an amalgamated company inherited the tax loss from an amalgamating company on a concessionary amalgamation. 7 47. To determine whether an amalgamated company meets the ownership continuity and commonality tests so that it can use the tax loss, or the tax loss can be subtracted from the net income of a group company after amalgamation, the amalgamated company is treated for all times before the amalgamation as if it did not separately exist and was instead the amalgamating company, with the same shareholders and option holders. 48. The following paragraphs set out how s IE 2 applies in each situation and include examples. Continuity test 49. Generally, an amalgamated company can use an inherited tax loss if it meets a continuity test from the start of the income year that the tax loss component arose until the end of the income year in which it is to use the loss. 8 Where the inherited tax loss was carried forward by the amalgamating company under the business continuity test, the amalgamated company must also meet the business continuity test. This statement does not consider the business continuity test requirements. For guidance on the main aspects of the business continuity test, see IS 22/06 : Loss carry-forward – continuity of business activities. 50. For the purposes of the Act the amalgamated company is treated for all times before the amalgamation as if it did not separately exist and was instead the amalgamating companies, with the same shareholders and option holders. This means that from the start of the income year when the tax loss component arose to the date of amalgamation, ownership co ntinuity is considered based on the shareholding of the amalgamating company. From the date of amalgamation to the end of the income year in which the loss is used, ownership continuity is considered in relation to the shareholding of the amalgamated company. 51. Example | Tauira 7 illustrates how the ownership continuity test applies to an amalgamated company wanting to use a tax loss it inherits from an amalgamating company to offset net income arising after amalgamation. 52. If an amalgamated company inherits tax losses of one or more amalgamating companies, the losses of each amalgamating company need to be tracked separately to determine if the amalgamated company meets the continuity requirement for the relevant continuity period. 7 See ss IE 2(2) and IE 5. 8 Subject to application of the part-year rules. Page 18 of 40 Example | Tauira 7 – Ownership continuity of amalgamated company after an amalgamation A Co and B Co amalgamate on 31 March 2023. A Co is the amalgamated company. B Co incurred a $50,000 loss in the 2022 income year that it carried forward to the 2023 income year. The commonality of ownership test was met at the date of amalgamation and A Co inherited the tax loss of B Co. A Co now wishes to use the tax loss to offset its net income derived in the 2024 income year. The shareholding of B Co from the start of the income year in which the loss arose (1 April 2021) to the date of amalgamation remained the same. The shareholding of A Co from the date of amalgamation to the end of the 2024 income year (31 March 2024) has remained the same. A Co can use the tax loss inherited from B Co if it meets a continuity test from the start of the income year in which the loss arose (1 April 2021) to the date when it will use the loss (31 March 2024). To determine ownership continuity, A Co is treated as if it had B Co’s shareholders before the amalgamation and its own shareholders after the amalgamation. Shareholder 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2023 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024 Continuity of voting interest C 5% 17% 5% Page 19 of 40 D 65% 57% 57% E 30% 26% 26% 88% Because ownership continuity is maintained, A Co:  does not need to consider the business continuity test; and  can use the tax loss inherited from B Co to offset its net income in the 2024 income year. Notional single person 53. Sometimes the shareholding of an amalgamating company and an amalgamated company includes ownership interests of less than 10% in a company that are treated as held by a “notional single person”. 9 The notional single person rule allows smaller ownership interests to be tracked together as a group. It applies where a person:  has a direct ownership interest in a company of less than 10%; and  is not a company that is associated with the subject company. 54. For further information on the notional single person rule, see \[165\] to \[178\] of IS 22/07 . 55. If the shareholdings of an amalgamating company and an amalgamated company each include a notional single person, the notional single person in the amalgamating company and the notional single person in the amalgamated company are treated as the same person after the amalgamation when calculating ownership continuity. 10 Example | Tauira 8 illustrates how this works. Example | Tauira 8 – Ownership continuity where the amalgamating company and amalgamated company have a notional single person A Co and B Co amalgamate on 31 March 2024. A Co is the amalgamated company. A Co and B Co both have several shareholders who each hold an ownership interest of less than 10% in the company. The company treats them as a notional single person. The shareholdings of A Co and B Co are as follows: 9 Section YC 10. 10 The notional single person rule does not apply when determining if commonality is satisfied. Page 20 of 40 Shareholder B Co (to 31 March 2024) A Co (on 1 April 2024) Continuity of voting interest C 15% 45% 15% D 45% 20% 20% Notional single person 40% 35% 35% 70% Subsequent amalgamations 56. An amalgamated company might undertake a subsequent amalgamation before it uses a tax loss it inherited from an amalgamating company on an earlier amalgamation. 57. In this situation, an amalgamated company can only use the inherited tax loss if all the following companies are at least 66% commonly owned for the commonality period:  the amalgamating company that incurred the tax loss inherited by the amalgamated company; and  any company that amalgamated with the amalgamated company before the amalgamated company can use the inherited tax loss. 58. Example | Tauira 9 illustrates a situation where an amalgamated company is unable to use an inherited tax loss because the amalgamating company that incurred the tax loss did not have the required commonality with a company that amalgamated with the amalgamated company before it was to use the loss. Example | Tauira 9 – Where an amalgamated company cannot use an inherited tax loss following a subsequent amalgamation A Co and B Co amalgamate on 1 April 2022 . A Co amalgamates with C Co on 1 September 2022. A Co is the amalgamated company in each amalgamation. The shareholdings of A Co, B Co and C Co remained unchanged since incorporation and are as follows: Page 21 of 40 B Co incurred a loss in the year ended 31 March 2021 that A Co inherited on amalgamation on the basis that:  B Co met the ownership continuity test; and  A Co and B Co were at least 66% commonly owned from the start of the income year when the tax loss arose until the amalgamation date. A Co derives net income in the 2024 income year. A Co cannot use the tax loss it inherited from B Co on amalgamation to offset against its net income in the 2024 income year. Based on the shareholdings of B Co and C Co above, B Co and C Co were not at least 66% commonly owned from the start of the income year in which the loss arose (1 April 2020) to the amalgamation date (1 September 2022). B Co and C Co were only 30% commonly owned. Shareholder B Co (1 April 2020 to 1 September 2022) C Co (1 April 2020 to 1 September 2022) Commonality of voting interests D 70% 0% 0% E 0% 0% 0% F 30% 100% 30% 30% Page 22 of 40 Sharing an amalgamated company’s inherited loss with a group company after amalgamation 59. Under the general tax loss rules, a loss company 11 can share a tax loss with a profit company if:  the loss company is either incorporated in New Zealand or carrying on a business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand; 12  notification and payment requirements are met; 13  the loss company meets a continuity requirement; 14 and  the profit company and the loss company meet ownership commonality requirements. 15 60. For a detailed discussion of the requirements under the general tax loss rules that companies need to meet in order to share losses, see \[60\] to \[113\] of IS 22/07. 61. To determine if the required commonality of ownership is met where the loss company is an amalgamated company and the tax loss being shared is an inherited tax loss, the amalgamated company is treated in respect of the inherited loss as if it had the amalgamating company’s shareholders before the date of amalgamation and its own shareholders from the date of amalgamation. Example | Tauira 10 illustrates how this works. Example | Tauira 10 – Amalgamated company offsetting inherited tax loss against net income of a company that was not involved in the amalgamation In Example | Tauira 7 A Co amalgamated with B Co on 31 March 2023. A Co (the amalgamated company) inherited B Co’s tax loss on amalgamation and used the tax loss to offset its net income derived in the 2024 income year. Assume that A Co from Example | Tauira 7 had no net income in the 2024 income year and instead seeks to offset the tax loss inherited from B Co against C Co’s net income (a non-amalgamation group company) in the 2024 income year. The shareholding of C Co has not changed since it was incorporated and is as follows 11 For the purpose of this statement the terms “loss company” means a company that has a tax loss component that it can use, and “profit company” means a company that has net income. 12 Sections IC 5(1)(b) and IC 7. For further information on this requirement, see \[62\] to \[67\] of IS 22/07. 13 See ss IC 8 and IC 9. 14 See s IC 2(1). 15 See s IC 2(2) . Page 23 of 40 For A Co to offset the losses it inherited from B Co against net income of C Co arising after the date of amalgamation, A Co and C Co must be at least 66% commonly owned from the start of the income year in which the loss arose (1 April 2021) until the end of C Co’s 2024 income year (31 March 2024). In measuring the commonality of shareholding between A Co and C Co to the date of amalgamation, A Co’s shareholding is based on the shareholding of B Co. As discussed at Example | Tauira 7, the shareholding of B Co from the start of the income year in which the loss arose (1 April 2021) to the date of amalgamation is as follows: Shareholder B Co ( 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2023) C Co (1 April 2021 to 31 March 2023) Commonality of voting interest C 5% 30% 5% D 65% 50% 50% E 30% 20% 20% 75% As B Co and C Co meet the commonality test from the start of the income year in which B Co incurred the loss to the date of amalgamation, the commonality test must next be applied to the shareholding of A Co after the amalgamation. As discussed at Example | Tauira 7 above, the shareholding of A Co from the date of amalgamation to the end of the 2024 income year (31 March 2024) is as follows: Page 24 of 40 Shareholder A Co (1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024) C Co (1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024) Commonality of voting interest C 17% 30% 17% D 57% 50% 50% E 26% 20% 20% 87% As the commonality test is met before and after amalgamation, A Co can offset the net income of C Co against the losses A Co inherited from B Co on amalgamation. Tax losses of an amalgamated company 62. Section IE 3 applies to an amalgamated company in relation to either or both of the following (referred to in this item as the pre-amalgamation loss):  a tax loss balance carried forward to the year of amalgamation for which a continuity test is met up to the date of amalgamation; and/or  the part of the net loss in the amalgamation tax year that relates to the pre- amalgamation part year. 63. Tax losses of an amalgamated company arising after amalgamation are considered under the general tax loss rules. 64. This section applies to the tax losses of an amalgamated company on a concessionary amalgamation and a non-concessionary amalgamation. Page 25 of 40 Pre-amalgamation part year and post-amalgamation part year 65. For the purposes of s IE 3 only, the year of amalgamation is treated as two separate tax years. The pre-amalgamation part year is the part of the income year that ends with the date of amalgamation. The post-amalgamation part year is the part of the income year that begins on the day following the date of amalgamation and ends on the last day of the income year. For example, an amalgamated company has a standard balance date (31 March) and amalgamates on 30 June 2023. The pre-amalgamation part year is the period that starts on 1 April 2023 and ends on 30 June 2023. The post- amalgamation part year is the period that starts on 1 July 2023 and ends on 31 March 2024. 66. Sometimes an amalgamation will take place at the end of the income year such that the pre-amalgamation part year is the entire income year. For example, an amalgamated company has a standard balance date (31 March) and amalgamates on 31 March 2024. The pre-amalgamation part year is the period that starts on 1 April 2023 and ends on 31 March 2024. 67. How section IE 3 applies to the pre-amalgamation part year and post-amalgamation part year is discussed further from \[69\]. 68. Treating the year of amalgamation as two separate years for the purposes of s IE 3 does not mean that the amalgamated company needs to file two separate income tax returns for the year of amalgamation. An amalgamated company continues to calculate its taxable income in the year of amalgamation in accordance with subpart BC (of the core provisions in Part B). Pre-amalgamation tax losses used or made available in the pre- amalgamation part year (s IE 3(2)) 69. An amalgamated company that has net income in the year of amalgamation may have a tax loss balance carried forward to the year of amalgamation. In this situation where the amalgamated company meets a continuity test up to the date of amalgamation, the tax loss must first be subtracted from the part of the net income that relates to the pre-amalgamation part year. 16 Example | Tauira 14 illustrates a situation where an amalgamated company uses part of its pre-amalgamation losses in the pre- amalgamation part year. 70. The amalgamated company may make any unused tax loss balance available to a group company for subtraction from the part of the group company’s net income in 16 See ss IE 3(2) and IA 4(1). Page 26 of 40 the amalgamation tax year that relates to the pre-amalgamation part year. This applies provided the commonality test under the general loss grouping rules is met. 17 71. Similarly, if the amalgamated company has a net loss in the year of amalgamation, it may share the part of the net loss that relates to the pre-amalgamation part year with a group company and subtract it from the part of the group company’s net income in the amalgamation tax year that relates to the pre-amalgamation part year. This applies provided the commonality test under the general loss grouping rules is met. Pre-amalgamation tax losses used or made available after amalgamation (s IE 3(3)) 72. A pre-amalgamation loss of an amalgamated company not used or made available in the pre-amalgamation part year may only be carried forward past the date of amalgamation (to the post-amalgamation part year), if both of the following requirements are met:  the amalgamated company meets a continuity test from the start of the income year in which the loss arose to the date of amalgamation; and  the pre-amalgamation loss could have been made available to an amalgamating company and subtracted from its net income calculated for the pre- amalgamation part year. 73. As discussed at \[36\], the second requirement is focused on the ability of an amalgamated company to share its pre-amalgamation losses with the amalgamating companies in a general sense. It follows that the amalgamating company is not required to have net income for the pre-amalgamation part year against which it could, in fact, have offset the amalgamated company’s pre-amalgamation loss. 74. An amalgamated company could make its tax loss available to an amalgamating company to offset against its net income for the pre-amalgamation part year if, from the start of the income year that the tax loss component arose to the date of amalgamation, the following requirements are met:  the amalgamated company is either incorporated in New Zealand or carrying on a business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand; 18  the amalgamated company meets a continuity test; and  the amalgamated company and any company that amalgamated with it are at least 66% commonly owned. 17 See s IE 3(2). 18 Sections IC 5(1)(b) and IC 7. For further information on this requirement, see \[62\] to \[67\] of IS 22/07. Page 27 of 40 75. The final requirement is modified for a tax loss component that is an attributed controlled foreign company (CFC) net loss or a foreign investment fund (FIF) net loss. In these cases, the amalgamated and amalgamating companies must be in a wholly owned group. 76. Example | Tauira 11 Example | Tauira 11 illustrates a situation where an amalgamated company is able to use a pre-amalgamation tax loss to offset net income arising after the amalgamation because the amalgamated company and amalgamating company were at least 66% commonly owned. Example | Tauira 12 discusses a situation where the amalgamated company’s pre-amalgamation losses carried forward under the business continuity test are sought to be used after the amalgamation. Example | Tauira 13 illustrates a situation where an amalgamated company cannot use a pre- amalgamation tax loss to offset net income arising after the amalgamation because the amalgamated and amalgamating companies were not at least 66% commonly owned when the pre-amalgamation tax loss arose. Example | Tauira 14 illustrates the different tests that apply to pre-amalgamation tax losses used before and after amalgamation. Example | Tauira 11 – Amalgamated company using its pre-amalgamation tax loss to offset net income arising after the amalgamation A Co and B Co amalgamate on 31 March 2023. A Co is the amalgamated company. A Co incurred a loss of $30,000 in the year ended 31 March 2022 and derived net income in the year ended 31 March 2024 of $40,000. Prior to the amalgamation the shareholdings of each company (unchanged since incorporation) were as follows: Page 28 of 40 After the amalgamation, the shareholding in A Co is as follows A Co can offset its tax loss that arose before the amalgamation (the 2022 income year) against its net income arising after the amalgamation (the 2024 income year) if the continuity and commonality tests are met. Continuity of shareholding Based on the shareholdings above, A Co meets the ownership continuity test from the start of the income year in which the loss arose (1 April 2021) to the date the loss is used (31 March 2024). Shareholder A Co (1 April 2021) A Co (31 March 2024) Continuity of voting interest C 20% 19% 19% D 45% 45.5% 45% E 35% 35.5% 35% 99% Commonality of shareholding Based on the shareholdings above, A Co and B Co were at least 66% commonly owned from the beginning of the year in which the loss arose until the date of amalgamation (A Co and B Co were 90% commonly owned). Accordingly, A Co can offset its pre- amalgamation tax loss against its net income in the 2024 income year. Shareholder B Co ( 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2023) A Co (1 April 2021 to 31 March 2023) Commonality of voting interest C 10% 20% 10% D 50% 45% 45% E 40% 35% 35% Page 29 of 40 90% Example | Tauira 12 – Amalgamated company’s pre-amalgamation losses carried forward under the business continuity test are sought to be used after the amalgamation A Co and B Co (both New Zealand resident companies) have had common ownership since they were incorporated. A Co incurred a $10,000 loss in its 2022 income year that it carried forward to its 2024 income year based on the business continuity test (following a 100% change in the shareholding of both A Co and B Co on 31 March 2022). A Co and B Co amalgamate on 31 March 2023. A Co is the amalgamated company. A Co seeks to offset the $10,000 loss against its net income arising in the 2024 income year. Under s IE 3 , A Co can carry forward its 2022 losses past the date of amalgamation on the basis that:  it meets a continuity test from the start of the income year in which the loss arose to the date of amalgamation; and  the pre-amalgamation loss of $10,000 could have been made available to B Co and subtracted from its net income in the year of amalgamation (as A Co and B Co were at least 66% commonly owned from the start of the income year in which the loss arose (1 April 2021) to the date of amalgamation (31 March 2023)). A Co can use its 2022 tax loss to offset its net income arising in the 2024 income year if it continues to satisfy the business continuity test under subpart IB. In this case as A Co and B Co are both New Zealand resident companies and were part of the same group of companies immediately before and immediately after the ownership continuity breach (on 31 March 2022), A Co and B Co are treated as a single company for the purposes of applying subpart IB 3. It follows that the amalgamation of A Co and B Co should not itself result in a major change to the business of A Co. Page 30 of 40 Example | Tauira 13 – Amalgamated company cannot use pre-amalgamation tax losses following an amalgamation with a subsidiary that was incorporated after the tax loss components arose A Co amalgamates with its wholly owned subsidiary B Co on 31 March 2023. A Co is the amalgamated company. A Co has had the same shareholding since incorporation. At the end of its 2023 income year (31 March 2023), A Co has a tax loss balance of $50,000. The losses arose in the 2014 to 2018 income years. B Co was incorporated during the 2020 income year (1 February 2020) for the purpose of protecting a name for a business opportunity that A Co was considering. The business never eventuated, and A Co decided to amalgamate with B Co as part of tidying its corporate structure. A Co has net income in its 2024 income year that it wants to offset against its losses of $50,000. It can offset its net income arising after the amalgamation if the continuity and commonality tests illustrated below are met. A Co cannot use its pre-amalgamation losses after the amalgamation with B Co as A Co and B Co were not commonly owned at the time that A Co’s losses arose. B Co was not incorporated until after A Co’s losses arose. Example | Tauira 14 – Pre-amalgamation losses used before and after amalgamation A Co and B Co (both of which have a 31 March balance date) amalgamate on 30 June 2023. A Co is the amalgamated company. Page 31 of 40 The shareholding of A Co has remained unchanged since incorporation. A Co and B Co were 100% commonly owned from 1 April 2022. Prior to this date A Co owned 30% of B Co’s shares. A Co derives net income in the year of amalgamation (year ended 31 March 2024) of $35,000. A Co is working out if its pre-amalgamation losses can be offset against its net income in the year of amalgamation. A Co’s loss balances are as follows: Year ending 31 March 2021 31 March 2022 31 March 2023 A Co Tax loss component by year ($10,000) ($5,000) ($20,000) Loss balance at year end ($10,000) ($15,000) ($35,000) In the year of amalgamation, A Co’s net income in the pre-amalgamation part year and post-amalgamation part year is as follows: Pre-amalgamation net income Post-amalgamation net income Net income for 2024 income year A Co $10,000 $25,000 $35,000 A Co’s pre-amalgamation losses can be used to offset the net income arising in the pre-amalgamation part year (treating the pre-amalgamation part year as if it were a separate tax year) if a continuity test is met. As ownership continuity is met A Co can offset its pre-amalgamation loss against its net income in the pre-amalgamation part year of (as shown in the table above, $10,000). A Co’s earliest tax loss is from the 2021 income year. The tax loss component in the 2021 income year happens to equal the amount of the A Co’s net income in the pre- amalgamation part year of $10 ,000, so is fully used. A Co’s remaining pre-amalgamation loss is as follows: Year ending 31 March 2021 31 March 2022 31 March 2023 A Co Loss balance at year end ($10,000) ($5,000) ($25,000) Page 32 of 40 Use of tax losses prior to amalgamation $10,000 - - Remaining tax loss - (5,000) ($25,000) The balance of A Co’s pre-amalgamation losses can only be used after amalgamation if the pre-amalgamation losses could have been subtracted from B Co’s net income calculated for the pre-amalgamation part year. As A Co and B Co were only at least 66% commonly owned from 1 April 2022 (the start of the 2023 income year), A Co’s tax loss component arising in the 2022 income year ($5,000) cannot be used by A Co to offset its net income, or net income of a group company, after the amalgamation. As A Co and B Co meet the commonality test in relation to A Co’ tax loss component arising in the 2023 income year ($20,000), those losses can be used to offset (in part) A Co’s net income arising in the post-amalgamation part year ($25,000). Sharing a non-amalgamating group company’s loss arising in the pre-amalgamation part year with an amalgamated company after amalgamation 77. The general tax rules as to when a loss company can share a tax loss with a profit company are discussed at \[59\]. 19 A further requirement must be met where a non- amalgamating group company wants to share tax losses that arose before the date of amalgamation with an amalgamated company after amalgamation. 78. The tax loss can only be shared with the amalgamated company if all of the following companies have commonality for the commonality period: 20  the group company that incurred the tax loss;  the amalgamated company; and  any company that amalgamated with the amalgamated company. 19 Different rules apply where the tax loss component is an attributed CFC net loss or a FIF net loss (see s IQ 4). 20 Where the tax loss component is an attributed CFC net loss or a FIF net loss, the requirements in s IQ 4 must be met. This includes the requirement that the group of companies are in a wholly owned group of companies. Page 33 of 40 79. Example | Tauira 15 illustrates where the tax loss of a non-amalgamating group company arising before amalgamation could be offset against the net income of an amalgamated company because the non-amalgamating group company, amalgamated company and the amalgamating company were at least 66% commonly owned. Example | Tauira 15 – Non-amalgamating group company offsets tax losses arising before amalgamation A Co and B Co amalgamate on 31 March 2023. A Co is the amalgamated company. The shareholdings of each company have remained unchanged since incorporation and are as follows: After the amalgamation, the shareholding of A Co is as follows: Z Co (a non-amalgamating group company) has losses from the 2022 income year, which it wants to offset against the net income of A Co in the 2024 income year. The shareholding of Z Co has remained unchanged since incorporation and is as follows: Page 34 of 40 The losses of Z Co arose before the date of amalgamation. Accordingly, Z Co can share its losses with A Co if Z Co meets a continuity test and the following commonal ity tests. Commonality of shareholding between B Co (amalgamating company) and Z Co is at least 66% from the start of the income year in which the loss arose (1 April 2021) to the date of amalgamation (31 March 2023) Shareholder B Co Z Co Commonality of voting interest C 20% 30% 20% D 45% 50% 45% E 35% 20% 20% 85% Commonality of shareholding between A Co (amalgamated company) and Z Co is at least 66% from the start of the income year in which the loss arose (1 April 2021) to the date of amalgamation (31 March 2023) Shareholder A Co Z Co Commonality of voting interest C 10% 30% 10% D 50% 50% 50% E 40% 20% 20% 80% Commonality of shareholding between A Co (amalgamated company) and Z Co is at least 66% after amalgamation (1 April 2023) until the date of offset (31 March 2024) Page 35 of 40 Shareholder A Co Z Co Common voting interest C 19% 30% 19% D 45.5% 50% 45.5% E 35.5% 20% 20% 84.5% As A Co, B Co and Z Co were at least 66% commonly owned from the start of the income year in which the losses arose until the date of offset, Z Co can offset its losses against A Co’s net income in the 2024 income year. Ordering of tax losses 80. Tax loss components included in a tax loss must be used in the order that they arose (s IA 9(1)). 81. An amalgamated company may have tax loss components for the same tax year. Where this occurs, the amalgamated company can elect the order in which it uses the losses. The amalgamated company should make this election when it files its income tax return. If the amalgamated company does not make an election, it will use the losses on a pro rata basis (s IA 9(3)). 82. Example | Tauira 16 illustrates how the ordering rules apply when an amalgamated company has tax loss components for the same tax year. Example | Tauira 16 – Using tax losses that arose in the same income year A Co amalgamates with B Co, C Co and D Co on 31 March 2023. A Co is the amalgamated company. A Co has net income in its 2024 income year of $30,000. A Co, C Co and D Co incurred losses in prior years as follows: A Co: $10,000; 2021 income year C Co: $30,000; 2022 income year D Co: $20,000; 2022 income year A Co files its 2024 income tax return without making any notification to the Commissioner about the order in which it will use its 2022 tax losses. Page 36 of 40 C Co’s 2022 tax loss ($30,000) is 60% of the total 2022 tax loss ($50,000) (30,000/50,000 = 60%) and D’s tax loss is 40% of the total 2022 tax losses. It follows that A Co’s losses will be used in this way: Net income $30,000 Losses from 2021 income year (A Co) ($10,000) Losses from 2022 income year (C Co) ($12,000) (60% of the remaining net income of A Co following the offset of its 2021 tax loss ($20,000)) Losses from 2022 income year (D Co) ($8,000) (40% of the remaining net income of A Co following the offset of its 2021 tax loss ($20,000)) The losses A Co carries forward to the 2025 income year are as follows: C Co: $18,000; 2022 income year D Co: $12,000; 2022 income year Alternatively, A Co may make an election when filing its 2024 income tax return to use all of D Co’s 2022 tax loss ($20,000) or $20,000 of C Co’s 2022 tax loss of $30,000.

This appendix summarises loss concepts that this statement refers to. Page 37 of 40 Tax loss A2. A tax loss is essentially the total loss amount for the tax year that a loss company can share or carry forward to the subsequent tax year. A3. A loss company’s “tax loss” for a tax year comprises:  the loss balance carried forward to the tax year;  as relevant: o less the loss company’s net income for the tax year; or o plus the loss company’s net loss for the tax year; 21 and o plus various other amounts listed in s IA 2(4), for example, an amount of converted imputation credits arising under s LE 2 and an unused attributed controlled foreign company (CFC) or foreign investment fund (FIF) net loss for the tax year under ss IQ 2(3) and IQ 3(3). A4. A loss balance carried forward to a tax year is usually the loss for the preceding tax year that was not used in that year. 22 A5. For further information on “tax loss”, see \[33\] to \[36\] of IS 22/07. Tax loss component A6. A tax loss is made up of tax loss components. The concept of a tax loss component is important because the continuity and commonality requirements (discussed further from \[A8\] (continuity) and \[A11\] (commonality)) must be tested for each component. Generally, tax loss components included in a tax loss must be used in the order in which they arose. A7. Tax loss components include:  net losses from previous tax years (included in the loss balance carried forward to the tax year);  the loss company’s net loss for the tax year (if any); 21 A person’s “net loss” for a tax year is the difference between the person’s annual total deductions and their annual gross income (ie, where the annual total deductions exceed the annual gross income). 22 Section IA 3(4). The main way that a company can use a tax loss is by sharing it with a group company (s IA 3(2)). It can also use a tax loss to pay shortfall penalties (s IA 3(1)) or to reduce the amount of a taxable distribution received from a non-complying trust (s IA 3(3)). Page 38 of 40  certain additional amounts listed in s IA 2(4), for example, an amount of converted imputation credits arising under s LE 2 and an unused attributed CFC or FIF net loss for the tax year under ss IQ 2(3) and IQ 3(3); and  certain losses arising before the 2009 income year that the loss company was entitled to carry forward under previous legislation. Continuity tests A8. If a company is to carry forward a tax loss, one of the following continuity tests must met:  at least 49% continuity in the ownership of the loss company (ownership continuity); and/or  continuity of the business activities of the loss company (business continuity). 23 A9. Continuity must be tested for each tax loss component and must be maintained for the continuity period applying to that component. Broadly, the continuity period is the period from the start of the income year in which the tax loss component arose to the end of the income year in which the loss is used. 24 A10. For further information on the continuity tests, see \[48\] to \[59\] of IS 22/07. For guidance on the main aspects of the business continuity test, see IS 22/06 : Loss carry- forward – continuity of business activities. Ownership commonality A11. To share a tax loss with another company, the companies must satisfy the commonality requirement. A12. Commonality refers to the requirement for companies to be at least 66% commonly owned. That is, there is a group of persons who hold in each company:  common voting interests that add up to at least 66%; and  if a market value circumstance exists for a company, common market value interests that add up to at least 66%. A13. Companies that meet the commonality requirement are referred to in the loss rules as a “group of companies”. 23 The business continuity test may enable a company to carry forward tax losses despite a breach in ownership continuity if certain requirements are satisfied. 24 Subject to application of the part-year rules. Page 39 of 40 A14. Commonality must be tested for each tax loss component and be satisfied for the commonality period applying to that tax loss component. Broadly, the commonality period is the period from the start of the loss company’s income year in which the tax loss component arose to the end of the income year in which the loss is used. A15. The requirement for the commonality to be met at all times during the commonality period means that it is important to consider where a company was incorporated or when it became a member of the group of companies. A16. For further information on “commonality”, see \[78\] to \[92\] of IS 22/07. Part-year rules A17. The general loss rules include what they refer to as the “part-year rules”. A18. The part-year rules recognise that part way through an income year, an event (eg, a change in the shareholding of a loss company) could result in companies either breaching or establishing continuity or ownership commonality for a tax loss component or a group of persons. A19. In the absence of the part-year rules, if a continuity or commonality event occurred part way through the income year, this could prevent a company from using a tax loss component for the income year, or from carrying it forward. A20. The part-year rules ensure that, in these cases, companies can still use certain losses in the relevant part-year periods. This is consistent with the purpose of the loss rules (to ensure that, largely, losses are available for the person who ultimately incurred the losses to use). It also avoids an outcome that would otherwise follow from the assessment of income tax on an annualised basis. A21. For further information on how the part-year rules apply, see \[197\] to \[242\] of IS 22/07. A22. Other part-year rules cater for breaches of the business continuity rules. However, these rules are outside the scope of this interpretation statement. For more information on these rules, see IS 22/06.

They set out the Commissioner’s views and guidance on how New Zealand’s tax laws apply. They may address specific situations we have been asked to provide guidance on, or they may be about how legislative provisions apply more generally. While they set out the Commissioner’s considered views, interpretation statements are not binding on the Commissioner. However, taxpayers can generally rely on them in determining their tax affairs. See further Status of Commissioner’s advice (Commissioner’s Statement, Inland Revenue, December 2012). It is important to note that a general similarity between a taxpayer’s circumstances and an example in an interpretation statement will not necessarily lead to the same tax result.

QUESTIONS WE’VE BEEN ASKED | PĀTAI KUA UIA MAI How does an amalgamated company calculate its available subscribed capital following an amalgamation? Issued | Tukuna: QB XX/XX This question we’ve been asked explains how an amalgamated company calculates its available subscribed capital. Key provisions | Whakaratonga tāpua Income Tax Act 2007 – s CD 43 REPLACES | WHAKAKAPIA: QB 13/02 and QB 14/05 Page 1 of 11 QB XX/XX | Issue date Question | Pātai How does an amalgamated company calculate its available subscribed capital (ASC) following an amalgamation? Answer | Whakautu An amalgamated company calculates its ASC using the formula: 1 July 1994 balance + subscriptions − returns − look-through company returns The purpose of the ASC formula is to determine the amount that shareholders have paid into a company as capital when subscribing for shares. The ASC of a company can be returned to shareholders tax-free in certain circumstances rather than being treated as a dividend. The definitions of “subscriptions” and “returns” are modified for an amalgamated company. The amalgamated company’s “subscription” amount for a class of share will include the:  total amount of consideration that the company received after 30 June 1994 for the issue of shares of the same class; and  ASC of all shares in the amalgamating companies, provided that: o the amalgamating company’s shares are of an equivalent class; o the amalgamating company’s shares are not held directly or indirectly by an amalgamating company; and o the shares are not shares in the amalgamated company. The “returns” amount will increase if an amalgamating company holds shares in an amalgamated company and the shares are cancelled on amalgamation. The amalgamated company’s ASC per share will reduce by the “returns” amount. Key terms | Kīanga tau tāpua Amalgamated company means the company that continues after an amalgamation. Page 2 of 11 QB XX/XX | Issue date Amalgamating company means a company that amalgamates with one or more other companies under an amalgamation. Every company involved in an amalgamation is an amalgamating company. Any reference in this Item to amalgamating company includes the amalgamated company. ASC means the amount that shareholders have paid into a company as capital when subscribing for shares. It is calculated using the formula in s CD 43(1). Explanation | Whakamāramatanga Introduction 1. This question we’ve been asked (QWBA) explains how an amalgamated company calculates its ASC following an amalgamation. 2. We have been asked to consider how the “subscriptions” and “returns” amounts are modified for an amalgamated company. 3. This item applies to both resident’s restricted amalgamations and amalgamations that are not resident’s restricted amalgamations. 4. See IS XX/XX: Income tax and GST – Amalgamations for general tax guidance on amalgamations. 5. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This QWBA replaces previous publications 6. In 2013, the Commissioner issued a QWBA on determining the “subscriptions” amount for an amalgamated company under the ASC rules (QB 13/02 : Income tax – Determining the “subscriptions” amount for an amalgamated company under the available subscribed capital rules). 7. To complement QB 13/02, the Commissioner issued a further QWBA on the topic: QB 14/05 : Income tax – ASC rules – Calculating the “subscriptions” amount for an amalgamated company when the shares of an amalgamating company are held by another amalgamating company. 8. This QWBA replaces QB 13/02 and QB 14/05 from the date of issue. Page 3 of 11 QB XX/XX | Issue date Formula for calculating available subscribed capital 9. Section CD 43(1) contains the formula for calculating ASC: CD 43 Available subscribed capital (ASC) amount Formula for calculating amount of available subscribed capital (1) For a share (the share) in a company at any relevant time (the calculation time), the amount of available subscribed capital is calculated using the formula— 1 July 1994 balance + subscriptions – returns – look-through company returns.

(b) subscriptions, subject to subsections (6) to (21), is the total amount of consideration that the company received, after 30 June 1994 and before the calculation time, for the issue of shares of the same class (the class) as the share, ignoring section HB 1 (Look-through companies are transparent), and including consideration for the issue of shares by the company as a result of the application of section CD 6 (Trusts are nominees): (c) returns, subject to subsections (22) to (25) 1 , is the total amount of consideration that the company paid, after 30 June 1994 and before the calculation time, on the cancellation of shares in the relevant class and that was not a dividend because of section CD 22, CD 23B, or CD 24 or a corresponding provision of an earlier Act. ... 10. The ASC formula has four components. However, in this QWBA we focus on “subscriptions” and “returns” because the “subscriptions” and “returns” amounts are specifically modified in an amalgamation. “Subscriptions” is the total amount of consideration received 11. The “subscriptions” amount of a company is the total amount of consideration that the company received after 30 June 1994 and before the calculation time for the issue of shares of the same class (s CD 43(2)(b)). 1 See s 9 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2024–25, Emergency Response, and Remedial Measures) Bill. Page 4 of 11 QB XX/XX | Issue date 12. When an amalgamated company is determining its “subscriptions” amount, s CD 43(2)(b) is subject to s CD 43(15). The phrase “subject to” indicates that one provision qualifies, modifies or changes another. The phrase also indicates which provision is to prevail in the event of a conflict: C & J Clark Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioner \[1973\] 1 WLR 905; Harding v Coburn \[1976\] 2 NZLR 577; and Re Tasman Pacific Airlines of NZ Ltd (in rec & liq) \[2002\] 1 NZLR 688. Modifying the “subscriptions” amount for an amalgamated company 13. Section CD 43(15) modifies the s CD 43(2)(b) definition of “subscriptions”: Subscriptions amount: amalgamated company (15) The subscriptions amount for a company that is an amalgamated company resulting from an amalgamation— (a) includes an amount, as if it were consideration received at the time of the amalgamation for the issue of the amalgamated company’s shares, equal to the available subscribed capital, at the time of the amalgamation, of all shares in the amalgamating companies that are— (i) of an equivalent class to the class; and (ii) not held directly or indirectly by an amalgamating company; and (iii) not shares in the amalgamated company: (b) does not include any other amount for the agreement of shareholders of an amalgamating company to the amalgamation and the resulting property acquisitions by the amalgamated company. 14. Section CD 43(15)(a) specifies that the subscriptions amount for an amalgamated company includes an amount equal to the ASC at the time of the amalgamation of all shares in the amalgamating companies that are:  of an equivalent class to the class; and  not held directly or indirectly by an amalgamating company; and  not shares in the amalgamated company. 15. Each of these requirements is considered further below. 16. Section CD 43(15)(b) provides that the subscriptions amount does not include any amount for the agreement of shareholders to the amalgamation and the resulting property acquisitions by the amalgamated company. Page 5 of 11 QB XX/XX | Issue date Shares are of an equivalent class 17. The first requirement in s CD 43(15)(a) is that the shares in the amalgamating companies are “of an equivalent class to the class” of shares in the amalgamated company. 18. To determine whether the shares of an amalgamating company are of an equivalent class to those of the amalgamated company, the amalgamating company’s constitution and any shareholder agreements should be reviewed. Factors to consider are whether the amalgamating company’s shares carry the same:  shareholder decision-making rights;  rights to be paid profits that the company distributes; and  rights to the distribution of assets on the cancellation of shares. Shares are not held directly or indirectly by an amalgamating company 19. The second requirement in s CD 43(15)(a) is that the shares of the amalgamating company are “not held directly or indirectly by an amalgamating company”. 20. The amalgamated company’s ASC does not include an amount equal to the ASC of shares in an amalgamating company if another amalgamating company holds the amalgamating company’s shares. 21. The reason for excluding the ASC of subsidiaries from the ASC calculation is to avoid the double-counting of capital that the underlying shareholders have introduced. The underlying shareholders have subscribed for the shares in the parent company, and an amount of ASC equivalent to that value should be included only once for the amalgamated company (s ee Example | Tauira 1). Shares are not the amalgamated company’s shares 22. The third requirement in s CD 43(15)(a) is that the shares are “not shares in the amalgamated company”. 23. Section CD 43(15)(a) modifies the subscriptions amount to include an amount equal to the ASC of all shares in the amalgamating companies. The term “includes” operates to add an amount to the “subscriptions” amount in s CD 43(2)(b) for an amalgamated company. However, as an amalgamated company is also an “amalgamating company”, the third requirement prevents the amalgamated company’s subscriptions from being counted twice (see Example | Tauira 2). Page 6 of 11 QB XX/XX | Issue date Conclusion 24. The subscriptions amount of an amalgamated company equals the amount calculated under s CD 43(2)(b) plus an amount equal to the ASC of all shares in the amalgamating companies that are of an equivalent class, except:  shares held directly or indirectly by an amalgamating company; and  shares in the amalgamated company. “Returns” is the total consideration paid on cancellation 25. The “returns” amount of a company is the total amount of consideration that the company has paid after 30 June 1994 and before the calculation time on the cancellation of shares of the same class and the consideration was excluded from being a dividend under specific provisions. Modifying the “returns” amount for an amalgamated company 26. Section CD 43(24) modifies the s CD 43(2)(c) definition of “returns”: Returns amount: shares cancelled on amalgamation (24) If shares in an amalgamated company held by an amalgamating company are cancelled on the amalgamation, the returns amount included in calculating the available subscribed capital amount of a share in the amalgamated company that is of the same class as the cancelled shares is increased by the amount calculating using the formula— cancelled shares × asc per share. Definition of items in formula (25) In the formula in subsection (24),— (a) cancelled shares is the number of cancelled shares: (b) asc per share is the available subscribed capital per share calculated under the slice rule of each cancelled share immediately before the amalgamation. 27. Section CD 43(24) applies if an amalgamating company holds shares in an amalgamated company, and the shares are cancelled on amalgamation. 28. The effect of s CD 43(24) is to increase the returns amount by the amount calculated using the formula (ie, the ASC of the amalgamated company will be reduced by this amount) (see Example | Tauira 3). Page 7 of 11 QB XX/XX | Issue date Examples | Tauira 29. The following examples provide guidance on how to apply the law. Example | Tauira 1 – Upward amalgamation On 16 February 2021, A Co was incorporated and issued 2,200 ordinary shares for $1 each. Then on 17 March 2022, B Co was incorporated and issued 1,500 ordinary shares for $1 each to A Co. Neither A Co nor B Co is a look-through company. A Co and B Co undertake a short-form amalgamation under s 222(1) of the Companies Act 1993. A Co continues as the amalgamated company. B Co’s shares are cancelled. The subscriptions amount of A Co is determined under para (2)(b) and subs (15) of s CD 43. A Co’s share capital ($2,200) is included in A Co’s subscriptions amount under s CD 43(2)(b). An amount equivalent to B Co’s ASC ($1,500) is not included under s CD 43(15), because an amalgamated company (A Co) holds all of B Co’s shares. As the shares of A Co (the amalgamated company) are not cancelled, s CD 43(24) does not apply, and the returns amount is not modified due to the amalgamation. A Co calculates its ASC as follows: 1 July 1994 balance = $0 Subscriptions = $2,200 (s CD 43(2)(b)) + $0 (s CD 43(15)) Returns = $0 Page 8 of 11 QB XX/XX | Issue date Look-through company returns = $0 ASC = $2,200 Example | Tauira 2 – Horizontal amalgamation On 16 February 2021, A Co was incorporated and issued 2,200 ordinary shares for $1 each to C Co. Then on 17 March 2022, B Co was incorporated and issued 1,500 ordinary shares for $1 each to D Co. Neither A Co nor B Co is a look-through company. A Co and B Co undertake a long-form amalgamation under s 220 of the Companies Act 1993. A Co continues as the amalgamated company. The shares in B Co are cancelled. The subscriptions amount of A Co is determined under para (2)(b) and subs (15) of s CD 43. A Co’s share capital ($2,200) is included in A Co’s subscriptions amount under s CD 43(2)(b). As an amalgamating company does not own B Co directly or indirectly, and as B Co is not the amalgamated company, an amount equivalent to B Co’s ASC ($1,500) is included under s CD 43(15). The shares of A Co (the amalgamated company) are not cancelled, and s CD 43(24) does not modify the returns amount. Page 9 of 11 QB XX/XX | Issue date A Co calculates its ASC as follows: 1 July 1994 balance = $0 Subscriptions = $2,200 (s CD 43(2)(b)) + $1,500 (s CD 43(15)) Returns = $0 Look-through company returns = $0 ASC = $3,700 Example | Tauira 3 – Downwards amalgamation On 16 February 2021, A Co was incorporated and issued 2,200 ordinary shares for $1 each. Then on 17 March 2022, B Co was incorporated and issued 1,500 ordinary shares for $1 each to A Co. Neither A Co nor B Co is a look-through company. A Co and B Co undertake a long-form amalgamation under s 220 of the Companies Act 1993. B Co continues as the amalgamated company. The amalgamation proposal states that the shares in B Co are cancelled, and A Co’s shares will convert into B Co’s shares. The subscriptions amount of B Co is determined under para (2)(b) and subs (15) of s CD 43. B Co’s share capital ($1,500) is included in B Co’s subscriptions amount under s CD 43(2)(b). Page 10 of 11 QB XX/XX | Issue date As an amalgamating company does not own A Co directly or indirectly, and as A Co is not the amalgamated company, an amount equivalent to A Co’s ASC ($2,200) is included under s CD 43(15). As the shares of B Co (the amalgamated company) are cancelled and as an amalgamating company owns B Co, s CD 43(24) applies and modifies the returns amount. B Co calculates its ASC as follows: 1 July 1994 balance = $0 Subscriptions = $1,500 (s CD 43(2)(b)) + $2,200 (s CD 43(15)) Returns = $1,500 Look-through company returns = $0 ASC = $2,200 (s CD 43(24)) Draft items produced by the Tax Counsel Office represent the preliminary, though considered, views of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue.

A move from one set of rules to another may occur in a number of different situations such as when a person stops renting out their holiday home on a casual basis and makes it available for rent on a fulltime basis (fo r ex ample, as short-stay accommodation or long-term rental). For further detail, see IS XX/XX. Determining what income tax deduction rules apply 3.If a person derives income from a residential property, they calculate their deductible ex penditure under either the mixed-use asset rules or the standard tax rules. IS XX/XX FS X | Issue date Page 3 of 8 4.Figure | Hoahoa 1 provides guidance on how a person can work out which income tax deduction rules apply in an income year. A person must keep track of the use of t he r esidential property during the income year to determine which income tax deduction rules apply for that income year. Figure | Hoahoa 1 – Determining which income tax deduction rules apply 5.This fact sheet considers how a person applies the standard income tax rules to their residential property. For information on a person’s tax treatment if the mixed-us e a sset rules apply, see IS XX/XX FS 2. Applying the standard tax rules 6.Any income a person receives from renting out a residential property is taxable in come. 7.A person must determine what deductions they can claim for expenditure incurred in deriving the rental income (see \[44\] to \[49\] of IS XX/XX). A person can deduct IS XX/XX FS X | Issue date Page 4 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] expenditure to the extent it is incurred in deriving taxable income. In general terms (and subject to any specific limitations): any expenses that relate solely to a person’s private use are non-deductible; any expenses that relate solely to the person’s income-earning activity are fully deductible; and to the extent an expense relates to both a person’s income-earning and privat e u se of the property, it will be only partly deductible and will need to be apportioned. 8.There are specific rules for calculating depreciation on items of depreciable property used in the residential property. Figure | Hoahoa 2 provides guidance on how a perso n c an work out their depreciation deduction under the standard tax rules. Figure | Hoahoa 2 – Determining depreciation deductions under the standard tax rules IS XX/XX FS X | Issue date Page 5 of 8 9.The calculation for the depreciation loss is based on the depreciable property’s adjusted tax value (ATV). The ATV is the item’s cost less any deductions for amounts of depreciation loss that the person would have been allowed if the item of depreciabl e p roperty was wholly used in deriving taxable income. This means any apportionment under the mixed-use asset rules in the prior year does not change how the ATV is calculated (see \[84\] to \[87\] of IS XX/XX). 10.When a person sells an item of depreciable property, they must calculate their depreciation recovery income or depreciation loss on sale (see from \[103\] of IS XX/XX). 11.If the residential property ring-fencing rules apply to the residential property in the income year of sale, a person can offset unused excess deductions to the extent tha t t hey derive income from the residential property (including depreciation recovery income). Residential property ring-fencing rules may limit amount of deduction 12.If a person uses the standard tax rules to calculate their deductions (including their depreciation deduction), they must also consider whether the residential property ring- fencing rules apply to suspend or limit the deduction in the current income year (see \[94\] to \[9 7\] of IS XX/XX). 13.The residential property ring-fencing rules apply unless the residential property has been used as the person’s main home for most of the income year (see \[53\] to \[55\] of IS XX/XX). 14.Generally, the residential property ring-fencing rules apply on a portfolio basis. However, a person can elect to apply the rules on a property-by-property basis instea d ( see \[65\] – \[76\] of IS XX/XX). 15.The residential property ring-fencing rules operate to prevent a person from offsetting deductions incurred for residential properties against other sources of income (fo r e xample, salary or wages). This means if the person’s rental activity makes a loss, they cannot claim the excess deductions in that income year. 16.Any excess deductions are not permanently forfeited but are suspended and may be o ffset against future income derived from residential property when the standard tax rules apply. 17.A person cannot use any excess deductions against income derived from the residential property if the mixed-use asset rules apply in an income year. This is of relevance if there is a subsequent change of use of the residential property. IS XX/XX FS X | Issue date Page 6 of 8 Unable to use prior year quarantined expenditure 18.The person may have mixed-use asset quarantined expenditure carried forward from a prior income year (see \[41\] to \[43 \] of IS XX/XX). The person cannot offset t he q uarantined expenditure if the standard tax rules apply to the residential property. T he qu arantined expenditure is not forfeited but carried forward to a future income year. 19.Example | Tauira 1 illustrates how the above tax rules apply where a residential p roperty has moved from the mixed-use asset rules to the standard tax rules. Example | Tauira 1 – Changing from mixed-use asset rules to standard tax rules Te Ariki owns a three-bedroom property in Christchurch. In the 2022–23 income year the Christchurch property was a mixed-use asset and Te Ariki used the mixed-use asset rules to calculate his net income from the Christchurch property. Te Ariki had quarantined expenditure from the 2022–23 income year of $3,000. In January 2023, Te Ariki decides to rent his Christchurch property to long-term tenants and the tenants continue to rent the Christchurch property throughout the 2023–24 income year. In the 2023–24 income year, the Christchurch property was not vacant or used privately. The Christchurch property is not a mixed-use asset in the 2023–24 income year. The standard tax rules apply to the Christchurch property for the 2023–24 income year. Te Ariki charges his tenants $600 per week (a total of $31,200 in the 2023–24 income year). Te Ariki incurred the following expenses (total $42,000) relating to the property: interest – $36,000 local authority rates – $2,50 0 house insurance – $2,600 repairs and maintenance – $900 Te Ariki can claim a deduction for expenditure to the extent it is incurred in deriving taxable income from renting his Christchurch property, provided none of the general limitations (for example, the capital limitation) apply. However, due to the interest IS XX/XX FS X | Issue date Page 7 of 8 limitation rules, his deduction for interest costs is limited to 80% ($28,800) in the 2023– 24 income year. 1 The Christchurch property is partly furnished. Te Ariki prepares a tax fixed asset register for the 2024 income year: Asset Cost Opening Adjusted Tax Value Depreciation Loss Closing Adjusted Tax Value Washing Machine $1,600 $1,120 $336 $784 Dryer $1,250 $875 $262.50 $612.50 Fridge / freezer $1,800 $1,350 $337.50 $1,012.50 As the items of depreciable property are wholly used to derive rental income, Te Ariki can claim a deduction for the entire depreciation loss ($ 936 total) unless the residential property ring-fencing rules apply and suspend a portion of the depreciation deduction in the 2023–24 income year. In the 2023–24 income year, the Christchurch property is subject to the residential property ring-fencing rules as no exclusions apply . In the 2023–24 income year, Te Ariki’s rental activity is as follows: Residential income Deductible expenditure Expenditure deductible in 2023–24 income year Excess deductions carried forward to future income year $31,200 $35,736 $31,200 $4,536 In the 2023–24 income year, Te Ariki can claim $31,200 of the expenses incurred for his Christchurch property. He has $4,536 of unused excess deductions to carry forward to the 2024–25 income year. 1 From 1 April 2025, interest deductibility will be fully restored, and a person will be able to claim 100% of the interest incurred. IS XX/XX FS X | Issue date Page 8 of 8 Te Ariki also has $3,000 of mixed-use asset quarantined expenditure relating to his Christchurch property to carry forward to future income years.

Introduction | Whakataki 1. IS XX/XX: Income tax – implications of a residential property moving between the standard tax rules and the mixed-use asset rules considers situations where a person’s use of their residential property has changed so that it moves from being under one set of income tax deduction rules to another. 2. This fact sheet provides an overview of the consequences of moving from the standard tax rules to the mixed-use asset rules. A move from one set of rules to another may occur in different situations such as when a property that has previously been used as short-stay accommodation is used as both the person’s holiday home and short-stay accommodation in the next income year. For further detail, see IS XX/XX. Determining what income tax deduction rules apply 3. If a person derives income from a residential property, they calculate their deductible expenditure under either the mixed-use asset rules or the standard tax rules. 4. Figure | Hoahoa 1 provides guidance on how a person can work out which income tax deduction rules apply in an income year. A person must keep track of the use of the IS XX/XX FS X | Issue date Page 3 of 7 residential property during the income year to determine which income tax deduction rules apply for that income year. Figure | Hoahoa 1 – Determining which income tax deduction rules apply 5. This fact sheet considers how a person applies the mixed-use asset rules to their residential property. For information on a person’s tax treatment if the standard tax rules apply, see IS XX/XX FS 1. Applying the mixed-use asset rules 6. Any income a person receives from renting out a residential property will generally be taxable income. 7. If the residential property is a mixed-use asset, deductions can be claimed for expenses that relate solely to its rental activity. Any expenses that relate solely to the private use of the residential property are not deductible. IS XX/XX FS X | Issue date Page 4 of 7 8. Expenses that relate to both the income-earning and private use of the residential property will be only partly deductible. The person must use the mixed-use asset apportionment formula to calculate their deductible mixed-use asset expenditure. The effect of the formula is that the proportion of expenses that are deductible reflects the income-earning use of the mixed-use asset relative to the private use (see \[39\] to \[ 40\] of IS XX/XX). 9. There are specific rules for calculating depreciation on items of depreciable property used in the residential property. 10. Figure | Hoahoa 2 provides guidance on how a person can work out their depreciation deduction where the mixed-use asset rules apply in the income year. Figure | Hoahoa 2 – Determining depreciation deductions under the mixed-use asset rules 11. The calculation for the depreciation loss is based on the depreciable property’s adjusted tax value (ATV). The ATV is the item’s cost less any deductions for amounts of depreciation loss that the person would have been allowed if the item of depreciable property was wholly used in deriving taxable income. This means any apportionment IS XX/XX FS X | Issue date Page 5 of 7 or limitation under the residential property ring-fencing rules in a prior year does not change how the ATV is calculated (see \[94\] to \[ 97\] of IS XX/XX). 12. When a person sells an item of depreciable property, they must calculate their depreciation recovery income or depreciation loss on sale (see from \[103\] of is XX/XX). Mixed-use asset quarantined expenditure cannot be offset against depreciation recovery income. Quarantined expenditure rules may limit the amount of deduction 13. If a person’s residential property is a mixed-use asset and the person makes a loss from the rental activities, they must determine whether the quarantined expenditure rules apply. If the quarantined expenditure rules apply, the person may only deduct their expenses up to the amount of the rental income they received from the mixed- use asset (see \[41\] to 43\] of IS XX/XX). 14. A deduction for quarantined expenditure is not permanently forfeited but is suspended and may be offset against future asset income derived from the residential property when the mixed-use asset rules apply. 15. A person cannot offset any quarantined expenditure against income derived from the residential property if the standard tax rules apply. This is of relevance if there is a subsequent change of use of the residential property. Unable to use unused excess deductions 16. The person may have unused excess deduction suspended under the residential property ring-fencing rules carried forward from a prior income year (see \[ 50\] to \[ 52\] of IS XX/XX). 17. The person cannot offset the unused excess deductions against income derived from the residential property if the mixed-use asset rules apply in the income year. The unused excess deductions are not forfeited but carried forward to a future income year. IS XX/XX FS X | Issue date Page 6 of 7 Example | Tauira 1 – Changing from standard tax rules to mixed-use asset rules Jane owns a two-bedroom property in Hahei. Jane has let the Hahei property out as short-stay accommodation, and it has not been used privately. However, in the 2024– 25 income year Jane decides to stay in the Hahei property for a six-week period (42 days) and let it out for short-stay accommodation for the remainder of the income year . The Hahei property is let out for short-stay accommodation for 223 days and vacant (unused) for the remainder of the 2024–25 income year. In the 2023–24 and earlier income years, Jane used the standard tax rules to calculate her deductible expenditure from the Hahei property. Jane has $10,000 of unused excess deductions under the residential property ring-fencing rules to carry forward to future income years. As the Hahei property has been used privately by Jane and was vacant for at least 62 days in the 2024–25 income year, the Hahei property will be a mixed-use asset in the 2024–25 income year. Jane derived $45,000 from the Hahei property during the 2024–25 income year. The Hahei property is fully furnished, and Jane prepares an itemised tax fixed asset register for the 2024–25 income year. The total amounts for the 2024–25 income year are: Opening adjusted tax value Depreciation loss Closing adjusted tax value 2025 $16,200 $4,860 $11,340 In addition to the depreciation loss, Jane incurred the following expenses relating to the property in the 2024–25 income year:  interest – $24,750  local authority rates – $2,500  house insurance – $3,000  utilities – $4,000  repairs and maintenance – $500 IS XX/XX FS X | Issue date Page 7 of 7 All the expenditure ($39,610) relates to both the private and income earning use of the Hahei property. Jane calculates her mixed-use asset expenditure using the following formula: expenditure x income-earning days ÷ (income-earning days + counted days) Expenditure = $39,610 Income-earning days = 223 Counted days = 42 Jane’s mixed-use asset expenditure is $33,332.19. In the 2024–25 income year Jane derived net income of $11,667.81 from the Hahei property: Rental income $45,000 Deductible expenditure ($33,332.19) $11,667.81 Jane is unable to use the prior year unused excess deductions against the net income from the Hahei property. The $10,000 of unused excess deductions can be carried forward to future income years.

the effect of a change in income tax deduction rules on a person’s ability to us e p rior y ear quarantined expenditure under the mixed-use asset rules; the effect of a change in income tax deduction rules on a person’s ability to clai m pr ior year unused excess deductions under the residential property ring-fencing rules; and how the depreciation rules apply to depreciable property used in a residential property when there has been a change in which set of income tax deduction rules apply to the property. 2.This statement applies to persons who derive income from their residential property. This statement does not apply to residential property owned by companies (includin g c lose companies). Income tax deduction rules 3.If a person derives income from a residential property, they must determine whether the mixed-use asset rules or the standard tax rules apply to that property. If the use of a residential property changes from one income year to the next, or within an incom e y ear, the set of income tax deduction rules that applies to the residential property may be different from the set of rules that applied in previous income years. 4.The set of rules that applies determines the deductible proportion of the person’s expenses. The person must consider which income tax deduction rules apply eac h i ncome year because the mixed-use asset and residential property ring-fencing rules apply on an income year basis. 5.A person must apply the mixed-use asset rules if, during the income year, the r esidential property was: partly used to earn income; partly used for private use; and IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 4 of 35 unused for at least 62 days. 6.If the residential property is not a mixed-use asset, the standard tax rules apply. I n a ddition, a person must consider if the residential property is subject to the residential property ring-fencing rules. Amount of deduction may be limited 7.The amount of the deduction a person can claim relating to their residential property may be limited. 8.If the mixed-use asset rules apply, the amount of the person’s deduction is apportioned in the current income year for the private use of the residential property. Further, the amount of the deduction that can be claimed in the income year may be l imited under the mixed-use asset quarantined expenditure rules. 9.A person cannot offset any expenditure incurred in a prior income year that has been q uarantined under the mixed-use asset rules if the residential property is not a mixed- use asset in the current income year. If the person has not sold the residential property, they can carry forward the quarantined expenditure to future income years. 10.If the standard tax rules apply, a person must consider whether the residential property ring-fencing rules limit the amount of the deduction that can be claimed in the incom e y ear. The residential property ring-fencing rules do not apply if one of the specific exclusions applies (for example, the main home exclusion or the mixed-use asset exclusion). 11.A person cannot offset any unused excess deductions carried forward from a prior income year under the residential property ring-fencing rules if their residentia l pr operty is not subject to the residential property ring-fencing rules in the current income year. However, a person can carry forward the unused excess deductions to future income years. Calculating depreciation deductions 12.A person can claim depreciation deductions in relation to depreciable property that t hey use to derive income from their residential property. 13.The first step to calculate a deprecation deduction is for a person to calculate their depreciation loss for the income year for each item of depreciable property. The nex t s tep is to work out what proportion of the depreciation loss the person can claim as a deduction in the income year. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 5 of 35 14.The proportion of the depreciation loss that is deductible depends on which income t ax deduction rules apply to the residential property in the income year and whether the depreciable property is wholly or partly used to produce income. 15.If the mixed-use asset rules apply to the residential property in a given income year, the person must use the apportionment formula in s DG 9 to calculate their depreciation deduction. Further, part of the depreciation deduction may be suspended if the quarantined expenditure rules apply. 16.If the standard tax rules apply and the depreciable property is wholly used to produce i ncome, the depreciation deduction is the depreciation loss amount. However, if t he d epreciable property is only partly used to produce income, the person must apportio n th e depreciation loss. In addition, if the residential property ring-fencing rules apply, the person may need to suspend a portion of the depreciation deduction and carry i t forward to a future income year. 17.Any apportionment of the depreciation loss under either the standard tax rules or the mixed-use asset rules does not change how a person calculates the depreciation loss in future income years. The calculation for the depreciation loss is based on the depreciable property’s adjusted tax value, which takes into account the total depreciable loss a person could have claimed before any apportionment or suspension. Disposal of depreciable property 18.When a person sells an item of depreciable property, they must calculate their depreciation recovery income or depreciation loss on sale. The method for calculating depreciation recovery income or depreciation loss on sale is the same whether the standard tax rules or mixed-use asset rules apply to the residential property. 19.A person cannot offset any prior-year mixed-use asset quarantined expenditure a gainst depreciation recovery income. Depreciation recovery income is not asset income (that is, income derived from the use of the mixed-use asset). 20.If the residential property ring-fencing rules apply to the residential property in the income year an item of depreciable property is sold, a person can offset unused excess deductions against depreciation recovery income they derive on the sale of the item of depreciable property. However, if the residential property ring-fencing rules do not apply in the income year of sale, a person cannot offset unused excess deductions against depreciation recovery income. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 6 of 35 Introduction | Whakataki 21.If a person derives rental income from a residential property, they must work out which income tax deduction rules apply so they can meet their tax obligations. 22.Depending on a person’s circumstances, the residential property will fall under either the mixed-use asset rules or the standard tax rules. The set of rules that applies determines the deductible proportion of the person’s expenses and how any unused deductions can be used in future income years. 23.A person also needs to consider whether they can claim depreciation deductions for the use of items of depreciable property used in conjunction with the residential property. How the rules apply can become complicated when a person has calculated depreciation deductions under the mixed-use asset rules in one income year and under the standard tax rules in the next income year, or the other way around. 24.This interpretation statement provides guidance for persons who derive income from residential property and the use of that residential property changes. This interpretation statement is organised into four parts: Part one – explains how a person determines which income tax deduction rules apply to their residential property. Part two – discusses when a person can use prior-year expenditure that has been quarantined under the mixed-use asset rules, or unused excess deductions carried forward from a prior income year under the residential property ring- fencing rules. Part three – discusses how to apportion the depreciation loss and calculate t he d epreciation deduction when the residential property moves from being under one set of income tax deduction rules to another. Part four – explains how to calculate depreciation recovery income or depreciation loss on sale on the disposal of depreciable property. Part one – Determining which income tax deduction rules apply 25.If a person derives rental income from a residential property, they must determine w hether the mixed-use asset rules or the standard tax rules apply. 26.If the use of the residential property changes in an income year, the income tax deduction rules the person must apply to the property for that income year may differ from the set of rules they applied to it in the previous income year. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 7 of 35 27.A person must revisit which income tax deduction rules apply each income year, a s t he m ixed-use asset rules apply on an income-year basis. A person must keep records to work out at the end of each income year which rules apply and to be able to apply t he r elevant rules correctly. 28.Figure | Hoahoa 1 w ill help a person determine which set of income tax deduction rules applies to their circumstances in any given income year. Mixed-use asset rules 29.The mixed-use asset rules apply where assets are sometimes used privately, sometimes used to earn income and are also unused for at least 62 days during the income year. The mixed-use asset rules apply on an asset-by-asset basis. Residential property is within the scope of the mixed-use asset rules. 30.If the mixed-use asset rules apply, a person must use those rules to apportion their expenditure between the income earning use of the residential property and its privat e us e. In addition, if the residential property is loss making, the person must determi ne w hether any of their deduction is quarantined expenditure. Asset criteria 31.Residential property is a “mixed-use asset” if, during the income year it (s DG 3): is partly used to earn income; is partly used privately; and was not used for at least 62 days. 32.Private use includes use by persons associated with the owner and use by persons renting it for “mates’ rates” – that is, rates that are less than 80% of the market value rent (s DG 4). Further, it is not necessary for the private use to be exclusive use of t he r esidential property for the mixed-use asset rules to apply. 33.If the residential property meets the criteria for a mixed-use asset, the owner must consider whether any of the exclusions to the mixed-use asset rules apply. 34.The mixed-use asset rules will not apply to residential property if its only income- earning use in the income year is as a long-term rental property (s DG 3(4)(c)). 35.A person can opt out of the mixed-use asset rules if (s DG 21): IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 8 of 35 their income for the income year from the residential property is under $4,000; 1 or t hey made a loss from the residential property and if they did not opt out of the rules would have quarantined expenditure (that is, expenditure carried forward to the next income year). 36.If a person chooses to opt out of the mixed-use asset rules, the income from the r esidential property is exempt. This means the person does not pay tax on the income and they cannot claim tax deductions for any expenditure or loss relating to the residential property. 37.For further information on opting out of the mixed-use asset rules, see QB XX/06 Income tax – which rules apply if I have a dwelling I sometimes rent out as short- stay accommodation and also sometimes uses privately? Apportionment of expenditure 38.If the residential property is a mixed-use asset, deductions can be claimed for expenses that relate solely to its rental activity. Any expenses that relate solely to the private use of the residential property are not deductible. 39.Expenses that relate to both the income-earning and private use of the residential property will be only partly deductible. The person must use the formula in s DG 9(2) to calculate the deductible portion of this expenditure: expenditure × income-earning days ÷ (income-earning days + counted days) where: “expenditure” is the expenditure that relates to both the income-earning and private use of the residential property; “income-earning days” are the total number of days in the income year that t he per son derived income (other than exempt income) from the use of the mixed- use asset; and “counted days” are the total number of days in the income year the asset was in use, excluding income-earning days. 40.The effect of the formula is that the proportion of expenses that is deductible reflects the income-earning use of the mixed-use asset relative to the private use. 1 The $4,000 threshold does not include income that is classed as exempt income. Exempt income is income from renting out the dwelling to associated persons (for example, family members) or income from renting out the dwelling for less than 80% of the market value rent. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 9 of 35 41.For an explanation of how to determine the expenditure a person may deduct against t heir income from a mixed-use asset, see QB XX/07 Income tax – How do the mixed- use asset rules apply if I provide short-stay accommodation? Quarantined expenditure 42.If a person’s residential property is a mixed-use asset and the person makes a loss f rom the rental activities, they must determine whether the quarantined expenditur e r ules apply (s DG 16). 43.The expenditure quarantine rules apply to a mixed-use asset if: income derived from the use of the asset (other than exempt income) during the income year is less than 2% of the mixed-use asset’s value; and the person incurs expenditure for the income year. 44.For more detailed guidance on when the quarantined expenditure rules apply, s ee QB XX /07. 45.If the quarantined expenditure rules apply, the person may only deduct their expenses up to the amount of rental income they received from the mixed-use asset. A person cannot offset the amount of the expenses over and above the amount of asset income against their income from other sources (for example, salary and wage income). Instead, that amount of expenses is quarantined and carried forward to a future income year. The discussion from \[62\] explains how a person can use quarantined expenditure in future income years. Standard tax rules 46.If a person derives income from a residential property during the income year and the property is not within the scope of the mixed-use asset rules, they must apply t he s tandard tax rules to calculate their taxable income. 47.Any income a person receives from renting a residential property is generally taxable i ncome (s CC 1). A person must determine what deductions they can claim for expenditure incurred in deriving the rental income (s DA 1). 48.The starting point is that a person can fully deduct expenses that relate solely to their rental activity. 2 Conversely, any expenses that relate solely to their private use of the pr operty are non-deductible. 2 However, interest may not be fully deductible until 1 April 2025. Further, if the dwelling is rented through an online marketplace, the person may need to claim their deduction on a GST-exclusive basis (as QB xx19/08 explains). IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 10 of 35 49.To the extent an expense relates to both a person’s income-earning and private use of the property, it will be only partly deductible. 50.For further information on how to apply the standard rules, see QB XX/08 Income tax – H ow do the standard tax rules apply if I provide short-stay accommodation ? a nd QB 23/08: Income tax – deductibility of expenditure – renting to flatmates. 51.If the standard tax rules apply to the residential property, a person must also consider w hether the residential property ring-fencing rules apply. Residential property ring-fencing rules 52.The residential property ring-fencing rules may apply when a person owns a residential property and has expenditure or a loss that relates to the property for which they ar e a llowed a deduction. 53.The residential property ring-fencing rules operate to prevent a person from offsetting de ductions incurred for residential properties against other sources of income (fo r e xample, salary or wages). This means if the person’s rental activity makes a loss (tha t is, the deductible expenses exceed the income), they cannot claim the excess deductions (that is, the extent to which they exceed the income) in that income year (s EL 4). Any excess deductions are not permanently forfeited but are suspended an d m ay be offset against future income derived from residential property. The discussion from \[67\] explains how a person can use the unused excess deductions in futur e in come years. 54.There are several exclusions from the residential property ring-fencing rules (see ss EL 9 to EL 13), including exclusions for a main home and for mixed-use assets. Main home exclusion 55.The main home exclusion (s EL 9) applies if: more than 50% of the land is used as the person’s main home (the spac e t hreshold); and the person uses the land as their main home for more than 50% of the income year (the time threshold). 56.A “main home” is the one dwelling that a person mainly uses as a residence (s YA 1). In determining what a person’s main home is, if they have more than one home, t he f ocus is on the nature of the place and the relationship between the person and that place – see QB 24/01 : I f a person has two or more homes, which home is their main home for the purpose of the main home exclusion to the bright-line test? 57.The main home exclusion can apply if a trust owns the residential property, provided: IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 11 of 35 a beneficiary of the trust occupies the property as their main home; and either the principal settlor of the trust does not have a main home or, if they do, it is the property in question. Mixed-use asset exclusion 58.The residential property ring-fencing rules do not apply to residential land for an income year when the land is an asset within the scope of the mixed-use asset rules (s EL 12) . 59.Figure | Hoahoa 1, Example | Tauira 1 and Example | Tauira 2 pr ovide guidance on how a person can work out which income tax deduction rules apply to their residential property. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 12 of 35 Figure | Hoahoa 1 – Determining which income tax deduction rules apply to residential property you earn income from Example | Tauira 1 – A property changing from being the owner’s residence to a long- term residential rental Anaru owns a three-bedroom property in Taupō. After he purchased the property in 2021, Anaru lived in the property with two flatmates. In the 2023–24 income year (the income year ending 31 March 2024), he receives a promotion from his employer and moves to Napier to take up the new role. Anaru moves out of the Taupō property on 15 January 2024. Anaru’s flatmates continue to live in the property under a tenancy arrangement. Anaru’s deductions for the Taupō property are not ring-fenced in the 2023–24 income year as the main home exclusion applies. Anaru has used the entire Taupō property as his main home for more than 50% of the income year. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 13 of 35 The mixed-use asset rules do not apply to the Taupō property for the 2023–24 income year as the property was not unused for 62 or more days during the income year; it was used for the whole income year. Anaru must apply the standard tax rules to work out his tax obligations in relation to the property for the 2023–24 income year (see QB 23/08). Example | Tauira 2 – A property changing from being a mixed-use asset to a long-term residential rental Susie owns a three-bedroom property in Dunedin. For the first 4 months of the 2021– 22 income year, Susie lives in the property and lets one of the bedrooms as short-stay accommodation. Susie lets the bedroom at a market rent and it has approximately 60% occupancy during those 4 months. In August 2021, Susie moves back to her parents’ home and her Dunedin property is left vacant. In November 2021, Susie decides to rent her Dunedin property to long- term tenants. During the 2021–22 income year, Susie has used the Dunedin property privately (as her residence) and has used it to derive income (rental income). The Dunedin property was also vacant for more than 62 days during the income year. The Dunedin property will be in the mixed-use asset rules for the income year unless one of the asset exclusions applies. An asset is excluded from the mixed-use asset rules if it is a residential property and the only income-earning use is as a long-term rental property. Susie has earned income from the Dunedin property from short-stay accommodation and long-term rental during the 2021–22 income year. Therefore, the long-term rental exclusion does not apply, as long-term rental income was not the sole source of Susie’s income from the Dunedin property for the income year. As the Dunedin property is a mixed-use asset, the residential property ring-fencing rules do not apply due to the mixed-use asset exclusion from the ring-fencing rules. Instead, the mixed-use asset rules will apply to the Dunedin property. Susie must apply the mixed-use asset rules to calculate her deductible expenditure for the Dunedin property for the 2021–22 income year (see QB XX/07). In the 2022–23 income year, Susie continues to live at her parents’ home and rent the Dunedin property as a long-term rental. The standard tax rules apply to the Dunedin property in the 2022–23 income year, because the long-term rental exclusion from the mixed-use asset rules applies. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 14 of 35 In the 2022–23 income year, the Dunedin property is subject to the residential property ring-fencing rules as neither the main home exclusion nor the mixed-use asset exclusion from the ring-fencing rules applies. Part two – Prior year quarantined expenditure or unused excess deductions 60.In some cases where a residential property has made a loss, a person may have either: quarantined expenditure under the mixed-use asset rules (see from \[62\]); or unused excess deductions under the residential property ring-fencing rules (s ee f rom \[67\]. 61.The person must determine whether they can offset the quarantined expenditure or u nused excess deductions suspended from prior income years against their current year income. Offsetting prior year quarantined expenditure against current year income 62.Mixed-use asset quarantined expenditure carried forward from a prior income year may be offset against “asset income” in the current income year (s DG 17). Asset income 63.“Asset income” is the total amount of taxable income derived in the current income year from the use of the asset. The mixed-use asset rules define “asset”. Residential property will be an “asset” for the mixed-use asset rules if it meets specific criteria, including criteria relating to the use of the asset – see \[31\]. 64.If a residential property that has previously been in the mixed-use asset rules but does not meet the criteria of an asset in the current income year because the use of t he a sset has changed, the owner will not derive any asset income. Therefore, the owner will not be able to use quarantined expenditure carried forward from a prior income year in the current income year. This is illustrated in Example | Tauira 3 . 65.The quarantined expenditure continues to be carried forward to future income yea rs. T he person may offset it against income in a future income year when the residential property is a mixed-use asset and they derive asset income from the residential property. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 15 of 35 66.Generally, quarantined expenditure from a mixed-use asset cannot be used against any income derived from a different mixed-use asset. If the mixed-use asset with quarantined expenditure is sold, any prior-year quarantined expenditure that canno t be d educted in the income year of sale is forfeited. However, quarantined expenditur e c an be offset against the asset income derived from a different mixed-use asset if (s DG 17(6)): the first asset is damaged or lost; the second asset is acquired to replace the first asset; and the two assets are identical or substantially the same. Example | Tauira 3 – Claiming deductions for prior-year quarantined expenditure Following on from Example | Tauira 2, in the 2021–22 income year Susie made a loss from her Dunedin property and had quarantined expenditure under the mixed-use asset rules. Susie did not opt out of the mixed-use asset rules in the 2021–22 income year. In the 2022–23 income year, Susie is unable to claim a deduction for the quarantined expenditure from the 2021–22 income year and any other prior income year, as the Dunedin property is no longer a mixed-use asset and Susie does not derive any “asset income” in the income year. The mixed-use asset quarantined expenditure for the 2021–22 income year and any other prior income year will be carried forward. It will be available for Susie to deduct in a future income year if the Dunedin property becomes a mixed-use asset again. Offsetting unused excess deductions against current year income 67.If residential property is subject to the residential property ring-fencing rules in an i ncome year, a person will have unused excess deductions if their deductible expenditure exceeds their “residential income”. 68.A person cannot offset the unused excess deductions against their income from other sources (for example, salary and wage income). 69.Unused excess deductions are carried forward to future income years and can be offset a gainst future residential income the person derives from their residential property or portfolio. 70.What happens to any unused excess deductions if a residential property is sold depends on: IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 16 of 35 whether the residential property ring-fencing rules were applied to a portfolio of properties or on a property-by-property basis; and whether the residential property or portfolio was fully taxed on sale – see IS 23/10: Deductibility of holding costs for land. Residential income 71.“Residential income” is defined for the purposes of the residential property ring- fencing rules (s EL 3). In general terms, “residential income” includes rental income and any depreciation recovery income a person derives in relation to their “residential portfolio” or individual property that is subject to s EL 4. 72.The default position is that the residential property ring-fencing rules apply on a portfolio basis. However, a person can elect to apply the rules on a property-by- property basis instead. Residential portfolio 73.Unless a person has elected to apply the residential property ring-fencing rules on a property-by-property basis, their residential portfolio will consist of all residentia l r ental properties they have included in their residential portfolio. The portfolio basis allows a person to calculate their total profit or loss across all residential properties in their portfolio that are subject to deductions being allocated under s EL 4 in tha t income year. The income from all properties in the portfolio subject to s EL 4 is offset, up to the amount of income from the portfolio, by deductions from all properties in the portfolio subject to s EL 4. 74.If a person has included a residential property in their portfolio at any time, it will remain part of their residential portfolio even if in a subsequent income year an exclusion (for example, the main home exclusion or the mixed-use asset exclusion) applies. The exclusions do not stop the residential property from being part of the person’s residential portfolio. This is relevant in the income year the person sells t he l ast of the properties in their residential portfolio. However, if an exclusion applies fo r a particular income year, s EL 4 does not apply to limit deductions for that income year for that property. 75.Despite a residential property remaining part of a person’s residential portfolio if it has been included in the portfolio at any time, if the residential property is excluded fro m t he s EL 4 limitation in a particular income year, neither the income nor the deductions for the property for that income year are taken into account for the purposes of applying s EL 4 to the properties in the person’s portfolio that are not excluded. This has the effect that the person cannot offset: IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 17 of 35 deductions for expenditure incurred relating to other properties in their r esidential portfolio against income from the excluded property; or any carried forward unused excess deductions relating to the residential portfolio against income from the excluded property. 76.A person will be able to carry forward the unused excess deductions to future income years. This is illustrated in Example | Tauira 4. Property-by-property basis 77.The same principles for offsetting excess deductions apply if a person has elected to apply the residential property ring-fencing rules on a property-by-property basis. This is illustrated in Example | Tauira 5 . 78.If a person has chosen to apply the rules on a property-by-property basis, the r esidential income they derive, along with the expenditure or loss, must relate solely to that individual property (property A). Any excess amount in relation to property A is suspended as a deduction and carried forward to a later income year in which t he per son derives residential income from property A (s EL 6). Example | Tauira 4 – Offsetting unused excess deductions – portfolio basis Rohan owns three residential properties. All three residential properties have been rented to tenants on a long-term basis. The residential properties have been subject to the residential property ring-fencing rules. Rohan applies the residential property ring-fencing rules on a portfolio basis. 2021–22 income year In the 2021–22 income year, Rohan’s rental activity is as follows: Residential portfolio Residential income Deductible expenditure Expenditure deductible in the 2021–22 income year Excess deductions carried forward to future income year Property A $16,500 $16,500 Property B $20,000 $19,000 Property C $5,000 $13,000 IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 18 of 35 Total $41,500 $48,500 $41,500 $7,000 In the 2021–22 income year, Rohan can claim $41,500 of the expenses incurred for the properties in his portfolio. He has $7,000 of unused excess deductions to carry forward to the 2022–23 income year. Rohan’s tax summary for the 2021–22 income year is: Taxable income $0 Excess deductions to carry forward $7,000 2022–23 income year During the 2022–23 income year, the long-term tenants in Property C move out. Property C is unoccupied for a 3-month period and Rohan then lives in the property for a short time while his home is being renovated. Rohan then decides to let Property C as short-stay accommodation for the remainder of the income year. As a result of the change of use, Property C satisfies the mixed-use asset criteria in the 2022–23 income year. For the 2022–23 income year, Rohan must apply the mixed-use asset rules, instead of the standard tax rules and the residential property ring-fencing rules, to determine his tax obligations relating to Property C. After calculating the deductions, he can claim for Property C under the mixed-use asset rules, Rohan calculates that his net income derived from Property C is $3,500. In the 2022–23 income year, Rohan’s rental activity from his residential portfolio is as follows: Residential portfolio Residential income Deductible expenditure Expenditure deductible in the 2022–23 income year Excess deductions carried forward to future income year Property A $16,500 $15,500 Property B $20,000 $20,000 Excess amounts carried forward from prior income year $7,000 IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 19 of 35 Total $36,500 $42,500 $36,500 $6,000 The excess amounts carried forward from the prior income year are added to the deductible expenses for the 2022–23 income year. The amount Rohan can claim in the 2022–23 income year is the greater of the total deductible expenses and the residential income from the portfolio for the income year. In this case, that means Rohan can claim $36,500 of the expenses and has $6,000 of unused excess deductions to carry forward to the 2023–24 income year. The effect of this is that Rohan has been able to offset $1,000 of the prior-year unused excess deductions against his residential income in the 2022–23 income year. However, as Property C is a mixed-use asset and excluded from the s EL 4 limitation in the 2022–23 income year, Rohan is unable to offset any unused excess deductions against the income relating to Property C. Rohan is taxed on his net income from Property C of $3,500. Rohan’s tax summary for the 2022–23 income year is: Taxable income $3,500 Excess deductions to carry forward $6,000 2023–24 income year Rohan secures a long-term tenant for Property C in April 2023. Property C is not a mixed-use asset in the 2023–24 income year and is once again a residential property subject to the s EL 4 limitation in the residential property ring-fencing rules. In the 2023–24 income year, Rohan’s rental activity from his residential portfolio is as follows: Residential portfolio Residential income Deductible expenditure Expenditure deductible in the 2023–24 income year Excess deductions carried forward to future income year Property A $16,500 $16,000 Property B $20,000 $22,000 Property C $15,000 $13,000 Excess amounts carried forward $6,000 IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 20 of 35 from prior income year Total $51,500 $57,000 $51,500 $5,500 The excess amounts carried forward from the prior income year are added to the deductible expenses for the 2023–24 income year. The amount Rohan can claim in the 2023–24 income year is the greater of the total deductible expenses and the residential income from the portfolio for the income year. In this case, that means Rohan can claim $51,500 of the expenses and has $5,500 of unused excess deductions to carry forward to the 2024–25 income year. The effect of this is that Rohan has been able to offset $500 of the prior-year unused excess deductions against his residential income in the 2023–24 income year. Rohan’s tax summary for the 2023–24 income year is: Taxable income $0 Excess deductions to carry forward $5,500 Example | Tauira 5 – Offsetting unused excess deductions – property-by-property basis The same facts apply as in Example | Tauira 4, except that Rohan elects to apply the residential property ring-fencing rules to Property C on a property-by-property basis. 2021–22 income year In the 2021–22 income year, Rohan’s rental activity is as follows: Residential portfolio Residential income Deductible expenditure Expenditure deductible in the 2021–22 income year Excess deductions carried forward to future income year Property A $16,500 $16,500 Property B $20,000 $19,000 Total $36,500 $35,500 $35,500 $0 Property-by- property basis IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 21 of 35 Property C $5,000 $13,000 $5,000 $8,000 Rohan has $8,000 of unused excess deductions to carry forward to the 2022–23 income year relating to Property C. Rohan is able to claim the total $35,500 of expenses for his residential portfolio because the income from the portfolio exceeds that. Rohan therefore has net $1,000 of residential income from his residential portfolio. Rohan’s tax summary for the 2021–22 income year is: Taxable income $1,000 Excess deductions to carry forward $8,000 2022–23 income year In the 2022–23 income year, Rohan’s rental activity from his residential portfolio is as follows: Residential portfolio Residential income Deductible expenditure Expenditure deductible in the 2022–23 income year Excess deductions carried forward to future income year Property A $16,500 $15,500 Property B $20,000 $20,000 Total $36,500 $35,500 $35,500 $0 Rohan is able to claim the total $35,500 of expenses for his residential portfolio, as the income from the portfolio exceeds that. He therefore has net $1,000 of residential income from his residential portfolio. Rohan’s calculations of the deductions he can claim for Property C under the mixed- use asset rules show the net income he derived from Property C is $3,500. He is unable to offset any of the unused excess deductions relating to Property C that have been carried forward under the ring-fencing rules against the asset income derived in relation to Property C. Rohan is taxed on his net income from Property C of $3,500. Rohan will have $8,000 of unused excess deductions to carry forward to the 2023–24 income year from Property C.

In this case, that means Rohan can claim $36,500 of the expenses and has $1,500 of unused excess deductions relating to his residential portfolio to carry forward to the 2024–25 income year. In relation to Property C, Rohan can claim $15,000 of the expenses and has $6,000 of unused excess deductions to carry forward to the 2024–25 income year. The effect of this is that Rohan has been able to offset $2,000 of the prior-year unused excess deductions against his residential income from Property C in the 2023–24 income year. Rohan has in total excess residential rental deductions of $7,500 available to carry forward to the 2024–25 income year. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 23 of 35 Rohan’s tax summary for the 2023–24 income year is: Taxable income $0 Excess deductions to carry forward $7,500 Part three – Calculating depreciation deductions 79.A person may claim a depreciation deduction for an item of depreciable property (fo r e xample, stove, carpets, fridge) that they use for income-earning purposes. Since the 2011–12 income year it is no longer possible to claim any depreciation on t he r esidential property itself (including any fixtures or improvements). 3 A person cannot claim a depreciation deduction for chattels they use solely for private purposes. 80.The application of the rules can become complicated when a person has calculated d epreciation deductions under the mixed-use asset rules in one income year and under the standard tax rules in the next income year, or the other way around. 81.If the standard tax rules apply, a person must consider whether the residential property ring-fencing rules limit a deduction for any depreciation loss. If the mixed-use asset rules apply, the amount of the depreciation deduction is limited by the apportionment calculation and may also be limited under the mixed-use asset quarantined expenditure rules. 82.The first step is to calculate the depreciation loss for the income year for each item of depreciable property. The next step is to work out what proportion of those losses a per son may claim as a deduction in the income year. 83.If a person claims a depreciation deduction, they must keep a schedule of all the items of depreciable property they are depreciating. This schedule should show t he d epreciation the person has claimed in previous income years and the adjusted tax value (ATV) of each item of depreciable property. Calculating depreciation loss 84.Before a person can apply any apportionment method, they must work out the depreciation loss for the income year for each item of depreciable property. 85.For low-value items (up to $1,000), the depreciation loss is the depreciable property’s cost. For other items of depreciable property, a person must work out the depreciation 3 For the 2011–12 income year and subsequent income years, depreciation on residential buildings is 0% where buildings have an estimated life of more than 50 years. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 24 of 35 loss for the income year using either the diminishing value (DV) method or the straight-line (SL) method. For information about the methods and the depreciation rates, see Inland Revenue’s website: Depreciation rate finder and calculator . 86.The starting point to calculate the depreciation loss is to determine the ATV. An item’s ATV is its “base value” less “total deductions”. 87.Generally, the “base value” is the cost a person incurred in purchasing the item of depreciable property. 88.The “total deductions” amount includes all deductions for amounts of depreciation loss the person has been allowed or would have been allowed if the person had used t he i tem wholly in deriving assessable income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income. That is, the “total deductions” amount is the amoun t bef ore any apportionment under either the mixed-use asset rules or the standard tax rules. 89.Example | Tauira 6 illustrates how to calculate depreciation loss on a chattel used in a residential property. Example | Tauira 6 – C alculating depreciation loss Marama owns a two-bedroom property in Kaikōura. Marama purchases a new leather lounge suite for $7,500 on 1 April 2020 for her Kaikōura property. The depreciation rate for loose furniture is 20% DV. Marama calculates her depreciation loss for the 2020–21 income year as follows: Opening ATV Depreciation loss Closing ATV 7,500 1,500 6,000 Example | Tauira 7 shows how Marama calculates her depreciation deduction for the 2020–21 income year. Determining the depreciation deduction under the standard tax rules 90.Under the standard tax rules, a person can claim depreciation on items of depreciable p roperty that they use or that are available for them to use in deriving taxable income. 91.If the item of depreciable property is wholly used to derive taxable income, the person c an claim the full depreciation loss as a deduction. The next step is to determine whether the deduction is suspended under the residential property ring-fencing rules. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 25 of 35 92.If the item of depreciable property is partly used to derive taxable income, the person m ust apportion between private and income earning use. The specific apportionment formula for depreciation of items partly used to earn income is (s EE 50): depreciation loss × qualifying use days ÷ all days 93.“Qualifying use days” is the number of days the residential property is rented out or is available to be rented out. “All days” is the number of days in an income year the residential property is used or available for use for any purpose. 94.Where a person uses an item of depreciable property partly for private use and partly to earn income, s EE 50(2) states that the depreciation deduction “must not be more” than the amount calculated using the formula. 95.However, the depreciation deduction may be less than the amount calculated under the formula. This would be the case where the person uses the depreciable property for private purposes and to derive taxable income on the same day. In this situation, apportionment under the general permission for deductibility is appropriate (s DA 1). For example, if the item of depreciable property is used for both private and incom e ea rning purposes at the same time (for example, it is in a common use area) t he C ommissioner would generally accept the amount of the depreciation loss being apportioned 50:50 between the private use and the income-earning use (so 50% deductible and 50% non-deductible). However, where the actual use of the asset can be clearly demonstrated, an alternative basis may be adopted if it reflects a reasonabl e basis of apportionment. Depreciation deductions may be suspended under the residential property ring-fencing rules 96.If a person uses the standard tax rules to calculate their depreciation deduction, they must also consider whether the residential property ring-fencing rules apply. 97.If the residential property ring-fencing rules apply to the residential property for the income year, the person may need to suspend a portion of the depreciation deduction (together with all other deductions for the property) and carry it forward to a future income year as an unused excess deduction. 98.Suspending a depreciation deduction in an income year does not change how the per son calculates their depreciation loss in the next income year. A person calculates the ATV based on the total deductions they could have claimed before any suspensio n ( see \[86\]). 99.A person must maintain records of any suspended depreciation deductions and track whether the amount is claimed as a deduction in a future income year. If the suspended depreciation deduction is claimed in a future income year, the ATV of t he i tem of depreciable property must be recalculated. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 26 of 35 Determining the depreciation deduction under the mixed- use asset rules 100.If the residential property is a mixed-use asset, the mixed-use asset rules override the pa rtial use rules in subpart EE. 101.Under the mixed-use asset rules, a person is allowed a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss to the extent of the amount calculated using the formula in s DG 9(2). The apportionment formula is set out in \[39\]. The effect of the formula is that t he pr oportion of the depreciation loss that is deductible reflects the income-earning us e o f the mixed-use asset relative to the private use. 102.If the quarantined expenditure rules apply (see \[42\]) a person must quarantine a p ortion of the depreciation deduction and carry it forward to a future income year. 103.Any limitation of the depreciation deduction due to the mixed-use asset apportionment formula or the quarantined expenditure rules, does not change how a person calculates their depreciation loss in the next income year. 104.Example | Tauira 7 illustrates how depreciation deductions are calculated when the income tax deduction rules that apply to the residential property changes. Example | Tauira 7 – C alculating depreciation deductions on chattels where the land regime that applies to a residential property changes The same facts apply as in Example | Tauira 6. During the 2020–21 income year, Marama stayed in her property from 20 December 2020 to 15 February 2021 (57 nights) and made the property available for short-stay accommodation for the remainder of the income year. In the 2020–21 income year, the property was booked for 170 nights and unused for the other 138 nights that it was available for short-stay accommodation. Marama’s Kaikōura property is a mixed- use asset for the 2020–21 income year – see QB XX/06 Income tax – which rules apply if I have a dwelling I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and also sometimes uses privately?: Because Marama’s Kaikōura property is a mixed-use asset, Marama must determine the portion of the depreciation loss that is deductible under the mixed-use asset rules. For the purposes of this example, Marama calculates her expenditure on the basis that the depreciation loss is her sole item of expenditure or loss. Marama calculates her mixed-use asset expenditure using the following formula: expenditure × income-earning days ÷ (income-earning days + counted days) IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 27 of 35 Expenditure = $1,500 Income-earning days = 170 Counted days = 57 Marama’s mixed-use asset expenditure is $1,123.35. Marama’s deprecation deduction is $1,123.35. The amount of the depreciation deduction due to the mixed-use asset rules will not affect the calculation of the ATV of the leather lounge suite in the next income year. The ATV is $6,000 ($7,500 less $1,500) for the 2021–22 income year. Towards the end of the 2020–21 income year, Marama is getting fewer short-stay bookings, so she decides to let the Kaikōura property to a tenant on a long-term basis. Marama’s tenant occupies the Kaikōura property from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2023. As the Kaikōura property is not used privately during the 2021–22 income year or the 2022–23 income year, it will not be a mixed-use asset in those income years. The standard tax rules will apply to the Kaikōura property. Marama calculates her depreciation loss in the 2021–22 and 2022–23 income years: Opening ATV Depreciation loss Closing ATV 2022 $6,000 $1,200 $4,800 2023 $4,800 $960 $3,840 Marama’s rental activity makes a loss in both the 2021–22 and 2022–23 income years. Marama calculates that because of the application of the residential rental ring-fencing rules, she can claim deductions for 66.66% of her total expenditure for the property in the 2021–22 income year and 72.39% of her total expenditure for the property in the 2022–23 income year (that is, Marama’s income from the residential property is 66.66% and 72.39% of the expenditure incurred in the 2021–22 and 2022–23 income years respectively). On this basis, the depreciation deduction Marama can claim is limited to $800 in the 2021–22 income year and $695 in the 2022–23 income year. The remainder of the depreciation deduction ($400 in the 2021–22 income year and $265 in the 2022–23 income year) is suspended and carried forward to future income years. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 28 of 35 Part four - Sale of depreciable property 105.A person must calculate their depreciation recovery income or depreciation loss on s ale if they: sell an item of depreciable property; or the item of depreciable property is not used to derive income (for example, they have sold the residential property the depreciable property was used i n c onjunction with). 106.The method to calculate depreciation recovery income or depreciation loss on sale is the same whether the mixed-use asset rules or standard tax deduction rules apply i n t he income year of disposal. 4 Calculating depreciation recovery income 107.Depreciation recovery income arises when the depreciable property is sold for more than its ATV. 108.Generally, the depreciation recovery income is the lesser of: the amount by which the consideration is more than the item’s ATV on the date of disposal; and the total of the amounts of depreciation loss for which a person has been a llowed deductions for the item of depreciable property. 109.However, when a person partly used the item of depreciable property to produce in come (for example, an item of depreciable property in a mixed-use asset), they must use a specific formula to calculate the depreciation recovery income (s EE 49). Sale of depreciable property partly used to produce income 110.Section EE 49 applies if: at any time during the period a person owns an item of depreciable property, they determine the depreciation deduction under s EE 50 (see \[92\]); or the item of depreciable property is used in a mixed-use asset. 111.The formula in s EE 49 is: (all deductions ÷ (base value – adjusted tax value)) 4 Section DG 8(2)(b) and (c) provide that for a mixed-use asset, depreciation recovery income is dealt with in s EE 49 and a depreciation loss on disposal is dealt with in ss EE 44 to EE 48 and s EE 50(6) and (7). IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 29 of 35 × amount of depreciation recovery income where: “all deductions” means all amounts of depreciation loss for which the person ha s been allowed a depreciation deduction; “base value” generally means the cost of the item of depreciable property; “adjusted tax value” is the item’s base value less “total deductions”; and “amount of depreciation recovery income” is the amount by which the sal e p roceeds is more than the item’s ATV on the date on which the item is sold. 112.The depreciation recovery income formula takes into account deductions that have been allowed. If a person did not deduct all or part of a depreciation loss due to the mixed-use asset apportionment formula, the mixed-use asset quarantined expenditur e r ules, or the residential property ring-fencing rules, the denied amount would not be c lawed back as depreciation recovery income. 113.After calculating depreciation recovery income, a person can determine the extent to which they can use any prior-year quarantined expenditure under the mixed-use asset rules, or unused excess deductions under the residential property ring-fencing rules, to offset the depreciation recovery income. Unable to use prior-year mixed-use asset quarantined expenditure against depreciation recovery income 114.Mixed-use asset quarantined expenditure carried forward from a prior income year may be offset against “asset income” in the current income year (s DG 17). “Asse t i ncome” is the total amount of taxable income derived in the current income year from “the use of the asset” (s DG 17(3)(a)). 115.While depreciation recovery income generally consists of the reversal of depreciation de ductions, it arises on the sale of the depreciable property rather than from the use of the asset. Because depreciation recovery income is not “asset income”, a person cannot offset prior-year mixed-use asset quarantined expenditure against depreciatio n r ecovery income. Offsetting unused excess deductions against depreciation recovery income 116.A person can offset unused excess deductions against depreciation recovery income if the residential property ring-fencing rules apportionment mechanism (s EL 4) applies to the residential property in the income year in which they sell the item of depreciabl e pr operty. This is illustrated in Example | Tauira 8. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 30 of 35 117.However, if the s EL 4 allocation mechanism does not apply to the residential property in the income year in which the person sells the item of depreciable property, they cannot use any previously unused excess deductions. While the depreciation recovery income will be residential income (s EL 3), if s EL 4 does not apply to the residential property due to an exclusion (for example, because it is a mixed-use asset for tha t income year (s EL 12)), the person cannot use any previously unused excess deductions a gainst the depreciation recovery income. This is illustrated in Example | Tauira 9. Example | Tauira 8 – How to calculate depreciation recovery income from the sale of an item of depreciable property in a residential rental property The same facts apply as in Example | Tauira 6 and Example | Tauira 7. Marama’s depreciation treatment of the leather lounge suite is as follows: Income y ear Opening ATV Depreciation loss Closing ATV Deductions 2020–21 $7,500 $1,500 $6,000 $1,123.35 2021–22 $6,000 $1,200 $4,800 $800 2022–23 $4,800 $960 $3,840 $695 Marama continues to rent out her Kaikōura property to a long-term tenant in the 2023–24 income year. On this basis, Marama uses the standard tax rules to calculate her income and expenditure from the Kaikōura property. On 1 April 2023 Marama sells the lounge suite for $5,000. Because the sale proceeds are more than the lounge suite’s closing ATV, Marama must determine her depreciation recovery income using the following formula: (all deductions ÷ (base value – adjusted tax value)) × amount of depreciation recovery income All deductions = $2,618.35 ($1,123.35 + 800 + 695) Base value = $7,500 Adjusted tax value = $3,840 Amount of depreciation recovery income = $1,160 ($5,000 less $3,840) Total depreciation recovery income = $829.86 Marama must return the depreciation recovery income in her 2023–24 income tax return. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 31 of 35 The standard tax rules and residential property ring-fencing rules apply to the Kaikōura property in the 2023–24 income year. On this basis, Marama will be able to offset her unused excess deduction carried forward from earlier income years. Marama calculates her net income as follows: 5 Depreciation recovery income $829.86 Excess amounts carried forward from prior year – 2021–22 ($400) Excess amounts carried forward from prior year – 2022–23 ($265) Net income $164.86 Example | Tauira 9 – How to calculate depreciation recovery income from the sale of an item of depreciable property used in a mixed-use asset Hudson owns a three-bedroom property in Hamilton. He purchased it as a rental investment and let it to tenants from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2023. The standard tax rules applied to the Hamilton property in the 2021–22 and 2022–23 income years. The residential property ring-fencing rules apply to limit Hudson’s deductions in the 2021–22 and 2022–23 income years. Hudson let the three-bedroom property partially furnished and then purchased a new dining suite for $2,500 on 1 April 2021. The depreciation rate for loose furniture is 13.5% SL. During the 2023–24 income year, Hudson’s tenants move out. Hudson is unable to secure new tenants, and the property is unoccupied for 3 months until he decides to move into the property himself. The Hamilton property is a mixed-use asset for the 2023–24 income year. Hudson’s depreciation treatment of the dining suite is as follows: Income year Opening ATV Depreciation loss Closing ATV Deduction 2021–22 $2,500.00 $337.50 $2,162.50 $280.00 2022–23 $2,162.50 $337.50 $1,825.00 $275.00 2023–24 $1,825.00 $337.50 $1,487.50 $130.00 5 For the purpose of this example, we have ignored any rental income or other deductions for the income year. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 32 of 35 In the 2023–24 income year, $207.50 of the depreciation loss was disallowed as a deduction under the mixed-use asset rules. The amount of disallowed depreciation loss includes $83 of quarantined expenditure (that is, expenditure that is not deductible in the income year but instead carried forward to a future income year for use against income derived from the Hamilton property in the future). On 1 April 2024, Hudson decides to sell the dining suite for $2,000. Because the sale proceeds Hudson receives are more than the dining suite’s closing ATV, he must return depreciation recovery income using the following formula: (all deductions ÷ (base value – adjusted tax value)) × amount of depreciation recovery income All deductions = $685 ($280 + $275 + $130) Base value = $2,500 Adjusted tax value = $1,487.50 Amount of depreciation recovery income = $1,012.50 ($2,500 less $1,487.50) Total depreciation recovery income = $685 Hudson must return the depreciation recovery income of $685 in his 2023–24 income tax return. The standard tax rules do not apply to the Hamilton property in the 2023–24 income year. For this reason, Hudson cannot offset his unused excess deductions carried forward from the 2021–22 income year ($57.50) and 2022–23 income year ($62.50). Further, Hudson cannot offset the prior-year quarantined expenditure amount ($83) against the depreciation recovery income. Calculating depreciation loss on sale 118.If a person sells an item of depreciable property for less than the item’s ATV, they will i ncur a depreciation loss on sale (s EE 48(2)). 119.Generally, the amount of the depreciation loss on sale is the amount by which the c onsideration is less than the item’s ATV on that date. However, when a person partly uses the item of depreciable property to produce income (for example, an item of depreciable property in a mixed-use asset), they must use a specific formula to calculate the depreciation recovery income (s EE 50(6)). IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 33 of 35 Sale of depreciable property partly used to produce income 120.The formula in s EE 50(6) applies if a person sells an item of depreciable property at a loss and, during the period they owned that item, they used it partly to produce income and calculated the amount of depreciation deduction under s EE 50(2). 121.The formula in s EE 50(6) is: disposal depreciation loss × all deductions ÷ (base value – adjusted tax value at date of disposal) where: “disposal depreciation loss” means the sale consideration less the ATV; “all deductions” means all amounts of depreciation loss for which the person has been allowed a depreciation deduction; “base value” generally means the cost of the item of depreciable property; and “adjusted tax value at date of disposal” is an item’s base value less “total deductions” at the date of sale. 122.The effect of the formula is that the loss on sale is apportioned in the same proportion as the depreciation deductions were apportioned. 123.Example | Tauira 10 illustrates how to calculate depreciation loss on the sale of an item of depreciable property. Example | Tauira 10 – Calculating depreciation loss from the sale of an item of depreciable property used in a mixed-use asset Keely owns a two-bedroom holiday home in Arrowtown. It is a mixed-use asset, and she calculates her income and expenditure from the holiday home under the mixed- use asset rules. Keely purchases a $1,800 fridge for her holiday home on 1 April 2021. The depreciation rate for fridges is 17.5% SL. Keely’s depreciation loss is as follows: Income y ear Opening ATV Depreciation loss Closing ATV Deductions 2021–22 $1,800 $315 $1,485 $236 2022–23 $1,484 $315 $1,170 $283 2023–24 $1,170 $315 $855 $267 IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 34 of 35 The mixed-use asset apportionment formula has limited Keely’s depreciation deductions in the 2021–22 to 2023–24 income years. Keely sells the fridge for $500 on 1 April 2024. As the amount Keely receives is less than the fridge’s ATV, she has incurred a depreciation loss on sale. Keely calculates her depreciation loss on sale using the following formula: disposal depreciation loss × all deductions ÷ (base value – adjusted tax value at date) Disposal depreciation loss = $355 ($855 less $500) All deductions = $786 ($236 + $283 + $267) Base value = $1,800 Adjusted tax value at date = $855 Total depreciation loss on disposal = $295.27 Keely will be able to claim a deduction in the 2024–25 income year for the depreciation loss on disposal of $295.27.

They set out the Commissioner’s views and guidance on how New Zealand’s tax laws apply. They may address specific situations we have been asked to provide guidance on, or they may be about how legislative provisions apply more generally. While they set out the Commissioner’s considered views, interpretation statements are not binding on the Commissioner. However, taxpayers can generally rely on them in determining their tax affairs. See further Status of Commissioner’s advice ( Commissioner’s statement, Inland Revenue, December 2012). It is important to note that a general similarity between a taxpayer’s circumstances and an example in an interpretation statement will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case must be considered on its own facts.

Key provisions | Whakaratonga tāpua Section YD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 sets out the tax residence rules for individuals. Key terms | Kīanga tau tāpua 183-day rule An individual is a tax resident in New Zealand if they have been present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in total in any 12- month period. IS XX/XX FS 1 | Issue date Page 2 of 10 If a person is tax resident under the 183-day rule, they are treated as resident from the first of the 183 days, unless they acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand earlier, in which case they are resident from that date. 325-day rule If an individual no longer has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, they may cease being a New Zealand tax resident under the 325-day rule. This rule requires that the person is absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in total in a 12-month period . If a person ceases to be tax resident under the 325-day rule, they are treated as non-resident from the first of the 325 days or the day after the day they cease having a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, whichever is later. Permanent place of abode test An individual is tax resident in New Zealand if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. This is the overriding residence rule for individuals. This means that even if the person would be non-resident under another rule (for example, the 325-day rule), they cannot become non-tax resident if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. A place of abode (that is, a dwelling) is a person’s permanent place of abode if it is a place they habitually reside from time to time even if they spend periods overseas. To be a permanent place of abode, the abode must be a place the person habitually resides on an enduring, rather than temporary, basis. IS XX/XX FS 1 | Issue date Page 3 of 10 Introduction | Whakataki 1. The concept of tax residence is a central feature of the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 2. The main relevance of tax residence for income tax purposes is that it determines whether a person is assessable for tax on worldwide income or on only New Zealand– sourced income. This is because:  New Zealand residents are assessable on worldwide income 1 (though they may be entitled to a credit for foreign tax paid on foreign-sourced income or gains); and  non-residents are assessable on only New Zealand-sourced income. 3. Tax residence is also relevant to:  a person’s eligibility for Working for Families tax credits, including Best Start (which is a payment for families with a newborn baby); and  the filing obligations and interest treatment of student loans for borrowers who are away from New Zealand. Overview of tax residence for individuals Tax residence rules for individuals 4. The permanent place of abode rule is the overriding tax residence test for individuals. This means that if a person has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand they are tax resident here regardless of any of the other tax residence rules. 5. The main rules are that an individual is a New Zealand tax resident if they :  have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, even if they also have a permanent place of abode elsewhere (this is called the permanent place of abode test);  have been present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in total in any 12- month period ( this is called the 183-day rule); or  are absent from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand Government (this is called the government service rule). 1 Other than exempt income and excluded income. IS XX/XX FS 1 | Issue date Page 4 of 10 6. There is an exception to the normal residence rules for people employed under the Recognised Seasonal Employer Scheme. This scheme allows businesses in the horticulture and viticulture industries to recruit workers from Pacific Island countries for seasonal work. A person employed under the Recognise Seasonal Employer Scheme is treated as non-resident during the time they are employed under the scheme, provided they do not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. How an individual ceases being tax resident in New Zealand 7. An individual remains tax resident in New Zealand as long as they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand – even if they also have a permanent place of abode outside New Zealand. 8. But if an individual no longer has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, they cease being a New Zealand tax resident if they are absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in total in a 12-month period (this is called the 325-day rule). 9. However, the 325-day rule does not apply to an individual who is resident under the government service rule. They remain tax resident in New Zealand however long they are absent from New Zealand in the service of the Government. If an individual is tax resident in more than one country 10. If an individual is tax resident in New Zealand and also in a country New Zealand has a double tax agreement (DTA) with, “tie-breaker” rules apply to allocate tax residence to one of the countries for the purposes of the DTA. The DTA then determines the taxing rights of each country in relation to matters covered by the DTA. For more information, see IS xx/xx. 11. Whether or not there is a DTA, if an individual is taxable in New Zealand and another country on some income, they may be entitled to a credit in New Zealand for foreign tax paid on foreign-sourced income or gains. For more information, see IS xx/xx. Transitional residence – temporary tax exemptions for new migrants and returning New Zealanders 12. New migrants and returning New Zealanders who have been non-resident for at least 10 years may be eligible to be transitional residents. Transitional residents are entitled to temporary tax exemptions for certain foreign-sourced income. IS XX/XX FS 1 | Issue date Page 5 of 10 13. Transitional residents cannot receive Working for Families tax credits (including Best Start) and maintain their transitional residence status. In addition, the spouse or partner of a transitional resident cannot receive Working for Families tax credits. 14. It is important to note that if a person who is eligible to be a transitional resident applies for Working for Families tax credits (including Best Start), that application is treated as an election for both the person and their spouse or partner to not be transitional residents. This election cannot be reversed. 15. Transitional residents may receive FamilyBoost tax credits (which provide financial assistance to caregivers with early childhood education costs). Applying for FamilyBoost is not treated as an election to no longer be a transitional resident. A permanent place of abode in New Zealand 16. The permanent place of abode test is usually considered where someone who has lived in New Zealand leaves the country for some time. In this situation, the question is whether they can be regarded as continuing to habitually reside at their place of abode in New Zealand, despite a period or periods of absence. 17. The test can also be relevant to people who move between countries, and potentially when someone moves to New Zealand (though in that situation residence is usually triggered under the 183-day rule). 18. A place of abode ( that is, a dwelling) is a person’s permanent place of abode if it is a place where they habitually reside from time to time even if they spend periods overseas. To be a permanent place of abode, the abode must be a place where the person habitually resides on an enduring, rather than temporary, basis. 19. A person must have a place of abode (that is, a dwelling) in New Zealand to potentially have a permanent place of abode here. This does not mean the person needs to own the dwelling. For example, the property might be rented, held in a family trust, or owned by a family company or other family member. However, simply having a dwelling is not sufficient – the dwelling must be the person’s permanent place of abode. 20. Deciding whether a dwelling is someone’s permanent place of abode requires an overall assessment of the person’s circumstances and the nature and quality of the use the person habitually makes of the dwelling. 21. In determining whether a place of abode is a person’s permanent place of abode, it is necessary to consider the:  continuity and duration of the person’s presence in New Zealand; and IS XX/XX FS 1 | Issue date Page 6 of 10  durability of the person’s association with their place of abode here and how close their connection with it is. Continuity and duration of presence in New Zealand 22. As a general rule, the longer a person is present in New Zealand, the more likely it is that their place of abode here is a permanent place of abode for them. Conversely, the longer a person is absent from New Zealand, the less likely it is that their place of abode here will continue to be a permanent place of abode for them. It is also relevant to consider whether the person is present in New Zealand for continuous or interrupted periods. 23. There is no specific length of presence in or absence from New Zealand that results in a person acquiring or losing a permanent place of abode here. If a person has strong connections with New Zealand and their place of abode here, a longer period of absence would be required for their place of abode to no longer be considered their permanent place of abode than if the person’s connections to New Zealand and the place of abode were weaker. The circumstances as a whole must be considered. Durability of association with place of abode 24. To determine whether a person has a durable association with their place of abode, the person’s overall connections with their place of abode and with New Zealand must be weighed up. It is then necessary to evaluate the extent to which those connections indicate the person has an enduring relationship with their place of abode here, such that it can be considered to be their permanent place of abode. 25. Important factors to consider when assessing whether a person has a durable association with a place of abode, such that it can be regarded as a permanent place of abode for them, are:  the nature and quality of the use of the dwelling and the person’s connection with the dwelling;  the person’s intentions;  the person’s family and social ties;  the person’s employment, business interests and economic ties;  the person’s personal property; and  any other factors that shed light on whether the place of abode is a permanent place of abode for the person. IS XX/XX FS 1 | Issue date Page 7 of 10 26. It does not matter how strong a person’s ties to New Zealand are if those ties do not indicate the particular dwelling in question is a permanent place of abode for the person. For example, if a person has strong connections to New Zealand, but the only dwelling they have here is a property they have never lived in and never intend to live in, that property cannot be a permanent place of abode for them. 27. A person can be resident in New Zealand under the permanent place of abode test even if they also have a permanent place of abode outside New Zealand. The focus is not on determining which place the person has the strongest connections to, but on whether their place of abode in New Zealand is a permanent place of abode. The 183-day rule 28. In addition to the permanent place of abode test, a person can become tax resident in New Zealand under the 183-day rule. 29. Under this rule, a person is tax resident in New Zealand if they have been present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in total in any 12-month period. 30. The 183-day rule does not relate to an income year, a calendar year, or any other particular 12-month period, and the days of presence do not need to be consecutive. If a person is present in New Zealand for part of a day, that part-day counts as a full day of presence. 31. If a person is tax resident under the 183-day rule, they are treated as resident from the first of the 183 days, unless they acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand earlier – in which case they are resident from that date. 32. Because of this back-dating rule, a person’s tax residence in New Zealand could start from a date before they established a permanent place of abode here. An example of when this might happen is if the person came to New Zealand for a holiday or job interview before moving here. The 325-day rule 33. If an individual no longer has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, they may cease being a New Zealand tax resident under the 325-day rule. 34. This rule requires that the person is absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in total in a 12-month period. 35. The 325-day rule does not relate to an income year, a calendar year, or any other particular 12-month period, and the days of absence do not need to be consecutive. If IS XX/XX FS 1 | Issue date Page 8 of 10 a person is present in New Zealand for part of a day, that part-day counts as a full day of presence and does not count towards days of absence. 36. The 325-day rule does not apply to an individual who is resident under the government service rule. They remain tax resident in New Zealand however long they are absent from New Zealand in the service of the government. For more information about the government service rule, see IS xx/xx: Government service rule. 37. If a person ceases to be tax resident under the 325-day rule, they are treated as not resident from the first of the 325 days, provided they did not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand at any time during the 325-day period. Because the permanent place of abode rule is the overriding tax residence test for individuals, someone cannot cease being tax resident any earlier than the day after the day they cease having a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 38. Once a person ceases to be resident, they remain non-resident until they either acquire a permanent place of abode in New Zealand or satisfy the 183-day rule. Changes in tax residence 39. If a person’s tax residence or transitional residence status changes during an income year, the income tax implications need to be considered. The more significant potential implications are discussed in IS xx/xx. 40. If a person’s circumstances change during an income year and this may affect their tax residence, they should get in touch with Inland Revenue to let us know. This can be done by filling in IR886 : N ew Zealand tax residence questionnaire and sending it to us (through myIR or by post). 41. If a person has derived income in the year their tax residence changes, they need to file a tax return in New Zealand. 42. A taxpayer may wish to consult a tax professional if they are in doubt about their situation. Flowchart – how to determine whether an individual is tax resident in New Zealand 43.

If there are directors both in New Zealand and overseas, often a simple majority approach is appropriate in testing whether control of the company is exercised from New Zealand. But this is not always the case (see from \[21\]). The definition of “director” for this test is broad, to ensure that de facto directors are included and that entities without directors (such as unit trusts) are covered by the test. This test focuses on where the directors exercise their directorial control of the company as a whole from – that is, the place from which the strategic and policy decisions are made, on a continuing basis. head office test A company is a New Zealand tax resident if its head office is in New Zealand. A company’s head office is the office, which must be a physical place (for example, a building), from which the company’s business is directed and carried on. place of incorporation test A company is a New Zealand tax resident if it is incorporated in New Zealand. This includes any company incorporated under the Companies Act 1993. IS XX/XX FS 3 | Issue date Page 3 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Introduction | Whakataki 1. The concept of tax residence is a central feature of the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 2. The main relevance of tax residence for income tax purposes is that it determines whether a person is assessable for tax on worldwide income or on only New Zealand- sourced income. This is because:  New Zealand residents are assessable on worldwide income 1 (though they may be entitled to a credit for foreign tax paid on foreign-sourced income or gains); and  non-residents are assessable only on New Zealand–sourced income. Tax residence rules for companies Overview of the domestic tax residence rules for companies 3. A company is a New Zealand tax resident if:  it is incorporated in New Zealand;  its head office is in New Zealand;  its centre of management is in New Zealand; or  its directors, in their capacity as directors, exercise control of the company in New Zealand, even if the directors’ decision-making also occurs outside New Zealand. 4. The definition of “company” goes beyond just a body corporate. For example, the definition includes a unit trust, and it extends to any entity with a legal existence separate from that of its members. This means it includes a wide variety of entities established under the laws of other countries that, although not companies in the strict sense, are equivalent to companies. The place of incorporation test 5. The first tax residence test is that a company is a New Zealand tax resident if it is incorporated in New Zealand. 1 Other than exempt income and excluded income. IS XX/XX FS 3 | Issue date Page 4 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 6. This includes any company incorporated under the Companies Act 1993. Entities within the extended definition of company that are not capable of being incorporated, cannot be tax resident in New Zealand under this test (for example, a unit trust, for which there is no incorporation procedure in New Zealand). The head office test 7. The second tax residence test is that a company is a New Zealand tax resident if its head office is in New Zealand. 8. The head office of a company is the office that is above all others – the place of administration and management that is superior to all others. It is the office, which must be a physical place (for example, a building), from which the business of the company is directed and carried on. 9. Relevant consideration in determining which office is the head office include the location of senior management staff, and where major strategic and policy decisions are made. The centre of management test 10. The third tax residence test is that a company is a New Zealand tax resident if its centre of management is in New Zealand. 11. The focus of the test is on the centre of management of the company as a whole. Acts of management at various levels may be relevant. 12. The focus is on where the company’s centre of management is as a matter of fact. The test is not limited to consideration of the company’s formal management structures, such as those set out in corporate governance documents. What is relevant is how the company is managed in reality, even if that conflicts with governance documents or formal structures. The director control test 13. The final tax residence test is that a company is a New Zealand tax resident if its directors, in their capacity as directors, exercise control of the company in New Zealand, even if the directors’ decision-making also occurs outside New Zealand. 14. The defin ition of “director” for this test is broad, to ensure that de facto directors are included and that entities without directors (such as unit trusts) are covered by the test. The definition includes the following: IS XX/XX FS 3 | Issue date Page 5 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  A person who occupies the position of director (that is, carries out the duties of a director), whether or not that title is used.  A person whose directions or instructions those occupying the position of directors are accustomed to acting in accordance with. The directions or instructions do not need to be direct – eg, this could be through a chain of companies.  A person who acts in the same way or a similar way as a director would act – that is, someone who is involved in making the types of decisions a director of a company would normally make. This ensures the test covers entities that do not have directors in the conventional sense (for example, a unit trust’s manager is a director for the test). 15. The director control test focuses on where the directors exercise their directorial control of the company as a whole from – that is, the place from which strategic and policy decisions are made. 16. The significance of the location of directors’ meetings varies. If directors exercise control only during directors’ meetings, the location of those meetings is of paramount importance. But if control is exercised outside of directors’ meetings, and the meetings are merely to formalise decisions that have already been made, the location of the meetings is of little significance. 17. The fact directors exercise directorial functions from New Zealand does not necessarily mean control of the company by its directors is exercised from New Zealand. For example, if the directors ordinarily exercise their powers during directors’ meetings in Australia, the fact New Zealand directors occasionally sign resolutions in New Zealand or participate in online meetings from New Zealand does not mean the directors are exercising control of the company from New Zealand. 18. If the nominated directors do not exercise control of a company, but rather de facto directors exercise control from New Zealand, the company is resident in New Zealand even though the de facto directors are not directors under the company’s constitution. 19. Determining whether the nominated directors exercise true control requires consideration of how the company as a whole is controlled in reality. 20. If nominated directors are accustomed to act in accordance with the directions or instructions of another person, this does not necessarily mean they are not exercising true control of the company. For example, they may exercise their independent minds in undertaking their directorial functions, not simply “rubber stamp” the decisions of others. However, it means the person in accordance with whose directions or instructions they are accustomed to act is also a director. IS XX/XX FS 3 | Issue date Page 6 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 21. Decision-making by directors does not need to be confined to New Zealand for a company to be tax resident under this test. If directorial decision-making is exercised both in New Zealand and overseas, it is necessary to consider whether the functions performed in New Zealand amount to exercise of control of the company from New Zealand. In some cases a simple majority approach is appropriate. For example, if two directors are in Australia and three directors are in New Zealand, the powers of all directors are equal, and directorial decision-making occurs during online meetings, a simple majority approach is appropriate, and the company is tax resident in New Zealand under the director control test. However, a simple majority approach is not appropriate in all situations – for example, if a director has exclusive special powers enabling them to control the company. 22. The director control test is satisfied if the directors exercise control of a company from New Zealand on a continuing basis. If control is ordinarily exercised from New Zealand, but is occasionally exercised from outside New Zealand, the company is tax resident in New Zealand on the basis that the directors exercise control from here. Changes in company tax residence 23. Some of the more significant income tax consequences that may arise when the tax residence of a company changes between New Zealand and another country are as follows:  Under the company migration rules, a company that ceases to be a New Zealand tax resident is treated for tax purposes as if it had disposed of its property at market value, liquidated, and distributed the full amount available for distribution as dividends.  As tax residents are assessable for income tax on foreign-sourced income, a change in tax residence means the foreign-sourced income a company derived while it was tax resident in New Zealand must be calculated (or a reasonable apportionment of the total foreign-sourced income made between the periods of residence and non-residence).  The company may become required to establish and maintain an imputation credit account or may lose the right to maintain one – with associated consequences.  There may be implications in relation to the controlled foreign company regime, the foreign investment fund regime, the financial arrangements rules, the grouping of some losses, and provisional tax. IS XX/XX FS 3 | Issue date Page 7 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] If a company is tax resident in more than one country 24. A company may be tax resident in both New Zealand and in another country under the domestic tax laws of each country. Dual residence has several implications in relation to the application of the Income Tax Act 2007 and New Zealand’s double tax agreements (DTAs). These are discussed in IS xx/xx\[link\]: Tax residence. 25. If there is a DTA between New Zealand and the other country, it generally allocates tax residence to one of the countries for the purposes of the DTA. In determining the treatment of income covered by the DTA, the company is treated as being tax resident only in the country to which tax residence has been allocated. This gives that country the primary taxing right, so reduces the incidence of double taxation. 26. DTAs may be modified by the BEPS Multilateral Instrument (the MLI), 2 so the specific DTA and the countries’ MLI positions must be considered to determine the allocation of tax residence for DTA purposes. Potential for dual residence – central management and control in Australia 27. New Zealand companies that carry on business are Australian tax resident if central management and control of the company is exercised in Australia, even if the company’s commercial activities are carried on outside Australia. Affected New Zealand companies may therefore be dual resident. 28. This could be relevant to, for example, a company that carries on business and has directors that are in or move to Australia. 29. This is discussed in more detail in IS xx/xx. Residence of foreign companies for the international rules 30. There are specific rules about where foreign companies are treated as being tax resident for the purposes of the international tax rules (which are defined in s YA 1 as including the rules relating to controlled foreign companies, foreign investment funds and foreign tax credits). These tax residence rules are set out in IS xx/xx. 2 Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (OECD, ratified by New Zealand on 27 June 2018 and in force for New Zealand 1 October 2018).

IS XX/XX FS 2 | Issue date Page 3 of 9 Introduction | Whakataki 1. Trusts are not separate entities for income tax purposes. The tax residence of the persons connected with a trust (that is, the trustees, settlors and beneficiaries) is relevant in determining the tax treatment of income a trustee derives and amounts distributed to beneficiaries as beneficiary income or taxable distributions. When the tax residence of persons connected with a trust changes, it usually affects how income is taxed. 2. The normal tax residence rules for individuals and companies apply (as relevant) to the trustee, settlors and beneficiaries, depending on whether the person is a natural person or a company. 3. The tax residence rules for individuals and companies are explained in IS xx/xx: Tax residence, and summarised in fact sheets IS xx/xx FS 1: Tax residence – individuals and IS xx/xx FS 2: Tax residence – companies. 4. In applying the tax residence rules to a trustee, the:  natural person tax residence rules apply to any natural person acting in the capacity of trustee; and  company tax residence rules apply to any company acting in the capacity of trustee. 5. Multiple trustees are treated as a single notional person (“the trustee”) when considering tax residence. The single notional person is tax resident in New Zealand if any trustee is tax resident here. This means any income derived by a trustee, even if non-resident, is treated as derived by a New Zealand tax resident trustee. 1 If all the trustees are non-resident, the single notional person is non-resident. 6. Multiple trustees are also treated as a single notional person for the purposes of meeting tax obligations such as filing returns. The trustees are jointly and severally liable to satisfy the obligations of the single notional person. References to a “trustee” or “trustees” in this fact sheet are to the single notional person. 7. The usual rules about whether amounts are New Zealand–sourced or foreign-sourced are also relevant to how income derived by a trustee and amounts distributed to beneficiaries are taxed. However, the tax residence of the settlors (and therefore any change in their tax residence) can change the rules affecting foreign-sourced income. 1 The country where the non-resident trustee resides may also tax the same income. See \[28\]. IS XX/XX FS 2 | Issue date Page 4 of 9 8. In addition, the trust rules allow settlors, trustees and beneficiaries to make elections to change the way income a trustee derives would otherwise be taxed according to tax residence. Elections also affect the classification of trusts and the tax treatment of distributions to beneficiaries. 9. This fact sheet gives an overview of how the tax residence of the persons connected with the trust is relevant to the way in which trustee income, beneficiary income and taxable distributions are taxed. A fuller explanation in IS xx/xx. Persons connected with a trust may need to seek professional advice. Beneficiary income 10. Beneficiary income is an amount the trustee derives to the extent to which it vests absolutely in interest in a beneficiary in the income year or is paid to the beneficiary within defined times. 11. Beneficiary income minors and close companies derive is not taxed as beneficiary income. It is treated as trustee income. 12. Beneficiaries who are New Zealand tax residents are taxed on worldwide income. Transitional residents and non-residents are taxed on New Zealand–sourced amounts but not (generally) foreign-sourced amounts. When a beneficiary’s tax residence changes, their obligations on amounts derived change accordingly. Trustee income New Zealand–sourced income 13. A trustee is assessable on income derived from New Zealand whether it is tax resident or not. Foreign-sourced income 14. If the trustee is not tax resident, it is generally assessable on only foreign-sourced amounts if a settlor of the trust is resident in New Zealand at any point during the year. A transitional resident settlor is disregarded for the purposes of this rule. There are two exceptions to the general rule. Both exceptions can apply only if the trustee is non-resident for the entire income year. IS XX/XX FS 2 | Issue date Page 5 of 9 15. Conversely, if the trustee is tax resident, it is generally exempt on foreign-sourced amounts if no settlor is a New Zealand resident at any time in the income year. A transitional resident settlor is disregarded for the purposes of this rule. Other conditions need to be met for the general rule to apply, including registration and reporting requirements. 16. Elections can be made so the trustee is assessable on worldwide income. This is relevant for the treatment of distributions made to beneficiaries that are not beneficiary income. Withholding tax on passive income 17. If an amount of income a trustee derives is passive income (for example, interest), resident withholding tax will usually be deducted if the trustee is treated as tax resident and non-resident withholding tax will usually be deducted if the trustee is treated as non-resident. In the latter case, the rate may depend on the provisions of any applicable double tax agreement (DTA). 18. If the amount of non-resident withholding tax withheld is correct and the non-resident trustee has no other income sourced from New Zealand, no further tax is payable. Otherwise, an Income tax return: Non-resident individual taxpayers – IR3NR needs to be filed. 19. If an election is made under s HC 33 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to treat a non- resident trustee as a New Zealand tax resident, resident withholding tax rather than non-resident withholding tax should be deducted on any passive income derived by the trustee. Summary of how beneficiary and trustee income are taxed 20. Table | Tūtohi 1 summarises the tax treatment of beneficiary income and trustee income. IS XX/XX FS 2 | Issue date Page 6 of 9 Table | Tūtohi 1 – How beneficiary income and trustee income are taxed Beneficiary income Beneficiary tax resident in New Zealand • All beneficiary income is included as assessable income except minor and close company beneficiary income. • Transitional residents do not include most foreign-sourced amounts. Beneficiary not tax resident in New Zealand • Only New Zealand–sourced beneficiary income is included as assessable income. Notes: • Beneficiaries who ceased to be tax resident in New Zealand and become tax resident again within 5 years must include beneficiary income and taxable distributions received from foreign and non-complying trusts while non-resident. • Trustees are generally liable as agent for the income tax liability of a beneficiary for their beneficiary income and any taxable distributions they derive. Trustee income New Zealand–sourced income is included in assessable income whether or not the trustee is tax resident in New Zealand. If a non-resident trustee has only non-resident withholding income and it has been taxed correctly, the tax withheld is a final tax. Note: Trustee income also includes minor beneficiary income, close company beneficiary income and certain property settlements. Foreign-sourced income is included in assessable income if: • the trustee was not tax resident when the income was derived; and • a settlor of the trust was tax resident (and not a transitional resident) in New Zealand at any point during the income year. In general, this rule does not apply if: • no settlement has been made on the trust after 17 December 1987; or • a settlement has been made but the settlor was non-resident between 17 December 1987 and the date of the settlement. Foreign-sourced income is exempt if: • the trustee was tax resident when the income was derived; and • no settlor of the trust was tax resident (and not a transitional resident) in New Zealand at any point during the income year; provided that: • if no settlor exists in the income year, the last surviving settlor was not a tax resident at the time of ceasing to exist; • the trust was not at any time in the income year a superannuation fund or a testamentary or inter vivos trust of which any settlor was tax resident in New Zealand when they died; • no s HC 33 election has been made; and • the registration and reporting obligations for foreign exemption trusts have been met. IS XX/XX FS 2 | Issue date Page 7 of 9 Taxable distributions 21. Beneficiaries of foreign trusts and non-complying trusts may also be assessable on distributions by the trustee of amounts other than beneficiary income. These are called taxable distributions. Taxable distributions from non-complying trusts are taxed at 45% rather than at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate. 22. The tax treatment depends on the classification of trust, the nature of the distribution, the source of the amount distributed and the tax residence of the beneficiary. 23. Table | Tūtohi 2 summarises the tax treatment where the amount distributed is New Zealand–sourced, whether the beneficiary is a New Zealand tax resident or not. Table | Tūtohi 2 – Tax treatment of New Zealand–sourced distributions from a trust Type of distribution from the trust Complying trust Foreign trust Non-complying trust Accumulated trustee income Not taxable Taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate Taxed at 45% Non-associated capital gains and profits Not taxable Not taxable Taxed at 45% Associated capital gains and profits Not taxable Taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate Taxed at 45% Corpus Not taxable Not taxable Not taxable 24. Foreign-sourced amounts distributed to non-resident beneficiaries are not taxable. 25. A beneficiary who ceases to be tax resident in New Zealand and then becomes tax resident again within 5 years is taxable on amounts received from foreign and non- complying trusts during that period. IS XX/XX FS 2 | Issue date Page 8 of 9 Settlors may be agents for trustees 26. A New Zealand tax resident settlor may be liable as agent of the trustee for income tax payable by the trustee on trustee income derived in an income year. One exception is where the trust has at least one New Zealand tax resident trustee at all times during a year. Settlors may have disclosure obligations 27. If a trust is established by a New Zealand tax resident settlor with no New Zealand resident tax trustees, or it ceases to have any New Zealand tax resident trustees, a disclosure must be made to the Commissioner within 3 months. This is done by submitting the form Settlors of trusts disclosure – IR462. This disclosure must be made irrespective of whether an election under s HC 33 of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been made. Dual resident trustees require a determination 28. If a trustee as a single notional person is tax resident in New Zealand and one of the trustees becomes tax resident in a country that taxes trusts on the basis of the residence of trustees, the trust may be dual resident. If this occurs and there is a DTA in place between New Zealand and the other country, an application must be made to the competent authorities to determine tax residence for the purposes of the DTA. The benefits of DTAs are not available if this is not done. Trustees of foreign exemption trusts 29. If a trust is a foreign exemption trust, the trustee has registration and reporting obligations to fulfil to continue to receive an exemption on foreign-sourced amounts. Trustee as agent for a beneficiary 30. The trustee is generally agent for each beneficiary and must satisfy the income tax liability of the beneficiaries for their beneficiary income and any taxable distributions they derive.

1985.............................................................................................. 132 Introduction | Whakataki Overview 1. This interpretation statement explains the tax residence rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act). 2. The analysis in this statement is in three parts:  Part 1: Tax residence of natural persons (individuals), from page 7, which covers: IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 4 of 133 o how to determine whether a natural person (individual) is tax resident in New Zealand; o the relationship between the New Zealand domestic tax residence rules and the residence articles contained in New Zealand’s double taxation agreements (DTAs); and o the transitional resident rules – under which new migrants and returning New Zealanders may be entitled to temporary tax exemptions for certain foreign-sourced income.  Part 2: Tax residence of companies, from page 72, which covers: o how to determine whether a company is tax resident in New Zealand; and o the consequences of a company being a dual resident.  Part 3: Tax residence and trusts, from page 103, which covers residence and the taxation regime for trusts. How trust income is taxed depends on whether it is beneficiary income or trustee income, and on the residence of persons connected with the trust – the trustee, settlors and beneficiaries. Relevance of tax residence 3. The concept of tax residence is a central feature of the Act and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GSTA 1985). Tax residence may also be relevant for student loan borrowers who are away from New Zealand. The relevance of tax residence in New Zealand is explained below. Income Tax Act 2007 Scope of taxation in New Zealand – main relevance of tax residence 4. Under the Act, the main relevance of tax residence is that it determines whether a person is assessable for tax on worldwide income or only on New Zealand-sourced income (s BD 1(5)). 5. New Zealand residents are assessable on worldwide income (other than exempt income and excluded income). They may be entitled to a credit for foreign tax paid on foreign-sourced income or gains (see further from \[35\]). 6. Non-residents are assessable only on New Zealand-sourced income (other than exempt income and excluded income). IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 5 of 133 Working in New Zealand during a short-term visit 7. Income a non-tax resident derives from performing personal or professional services in New Zealand during a visit to New Zealand will be exempt income if certain criteria are met. 1 The visit generally cannot be for more than 92 days – though this may be extended to 183 days if there is a DTA between New Zealand and the other country. If the visit is for more than 92 days (or 183 days, as relevant), all income derived from the time of arrival is subject to tax in New Zealand. For further information, see Inland Revenue’s website: New Zealand-based employee of an overseas employer . Working for Families tax credits 8. Tax residence is also relevant to a person’s eligibility for Working for Families tax credits, including Best Start (which is a payment for families with a newborn baby). 9. However, there are further additional residence requirements that either the principal caregiver or the dependent child must meet for the purposes of Working for Families tax credits (ss MC 5 and MD 7) . These relate to:  being “New Zealand resident” as defined in s MA 8 – which means ordinarily and lawfully resident, other than only because of holding a temporary entry class visa;  presence in New Zealand; and  the transitional residence status of the principal caregiver and their spouse or partner (see from \[150\]). Foreign superannuation schemes 10. Tax residence is also relevant to the rules for the taxation of interests in foreign superannuation schemes. In particular, it is relevant in the following situations:  Since 1 April 2014, lump sum withdrawals or transfers from foreign superannuation schemes are generally taxed on an amount that approximates the gains made during the period the person is a New Zealand resident under either one of two new methods: the schedule method or the formula method. Both methods require the person to determine the length of their “assessable period” (s CF 3(8)). The duration of a person’s tax residence is relevant to determining the length of the assessable period.  However, there is an exemption period for lump sum foreign superannuation withdrawals or transfers for people who acquired the interest in the scheme 1 These rules do not apply to non-resident public entertainers. T here are specific rules that may be relevant to entertainers: see IS 19/03: Income tax – Exempt income of non-resident entertainers. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 6 of 133 when they were non-resident 2 (see ss CW 28B and CF 3). The exemption period runs until the end of the 48th month after the month in which the person satisfied the residence requirements in the Act (see s CF 3(6)). This is similar to the temporary exemption for transitional residents. 3 However, unlike the transitional resident rules, there is no minimum period of non-residence required to qualify for the exemption period.  Since 1 April 2014, the foreign investment fund rules (the FIF rules) generally no longer apply to interests in foreign superannuation schemes. However, one situation where the FIF rules continue to apply is where a person acquires an interest in the foreign superannuation scheme while they are a New Zealand resident (see the definition of “FIF superannuation interest” in s YA 1). Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 11. Under the GSTA 1985, residence is relevant for determining the place of supply of goods and services. In particular, under s 8(2) of the GSTA 1985 supplies by:  residents are deemed to be made in New Zealand; and  non-residents are generally deemed to be made outside New Zealand 12. The term “resident” in the GSTA 1985 means resident as determined in accordance with the tax residence rules in the Income Tax Act (ss YD 1 and YD 2), but excluding s YD 2(2), and ignoring the back-dating rules in s YD 1(4) and (6). However, the definition of resident in the GSTA 1985 also provides that a person is deemed to be resident in New Zealand:  to the extent they carry on a taxable activity or any other activity in New Zealand while having any fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to that activity; and  if the person is an unincorporated body (which includes a partnership, a joint venture, and the trustee of a trust) that has its centre of administrative management here. 13. Supplies by non-residents may be treated as being supplied in New Zealand under s 8(3), (4) and (4B) of the GSTA 1985. 2 Provided they have not had such an exemption period before acquiring the interest. 3 Discussed from \[150\]. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 7 of 133 Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 14. Tax residence under the Act may also be relevant for the purposes of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 (the Student Loan Scheme Act). 15. In some circumstances, student loan borrowers who are not physically in New Zealand may be treated as being physically in New Zealand. 16. Being physically in New Zealand, or treated as such, is relevant to whether a borrower is “New Zealand-based” 4 for the purposes of the Student Loan Scheme Act. Whether a borrower is New Zealand-based determines whether their loan is interest-free and determines the repayment obligations that will apply to them. 17. In some situations where borrowers who are not physically in New Zealand may be treated as being physically in New Zealand, there is a requirement that the borrower is tax resident in New Zealand. This is the case, for example, where there is an unplanned absence from New Zealand or an unexpected delay in returning to New Zealand. 18. In addition, tax residence may be relevant to a New Zealand-based borrower’s filing requirements under the Student Loan Scheme Act. Absentees 19. An “absentee” is defined in s YA 1 5 as someone who has not been tax resident in New Zealand during any part of the tax year. Absentees are, therefore, non-resident – though a non-resident may not be an absentee (for example, in the year they become non-resident they will not be an absentee). 20. There are a number of tax consequences arising from being an absentee – the main ones being that an absentee cannot receive tax credits for charitable or other public benefit gifts (s LD 2) and does not qualify for the child taxpayer exemption (s CW 55BB). Analysis | Tātari 21. As noted at \[2\], The analysis in this interpretation statement is in three parts:  Part 1: Tax residence of natural persons (individuals) – from page 7.  Part 2: Tax residence of companies – from page 72.  Part 3: Tax residence and trusts – from page 103. 4 Defined in s 4(1) of the Student Loan Scheme Act. 5 Other than for the purposes of subpart HD (Agents). IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 8 of 133 Part 1: Tax residence of natural persons (individuals) Overview When an individual is a New Zealand tax resident 22. An individual is a New Zealand tax resident if they:  have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, even if they also have a permanent place of abode elsewhere (s YD 1(2)) (the permanent place of abode rule); or  have been personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in total in any 12-month period (s YD 1(3)) (the 183-day rule); and: o have not ceased to be tax resident under the 325-day rule (see \[27\] and \[28\]); and o are not treated as being non-resident because they are employed under the recognised seasonal employment scheme (see from \[131\]); or  are personally absent from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand Government (see from \[147\]). 23. The permanent place of abode rule is the overriding tax residence test for individuals. This means that if a person has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, they are tax resident here regardless of any of the other rules. 24. The courts have described a permanent place of abode in New Zealand as being a place where a taxpayer habitually resides from time to time even if they spend periods of time overseas. A person must have a place of abode (that is, a dwelling) in New Zealand to potentially have a permanent place of abode here, but they do not need to own the place of abode and it does not need to be vacant or able to be occupied immediately. 25. If a person is tax resident under the 183-day rule, they are treated as resident from the first of those 183 days (s YD 1(4)), unless they acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand earlier than the first of those 183 days – in which case they are resident from the date they acquired a permanent place of abode. 26. The permanent place of abode test is most relevant to people leaving New Zealand. People moving to New Zealand typically become resident under the 183-day rule (because residence under that test back-dates to the first counted day of presence) and do not need to consider the permanent place of abode test. However, in some situations someone moving to New Zealand could establish a permanent place of abode in New Zealand before to the first day of presence counted for the 183-day rule (for example, because they are wrapping up their affairs in another country while IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 9 of 133 moving between the two countries and do not spend more than 183 days in New Zealand before they establish a permanent place of abode here). Also, there may be situations where someone does not move to New Zealand as such, but lives between New Zealand and another country or countries. In that situation, New Zealand residence could be triggered under either test. When an individual ceases to be a New Zealand tax resident 27. An individual who is tax resident in New Zealand only because of the 183-day rule (that is, they do not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand) will cease to be tax resident if  they are personally absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in total in a 12-month period (s YD 1(5)) (the 325-day rule); and  they are not absent from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand Government (see from \[147\]). 28. If a person ceases to be tax resident under the 325-day rule, they are treated as not resident from the first of those 325 days (s YD 1(6)), provided they did not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand at any time during the 325-day period. Because the permanent place of abode rule is the overriding tax residence test for individuals, someone cannot cease to be tax resident any earlier than the day after the day they cease having a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. Personal presence in or absence from New Zealand 29. The 183-day and 325-day rules refer to a person being personally present in or personally absent from New Zealand. 30. “New Zealand” is defined in s YA 1 as including the continental shelf. It also includes the water and airspace above any part of the continental shelf beyond New Zealand’s territorial sea 6 to the extent to which exploration or exploitation of that part of the continental shelf or its natural resources may be undertaken there. 31. However, s 13 of the Legislation Act 2019 provides that when “New Zealand” is used as a territorial description it means the islands and territories within the Realm of New Zealand, excluding the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau and the Ross Dependency. 32. This means physical presence in or absence from New Zealand is limited to the main islands and closer offshore islands of the Realm of New Zealand. 6 As defined in s 3 of the Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone, and Exclusive Economic Zone Act 1977. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 10 of 133 33. Presence in New Zealand embassies or New Zealand consulate offices overseas is not personal presence in New Zealand. How part days of presence or absence are treated 34. In applying the 183-day and 325-day rules, a person who is personally present in New Zealand for part of a day is treated as present in New Zealand for the whole day and not absent for any part of the day (s YD 1(8)). For example, if someone arrived in New Zealand at 3pm on 28 July, that day would be counted as a full day of presence. Similarly, if someone left New Zealand at 6am on 10 May, that day would be counted as a full day of presence. If someone is tax resident in more than one country If New Zealand has a DTA with the other country 35. If someone is tax resident both in New Zealand and another country under the domestic law of each country, and there is a DTA between the countries, a series of “tie-breaker” tests is applied to allocate tax residence to one of the countries for the purposes of the DTA. The DTA then determines, based on this allocated tax residence, what taxing rights each country has in relation to matters covered by the DTA. See further from \[184\]. 36. If both countries have some right to tax a particular item of income or gain that a person has, the person may be entitled to a credit for foreign tax paid on foreign- sourced income or gains. For further information, see IS 16/05 : In come tax – Foreign tax credits – How to claim a foreign tax credit where the foreign tax paid is covered by a Double Tax Agreement. If New Zealand does not have a DTA with the other country 37. If someone is tax resident both in New Zealand and another country under the domestic law of each country, and there is not a DTA between the countries, they are assessable in New Zealand on their worldwide income (other than exempt income and excluded income) but may be entitled to a credit for foreign tax paid on foreign- sourced income or gains. For further information, see IS 14/02 : In come tax – Foreign tax credits – What is a tax of substantially the same nature as income tax imposed under s BB 1? IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 11 of 133 Transitional residence – temporary tax exemptions for new migrants and returning New Zealanders 38. New migrants and returning New Zealanders who have been non-resident for at least 10 years may be eligible to be transitional residents. Transitional residents are entitled to temporary tax exemptions for certain foreign-sourced income. However, neither they nor their spouse or partner can receive Working for Families tax credits (including Best Start). 39. It is important to note that if a person who is a transitional resident applies for Working for Families tax credits (including Best Start), or if their spouse or partner does, this application is treated as an election for both parties to no longer be transitional residents. This deemed election cannot be reversed. Therefore, careful consideration should be given (and professional advice sought if necessary) to a decision to apply for Working for Families tax credits during the transitional residence period. 40. Transitional residents may receive FamilyBoost tax credits (which provide caregivers with financial assistance for early childhood education costs). A pplying for FamilyBoost is not treated as an election to no longer be a transitional resident. 41. The rules for transitional residence are discussed from \[150\].

The permanent place of abode test is set out in s YD 1(2), which says: YD 1 Residence of natural persons ... Permanent place of abode in New Zealand (2) Despite anything else in this section, a person is a New Zealand resident if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, even if they also have a permanent place of abode elsewhere. 44. The permanent place of abode test applies “despite anything else” in s YD 1. This makes the permanent place of abode test the overriding residence rule for individuals. This means a person is a New Zealand resident if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, irrespective of any of the other rules. 45. The term “permanent place of abode” is not defined in the Act. 46. CIR v Diamond \[2015\] NZCA 613 is the leading New Zealand case discussing the meaning of permanent place of abode. The permanent place of abode test has been considered in New Zealand in different factual contexts in Van Uden v CIR \[2018\] NZCA 487, and in several Taxation Review Authority cases. There is also Australian case law on the meaning of permanent place of abode – most notably FCT v Applegate 79 ATC 4307 (FCAFC), as the New Zealand legislative history shows that Parliament intended to adopt the test as articulated in Applegate. 7 47. The following discussion of what it means to have a permanent place of abode, and the relevant factors to weigh up in determining whether someone has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand draws on the principles from the case law. Meaning of permanent place of abode 48. The Court of Appeal has described “permanent place of abode” as meaning a place where a taxpayer habitually resides from time to time even if they spend periods of time overseas (Diamond and Van Uden). 49. Permanent means the opposite of temporary, and the Court of Appeal observed in Diamond that something is permanent when it is “continuing or designed to continue indefinitely without change” (at \[para 48\]). However, it is clear from the New Zealand case law that the person does not need to intend to live somewhere for the rest of 7 As noted in Diamond. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 14 of 133 their life for it to be their permanent place of abode (Case H97 (1986) 8 NZTC 664 (TRA) , Case J98 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,555 (TRA) , Case Q55 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,313 (TRA) ). 50. A person can be resident in New Zealand under the permanent place of abode test even if they also have a permanent place of abode outside New Zealand. The focus is not on determining which place the person has the strongest connections to, but on whether their place of abode here is a permanent place of abode. See further from \[103\]. A dwelling is required 51. A person must have a place of abode (that is, a dwelling) in New Zealand to potentially have a permanent place of abode here. This is because, as pointed out by the Court of Appeal in Diamond (at \[xx\]), “abode” means a “habitual residence, house or home or place in which the person stays, remains or dwells”. 52. A person needing to have a dwelling in New Zealand to potentially have a permanent place of abode here does not mean the person needs to own the dwelling. For example, the property might be rented, held in a family trust, or owned by a family company or other family member. 53. A place of abode does not need to be vacant or able to be occupied immediately by a person to be a permanent place of abode for them. Someone who is temporarily overseas may lease their property to a third party or enable someone else to use it during their absence. A place of abode can be a person’s permanent place of abode even if it is rented to or used by someone else while the person is overseas. If the person habitually resides in the property, despite being absent from New Zealand for a time, the property can still be their permanent place of abode, irrespective of whether the property is occupied by someone else for limited periods. See, for example, Case Q55, Case F138 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,237 (TRA) , Case J98 and Case J41 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,240 (TRA). 54. However, simply having a dwelling in New Zealand is not sufficient. The dwelling must be the person’s permanent place of abode. The discussion from \[58\] explains how to determine whether this is the case. When the test needs to be considered 55. The permanent place of abode test is usually considered when someone who has habitually resided at a dwelling in New Zealand has left New Zealand for a time. In that situation, the question is whether they can be regarded as continuing to habitually reside at their place of abode in New Zealand, despite a period or periods of absence, such that it can still be considered to be a permanent place of abode for them. The factors discussed from \[68\] help determine that question. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 15 of 133 56. The permanent place of abode test can also be relevant when someone who was not a New Zealand tax resident, and who has not become resident under the 183-day rule, establishes a place of abode here. The question in that scenario is whether, and at what point, the person can be considered to have begun habitually residing at their abode here, such that it can be considered to be their permanent place of abode (irrespective of whether they also have a permanent place of abode outside New Zealand). 57. The permanent place of abode test may also be relevant in other contexts, such as if someone moves between New Zealand and another country or countries. How to determine whether someone has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand An overall assessment of the circumstances is required 58. Deciding whether someone habitually resides at a dwelling here such that it is a permanent place of abode for them requires an overall assessment of the person’s circumstances and the nature and quality of the use the person habitually makes of the place of abode. It is not just the situation during the person’s absence from New Zealand that is relevant. The situation before and after periods of absence from New Zealand should be considered in assessing how close the person’s connection with their place of abode is (Diamond, Van Uden and Case Q55). Factors to consider 59. In determining whether a person habitually resides at a place of abode in New Zealand such that it is a permanent place of abode for them, it is necessary to consider the:  continuity and duration of the person’s presence in New Zealand (discussed from \[68\]); and  durability of the person’s association with the place of abode and how close their connection with it is (discussed from \[76\]). (See Diamond, Applegate, Van Uden, Case H97, Case J98 and Case Q55). Connections are relevant only if they indicate a particular dwelling is a person’s permanent place of abode 60. It does not matter how strong a person’s ties to New Zealand are if those ties do not indicate that the particular dwelling in question is the person’s permanent place of abode. For example, if a person has strong connections to New Zealand, but the only dwelling they have here is a property they have never lived in and never intend to live IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 16 of 133 in, that property could not be their permanent place of abode. They clearly could not be regarded as habitually residing there. 61. In Diamond, the taxpayer had never resided, or intended to reside, in his dwelling in New Zealand. The dwelling had only ever been used as an investment property. In those circumstances, the court considered the dwelling could not be the taxpayer’s permanent place of abode, irrespective of any of the ties he had to New Zealand. Because there was simply no question about whether the taxpayer habitually resided in the dwelling before he left New Zealand (he did not), there could be no question about whether he continued to habitually reside there during the tax years in question (the first 4 years of his absence from New Zealand). Therefore, the court did not need to analyse and weigh up the nature and extent of each of the connections the taxpayer had to New Zealand. No matter how strong the taxpayer’s connections to New Zealand were, because he did not have any residential connections to the dwelling at all, none of his connections to New Zealand could indicate that the dwelling was a permanent place of abode for him. On any overall assessment of the taxpayer’s circumstances, the property was not a permanent place of abode for him before or after his departure. When a place of abode is a person’s permanent place of abode 62. In most cases it is a simple matter to establish whether a person’s place of abode in New Zealand is a permanent place of abode. Assume, for example, that a person who normally lives in New Zealand, who owns and occupies a house here and who has employment ties here, is absent for a fixed period of, say, 12 months. This person has an enduring relationship with their New Zealand place of abode, and it is the place where they usually live. That place of abode is their permanent place of abode – they habitually reside there even though they are away from New Zealand for a time. 63. More difficult cases arise where the person has been absent from New Zealand for a substantial period or where the person is here intermittently. Where the answer is not clear, all relevant factors must be weighed carefully. As noted above, this involves considering the continuity and duration of the person’s presence in New Zealand, and the durability of the person’s association with the place of abode and how close their connection with it is. 64. Paragraphs \[76\] – \[ 102\] discuss the relevant factors to consider in assessing the continuity and duration of the person’s presence in New Zealand and the durability of the person’s association with the place of abode and how close their connection with it is. It is important to understand that those factors are not of equal weight, and the significance of each of them depends on the person’s particular circumstances. The question is whether, having regard to the overall picture, there is a place of abode in New Zealand in which the person habitually resides, such that it can be regarded as a permanent place of abode for them. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 17 of 133 65. A person’s connections to the location in New Zealand where their place of abode is situated are relevant in objectively assessing whether a particular place of abode is a permanent place of abode for them. The strength of such connections may indicate that the abode is a place where the person habitually resides, even though they are away for a time, and a place to which the person will likely return to live on an enduring basis. 66. A person may also have connections to New Zealand generally, such as keeping a New Zealand bank account, having membership in professional or trade associations, or maintaining medical insurance with a New Zealand company (see further from \[94\]). Such connections could be relevant to any location in New Zealand and are not by their nature tied to any specific dwelling or location. General connections to New Zealand are relevant only to the extent that they provide some indication about whether the person is likely to return to New Zealand to live in their abode here, such that it can be regarded as a permanent place of abode for them. 67. The factors that need to be considered are discussed next. Continuity and duration of presence in New Zealand 68. As a general rule, the longer a person is present in New Zealand, the more likely it is that their place of abode here is a permanent place of abode for them. Conversely, the longer a person is absent from New Zealand, the less likely it is that their place of abode here will continue to be a permanent place of abode for them. 69. This is not to say that periods of presence in or absence from New Zealand are the overriding consideration. However, when a person is absent from New Zealand for an extended period, it is less likely that their place of abode here continues to be a permanent place of abode for them, even though they may still have connections with New Zealand. The longer the period of absence, the less likely that the abode can be considered a place in which they habitually reside. 70. Where a person is absent from New Zealand, a point would eventually be reached where it would no longer be reasonable to consider that a place of abode they have in New Zealand is still a permanent place of abode for them. Such an assessment would be made taking all material facts into account. This would include whether the person has maintained connections in New Zealand that indicate they will be returning to live at the place of abode on a durable basis. 71. The longer a person is away from New Zealand, the fewer ties to New Zealand they are likely to retain. This would typically support a conclusion that their dwelling here is no longer a permanent place of abode for them. That said, there may be situations in which a person lives in another country for an extended time but still maintains strong ties to New Zealand. Depending on the circumstances, the person may continue to IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 18 of 133 have a permanent place of abode here. As discussed from \[103\], a person may have more than one permanent place of abode. 72. There is no specific length of presence in, or absence from, New Zealand that results in a person acquiring or losing a permanent place of abode here. If a person has strong connections with New Zealand and their place of abode here, it could be expected that a longer period of absence would be required for their place of abode to no longer be considered their permanent place of abode than if the person’s connections to New Zealand and the place of abode were weaker. The totality of the particular circumstances must be considered in each case. 73. The duration of presence factor focuses on the length of the person’s presence or presences in New Zealand. The continuity of presence factor refers to whether the person is present in New Zealand for continuous or interrupted periods. 74. The more continuous the periods a person is at their place of abode in New Zealand, the stronger the indication that their place of abode here is their permanent place of abode. This is because they are actually living here, rather than merely visiting for brief periods. Likewise, the more continuous the periods of absence from New Zealand are, the more that might indicate the person’s place of abode here is no longer a permanent place of abode for them. This can be compared with a situation where someone frequently returns to New Zealand. 75. However, while frequent trips back to New Zealand are a factor that might help determine whether a person’s place of abode here is a permanent place of abode for them, this is not necessarily the case, and such trips must be viewed in context. For example, regular visits may be explicable because the person is returning to see children who live here with an ex-spouse, or to visit extended family. The weight to be given to frequent visits should be considered in light of all the circumstances (including wh ether they stay at their abode on those visits) and the reasons for their trips to New Zealand. Durability of association with a place of abode 76. Consideration of the durability of a person’s association with a place of abode involves an examination of the extent and strength of the attachments the person has established and maintained in New Zealand. The strength of such connections may indicate whether the place of abode is a place the person habitually resides, even though they are away for a time. 77. The case law establishes that factors to be considered when assessing whether a person has a durable association with a place of abode, such that it can be regarded as a permanent place of abode for them, include: IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 19 of 133  the nature and quality of the use of the dwelling and the person’s connection with the dwelling (discussed from \[78\]);  the person’s intentions (discussed from \[84\]);  the person’s family and social ties (discussed from \[89\]);  the person’s employment, business interests and economic ties (discussed from \[94\]);  the person’s personal property (discussed from \[99\]); and  any other factors that shed light on whether the place of abode is a permanent place of abode for the person (discussed from \[101\]). (See, for example, Applegate, Van Uden, Case Q55, Case F138, Case J98, and Case U17 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,174 (TRA) ). The nature and quality of the use of the dwelling and the person’s connection with the dwelling 78. The nature and quality of the use of a dwelling a person has in New Zealand, and the connection the person has with the dwelling, are fundamental to determining whether the dwelling is a permanent place of abode for them. If the person owns a house or apartment in New Zealand they have previously lived in, for example, this would likely be a stronger indication of an enduring connection with the place of abode than, say, the ability to reside at a parent’s house that had previously been lived in. 79. A situation that often arises is where a young person lives away from the family home some of the time, for example during university terms, but returns to the family home during holidays. If the young person goes overseas after their studies, there is often a question about whether the family home is a permanent place of abode for them. In such circumstances, it may well be that the person had two permanent places of abode before they left New Zealand – the family home and the student accommodation – because they habitually resided in both places. It could therefore be that although they no longer have the abode that was their student accommodation once they leave New Zealand (for example, because they gave up the lease) the family home continues to be a permanent place of abode for them. As in any other circumstances, this depends on the nature and quality of the use the person habitually makes of that abode. In this context, it would be relevant to consider how often and for how long the person returned to the family home (both before they left New Zealand and after their departure), the extent to which they are financially independent, and their intended future use of the abode (which may change over time). Whether the family home is the person’s permanent place of abode is a question of fact and requires an overall assessment of the circumstances and the nature and quality of the use the person habitually makes of the abode. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 20 of 133 80. As noted at \[55\], the permanent place of abode test is usually considered in a situation where someone who has habitually resided at a dwelling in New Zealand has left New Zealand for a time. In that situation, the question is whether they can be regarded as continuing to habitually reside at their place of abode in New Zealand, despite a period or periods of absence, such that it can be considered to be a permanent place of abode for them. It is clear from Diamond that a property that a person has never lived in, never intended to live in, and that has only ever been used as an investment could not be a permanent place of abode for the person. 81. However, there may potentially be circumstances where a place of abode that a person has not yet lived in, but intends to live in in the future, is their permanent place of abode. While this would only be in limited situations, the Commissioner considers that it could occur. For example, if the person’s permanent place of abode had been the family home, and the family shifted during the person’s absence from New Zealand, the new family home could be their permanent place of abode even though they had not yet lived in it. The Court of Appeal in Diamond did not consider this type of scenario, but the Commissioner considers that such an approach would be consistent with the court’s approach and reasoning. The totality of the circumstances must be considered. In the absence of changed circumstances, in such a scenario the new family home could be viewed as essentially being a substitute for the previous family home, which was clearly the person’s permanent place of abode. If a person habitually resides in the family home, despite a period of absence from New Zealand, the Commissioner considers that a shift in the location of the family home would not alter the conclusion that the person continues to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 82. On the other hand, someone who lived overseas and bought a house in New Zealand would not have a permanent place of abode here merely by virtue of that, even if they intended to live there in the future. However, the house might become a permanent place of abode for the person at some stage before they move here permanently or even if they do not ever move here to live all the time. For example, if they started coming to New Zealand and living in the house at regular intervals or for significant periods, it may become their permanent place of abode at some stage, even if they also have a permanent place of abode elsewhere. It is always necessary to consider the circumstances as a whole, including the continuity and duration of presences in New Zealand, the nature of the person’s visits to New Zealand and the reasons for them, and what occurs over time (that is, the pattern over several years). 83. The extent to which a person has lived in a dwelling is a relevant consideration in assessing whether the dwelling is a permanent place of abode for them. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 21 of 133 Intention 84. Determining whether a person’s place of abode in New Zealand is a permanent place of abode for them is an objective enquiry (Case H97, Case J98 and Case Q55). However, a person’s intention can also be considered in such an enquiry (Case F138, Case F139 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,245 (TRA) , Case H97 and Case Q55). 85. A person’s intentions about their presence in or absence from New Zealand and about a place of abode they have here are important factors, though a person’s intentions are not the central consideration. It is necessary to consider not only what was intended, but what in fact occurred (Case F139 and Case H97). 86. In cases where a person is overseas, the intention to return to New Zealand to live may be indicative of their place of abode here continuing to be a permanent place of abode for them – a place in which they habitually reside, despite a period overseas. 87. However, it is important to balance consideration of a person’s intentions with all other relevant factors. For example, if a person has departed from New Zealand for an extended period, but intends to ultimately return, that intention alone will not establish that the person’s place of abode here remains a permanent place of abode for them. On the other hand, if a person has departed for a relatively short period of fixed duration, the intention to return will be a strong indicator that the person’s place of abode here continues to be a permanent place of abode for them. 88. A person’s intention is subjective. However, the weight a person’s stated intention is given depends on the extent to which the circumstances support that stated intention. Family and social ties 89. The location of a person’s family may be a factor of some importance. For example, if a person is absent from New Zealand, but their immediate family (for example, spouse or partner and dependent children) remain here, that will tend to support a conclusion that the person’s place of abode here continues to be a permanent place of abode for them. 90. Once again, however, family ties must be considered in relation to all the other relevant factors. If a person is absent from New Zealand for a relatively short period, the fact their family accompanies them overseas will not mean the person does not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 91. The weight to be attached to family ties may vary from individual to individual, and in light of the nature and quality of the relationships. In determining the weight to be given to any family ties, it is important to bear in mind the person’s particular circumstances. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 22 of 133 92. For example, in some circumstances it might be relevant that a person has dependent children in New Zealand, and in other circumstances this would not be a relevant consideration. For instance, if someone’s spouse or partner and children remain in the family home in New Zealand while the person is overseas for a time, those family connections are relevant, and indicate that the abode continues to be a permanent place of abode for the person. On the other hand, if someone has dependent children in New Zealand but they are estranged from them (as in Case U17) or they have agreed for their children to remain in New Zealand with an ex-spouse (as in Diamond), the fact the children are here does not provide any indication about whether the person’s place of abode here continues to be a permanent place of abode for them. While in the latter situation the person has important, close family ties to New Zealand, and may well make regular trips back to New Zealand to see their children, those connections need to be viewed in light of all the other circumstances and do not necessarily suggest that any place of abode the person has in New Zealand continues to be a permanent place of abode for them. Of course, if the person returns to New Zealand from time to time to visit family and they stay at their place of abode here, the fact they habitually stay at their abode is a relevant consideration. 93. Other social ties, such as membership of sporting and cultural associations, may also be relevant in establishing whether a person’s place of abode here continues to be a permanent place of abode for them – a place they habitually reside. Such ties are not necessarily of much weight by themselves, but may suggest the person will be returning to New Zealand to live (and in particular to the location in which their place of abode is), and, together with other ties to that location or place of abode, may be indicative of the person’s place of abode here continuing to be a permanent place of abode for them. Employment, business interests and economic ties 94. If a person is absent from New Zealand but retains employment, business, trade or professional ties with New Zealand, that may be relevant to the extent it indicates the person is likely to or intends to return to live in their place of abode here. 95. For example, university lecturers who take sabbatical leave overseas generally continue to be employed and paid by the university during their absence. The continued employment ties in such a situation are important in determining whether the person’s place of abode in New Zealand remains a permanent place of abode for them. The weight to be given to employment ties depends on their strength – for example, whether employment is guaranteed after the absence or is likely still to be open to the person, and the reasons for the employment arrangements being as they are. 96. Memberships of trade and professional associations may provide some indication as to whether a person is likely to or intends to return to live in their place of abode in New Zealand so should be taken into account, but by themselves do not carry much weight. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 23 of 133 97. The person’s overall economic connections with New Zealand will be relevant only to the extent they indicate the person is likely to or intends to return to New Zealand and live in their place of abode here. Such connections are often of no assistance in determining this. There are numerous reasons a person might retain a bank account or credit card facility in New Zealand or have insurance coverage from New Zealand, superannuation in New Zealand, or investments here or managed from here. Unless, in the particular circumstances, these factors indicate the person habitually resides in their place of abode here, they will not be relevant. 98. The Commissioner considers that paying child support for children in New Zealand is not relevant, as it does not provide any indication about whether the person is likely to return to New Zealand to live in their abode here, such that it can be regarded as a permanent place of abode for them. Personal property 99. If the person has personal property (for example, furniture or a vehicle) in New Zealand, this could be taken into account to the extent it indicates they are likely to or intend to return to live in their abode here. 100. The weight to be given to the fact a person has personal property in New Zealand depends on the nature of the property and the person’s circumstances. For example, if someone leaves the bulk of their furniture and other personal effects in New Zealand, this would be of far more weight than someone leaving, say, a few personal effects with a relative or friend. Other factors 101. Other factors, such as whether the person receives New Zealand social welfare assistance, or whether they regularly spend their holidays in New Zealand, may also be relevant, but again, only to the extent that they indicate the person is likely to or intends to return to live in their place of abode here. 102. There is no exhaustive list of factors to be taken into account. Any factor showing a person has a durable connection to their place of abode in New Zealand may be relevant, as it may assist in drawing the inference that the person intends to continue to habitually reside in their place of abode in New Zealand, such that it can be regarded as a permanent place of abode for them. A person may have a permanent place of abode elsewhere 103. Section YD 1(2) provides that a natural person is a New Zealand resident if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, “even if they also have a permanent place IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 24 of 133 of abode elsewhere”. Therefore, it is clear from s YD 1(2) that a person may have more than one permanent place of abode. 104. The focus of the permanent place of abode test is on the person’s connections with their place of abode in New Zealand, rather than on whether the person’s connections are closer with the place of abode in New Zealand or with a place of abode in another country. A person may be resident in New Zealand under the permanent place of abode test even if they have closer connections with a place of abode in another country. 105. That said, factors that suggest a person has a durable connection to their place of abode in New Zealand must be weighed against contrary factors that indicate the person no longer habitually resides at their place of abode here. Such contrary factors could include evidence of the person’s connections to a foreign country or to a place of abode in that country – for example, the purchase of a home in another country, or family, social or other ties to another country. 106. If a person has established strong connections to another country, it is less likely they will return to their place of abode in New Zealand, so it is less likely they can be regarded as continuing to habitually reside there. Conversely, the lack of strong connections to another country makes it more likely the person will return to their place of abode in New Zealand, so more likely they can be regarded as still habitually residing there (see, for example, Case H97). 107. However, there may be situations where a person has permanent places of abode in more than one country and moves between those countries. The fact a person has established strong connections in another country does not preclude them having a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 108. There may also be situations where a person has no permanent place of abode anywhere. Lack of strong connections in another country will therefore not necessarily mean a person’s place of abode in New Zealand is their permanent place of abode. For example, in Case 10/2013 (2013) 26 NZTC 2-009 (TRA) 8 Judge Sinclair did not place any particular weight on the taxpayer not having established roots in Iraq, noting that this was not surprising given the security issues in that country and the nature of the taxpayer’s employment. 109. The extent of a person’s connections to a foreign country will be relevant in assessing the person’s connections to New Zealand and their place of abode here. However, the permanent place of abode test does not involve a comparison of the relative “permanence” of different permanent places of abode. So long as a person has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, they are resident here under s YD 1(2). 8 The Taxation Review Authority decision in the Diamond case, which was ultimately decided by the Court of Appeal. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 25 of 133 Summary – permanent place of abode 110. The above discussion about determining whether a person has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand can be summarised as follows:  A place of abode is a person’s permanent place of abode if it is a place where they habitually reside from time to time even if they spend periods overseas. To be a permanent place of abode, the abode must be a place where the person habitually resides on an enduring, rather than temporary, basis.  A person must have a place of abode (that is, a dwelling) in New Zealand to potentially have a permanent place of abode here. This does not mean the person needs to own the dwelling. However, simply having a dwelling is not sufficient – the dwelling must be the person’s permanent place of abode.  Deciding whether a dwelling is someone’s permanent place of abode requires an overall assessment of the person’s circumstances and the nature and quality of the use the person habitually makes of the place of abode.  In determining whether a place of abode is a person’s permanent place of abode, it is necessary to consider the continuity and duration of the person’s presence in New Zealand and the durability of the person’s association with their place of abode here and how close their connection with it is.  To determine whether a person has a durable association with their place of abode, the person’s overall connections with their place of abode and with New Zealand must be weighed up. It is then necessary to evaluate the extent to which those connections indicate the person has an enduring relationship with their place of abode here, such that it can be considered to be their permanent place of abode.  It does not matter how strong a person’s ties to New Zealand are if those ties do not indicate the dwelling in question is a permanent place of abode for the person. For example, if a person has strong connections to New Zealand, but the only dwelling they have here is a property that they have never lived in and never intend to live in, that property could not be a permanent place of abode for them. Acquiring and losing a permanent place of abode 111. When a person becomes a New Zealand resident for tax purposes, the time that their tax residence starts must be identified. Individuals can become resident as a result of the operation of the permanent place of abode test or the 183-day rule (discussed from \[123\]). 112. When a person satisfies the 183-day rule, their tax residence is back-dated (under s YD 1(4)) to the first day of the 183 days that they were present in New Zealand in the IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 26 of 133 12-month period. In most situations where a person becomes tax resident in New Zealand, it is the 183-day rule and s YD 1(4) that establish when their residence starts. 113. However, a person could become resident under the permanent place of abode test from a time before the first day of their presence in New Zealand under the 183-day rule. This could occur, for example, if someone moved to New Zealand but regularly travelled in and out of the country on business and did not trigger the 183-day rule for some time. In those circumstances, the date at which the person acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand would need to be determined, as their New Zealand tax residence could start from that point. 114. When a person leaves New Zealand, the time when their New Zealand tax residence ends must also be identified. A person does not cease to be tax resident until they have been absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in a 12-month period and no longer have a permanent place of abode here. 115. The date that a person ceases to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand is therefore relevant if it occurs sometime after the 325 days of absence. The date a person ceases to have a permanent place of abode here is also relevant if it occurs during the 12-month period in which they satisfy the 325-day rule. In this situation, the interaction between the permanent place of abode test in s YD 1(2) and the back- dating rule in s YD 1(6) (see \[133\]) results in the person ceasing to be tax resident in New Zealand from the day after the day they cease having a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 116. The time at which a person acquires or ceases to have a permanent place of abode is determined by an evaluation of the circumstances of each case. The objective is to determine the point in time at which the person:  acquires a permanent place of abode in New Zealand by being present here and establishing an enduring connection with a place of abode here; or  ceases to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand by ceasing to habitually reside at a place of abode here. 117. If a person’s circumstances change at any point, it is necessary to reconsider whether they have a permanent place of abode here. It may be that the change in circumstances results in the acquisition or loss of a permanent place of abode here. It is relevant to consider the time of occurrence of such events as:  commencement or termination of employment;  changes in the location of the person’s family;  changes in personal circumstances such as relationship status;  purchase or sale of real or personal property;  commencement or termination of a lease; IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 27 of 133  transfer of financial affairs;  appointment to or resignation from trade, professional, sporting or cultural associations; and  departure from or arrival in New Zealand for an extended period. 118. In some situations, the combination of such factors may indicate a person acquires or ceases to have a permanent place of abode at a time other than on their arrival in or departure from New Zealand. Examples illustrating the concept of “permanent place of abode” Note: The following examples deal only with the permanent place of abode test. They do not consider the 183-day rule, the 325-day rule, any DTA implications, or any potential application of the transitional resident rules. The examples illustrate the way in which a person’s overall circumstances need to be considered to determine whether they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. The conclusions in the examples are based on the facts known at a particular time. If what eventuates differs from this, the results could be different for some or all of the years in question. If a person’s circumstances change during their absence from New Zealand, it is necessary to reconsider whether they have a permanent place of abode here. Example | Tauira 1 – Three-year secondment overseas Facts: Cate, who is normally resident in New Zealand, is seconded to Canada in connection with her employment for a fixed period of 3 years. Cate intends to return to New Zealand after the period of secondment, and the terms of her secondment are such that her job is available for her to return to. Cate’s partner and children accompany her to Canada. The family home in New Zealand is owned by a family trust, of which Cate’s parents and their solicitor’s trustee company are trustees. Cate, her partner and their children, together with Cate’s siblings and their families, are the trust’s beneficiaries. The house is rented out while the family is in Canada. Cate and her family leave their furniture and most of their other personal belongings in storage in New Zealand during their absence. Cate retains her New Zealand investments and her connections with several professional and sporting associations here. Cate and her family return to New Zealand each year to spend Christmas with family and have a summer holiday here. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 28 of 133 Result: Cate would have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand when she leaves for Canada. During the period of her absence, her place of abode here may cease to be her permanent place of abode. This depends on what eventuates. Cate should assess her overall circumstances throughout the period of her absence from New Zealand to ascertain whether she continues to have a permanent place of abode here. Explanation: Cate has a place of abode in New Zealand that she habitually resided in before leaving for Canada. The question is whether, during her absence from New Zealand, that house continues to be a place Cate habitually resides. Although Cate will be absent from New Zealand for 3 years, this is not of itself inconsistent with her place of abode here remaining a permanent place of abode – a place she habitually resides. All the relevant factors must be weighed up. In this case, Cate has retained ties with New Zealand: she still has most of her personal property here, maintains membership of several professional and sporting associations, and has investments here. Cate also retains employment ties with New Zealand, as her secondment is in connection with her New Zealand employment. Cate has a definite intention to return to New Zealand at the end of the 3-year secondment and to resume living in the family home here. Although the house is owned in trust, Cate’s parents are trustees and the family members are all beneficiaries. It is reasonable to infer that the trustees will enable the family to resume living in the family home on their return. At the time she leaves New Zealand, the strength of Cate’s enduring connections with New Zealand and with her place of abode here are sufficient to establish that her home here continues to be a permanent place of abode. If, at the time she left New Zealand, Cate’s circumstances had been different, she may not have had a permanent place of abode in New Zealand from the time of her departure. For example, Cate would not have had a permanent place of abode in New Zealand from the time she left if she had not intended to return to New Zealand after the secondment, she did not have a guaranteed position available for her to return to, and she and her family had taken most of their furniture and other belongings with them. However, whatever Cate’s circumstances at the time of her departure, realistically those circumstances are unlikely to remain exactly as they were. Over the period of her secondment in Canada, decisions Cate makes and events that occur might lead to a conclusion that her place of abode here ceases to be her permanent place of abode from a particular time or might support a conclusion that it remains her permanent place of abode. For example, Cate and her family might decide they love Canada and want to stay, and Cate or her partner might secure work and visas to enable them to do that, and they may take their belongings out of storage and move them to Canada. In those circumstances, Cate would cease having a permanent place of abode in New IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 29 of 133 Zealand from that point. On the other hand, Cate might not enjoy living in Canada, and might try to renegotiate her secondment arrangements to return to New Zealand earlier, or at least form the definite intention to return as soon as possible. Further to the need to consider the circumstances as they evolve, another relevant factor is whether Cate and her family stay in their place of abode here on their trips back each summer (for example, because the property is rented to students during the university year, but able to be used by them between December and February). In those circumstances, Cate’s place of abode here may well continue to be her permanent place of abode throughout the 3-year period. It is always necessary to make an overall assessment of a person’s circumstances and the nature and quality of the use they make of their place of abode in New Zealand in deciding whether it continues to be a permanent place of abode for them. Life events and changes in circumstances may mean someone ceases to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, so it is necessary to periodically consider the situation throughout the period of someone’s absence. Example | Tauira 2 – Potential to live with parents on return does not mean a person will have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand Facts: Mike departs from New Zealand on a working holiday (his “OE” – overseas experience). He intends to return to New Zealand after his OE, though he is not sure when that will be. Before he left New Zealand, Mike had been living in a rented flat in Wellington for a couple of years, prior to which he had lived with his parents (also in Wellington). Mike terminates his lease when he leaves New Zealand. Mike resigns from his job and stores his personal effects with his parents, who are happy for Mike to return to live with them if he wishes on his return. Mike leaves his KiwiSaver account in New Zealand and takes a contributions holiday. Mike ends up returning to New Zealand to live after 18 months away . Result: Mike does not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand while he is overseas. Explanation: Mike terminated the lease on the flat he lived in before he left New Zealand. Therefore, it does not continue to be a place he habitually resides from that point. Although Mike could return to live with his parents when he comes back to New Zealand, the fact he lived independently from his parents for a couple of years before leaving New Zealand means he no longer habitually resided at their house before his departure from New Zealand. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 30 of 133 Therefore, it is irrelevant that Mike intends to return to New Zealand after his OE or that he has stored his personal effects here and has family ties here. If Mike had never lived independently from his parents before going overseas, his parents’ house might continue to be his permanent place of abode when he left New Zealand. While, when he leaves New Zealand, Mike does not know when he will return, he is going on an OE and does not have the intention of leaving New Zealand permanently. Mike has left his personal effects at his parents’ house, has family ties here, and intends to return to New Zealand after his OE. In this scenario, because Mike had lived with his parents before going overseas, their house might continue to be his permanent place of abode because it is the place he habitually resides, despite a period of absence from New Zealand. However, this is a question of fact and requires an overall assessment of the circumstances, including the extent to which Mike is financially independent, and whether he intends to return to his parent’s house to live more than temporarily. Even if Mike’s parent’s house is still his permanent place of abode at the time he leaves New Zealand, there could come a point at which it ceases to be, because he no longer habitually resides there – this depends on what ultimately occurs. It is always necessary to make an overall assessment of a person’s circumstances and the nature and quality of the use they make of their place of abode in New Zealand when deciding whether it continues to be a permanent place of abode for them. Example | Tauira 3 – Permanent places of abode in New Zealand and elsewhere Facts: Li is a New Zealand citizen who has extensive business interests in New Zealand and Australia. Li owns a house in each country, neither of which is rented out, and both of which are available for his use. Li spends most of his time in Australia, but he regularly travels to New Zealand in connection with his business here. In total, Li spends up to 5 months of the year in New Zealand, staying in his house here most of the time he is here (except when his business requires him to be elsewhere in New Zealand). These trips vary in length from 2 days up to several weeks. Li has significant investments in New Zealand, and he is a member of cultural and sporting associations here. Li’s immediate family lives in Australia. Result: Li has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. Explanation: Li has a place of abode in New Zealand that he habitually resides in. He spends up to 5 months of the year in New Zealand, and for most of that time (whenever possible) he resides in his house here. Li’s presence in New Zealand is generally for short periods – that is, his presence here is not of a continuous nature. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 31 of 133 However, Li resides in his house here for long enough each year that there is no question he habitually resides there, so it is a permanent place of abode for him. In addition, Li has substantial connections with New Zealand, and those connections are maintained through regular trips to New Zealand. Those factors further bolster the conclusion that his place of abode here is a permanent place of abode. Although he also has a place of abode in Australia, Li usually or typically lives in both of his places of abode on an enduring, rather than temporary, basis. A person with a permanent place of abode in New Zealand is tax resident under the permanent place of abode test even if they also have a permanent place of abode elsewhere. Example | Tauira 4 – Sale of former permanent place of abode but having another dwelling in New Zealand Facts: Ronan is a software developer who has lived in Wellington for 12 years and has a partner there. He and his partner own the apartment they live in and another similar apartment in a nearby building that they rent out. Ronan accepts a 2-year contract in Dublin. For the first year of his contract, Ronan returns to Wellington every few months to see his partner, after which she decides to take a year of unpaid leave and join him in Ireland for the remainder of his contract. At that time, they sell the apartment they had lived in, given that they will be down to one income and wish to travel a little in Europe in the second year of Ronan’s contract. They sold the apartment they lived in rather than the investment property because it was not subject to a lease so was easier to sell promptly. The couple intend to return to Wellington after Ronan’s contract – they have many friends there and Ronan’s partner’s family live there. In addition to the investment property he owns with his partner, Ronan has a sizeable New Zealand share portfolio. Result: Ronan has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand during the first year of his absence. Explanation: In the first year of Ronan’s absence, there is a place of abode in New Zealand that he habitually resided in before leaving for Ireland – the apartment he and his partner owned and in which they lived. Although Ronan was away from New Zealand, it remained his permanent place of abode for the first year of his absence. His partner continued to live there, and Ronan returned to see her every few months. The apartment would have been furnished with Ronan and his partner’s belongings, and Ronan intended to return to New Zealand to live after his 2-year contract. In addition, Ronan has several enduring connections with New Zealand, and Wellington IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 32 of 133 in particular – he has lived in Wellington for 12 years and intends to return there with his partner after his 2-year contract, he has family ties there (his partner’s family), and he has substantial investments in New Zealand. These factors support a conclusion that he was likely to continue living in the apartment in Wellington on his intended return to New Zealand, so it remained a place in which he habitually resided, despite a period of absence. In the second year of Ronan’s absence from New Zealand, after the sale of the apartment in which he had lived, Ronan ceased having a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. Once the apartment was sold, Ronan no longer has an abode in New Zealand in which he habitually resides. Although Ronan and his partner own an investment property that is very similar to the apartment in which they lived, and they may indeed decide to live in it on their return to New Zealand, Ronan has never lived in that property, and it has only ever been used as an investment property. Therefore, it is irrelevant in respect of the second year of his absence that Ronan intends to return to New Zealand after his contract finishes or that he has numerous ties to New Zealand generally and Wellington more specifically – none of those ties indicate that the investment property is Ronan’s permanent place of abode. Example | Tauira 5 – Spouses departing New Zealand and ceasing to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand at different times Facts: Melanie and her husband and four young children live in Tauranga. Melanie gets a lucrative job offer in London and the family decide to move there. They have no intention to return to New Zealand to live in the foreseeable future and intend the move to be permanent. As such, the couple decide to sell their family home. Melanie moves to London in October to start her new job. Her husband stays behind in Tauranga until December so the children can finish the school year and to arrange the sale of their home. Once Melanie arrives in London, she enrols the children in schools there from the start of the following year. Melanie and her husband retain a one-bedroom rental property in Tauranga, which they have owned for several years. They leave their share portfolio to be managed by their New Zealand broker. They have life insurance policies with a New Zealand insurance company and retain those policies. The family home is sold in November. The sale settles in mid-December, at the end of the school year, at which time Melanie’s husband and children move to London as planned. Result: Melanie does not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand from the date of her departure in October. Her husband does not have a permanent place of abode from when the sale of the family home settles in mid-December. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 33 of 133 Explanation: Although Melanie, at least initially, continues to have strong connections to New Zealand, her place of abode here is no longer her permanent place of abode. In the 2 months after she leaves New Zealand, her husband and children remain here, living in their family home. However, this is so the children can finish the school year here and Melanie’s husband can arrange the sale of the family home. In the circumstances, it does not indicate that the family home continues to be Melanie’s permanent place of abode – she no longer habitually resides there. Melanie has no intention to return to live in New Zealand in the foreseeable future, nor to live in the home again, and the sale of the home shortly after her departure supports this. The retention of some investments and insurance in New Zealand is not by itself significant, and does not indicate that the home continued to be Melanie’s permanent place of abode until it was sold. Melanie has never resided at the rental property that she and her husband own – it was acquired solely as an investment and has always been used as such. It is not a place they habitually live. Therefore, it would not be Melanie’s permanent place of abode even if she maintained strong ties to New Zealand after her departure. Melanie’s husband continues to habitually reside in the family home until the sale settles in mid-December. Therefore, it remains his permanent place of abode until that time. If some time after Melanie left New Zealand but before the family home was sold, circumstances changed such that Melanie ended up forgoing the job opportunity in London and returning to New Zealand to the family home to live, the home would become her permanent place of abode once again from that time. This would not alter the fact that on her departure the family home ceased to be her permanent place of abode. Example | Tauira 6 – Family home relocation during a person’s absence from New Zealand Facts: Cameron is a civil engineer who goes to Japan for work for 18 months. Cameron’s children are about to start high school, and the family had intended to move from Christchurch to Dunedin soon, to be closer to extended family. Cameron and his wife agree that she and the children will stay in New Zealand for the 18 months Cameron will be away, during which time they will move to Dunedin so the children can start high school there. Cameron’s wife and children make the move from Christchurch to Dunedin, and Cameron will join them there once he returns from Japan. Result: Cameron has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand during his absence. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 34 of 133 Explanation: Cameron has a place of abode in New Zealand that he habitually resides in – being the family home. Cameron lived in the original family home in Christchurch before going to Japan. He had a durable association with the home in Christchurch, and it continued to be his permanent place of abode despite his absence. Once the family home shifts because the family move to Dunedin, Cameron has a durable association with the new family home there through his wife and children living there and his intention to live there on his return. This association establishes that the new family home is Cameron’s permanent place of abode. Although Cameron has not previously lived in Dunedin, his family home has been established there during his absence, and he will join his family there on his return. Cameron habitually resides in the family home with his wife and children, and the fact the family home has shifted during Cameron’s absence does not alter that. The new family home can be viewed as essentially being a substitute for the previous family home, which was clearly Cameron’s permanent place of abode. Example | Tauira 7 – Fly-in fly-out worker with family in New Zealand Facts: Charlie and his wife own a house in Auckland, where they live with their children and where he is a member of several local clubs. Charlie starts working as a fly-in-fly - out (FIFO) miner in Moranbah in Queensland (Australia). He works for periods of 8 weeks at a time, between which he returns to his home in Auckland for a week off. Charlie’s wages are paid into an Australian bank account, in Australian dollars, and most of his wages are automatically transferred from there into the New Zealand bank account he holds jointly with his wife. Charlie’s employer provides him with accommodation at the mine site. On his week off when he returns to New Zealand, Charlie maintains his sporting and social ties. Result: Charlie has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. Explanation: Charlie has a place of abode in New Zealand that he habitually resides in – the house that he and his wife own and that is their family home. Although Charlie is absent from New Zealand for the bulk of each year, his absences are solely because of the nature of his job, and there is no question that his home in Auckland continues to be a place he habitually resides, so it is a permanent place of abode for him. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 35 of 133 Example | Tauira 8 – No dwelling in New Zealand that could be a permanent place of abode, and insufficient connections even if, on alternate facts, there was a dwelling Facts: Daniel is an engineer who has lived in Napier all his life. He accepts a 2-year contract working on an oil rig in Malaysia for periods of 4 weeks at a time. When he takes up the job, he terminates the lease on the flat he has lived in for the last year. Between his stints on the rig, Daniel has two weeks off. He has a periodic lease on an apartment in Malaysia, and for most of his weeks off he stays there. At other times he travels elsewhere, sometimes returning to New Zealand to visit family and friends here. When he is back in New Zealand, Daniel stays at his parents’ house in Napier. Daniel’s wages are paid into his Malaysian bank account, in American dollars. He has no plans to return to New Zealand permanently – his intention is to work and live in Malaysia indefinitely. Daniel’s employer has sponsored his Malaysian work permit and will continue to do so as long as he stays with the company. Result: Daniel does not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. Explanation: Daniel terminated the lease on the flat he lived in before he left New Zealand. Therefore, it does not continue to be a place he habitually resides from that point. Although Daniel might potentially be able to return to live with his parents when he comes back to New Zealand, the fact he lived independently from his parents for at least a year before leaving New Zealand means he no longer habitually resided at their house before his departure from New Zealand. The fact that he stays at his parents’ house during some of his time off, when he returns to New Zealand to catch up with friends and family, does not suggest he habitually resides there. Even if Daniel had recently graduated from his university degree before leaving New Zealand, so had lived with his parents immediately before going overseas, his parents’ house would not be his permanent place of abode once he leaves New Zealand. This is because Daniel has not retained sufficient connections with New Zealand for his parents’ house here to remain his permanent place of abode. Although Daniel periodically visits his parents and friends in Napier, he has no other significant ties here, does not intend to return to New Zealand permanently, and intends to work and live in Malaysia indefinitely. Daniel’s employer will continue to sponsor his work permit, which indicates that this intention would seem to be reasonably held. In this scenario, Daniel would have lived with his parents before leaving New Zealand because he was still studying. However, by the time he left New Zealand he would have completed his degree and been financially independent. That, together with the fact IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 36 of 133 Daniel has no intention to return to New Zealand permanently and intends to work and live in Malaysia indefinitely, indicate that Daniel would no longer be said to habitually reside at his parents’ home. Example | Tauira 9 – Members of a family may acquire (or cease to have) a permanent place of abode in New Zealand at different times Facts: In 1982, Edward, a United Kingdom citizen, moved to New Zealand with his wife Amelia, a New Zealander. They both had a permanent place of abode here from that time. They married in 1985, and Edward was granted a permanent residence visa. In 1995, the couple and their two daughters moved to Singapore because of a job opportunity for Edward. In 2000, Edward and Amelia purchased a small lifestyle property just out of Auckland to use as a holiday home. They stayed at the property when they were back in New Zealand for holidays – about 2 or 3 months a year. Other family members in New Zealand also used the property for holidays. In 2002, Amelia moved back to New Zealand to care for her mother who was terminally ill. Edward and Amelia decided their daughters should attend school in New Zealand, so the children moved here in January 2003 and went to boarding school. Amelia lived in the property that had previously been used as a holiday home, and the children lived there during school holidays. In 2003, Edward came to New Zealand regularly to see Amelia and the children – about 2½ months in total over that year. After Amelia’s mother passed away in 2004, Amelia stayed in New Zealand as one of the children had been injured in a car accident. From that point, Edward re-arranged his work commitments so he could come to New Zealand not just for holidays, but more frequently, to support Amelia and the children. From that point, Edward spent about 4 months of each year in New Zealand with Amelia and the children. It became clear the daughter’s injuries would require long-term treatment, including surgeries and rehabilitation. At that point Edward decided to live in New Zealand all the time. He did so from 2006, giving up his lease in Singapore and bringing the rest of his personal effects from there to the family home in New Zealand. Result: Edward has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand from 2004, when he re-arranged his work commitments so he could come to New Zealand more frequently – from which time he spent about 4 months of each year here. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 37 of 133 Explanation: Edward had a place of abode in New Zealand from 2000, when he and Amelia purchased the property they used as a holiday house. However, the house was not Edward’s permanent place of abode at that time, as he did not habitually reside there on a permanent basis, but rather for temporary periods during holidays in New Zealand. The permanent place of abode test needs to be considered on an individual basis. The fact Amelia and the children moved back to New Zealand in 2002 and 2003, respectively, does not mean the house here became Edward’s permanent place of abode by virtue of the family living there. This is because Edward continued to live in Singapore, where he had lived since 1995, he did not habitually reside in the New Zealand house on a permanent basis. He came back only for relatively short holidays, and he had no intention to do otherwise at that time. It was after his daughter’s accident, when Edward re-arranged his work commitments so he could come to New Zealand more frequently – spending about 4 months of each year here – that he established a permanent place of abode here. From that point, Edward started habitually residing in the family home more than just temporarily for relatively short holidays, though he continued to also habitually reside in his residence in Singapore. From that point, the nature and quality of the Edward’s use of the property changed. The house here therefore became Edward’s permanent place of abode from that point. The day-count rules 119. In addition to the permanent place of abode test, there are day-count rules in the Act, under which a person can become tax resident in New Zealand or cease to be tax resident in New Zealand. These rules are referred to as the 183-day rule and the 325- day rule. 120. These rules are set out in s YD 1 as follows: YD 1 Residence of natural persons ... 183 days in New Zealand (3) A person is a New Zealand resident if they are personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in total in a 12-month period. Person treated as resident from first of 183 days IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 38 of 133 (4) If subsection (3) applies, the person is treated as resident from the first of the 183 days until the person is treated under subsection (5) as ceasing to be a New Zealand resident. Ending residence: 325 days outside New Zealand (5) A person treated as a New Zealand resident only under subsection (3) stops being a New Zealand resident if they are personally absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in total in a 12-month period. Person treated as non-resident from first of 325 days (6) The person is treated as not resident from the first of the 325 days until they are treated again as resident under this section. The part-d ay rule 121. For the purposes of the 183-day and 325-day rules, if a person is present in New Zealand for part of a day, that day counts as a full day of presence and does not count at all towards days of absence. This is provided for in s YD 1(8) which states: YD 1 Residence of natural persons ... Presence for part-days (8) For the purposes of this section, a person personally present in New Zealand for part of a day is treated as— (a) present in New Zealand for the whole day; and (b) not absent from New Zealand for any part of the day. 122. Therefore, days of arrival in and departure from New Zealand are treated as full days of presence in New Zealand for the 183-day and 325-day rules. The 183-day rule Overview of the rule 123. Section YD 1(3) provides that a person is a New Zealand resident if they are personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in total in a 12-month period. 124. If the 183-day rule is satisfied, s YD 1(4) then provides that the person is treated as resident from the first of those 183 days, until they are treated as ceasing to be resident under subs (5) (the 325-day rule). IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 39 of 133 125. The 183-day rule is satisfied if a person is present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in total in any 12-month period. The rule does not relate to an income year, a calendar year, or any other particular 12-month period. The 12-month period does not need to include the date as at which residence is being assessed, and the days of presence do not need to be consecutive. Relationship between the 183-day rule and the permanent place of abode test 126. Th e 183-day rule operates in conjunction with the permanent place of abode test in s YD 1(2). But the permanent place of abode test is the overriding test. 127. Therefore, if a person has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, they are resident in New Zealand even if they have not been present here for more than 183 days in total in any 12-month period. 128. Because the tests operate in conjunction with one another, a person who has acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand (for example, someone who has moved here from overseas) may have their residence back-dated to a time before that under the 183-day rule and s YD 1(4). This could occur, for example, if the person came to New Zealand for a holiday or job interview before moving here or because the person did not acquire a permanent place of abode immediately on moving to New Zealand, but some time later. 129. If a person has been present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in total in any 12- month period, that person is tax resident in New Zealand from the first of those days of presence (or from when they acquired a permanent place of abode here – whichever is earlier) until they cease to be tax resident. 130. A person who is tax resident under the 183-day rule ceases to be tax resident if they:  satisfy the 325-day rule (discussed from \[133\]);  do not have a permanent place of abode here (discussed from \[43\]); and  are not absent from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand Government (discussed from \[147\]). Examples illustrating the 183-day rule Note: The following examples deal only with the 183-day rule. They do not consider the permanent place of abode test, the 325-day rule, any DTA implications, or any potential application of the transitional resident rules. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 40 of 133 Example | Tauira 10 – The 183-day rule Facts: Amy arrived in New Zealand on 1 October 2012 and stayed here until 1 March 2013, a total of 152 days of presence in New Zealand. Amy was then absent from New Zealand for 200 days. She then returned to New Zealand on 18 September 2013, and stayed here for a further 7 months. It is assumed Amy was not resident in New Zealand before 1 October 2012 and that she had not been present in New Zealand before that date. Result: Amy is resident in New Zealand from 18 September 2013. Explanation: Amy was not personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period starting before 18 September 2013. Because of her absence from 2 March 2013 to 17 September 2013, Amy was in New Zealand for only 165 days in the 12-month period starting on 1 October 2012 (152 days from 1 October 2012 to 1 March 2013 plus 13 days from 18 September 2013 to 30 September 2013). However, Amy was present in New Zealand for 7 months (213 days), in the 12-month period starting on 18 September 2013. Therefore, Amy is resident from the first day of presence in that period (that is, from 18 September 2013). While Amy was not present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in a 12-month period until 20 March 2014 (her 184 th day of presence since her arrival on 18 September 2013), the back-dating rule back-dates her New Zealand tax residence to the first of the days of presence in the 12-month period in which she exceeded 183 days of presence (the period starting on 18 September 2013) . Amy will continue to be resident in New Zealand until she ceases to be resident under the 325-day rule (assuming she has no permanent place of abode here). 1 Oct 2012 1 Mar 2013 18 Sept 2013 18 Apr 2014 152 days in NZ 200 days out of NZ 213 days in NZ Residence back-dated IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 41 of 133 Example | Tauira 11 – The 183-day rule Facts: Ben arrived in New Zealand on 1 June 2012 and stayed here until 20 June 2012, a total of 20 days. Ben returned to New Zealand on 1 August 2012 and stayed here until 17 January 2013, a total of 170 days. It is assumed Ben was not resident in New Zealand before 1 June 2012 and that he had not been present in New Zealand before that date. Result: Ben is resident in New Zealand from 1 June 2012. Explanation: Ben was personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days (190 days), during the 12-month period starting on 1 June 2012. While Ben was not present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in a 12-month period until 11 January 2013 (his 184 th day of presence since his first arrival on 1 June 2012), the back-dating rule back-dates his New Zealand tax residence to the first of the days of presence in the 12-month period in which he exceeded 183 days of presence (the period starting on 1 June 2012). Ben will continue to be resident in New Zealand until he ceases to be resident under the 325-day rule (assuming he has no permanent place of abode here). Exception to 183-day rule – non-resident seasonal workers 131. Despite the 183-day rule, a person who is a “non-resident seasonal worker” is treated as non-resident during the time they are employed under the recognised seasonal employer (RSE) scheme (s YD 1(11)). The RSE scheme allows businesses in the horticulture and viticulture industries to recruit workers from Pacific Island countries for seasonal work. For more information about the RSE scheme see RSE Scheme overview for employers. 1 Jun 2012 20 Jun 2012 1 Aug 2012 1 7 Jan 2013 20 days in NZ 41 days out of NZ 170 days in NZ Residence back-dated IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 42 of 133 132. The non-resident seasonal worker rule does not override the permanent place of abode test. Therefore, if a non-resident seasonal worker acquires a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, they will be resident here. The 325-day rule Overview of the rule 133. Section YD 1(5) provides that a person who is resident only under the 183-day rule stops being resident here if they are personally absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in total in a 12-month period. 134. If the 325-day rule is satisfied, s YD 1(6) then provides that the person is treated as non-resident from the first of those 325 days. 135. The 325-day rule is satisfied if a person is absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in total in any 12-month period. The rule does not relate to an income year, a calendar year, or any other particular 12-month period. The 12-month period does not need to include the date as at which residence is being assessed, and the days of absence do not need to be consecutive. Relationship between the 325-day rule and the permanent place of abode test 136. The 325-day rule applies to make someone non-resident only if they do not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. If someone has a permanent place of abode here, they will remain resident even if they are absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in a 12-month period. 137. A person who is absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in a 12-month period and who does not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand immediately before their departure, has their non-residence back-dated to the first day of the period of absence. 138. However, a person who is absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in a 12- month period and who has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand at the time of their departure cannot have their non-residence back-dated to any earlier than the day after the day they cease having a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. In this situation, if the person has not returned to New Zealand in the interim, it is not necessary to start the day counting again after the person ceases having a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. If the person is absent for, say, 100 days before ceasing to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, those 100 days are taken into account for the purposes of the 325-day rule. When the person is finally absent for more than 325 days, they will cease to be resident from (and including) day 101 IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 43 of 133 (that is, the day after the day on which they ceased having a permanent place of abode in New Zealand). 139. The combined effect of the 325-day rule and the permanent place of abode test is that after 325 days of absence from New Zealand in a 12-month period, a person ceases to be resident in New Zealand from the first of those days of absence on which they do not have a permanent place of abode here. 140. Once a person ceases to be resident, they remain non-resident until they either acquire a permanent place of abode in New Zealand or satisfy the 183-day rule. Examples illustrating the 325-day rule and its relationship with the permanent place of abode test Note: The following examples deal only with the 325-day rule and its relationship with the permanent place of abode test. They do not consider the 183-day rule, any DTA implications, or any potential application of the transitional resident rules. Example | Tauira 12 – The 325-day rule Facts: Jeremy left New Zealand on 1 May 2013 and returned on 1 August 2013, a total of 91 days of absence. Jeremy stayed in New Zealand until 20 August 2013, a total of 20 days of presence. Jeremy remained absent until 1 February 2014, a total of 164 days. Jeremy came back to New Zealand from 1 February 2014 until 16 February 2014, a total of 16 days. After leaving again on 16 February 2014, Jeremy returned to New Zealand on 30 April 2014, after a period of absence of 72 days. It is assumed Jeremy did not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand from the time he first left (1 May 2013) and that Jeremy was resident in New Zealand as at that date by virtue of the 183-day rule. 1 May 2013 1 Aug 2013 1 Feb 2014 30 Apr 2014 20 days in NZ 91 days out of NZ 16 days in NZ 20 Aug 2013 16 Feb 2014 72 days out of NZ164 days out of NZ Non-residence back-dated IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 44 of 133 Result: Jeremy is non-resident from 2 May 2013. Explanation: Jeremy was absent for 327 days in total in the 12-month period starting on 2 May 2013 (91 days starting on 2 May 2013 and ending on 31 July 2013, 164 days starting on 21 August 2013 and ending on 31 January 2014, and 72 days starting on 17 February 2014 and ending on 29 April 2014). Therefore, Jeremy is non-resident from the first day of absence in that period (that is, 2 May 2013). While Jeremy was not absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in a 12-month period until 28 April 2014 (his 326 th day of absence since his first day of absence of 2 May 2013), the back-dating rule back-dates his New Zealand tax non-residence to the first of the days of absence in the 12-month period in which he exceeded 325 days of absence (the period starting on 2 May 2013). Jeremy will remain non-resident until he acquires a permanent place of abode here or until he is present here for more than 183 days in any period of 12 months. Example | Tauira 13 – Relationship between the 325-day rule and the permanent place of abode test Facts: Claire leaves New Zealand on 1 April 2014 and returns on 1 August 2015. Claire has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand at all times during this period – she owns a house here, has strong economic and personal ties here, and remains in the employment of her New Zealand employer. Result: Claire remains resident in New Zealand at all times during her absence. Explanation: Although Claire is absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days (that is, 365 days) in the 12-month period starting on 2 April 2014, she remains resident here because she has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand at all times during her absence. Example | Tauira 14 – Relationship between the 325-day rule and the permanent place of abode test Facts: James was seconded to the Australian office of his employer for 6 months and left New Zealand on 1 May 2014. James had always lived in New Zealand (with his parents), had a boyfriend here, and intended to return after the 6-month period. James left most of his personal property, including his car, with his parents. After he had been in Australia for 3 months, James was offered a permanent job there. On 1 August 2014 he accepted the job and resigned from his position in New Zealand. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 45 of 133 James stayed in Australia, and arranged to have his personal property transported to Australia. James asked his parents to sell his car, and he ended his relationship with his boyfriend. James intends to remain in Australia indefinitely. He did not return to New Zealand at all until he had a holiday here in July 2015. Result: James is non-resident from 2 August 2014. Explanation: James was personally absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in the 12-month period starting on 2 May 2014. However, James did not cease having a permanent place of abode in New Zealand when he originally departed on 1 May 2014 because he had a place of abode available to him (his parents’ house, where he had lived before his departure), he retained close personal and employment ties here, and he intended to return after a brief period of absence. James ceased having a permanent place of abode in New Zealand on 1 August 2014 when he resigned from his job in New Zealand and accepted the job in Australia, from which point he had decided to stay there indefinitely. Although it was in the following weeks that James arranged to have his property transported to Australia and ended his relationship, the decision to resign from his position in New Zealand and accept the permanent position in Australia is the time from which it is apparent that James had formed the intention to remain in Australia indefinitely. Accordingly, James ceased to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand on 1 August 2014. Because the permanent place of abode test is the overriding test, a person cannot have their non-residence back-dated under the back-dating rule to any earlier than the day after the day they cease having a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. Therefore, while James met the requirement of being absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in a 12-month period on 23 March 2015 (his 326 th day of absence 1 May 2014 1 Aug 2014 23 Mar 2015 Ceased having a permanent place of abode in NZ 326 days out of NZ Non-residence back-dated IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 46 of 133 since his first day of absence of 2 May 2014), his tax non-residence cannot be backdated to the first of the counted 325 days (2 May 2014). It can be back-dated only to the first of the 325 counted days on which he no longer had a permanent place of abode in New Zealand (2 August 2014). Therefore, James ceased being tax resident in New Zealand on 2 August 2014 – the day after the day he ceased having a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. James will remain non-resident until he acquires a permanent place of abode in New Zealand again or until he is present here for more than 183 days in any period of 12 months. Relationship between the 183-day rule and the 325-day rule – overlap of the day count rules 141. As noted at \[129\], if a person is personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in a 12-month period they are resident here and are treated as such from the first of those days of presence. The person then remains resident until they cease to be resident under the 325-day rule. 9 142. The combined effect of the 325-day rule and the permanent place of abode test is that a person who is absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in total in any 12- month period is treated as non-resident from the first of those days of absence or from the first day during the period of absence on which they no longer have a permanent place of abode here, whichever is later. 143. The effect of the back-dating of both the 183-day and 325-day rules means that where a person has travelled in and out of New Zealand there may be an overlap between those rules. 144. This is because a person who is resident under the 183-day rule may have been temporarily absent from New Zealand at some time before the 183-day rule was satisfied. If the person then satisfies the 325-day rule, they will cease to be resident in New Zealand from the first of those days of absence (assuming they have no permanent place of abode in New Zealand), even though that day falls before the final day that is taken into account for the purposes of the 183-day rule. In this situation, the period of absence taken into account for the purposes of the 325-day rule overlaps with the period of presence taken into account for the purposes of the 183-day rule. This may result in the person being treated as a New Zealand resident for a period of 9 As noted at \[136\], the 325-day rule can apply to make someone non-resident only if they do not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 47 of 133 less than 183 days, even though they were present here for more than 183 days in a 12-month period. 145. The two rules may also overlap in the converse situation. A person who ceases to be resident under the 325-day rule may have been temporarily present in New Zealand at some time before the 325-day rule was satisfied. If the person then satisfies the 183- day rule by being present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in a 12-month period, they will become resident in New Zealand from the first of those days of presence, even though that day falls before the final day that is taken into account for the purposes of the 325-day rule. This may result in the person being treated as non- resident for a period of less than 325 days even though they were absent for more than 325 days in a 12-month period. 146. Where a period taken into account for the purposes of the 183-day rule and a period taken into account for the purposes of the 325-day rule overlap, the later period operates to confer residence or non-residence, respectively, from the first day of that period. Examples illustrating the relationship between the 183-day and 325- day rules Note: The following examples deal only with the relationship between the 183-day and 325-day rules. They do not consider the permanent place of abode test, any DTA implications, or any potential application of the transitional resident rules. Example | Tauira 15 – Relationship between the 183-day rule and the 325-day rule Facts: Henry left New Zealand on 1 May 2013 and returned on 1 January 2014, after 244 days of absence. Henry left New Zealand again on 1 February 2014 after 32 days of presence here. Henry returned on 28 April 2014, after 85 days of absence, and remained in New Zealand from that point. It is assumed Henry did not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand until after he returned on 28 April 2014. It is also assumed Henry was resident in New Zealand under the 183-day rule before his departure on 1 May 2013. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 48 of 133 Result: Henry is treated as non-resident from 2 May 2013 until 31 December 2013. Henry is treated as resident in New Zealand again from 1 January 2014. Explanation: Henry was personally absent from New Zealand for 329 days in total in the 12-month period starting on 2 May 2013 (that is, for 244 days from 2 May 2013 to 31 December 2013, and for 85 days from 2 February 2014 to 27 April 2014). Therefore, Henry is treated as non-resident in New Zealand from the first day of absence (that is, 2 May 2013. While Henry was not absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in a 12-month period until 24 April 2014 (his 326 th day of absence since his first day of absence of 2 May 2013), the back-dating rule back-dates his New Zealand tax non-residence to the first of the days of absence in the 12-month period in which he exceeded 325 days of absence (the period starting on 2 May 2013). Henry was personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in the 12-month period starting on 1 January 2014 (that is, for 32 days from 1 January 2014 to 1 February 2014, and 248 days from 28 April 2014 to 31 December 2014 – a total of 280 days). Therefore, Henry is treated as resident from the first of those days of presence (that is, 1 January 2014). While Henry was not present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in a 12-month period until 26 September 2014 (his 184 th day of presence since his first day of presence of 1 January 2014), the back-dating rule back-dates his New Zealand tax residence to the first of the days of presence in the 12-month period in which he exceeded 183 days of presence (the period starting on 1 January 2014). The period taken into account for the purposes of the 183-day rule cuts into the period taken into account for the purposes of the 325-day rule. Therefore, Henry is treated as non-resident only from the start of the period of absence (that is, 2 May 1 May 2013 1 Jan 2014 28 Apr 2014 32 days in NZ 244 days out of NZ 1 Feb 2014 31 Dec 2014 85 days out of NZ Non-residence back-dated Residence back-dated In NZ IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 49 of 133 2013) until the day before the beginning of the period taken into account for the purposes of the 183-day rule (that is, 31 December 2013). Example | Tauira 16 – Relationship between the 183-day rule and the 325-day rule Facts: Belinda arrived in New Zealand on 1 November 2012 and stayed here for 150 days, until 30 March 2013. Belinda left New Zealand on 30 March 2013 and returned on 5 May 2013, a period of absence of 35 days (that is, from 31 March 2013 to 4 May 2013). Belinda was present in New Zealand from 5 May 2013 to 11 June 2013, a total of 38 days. Belinda left the country again on 12 June 2013 and has remained outside New Zealand since that time. It is assumed Belinda was resident outside New Zealand before she arrived on 1 November 2012 and that she did not at any time have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. Result: Belinda is treated as resident in New Zealand from 1 November 2012 to 30 March 2013. Belinda is treated as non-resident from 31 March 2013. Explanation: Belinda was present in New Zealand for 188 days in the 12-month period starting on 1 November 2012 (that is, for 150 days from 1 November 2012 to 30 March 2013, and for 38 days from 5 May 2013 to 11 June 2013). Therefore, Belinda is treated as resident from the first of those days of presence (that is, 1 November 2012). While Belinda was not present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in a 12-month period until 7 June 2013 (her 184 th day of presence since her first day of presence of 1 November 2012), the back-dating rule back-dates her New Zealand tax residence to the first of the days of presence in the 12-month period in which s he exceeded 183 days of presence (the period starting on 1 November 2012). Belinda was absent from New Zealand for 327 days in the 12-month period starting on 31 March 2013 (that is, for 35 days from 31 March 2013 until 4 May 2013, and for 292 1 Nov 2012 30 Mar 2013 11 Jun 2013 150 days in NZ 35 days out of NZ 5 May 2013 30 Mar 2014 Residence back-dated Non -residence back-dated 38 days in NZ In NZ IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 50 of 133 days from 12 June 2013 to 30 March 2014). Therefore, Belinda is treated as non- resident from the first of those days of absence (that is, 31 March 2013). While Belinda was not absent from New Zealand for more than 325 days in a 12- month period until 30 March 2014 (her 326 th day of absence since her first day of absence of 31 March 2013), the back-dating rule back-dates her New Zealand tax non- residence to the first of the days of absence in the 12-month period in which she exceeded 325 days of absence (the period starting on 31 March 2013). The period taken into account for the purposes of the 325-day rule cuts into the period taken into account for the purposes of the 183-day rule. Therefore, Belinda is treated as resident only from the start of the period of presence (that is, 1 November 2012) until the day before the beginning of the period taken into account for the purposes of the 325-day rule (that is, 30 March 2013). Government service rule 147. There is a special residence rule for people who are overseas in the service of the New Zealand Government (s YD 1(7)). 148. Under this rule, a person who is absent from New Zealand in the service of the government is treated as a New Zealand resident during the period of their absence. This means that during the period of their service they cannot lose New Zealand tax residence under the 325-day rule for ending residence. 149. The government service rule is discussed in IS xx/xx\[link\]: Government service rule. Transitional residence – temporary tax exemptions for new migrants and returning New Zealanders Requirements for transitional residence 150. New migrants and returning New Zealanders may be eligible to be transitional residents under s HR 8(2). If a person is a transitional resident they are entitled to tax exemptions for certain income for a period, even though they are tax resident in New Zealand. 151. Under s HR 8(2), a person is a transitional resident if they:  are a New Zealand resident through acquiring a permanent place of abode here, or through the 183-day rule;  did not, for a continuous period of at least 10 years immediately before acquiring a permanent place of abode or satisfying the 183-day rule (ignoring the back- IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 51 of 133 dating rule in s YD 1(4)) , meet those requirements, and were not resident in New Zealand;  have not previously been a transitional resident; and  have not ceased to be a transitional resident (which may be because they have elected not to be one or because the period for transitional residence has expired – see \[160\]). 152. The transitional resident rules apply to people who satisfy the requirements to be a transitional resident on or after 1 April 2006, for the 2005–06 and subsequent income years. Income that is exempt during the transitional residence period 153. The transitional resident rules provide a temporary tax exemption (s CW 27) for all foreign-sourced income except for:  employment income in connection with employment or service performed while the person is a transitional resident; and  income from a supply of services. 154. The transitional resident rules also ensure that certain other provisions in the Act apply to produce a result for income tax purposes that is the same as if the transitional resident were non-resident (for example the controlled foreign company (CFC) rules, the FIF rules, the financial arrangements (FA) rules, the trust rules and the non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rules) (see s HR 8(1)). Transitional residence and various family-related tax credits 155. Transitional residents cannot receive Working for Families tax credits under the family scheme and maintain their transitional residence status. In addition, the spouse or partner of a transitional resident cannot receive Working for Families tax credits. (See ss MC 5, MD 7 and HR 8(5) ). 156. It is important to note that if a person who is eligible to be a transitional resident applies for Working for Families tax credits (including Best Start), that application is treated as an election for both the person and their spouse or partner to not be transitional residents. This deemed election cannot be reversed. Therefore, careful consideration should be given (and professional advice sought if necessary) to a decision to apply for Working for Families tax credits during the transitional residence period. 157. Transitional residents may receive FamilyBoost tax credits (which provide financial assistance to caregivers for early childhood education costs). A pplying for FamilyBoost is not treated as an election to no longer be a transitional resident. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 52 of 133 Start date of transitional residence 158. A person meeting the requirements for transitional residence will be a transitional resident, unless they elect not to be, from the first day they are tax resident in New Zealand (under either the permanent place of abode test or the 183-day rule). 159. The back-dating rule in s YD 1(4) is not ignored for these purposes. Therefore, the start date of a person’s transitional residence period is the earlier of the day they acquire a permanent place of abode in New Zealand or the first day of presence counted for the 183-day rule. End date of transitional residence 160. A person will remain a transitional resident until the earliest of the following:  The end of the 48th month after the month in which they acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand or satisfied the 183-day rule (ignoring the back- dating rule in s YD 1(4)), whichever is earlier.  The day before they stop being a New Zealand resident.  The date on which they stop being a transitional resident because they elect not to be one (under s HR 8(4) or (5)). 161. A person can elect not to be a transitional resident by notifying the Commissioner of this, effective from a date the person nominates. This could be done when filing a tax return or by sending a message through MyIR. As noted at \[156\], if a person who is eligible to be a transitional resident applies for Working for Families tax credits (including Best Start), this is treated as an election for both the person and their spouse or partner not to be a transitional resident. 162. There has been some uncertainty about when transitional residence ends if it ends due to a person (or their spouse or partner) 10 applying for Working for Families tax credits. The Commissioner considers that in these circumstances transitional residence ends the day before the date their Working for Families tax credit application applies from (that is, the date from which they are eligible for the tax credit). This is based on the words in s HR 8(5) that the application is treated “for the period of the application” as a notice of election for the person (or their spouse or partner) not to be a transitional resident. This is illustrated in Example | Tauira xx 18 below. 10 If the spouse or partner is eligible to be a transitional resident.

For further information about the transitional resident rules and examples of how they apply, see Temporary exemption from tax on foreign income for new migrants and certain returning New Zealanders, 11 and Temporary exemption for transitional residents. 12 165. However, it is noted that those items are not accurate in two respects. Firstly, the item in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 5 (June 2006) states that the period of transitional residence starts on the first day of the month in which the person migrates to New Zealand. However, as noted at \[158\], transitional residence starts on the first day the person is tax resident in New Zealand. 166. Secondly, the item in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 3 (April 2007) states that transitional residence lasts for 48 months after migration. However, as noted at \[160\], it lasts (presuming it is not opted out of) until the end of the 48th month after the month in which the person acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand (which will not necessarily be at the time of migration here) or satisfied the 183-day rule. Examples illustrating the transitional resident rules Note: The following examples deal only with the transitional resident rules. They do not consider the 183-day and 325-day rules, the permanent place of abode test, or any DTA implications. Example | Tauira 17 – C alculating the transitional residence period Facts: Robert visited New Zealand on 1 February 2011 for a job interview. On 15 May 2011 he relocated here permanently and acquired a permanent place of abode at that time. On 29 October 2011 he satisfied the 183-day rule and was deemed to be tax resident in New Zealand from 1 February 2011 because of the back-dating rule in s YD 1(4). He has never been tax resident in New Zealand before and has not elected not to be a transitional resident. 11 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 5 (June 2006): 103. 12 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 3 (April 2007): 83. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 54 of 133 Result: Robert qualifies for transitional residence. His status as a transitional resident would run from 1 February 2011 to 31 May 2015, provided he remains resident here and does not make an election not to be a transitional resident. Explanation: Robert is resident in New Zealand from 1 February 2011, under the 183- day rule and s YD 1(4). Robert has never been a tax resident or transitional resident in New Zealand before and has not elected to not be a transitional resident. Therefore, he satisfies the requirements of s HR 8(2). Although Robert is treated as tax resident in New Zealand from 1 February 2011 (because of the back-dating rule in s YD 1(4)), he did not meet the requirements of either s YD 1(2) or s YD 1(3) (ignoring the back-dating rule) for being a resident until 15 May 2011, when he moved here and acquired a permanent place of abode here. Robert acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand before he satisfied the 183-day rule. Therefore, his status as a transitional resident would run from 1 February 2011 (the date from which Robert is tax resident in New Zealand) to 31 May 2015 (the end of the 48th month after the month in which he acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand). IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 55 of 133 Example | Tauira 18 – Date transitional residence ends when an application for Working for Families tax credits is made Facts: Jane returned to New Zealand on 10 May 2023 and met the criteria to be a transitional resident. Jane gave birth to her daughter on 25 June 2023 and made an application for Working for Families tax credits on 1 July 2023. The Working for Families account was registered on 21 July 2023 with the first payment made on 22 July 2023. Payments were backdated to the date of Jane’s daughter’s birth. Result: Jane was a transitional resident from 10 May 2023 to 24 June 2023. Explanation: Under s HR 8(3), the start date of transitional residence is the first day of residence. This is 10 May 2023 when Jane returned to New Zealand. The end date of transitional residence is the earliest of the dates specified in s HR 8(3). Relevantly for Jane, the earliest date is the day she nominates under s HR 8(4) not to be a transitional resident. Section HR 8(5) states that an application under s 41 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for an income year is treated “for the period of the application” as a notice of election under s HR 8(4) not to be a transitional resident. The period of the application for Working for Families starts from 25 June 2023 (being the date of Jane’s daughter’s birth), as Jane is eligible for Working for Families from that date. Therefore, Jane’s transitional residence ends the day before, on 24 June 2023. Changes in tax residence 167. The tax residence of a person may change during an income year if the:  person acquires a permanent place of abode in New Zealand during the year;  person ceases to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand;  first day of more than 183 days of presence in New Zealand in any 12-month period falls within the year;  first day of more than 325 days of absence from New Zealand in any 12-month period falls within the year; or  person ceases to be absent from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand Government. 168. If a person’s circumstances change during an income year and this may affect their tax residence, they should get in touch with Inland Revenue to let us know. This can be done by filling in IR886 : N ew Zealand tax residence questionnaire, and sending it to us (through myIR or by post). If a person has derived income in the year their tax IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 56 of 133 residence changes, they will need to file a tax return in New Zealand. A taxpayer may wish to consult a tax professional if they are in doubt about their situation. 169. A person’s transitional residence status may also change during an income year. 170. Some of the more significant income tax considerations that may be relevant when the residence or transitional residence status of a person changes during an income year are set out from \[172\] to \[183\]. A change in residence may also have implications for the application of a DTA. Further, if a person is a settlor or beneficiary of a trust and their residence status changes there may be tax implications – see from \[431\]. 171. Because of the back-dating rules that apply to the 183-day and 325-day rules, a change of residence during a particular income year may not be confirmed until the subsequent income year. Unless there has been a permanent or long-term move to or from New Zealand, this may cause uncertainties if a return needs to be filed in the interim (that is, if it is not known whether the 183-day or 325-day rule will end up being met). Care should be taken in these circumstances if a taxpayer is not certain about whether their residence status will change. Taxation of foreign-sourced income, and expenditure incurred in deriving it 172. If the person derived income from sources outside New Zealand during the income year, that income (subject to the transitional resident rules) is assessable income for New Zealand tax purposes if it was derived while the person was resident here (s BD 1(5)) . 173. Therefore, where a person’s residence status changes during an income year, the amount of any foreign-sourced income the person derived while resident in New Zealand must be determined. To do this, the total foreign-sourced income derived needs to be reasonably apportioned to the periods of residence and non-residence. 174. Expenditure incurred by a non-resident in deriving foreign-sourced income is not deductible. Therefore, if a person ceases to be resident in New Zealand during an income year and they incur expenditure in deriving foreign-sourced income, any of that expenditure incurred from the point they cease to be resident is not deductible. The financial arrangements rules 175. The FA rules are a timing regime that spreads income and expenditure under a financial arrangement over the term of the arrangement. 176. If a person becomes a New Zealand resident who is not a transitional resident during an income year and is a party to a financial arrangement, they may become subject to the FA rules. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 57 of 133 177. Where this is the case, they are treated as having assumed the accrued obligation to pay consideration under the financial arrangement immediately after the time at which they became a resident who is not a transitional resident, and as having paid the market value that a contract to assume the obligation had at that time (s EW 37(2)). The deemed acquisition price is then taken into account in any subsequent base price adjustment required by s EW 29. 178. To the extent that the exemption from the FA rules for non-residents (s EW 9) previously applied, that exemption ceases to apply when the person becomes resident. 179. If a person ceases to be a New Zealand resident during an income year and is a party to a financial arrangement, they must calculate a base price adjustment for the financial arrangement as at the date of ceasing to be resident (s EW 29). If the base price adjustment is positive, it is income derived by the person in the year for which the calculation is made (s EW 31(3)). If the base price adjustment is negative, it is expenditure incurred by the person in the year for which the calculation is made, and a deduction may be allowed for that expenditure under s DB 6, s DB 7, s DB 8 or s DB 11 (s EW 31(4)). 180. An exception to this is if the person is a cash basis person and they cease to be a New Zealand resident before the first day of the fourth income year following the income year in which they first became a New Zealand resident. In that case, they do not need to calculate a base price adjustment for a financial arrangement they were a party to both before becoming and after ceasing to be a New Zealand resident (s EW 30(1)). 181. A financial arrangement is an excepted financial arrangement for a transitional resident if no other party is a New Zealand resident and the financial arrangement is not for a purpose of a business carried on in New Zealand by a party to the arrangement (s EW 5(17)). Provisional tax 182. If a person ceases to be a New Zealand resident during the income year, they may cease to be a provisional taxpayer for the purposes of the provisional tax rules (being the provisions listed in s RC 2). 183. Conversely, if a person becomes a New Zealand resident during the income year, they may become a provisional taxpayer and liable to pay provisional tax in accordance with the provisional tax rules regime (s RC 3). Relevance of double taxation agreements 184. New Zealand is party to DTAs with numerous countries. If someone is tax resident in both New Zealand and a country with which New Zealand has a DTA, the DTA determines what taxing rights each country has. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 58 of 133 185. For a list of countries with which New Zealand has DTAs, see Tax treaties o n Inland Revenue’s website. Dual tax r esidence 186. Dual residence occurs when an individual is tax resident in two countries under the laws of each of those countries. This can easily arise, as different countries have different residence tests and may use more than one residence test. 187. One situation where dual residence is likely to arise in practice is where one country has a personal presence test and another relies on more permanent connections focusing on factors such as the location of a person’s home or their domicile. For example, if country A deems a person resident after they have been present there for 183 days, and country B has a test based on other factors, a person normally resident in country B who is present in country A for a 6-month period may be resident in both countries. Consequently, if both countries tax on a worldwide basis an element of double taxation may occur. 188. The New Zealand residence rules for individuals are intended to make it relatively easy to become tax resident here, and more difficult to cease being tax resident. Therefore, dual residence may occur quite easily in the New Zealand context. Individuals who become resident in New Zealand under the 183-day rule may also be resident in another country under a test based on other factors, such as domicile. Conversely, individuals leaving New Zealand may remain resident here under the permanent place of abode test, while at the same time becoming resident in another country under a personal presence rule. 189. Where there is a DTA between New Zealand and another country, dual residence issues are resolved by applying the residence article in the DTA. The object of the residence article is to ensure taxpayers are precluded from having dual residence for DTA purposes. 190. Where a taxpayer is resident under the domestic laws of New Zealand and the DTA partner, dual residence is avoided for the purposes of the DTA by applying a series of tie-breaker tests to allocate residence to one of the countries. Once residence has been allocated in this manner, the person’s tax liability, in relation to the matters the DTA covers, is determined on the basis of that residence status. 191. Section BH 1(4) states that DTAs have overriding effect: BH 1 Double tax agreements ... IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 59 of 133 Overriding effect (4) Despite anything in this Act, except subsection (5), or in any other Inland Revenue Act or the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993, a double tax agreement has effect in relation to— (a) income tax: (b) any other tax imposed by this Act: (c) the exchange of information that relates to a tax, as defined in paragraphs (a)(i) to (v) of the definition of tax in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 192. The Court of Appeal in CIR v ER Squibb & Sons (NZ) Ltd (1992) 14 NZTC 9,146 (CA) at 9,154 said this means that “wherever and to the extent that there is any difference between the domestic legislation and the double tax agreement provision, the agreement has overriding effect”. This means the domestic legislation must be read together with the relevant DTA articles. 193. When a person who is tax resident in New Zealand under domestic law is deemed to be resident in another country for the purposes of a DTA, the person remains liable to New Zealand income tax on their worldwide income on the basis of their residence here. However, the liability is modified by any restrictions the DTA imposes on New Zealand’s right to tax persons who are deemed to be resident in the other country for the purposes of the DTA. For example, if the person receives a dividend from a New Zealand resident company, the resident withholding tax (RWT) on the dividend would be calculated on the basis of the normal rate, but would be subject to the limitation the DTA imposes on New Zealand’s right to tax dividends derived by someone deemed to be resident of the DTA partner for DTA purposes. In most cases, the amount of tax that could be levied in New Zealand could not exceed 15% of the gross amount of the dividend. 194. The DTA residence articles are relevant only for the purposes of the DTAs. Someone who is resident in two countries under the domestic tax laws of those countries remains resident in both countries for other tax purposes (for example, GST). Residence article 195. The residence article in many of New Zealand’s DTAs closely follows the residence article in the OECD’s Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital (the OECD Model Convention). The residence article (art 4) of the OECD Model Convention, as it relates to individuals, provides: 1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term “resident of a Contracting State” means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature, and also includes that State and any political subdivision or local IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 60 of 133 authority thereof as well as a recognised pension fund of that State. This term, however, does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State or capital situated therein. 2. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then his status shall be determined as follows: a) he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which he has a permanent home available to him; if he has a permanent home available to him in both States, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State with which his personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests); b) if the State in which he has his centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if he has not a permanent home available to him in either State, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which he has an habitual abode; c) if he has an habitual abode in both States or in neither of them, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State of which he is a national; d) if he is a national of both States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement. 196. As can be seen, the article applies when a person is a resident of both countries (Contracting States) under para 1. This does not include any person who is liable to tax in a state in respect only of income from sources in that state. When the article applies, the person’s residence status for the purposes of the DTA is determined by applying a series of tie-breaker tests. The tie-breaker tests in the relevant DTA are applied in order, until residence can be determined under one of them. 197. The DTA residence tie-breaker tests apply only where the person concerned is resident of both countries under para 1 of art 4. Therefore, if a person comes to New Zealand from, say, Canada, becomes resident in New Zealand and ceases to be resident in Canada (so ceases to be liable to tax in Canada by reason of any of the listed criteria or similar criteria), it is clear the person is resident in New Zealand for both the purposes of the Act and the DTA with Canada. The residence allocation rules are not relevant in these circumstances because the person is not a resident of Canada under para 1 of art 4. The DTA is still relevant in terms of allocating taxing rights for any Canadian- sourced income. Interpretation of terms used in the residence article 198. The terms “permanent home”, “personal and economic relations” (or “centre of vital interests”) and “habitual abode” are not defined in any of New Zealand’s DTAs. 199. The “general definitions” article of New Zealand’s DTAs typically provides that in applying the DTA, “unless the context otherwise requires”, any term not defined in the DTA has the meaning it has under the laws of that state for the purposes of the taxes to which the DTA applies, with any meaning under the tax laws of that state prevailing over any meaning of the term under other laws of that state. (See also OECD Commentary on art 3 at para 13.1). IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 61 of 133 200. This means the meaning of an undefined term in a DTA may be ascertained by reference to domestic laws generally, not just tax laws – though any tax law meaning will prevail. 201. But, as noted, reference to any meaning that undefined terms may have under domestic law is relevant only if the context does not require otherwise. One of the general rules of treaty interpretation in art 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which New Zealand has ratified, is that a special meaning is given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended (para 4 of art 31). 202. If a DTA between New Zealand and another country uses the wording of a particular article in the OECD Model Convention (or very similar wording), the Commissioner considers it can be inferred that the OECD commentary on that article reflects the meaning the parties intended to be given to any undefined terms in that article. The Commissioner considers that in such circumstances, the OECD commentary is a significant aid to interpreting the relevant undefined terms. In such a case, the Commissioner considers that the context requires the undefined term not simply be regarded as having the meaning (if any) it has under domestic law – which is the default position under the general definitions article. 203. The OECD commentary on the residence article gives guidance on the meanings to be given to the undefined terms “permanent home”, “personal and economic relations” (or “centre of vital interests”) and “habitual abode”. New Zealand’s DTAs generally follow, or closely follow, the wording in the OECD Model Convention. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that the OECD commentary on those terms is a significant aid to interpreting their meaning, and any case law (New Zealand or foreign) that considers the meaning of the undefined term in a DTA context should also be considered. Permanent home 204. The first test in the residence articles in New Zealand’s DTAs gives preference to the country in which the person “has a permanent home available to \[them\]”. The test has three elements: there must be a home, it must be permanent, and it must be available for use. 205. It is clear from the OECD commentary that the concept of “home” is used in its physical sense. The commentary states that any form of home may be taken into account – that is, a house, apartment, rented or furnished room (OECD commentary on art 4 at para 13). 206. The OECD commentary states that for a home to be permanent “the individual must have arranged and retained it for his permanent use as opposed to staying at a particular place under such conditions that it is evident that the stay is intended to be of short duration” (OECD commentary on art 4 at para 12). Therefore, the test is an IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 62 of 133 objective one, and it is necessary to consider the conditions under which the person retained the home and then conclude from that whether the home has the quality of permanence. 207. The OECD commentary on art 4 of the OECD Model Convention emphasises that the permanence of the home is essential, and states that this means that “the person has arranged to have the dwelling available to him at all times continuously, and not occasionally for the purposes of a stay which, owing to the reasons for it, is necessarily of short duration”. The OECD commentary gives as examples travel for pleasure, business travel, educational travel, attending a course at a school, etc. (OECD commentary on art 4 at para 13). 208. The home must be available for the person’s use. Availability in this context is not based on mere occupation or immediate availability for occupation. “Available” is a broad term that includes several concepts including factual availability and legal availability (that is, legal rights and controls over the property). Determining whether a home is available involves assessing factors such as whether the: 13  home is capable of being used by the person;  person has the right to determine occupancy and possession of the property;  person has the power to dispose of the property. 209. Applying these factors, the Commissioner considers that when a home is let out on an arm’s length basis to a non-associated person it will generally be unavailable to the landlord as a permanent home. Therefore, the Commissioner considers a house that is let under the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (including one let on a periodic tenancy) will generally be unavailable to the landlord as a permanent home. If the house is let to an associated person or friend it might still be available to the owner as a permanent home. 210. The Commissioner is of the view that owning or personally renting accommodation is not fundamental to a person having a permanent home available to them. For example, a person may have a permanent home where accommodation is owned or leased by an employer, a spouse or partner, a company or a trust (not controlled by the person), or where the person is able to live somewhere rent-free. If a person owns or personally rents a home that is a relevant consideration, but if a home is arranged or retained in some other way (by or through a third party, for example) this is not of itself determinative of whether the person has a permanent home. This is consistent with the view expressed in G A Harris’ 1990 New Zealand’s International Taxation. To the extent that Case 12/2011 25 NZTC 1-012 (TRA) may arguably suggest otherwise, the Commissioner does not agree. 13 See Case 12/2011 (2011) 25 NZTC 1-012 (TRA) and Case J41. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 63 of 133 211. If it is apparent that a person who is dual resident has a permanent home available in one country or jurisdiction that puts an end to the matter unless the person can establish that they also have a permanent home available in the other country or jurisdiction. 212. If a person has a permanent home available in both countries, the next test is generally the personal and economic relations test. The DTA between New Zealand and Malaysia 14 differs in that if residence cannot be resolved under the permanent home test, the next test is the habitual abode test, followed by the personal and economic relations test. 213. Where a person does not have a permanent home available to them in either country, the next test for consideration is generally the habitual abode test. However, this is not the case under New Zealand’s DTAs with Australia, 15 Thailand, 16 the Republic of South Africa, 17 the United Arab Emirates, 18 Spain 19 and Papua New Guinea. 20 Under those DTAs, where a person does not have a permanent home available to them in either country the next test is the personal and economic relations test, followed by the habitual abode test. Personal and economic relations (centre of vital interests) 214. Generally, the next test in the residence articles in New Zealand’s DTAs gives preference to the country “with which \[the person’s\] personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests)”. 215. In applying this test, the person’s personal and economic relations with both New Zealand and the other country must be considered, and the country with which these relations are closer (or, in other words, their centre of vital interests) must be determined. 216. The OECD commentary on art 4 of the OECD Model Convention indicates that the following types of factors may be taken into account in applying the test (at para 15): ... regard will be had to his family and social relations, his occupations, his political, cultural or other activities, his place of business, the place from which he administers his property, etc. The circumstances must be examined as a whole, but it is nevertheless obvious that considerations based on the personal acts of the individual must receive 14 S igned on 19 March 1976. 15 Signed on 26 June 2009. 16 Signed on 22 October 1998. 17 Signed on 6 February 2002. 18 Signed on 22 September 2003. 19 Signed on 28 July 2005. 20 Signed on 29 October 2012.

If a person who has a home in one State sets up a second in the other State while retaining the first, the fact that he retains the first in the environment where he has always lived, where he has worked, and where he has his family and possessions, can, together with other elements, go to demonstrate that he has retained his centre of vital interests in the first State. 217. It is clear from the commentary that the “personal relations” referred to are wider than immediate family relations. Social relations are also taken into account, as are political, cultural and other activities. Sporting activities, for example, would fall into this latter category. Overall, a wide range of personal connections is considered. 218. The importance of the location of a person’s family depends on the person’s circumstances (that is, for some people the location of their family is going to be significant, for others not so). In many circumstances, personal relations will be more significant than economic relations because the location of a person’s family is often highly significant. However, the issue needs to be determined on the specific facts relating to the person. 219. In Hertel v MNR 93 DTC 721 (TCC) at 723, Sobier TCCJ commented that: In determining the centre of vital interests, it is not enough to simply weigh or count the number of factors or connections on each side. The depth of the roots of one’s centre of vital interests is more important than their number. 220. Assessing the depth of a person’s roots requires weighing up the circumstances as a whole to determine which locality is of greater significance to the person. Some commentators have suggested that greater weight should be given to personal relations. However, the Commissioner considers that the better view is that the “centre of vital interests” concept is a composite one and does not give preference to either personal or economic relations. The OECD commentary states (at para 15) that “considerations based on the personal acts of the individual must receive special attention”. The Commissioner considers that “personal acts” encompasses acts concerning both economic relations (such as seeking employment in a country) and personal relations (such as activities related to a person’s family). 221. If a person’s economic and personal relations are overall evenly balanced between New Zealand and another country (though personal relations are stronger with one country and economic relations with the other), the person has no centre of vital interests, as the factors are regarded as being of equal weight. In this situation, the next test needs to be considered. 222. A person’s historical association with a country is relevant when considering the personal and economic relations test. If a person has always lived and worked in one country and retains a home, family and possessions there, it is likely their personal and economic relations are closer with that country even if a new home is established in IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 65 of 133 another country (see Gaudreau v R 2005 DTC 66 (TCC) and Yoon v R 2005 DTC 1109 (TCC)). For example, a university lecturer going overseas on sabbatical leave for 12 months who has lived and worked in New Zealand for a significant time and retains their home and possessions in New Zealand, will have closer personal and economic relations with New Zealand than with the other country. 223. The focus of the test is on determining the country with which the person has closer personal and economic relations (their centre of vital interests). If such a determination cannot be made under the personal and economic relations test, the next test needs to be considered. Generally, the next test is the habitual abode test. Habitual abode 224. Generally, the habitual abode test applies if a person:  has a permanent home available in both countries, and the country with which their personal and economic relations are closer (their centre of vital interests) cannot be established; or  has no permanent home available in either country. 21 225. The focus of the test is on whether the person has a habitual abode in New Zealand or the other country or both. As stated by the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal in Lingle v R 2010 FCA 152 (at para \[6\]), the concept of a habitual abode: ... involves notions of frequency, duration and regularity of stays of a quality which are more than transient. To put it differently, the concept refers to a stay of some substance in the jurisdiction as a matter of habit, so that the conclusion can be drawn that this is where the taxpayer normally lives. 226. A person has a habitual abode in a country if they live there habitually or normally. A person may habitually live in more than one country – the enquiry is not about assessing the country in which the person’s abode is more habitual, but about whether they have a habitual abode in New Zealand or the other country or both. 227. The OECD commentary on art 4 of the OECD Model Convention indicates that the test is applied by taking into account all of a person’s stays in a country, not only those at a home the person owns or rents there. For example, if a person has permanent homes available in both New Zealand and Australia, all stays in New Zealand, whether at their permanent home or elsewhere, are considered in determining whether the person has a habitual abode here. 21 As noted at \[213\], the DTAs between New Zealand and Australia, Thailand, the Republic of South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, Spain (signed on 28 July 2005) and Papua New Guinea are exceptions to this. Under those DTAs, where a person does not have a permanent home available to them in either country the next test for consideration will be the personal and economic relations test. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 66 of 133 228. It is important to consider the particular circumstances of the person when determining whether they have a habitual abode in a country. In assessing whether a stay is more than transient, the reasons for the stay are relevant. For example, where a person spends about 100 days in New Zealand in a year because they return to New Zealand every weekend, this may suggest the person has a habitual abode here. On the other hand, three stays of about 30 days’ duration each in a year, for a course of medical treatment, may indicate that those stays are transient and not by themselves indicative of a habitual abode here. 229. The focus is on where the person normally lives during the period of dual residence. In obvious cases there is no need to consider other periods. However, a wider view (that is, looking beyond the period of dual residence) may assist in cases where it is unclear or when determining whether the stays in a particular country are transient or of substance. 230. As the OECD commentary on art 4 states: 19.1 Subparagraph b) does not specify over what length of time the determination of whether an individual has an habitual abode in one or both States must be made. The determination must cover a sufficient length of time for it to be possible to ascertain the frequency, duration and regularity of stays that are part of the settled routine of the individual’s life. Care should be taken, however, to consider a period of time during which there were no major changes of personal circumstances that would clearly affect the determination (such as a separation or divorce). The relevant period for purposes of the determination of whether an individual has an habitual abode in one or both States will not always correspond to the period of dual residence, especially where the period of dual residence is very short. ... 231. The Commissioner considers that where it is appropriate to consider a period outside the period of dual residence, the appropriate length of time outside the period of dual residence to consider is just the amount necessary to determine whether the person had a habitual abode in New Zealand during the period of dual residence. The Commissioner now considers that the period looked at in applying the habitual abode test in the matter that became Case 12/2011 was inappropriately long. 22 232. The OECD commentary on art 4 gives the following example of a situation where the period of dual residence is short, so it would be appropriate to consider a longer period than the period of dual residence: 19.1 ... Assume that an individual resident of State C moves to State D to work at different locations for a period of 190 days. During that 190-day period, he is considered a resident of both States C and D under their respective domestic tax laws. The individual lived in State C for many years before moving to State D, remains in State D for the entire period of his employment there and returns to State C to live there permanently at the end of the 190-day period. During the 22 In any event, it is noted that the Taxation Review Authority’s discussion of how the habitual abode test would apply to the facts of that case (which was along the lines of submissions made by counsel) was obiter – the authority having already found the taxpayer to be solely resident in New Zealand at all material times under the earlier tie-breaker tests. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 67 of 133 period of his employment in State D, the individual does not have a permanent home available to him in either State C or State D. In this example, the determination of whether the individual has an habitual abode in one or both States would appropriately consider a period of time longer than the 190-day period of dual-residence in order to ascertain the frequency, duration and regularity of stays that were part of the settled routine of the individual's life. 233. In the Commissioner’s view, in the above example, where the period of dual residence is only about half a year, it is not necessary to look beyond about a year either side of the period of dual residence to be able to ascertain whether the individual had a habitual abode in either or both of the states. Of course, the period that would appropriately be looked at depends on the particular facts of any situation, including how transient or settled the routine of the individual’s life was both in and beyond the period of dual residence. Nationality 234. When a person has a habitual abode in both countries or in neither of them, residence is generally determined under New Zealand’s DTAs on the basis of nationality or citizenship. In cases where nationality is stated to be the test, the concept of nationality (for individuals) is generally defined in relation to New Zealand to be a person who is a New Zealand citizen. A New Zealand citizen is someone who has citizenship here under the Citizenship Act 1977. Mutual agreement 235. If the residence issue cannot be resolved under the tie-breaker tests, the residence article provides that the question may be resolved by mutual agreement between the competent authorities of the Contracting States. Examples illustrating the DTA residence tie-breaker tests Note: The following examples deal only with the DTA residence tie-breaker tests. They do not consider the domestic residence tests in detail, any DTA implications, or any potential application of the transitional resident rules. Example | Tauira 19 – The permanent home test Facts: Stacey, who is employed as a university lecturer, travels to the United Kingdom for 15 months’ sabbatical leave at a United Kingdom university. While on leave, Stacey remains in the employment of a New Zealand university. She is required to work for the university on her return to New Zealand. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 68 of 133 Stacey’s partner travels with her to the United Kingdom. Stacey and her partner let their house in New Zealand to tenants while they are in the United Kingdom. The tenancy is a periodic tenancy under the Residential Tenancies Act 1986, so is terminable with a 63-day notice period if Stacey requires it as her principal place of residence. The tenants are not associated with or friends of Stacey or her partner. While in the United Kingdom, Stacey and her partner rent a house near the university where Stacey spends her sabbatical leave. Stacey remains a member of several local clubs and organisations in New Zealand and keeps most of her personal property, including investments, in New Zealand (looked after and managed by family members). For the purposes of this example, it is assumed Stacey is resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom under the relevant United Kingdom legislation. Result: Stacey is resident in both New Zealand and the United Kingdom under the tax legislation of each country. However, for the purposes of the DTA between New Zealand and the United Kingdom, she is deemed to be a resident of the United Kingdom from the time the tenancy in the United Kingdom starts until it ends and Stacey returns to New Zealand. Explanation: Stacey is resident in New Zealand under s YD 1 because she has a permanent place of abode here. As noted above, it is assumed she is also resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom under the relevant United Kingdom legislation. The question of Stacey’s residence for the purposes of the DTA is resolved by the permanent home test. Stacey does not have a permanent home available in New Zealand because she and her partner have rented out their New Zealand home on arm’s length terms to tenants who are not associated with them or friends of theirs. Stacey has a permanent home in the United Kingdom as she has rented a house there for 15 months. Although Stacey’s stay in the United Kingdom is for a known and fixed duration, it is sufficiently long that it cannot be regarded as temporary. As Stacey has a permanent home in the United Kingdom and does not have one in New Zealand, she is deemed to be a resident of the United Kingdom for the purposes of the DTA from the time the tenancy in the United Kingdom starts until it ends and Stacey returns to New Zealand. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 69 of 133 Example | Tauira 20 – The permanent home, habitual abode, and personal and economic relations tests Facts: Luke owns a house in New Zealand and one in Malaysia. He has extensive business interests in both countries. Luke regularly spends short periods in New Zealand, and these add up to about 5 months of the year. Luke’s visits to New Zealand are primarily for business purposes, but he also spends time catching up with family here. Luke works and lives in Malaysia for the remainder of the time, where he also occupies positions of responsibility in the community. Luke is married, and his wife and children live in Malaysia. For the purposes of this example, it is assumed Luke is resident for tax purposes in Malaysia under the relevant Malaysian legislation. Result: Luke is resident in both New Zealand and Malaysia under the tax legislation of each country. However, for the purposes of the DTA between New Zealand and Malaysia, Luke is treated solely as a Malaysian resident. Explanation: Luke is resident in New Zealand under s YD 1 as he has a permanent place of abode here. As noted above, it is assumed he is also resident for tax purposes in Malaysia under the relevant Malaysian legislation. Luke has permanent homes available to him in both New Zealand and Malaysia because his houses in both countries are continuously available to him for use. As Luke has a permanent home available to him in both countries, the next question is whether he has a habitual abode in either country. (As noted at \[211\], the order of the tie-breaker tests in the DTA between New Zealand and Malaysia differs from that in New Zealand’s other DTAs. Under New Zealand’s other DTAs, if a person has a permanent home available in both countries, the personal and economic relations test is applied next.) Luke has a habitual abode in Malaysia because he habitually lives there for about 7 months of the year. Luke also has a habitual abode in New Zealand because he habitually spends about 5 months of the year here. The reasons for Luke’s stays in New Zealand (business and visiting family) suggest the stays are more than transient in nature. As Luke has a habitual abode in both New Zealand and Malaysia, it is necessary to determine whether his personal and economic relations are closer with Malaysia or with New Zealand. ( Again, note the difference in the order of the tie-breaker tests in the DTA between New Zealand and Malaysia compared to New Zealand’s other DTAs.) IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 70 of 133 Luke has close economic relations with both countries due to his extensive business interests in both countries. Luke also has personal relations with both countries. These personal relations are considered to be stronger with Malaysia, given that Luke’s wife and children live there and he is involved in the community there. Therefore, weighing up the circumstances as a whole, Luke’s personal and economic relations are closer with Malaysia. Therefore, Luke is treated solely as a Malaysian resident for the purposes of the DTA. Example | Tauira 21 – The permanent home test Facts: Megan, who normally resides in Canada, is seconded to New Zealand by her Canadian employer for 18 months. While in New Zealand, Megan works for the New Zealand subsidiary of her Canadian employer. While she is in New Zealand, Megan lets her house in Canada out for a fixed-term of 18 months. The tenant is not a friend of or associated with Megan. Megan lives in rented accommodation in New Zealand. Megan leaves most of her personal property in Canada, and most of her investments are in Canada. For the purposes of this example, it is assumed Megan is resident for tax purposes in Canada under the relevant Canadian legislation. Result: Megan is resident in both New Zealand and Canada under the tax legislation of each country. However, for the purposes of the DTA between New Zealand and Canada, Megan is deemed to be a resident only of New Zealand. Explanation: Megan is resident in New Zealand under s YD 1 as she is present here for more than 183 days in a 12-month period. As noted above, it is assumed she is also resident in Canada under the relevant Canadian legislation. Megan has a permanent home available to her in New Zealand as she has rented accommodation here for 18 months. Although Megan’s stay in New Zealand is for a known and fixed duration, it is sufficiently long that it cannot be regarded as temporary. Megan does not have a permanent home available to her in Canada as her house there is rented out on arm’s length terms to a tenant who is not associated with her or a friend of hers. As Megan has a permanent home available to her in New Zealand but not in Canada, she is deemed to be a resident only of New Zealand for the purposes of the DTA. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 71 of 133 Example | Tauira 22 – The permanent home and habitual abode tests Facts: Jonty grew up in South Africa, and moved to Canada with his parents when he was 16 (when his father was temporarily transferred there for work). After 3 years, his parents moved back to South Africa. By this time, Jonty had started university in Canada and decided to stay there. Jonty graduated and had been working in Canada for 2 years when he was offered a 2-year secondment to New Zealand by his Canadian employer. While in New Zealand, Jonty is employed by the New Zealand subsidiary of his Canadian employer. Jonty retains his bank accounts in Canada and opens new ones in New Zealand. He does not transfer his Canadian superannuation into his New Zealand superannuation fund, as he may return to Canada at the end of his secondment. Jonty lived in a rented flat in Canada, which he gave up when he moved to New Zealand. Jonty has to travel between Auckland and Wellington, on a roughly week-about basis, for work, and he lives in his employer’s serviced apartments in both cities. Jonty has very little personal property. What he does have he either brings with him to New Zealand or sells before leaving Canada. At the end of the 2-year secondment, Jonty’s position in New Zealand is extended for another 18 months. During the 3½ years Jonty lives in New Zealand, he returns to Canada once, for a 3- week holiday. For the purposes of this example, it is assumed Jonty is resident for tax purposes in Canada under the relevant Canadian legislation. Result: Jonty is resident in both New Zealand and Canada under the tax legislation of each country. However, for the purposes of the DTA between New Zealand and Canada, Jonty is deemed to be a resident only of New Zealand. Explanation: Jonty is resident in New Zealand under s YD 1 as he is personally present here for more than 183 days in a 12-month period. As noted above, it is assumed he is also resident for tax purposes in Canada under the relevant Canadian legislation. Jonty does not have a permanent home available to him in Canada because he gave up his rented flat there. Jonty does not have a permanent home available in New Zealand because his homes here (a series of serviced apartments) are not permanent. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 72 of 133 As Jonty does not have a permanent home available in either country, the question is whether Jonty has a habitual abode in either country. Jonty has a habitual abode in New Zealand because he habitually or normally lives here during the period of dual residence. The period of dual residence is sufficiently long that it is not necessary to look beyond that period to determine whether Jonty’s time in New Zealand is transient or of substance. It is apparent that for the 3½ years of dual residence Jonty has a habitual abode in New Zealand. Jonty clearly does not have a habitual abode in Canada during the period of dual residence – he returned there only once in that time, for a holiday of short duration. Consequently, Jonty is deemed to be a resident only of New Zealand for the purposes of the DTA. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 73 of 133 Part 2: Tax residence of companies Overview 236. Under s YD 2, a company is a New Zealand tax resident if:  it is incorporated in New Zealand;  its head office is in New Zealand;  its centre of management is in New Zealand; or  its directors, in their capacity as directors, exercise control of the company in New Zealand, even if the directors’ decision-making also occurs outside New Zealand. 237. A company may easily satisfy more than one, or even all, of these tests. Such a company is clearly resident in New Zealand. However, the tests are alternatives, and a company needs to satisfy only one of them to be tax resident here. 238. A “foreign company” is a company that is not tax resident in New Zealand and is not treated as tax resident in New Zealand under a DTA (s YA 1). There are different tests to determine the country in which a foreign company is treated as tax resident for the purposes of the “international tax rules” (as defined in s YA 1). This is discussed briefly from \[356\]. Company definition 239. “Company” is defined in s YA 1. The relevant definition for the purposes of the residence rules is: YA 1 Definitions In this Act, unless the context requires otherwise— ... company— (a) means a body corporate or other entity that has a legal existence separate from that of its members, whether it is incorporated or created in New Zealand or elsewhere: (ab) does not include a limited partnership, other than a listed limited partnership or foreign corporate limited partnership: (abb) does not include a look-through company, except in the PAYE rules, the FBT rules, the NRWT rules, the RWT rules, the ESCT rules, the RSCT rules, and for the purposes of subpart FO (Amalgamation of companies): IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 74 of 133 ... (b) includes a unit trust: (c) includes a group investment fund that is not a designated group investment fund, but only to the extent to which the fund results from investments made into it that are— (i) not from a designated source, as defined in section HR 3(5) (Definitions for section HR 2: group investment funds); and (ii) not made before 23 June 1983, including an amount treated as invested at that date under the definition of pre-1983 investment in section HR 3(8): (d) includes an airport operator: (e) includes a statutory producer board: (f) includes a society registered under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908: (g) includes a society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1908: (h) includes a friendly society: (i) includes a building society: ... 240. As the definition extends to any entity with a legal existence separate from that of its members, this includes a wide variety of entities established under the laws of other countries that, although not companies in the strict sense, are equivalent to companies. If any such entity satisfied any of the company residence tests in s YD 2, it would be a New Zealand tax resident company so would be liable for tax here on its worldwide income. 241. Usually a look-through company (LTC) is treated as being transparent, but for some tax purposes it is still treated as a company. For example, an LTC is not transparent for the purposes of the NRWT rules and the RWT rules. In those circumstances, the tax residence of the owners of the company is not relevant. This means someone paying passive income to an LTC that meets the requirements of subpart HB can assume they are making a payment to a New Zealand tax resident company and not to the owners of the company. The company can be assumed to be a New Zealand tax resident company because to qualify as an LTC in the first place the company needs to be a New Zealand tax resident under s YD 2 and any applicable DTA. Place of incorporation test 242. Section YD 2(1)(a) provides that a company is a New Zealand tax resident if it is incorporated in New Zealand. This is an objective and easily ascertainable test of corporate residence – a company is resident if it has been through a process of IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 75 of 133 incorporation in New Zealand. A company incorporated under the Companies Act 1993 is resident here. 243. The place of incorporation test obviously cannot apply to companies incapable of being incorporated. For example, there is no incorporation procedure for unit trusts in New Zealand, so they cannot be tax resident here under s YD 2(1)(a). However, companies that cannot be incorporated may be resident in New Zealand under one of the other tests in s YD 2. Head office test 244. Section YD 2(1)(b) provides that a company is a New Zealand tax resident if its head office is in New Zealand. 245. The word “office” is defined in The Oxford English Dictionary (online ed, 3 rd edition, Oxford University Press, 2013, accessed 20 August 2024) (relevantly) as meaning: office, n. 6.a. A room, set of rooms, or building used as a place of business for non-manual work; a room or department for clerical or administrative work. Also (in extended use): the staff of such a room, department, etc. 246. The Commissioner therefore considers that “office” in the context of the head office test means a physical place from where the business is conducted – a place where the administration and management (in the broadest sense) of a business is carried out. 247. The head office of a company is the office that is above all others – the place of administration and management that is superior to all others. It is the office from which the business of the company is directed and carried on. 248. An office is superior to other offices of the company if individuals working in those other offices are responsible to individuals located in that office. The focus of the test is therefore on a physical place, in the sense of a building, from which the company's overall operations are directed and carried on. 249. In determining whether a company has its head office in New Zealand the following factors may be relevant:  The location of senior management staff. If senior management operate from an office in New Zealand, this is a strong indicator that the New Zealand office is the company’s head office.  Where the major strategic and policy decisions are made. If individuals working in other offices act in accordance with decisions and policy made at a particular office, that office is likely to be the head office.  Whether specialised functions (for example, of an advisory nature) are carried out in a particular office. If several specialised functions are carried out in a particular IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 76 of 133 office this may indicate that the office is the head office, though the significance of this factor depends on the company’s overall structure.  Whether the staff of the company consider that an office is the head office. 250. Weighing up these factors should identify whether a company’s head office is in New Zealand. Usually, the location of a company’s head office will be certain. If a company is engaged in carrying on business activities, identifying the company’s highest office should not be difficult. An example where it could be more difficult is where a company is merely a passive investment vehicle. The passive nature of the company’s activities may make identifying its highest office difficult, or the company may simply have no office. Another example is where a senior team carries out the administration and management of the business from different offices and members meet virtually. Centre of management test Description of the test 251. Section YD 2(1)(c) provides that a company is a New Zealand tax resident if its centre of management is in New Zealand. The focus of the test is on the centre of management of the company as a whole, not the management of only part of a company’s operations. In determining where the centre of management of a company as a whole is, acts of management at various levels may be relevant (see: Vinelight Nominees Ltd and Weyand Investments Ltd v CIR \[2013\] NZCA 655). 252. The test is a de facto test – that is, the focus is on where the company’s centre of management is as a matter of fact (NZ Forest Products Finance NV v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,073 (HC) ). The test is not limited to consideration of the company’s formal management structures, such as those set out in corporate governance documents. The test focuses on how the company is managed in reality, even if that conflicts with the governance documents or formal structures. 253. Therefore, if the senior executives of a company established in a foreign country manage the company on the basis of instructions from persons located in New Zealand, without exercising their independent minds as to how the company should be managed, the centre of management of the company is in New Zealand rather than in the foreign country. This is the case even if the persons giving instructions from New Zealand are not officers of the company under the company’s constitution. That said, the fact there are persons who influence the decisions made by the executives managing a company, or who provide guidance to them, does not necessarily amount to de facto management of the company. It depends on whether those charged with the management of the company are in fact exercising that management function independently, not merely doing the bidding of others who are in reality managing the company. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 77 of 133 Centre of management of the entire company 254. The centre of management test focuses on the centre of management of the entire company. Therefore, if a company that operates in several countries has a centre of management in New Zealand, but that centre of management relates only to the company’s New Zealand operations, the company is not tax resident here under the centre of management test. 255. If management of a company is carried out by persons in different countries, it may be necessary to consider the functions carried out in each country to determine where the company’s centre of management is. 256. In some cases, multinational companies conduct business in New Zealand directly through a branch rather than through a locally established subsidiary. The local branch may have its own executives and, occasionally, its own board of directors. In this situation, although the company has significant links with New Zealand, it is not tax resident here under the centre of management test. The management of a branch does not constitute the centre of management of a company as a whole, only the centre of management of a part of the company. 257. On the other hand, companies incorporated outside New Zealand, that conduct operations outside New Zealand, may have their centre of management in New Zealand. Such companies are tax resident in New Zealand under the centre of management test despite their close connections with other countries. Comparison between the centre of management test and the head office test 258. It may well be that a company satisfies both the head office and centre of management tests, as the centre of management of a company is commonly located in its head office. However, the focus of the two tests is different. The head office test concentrates on a physical place (that is, on an office that constitutes a company’s highest office). By contrast, the focus of the centre of management test is not on identifying the quality of a particular office, but rather on the broader question of whether the company’s management is centred in New Zealand. A company does not need to have an office in New Zealand to satisfy the centre of management test. 259. A company may have no office (so obviously no head office) in New Zealand, but its centre of management may be here because the management decisions are effectively undertaken from New Zealand. In this situation, the company is tax resident under the centre of management test, even though the head office test is not satisfied. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 78 of 133 Director control test Description 260. Section YD 2(1)(d) provides that a company is a New Zealand tax resident if its directors, in their capacity as directors, exercise control of the company in New Zealand. A company that satisfies this test is resident whether or not the directors’ decision-making is confined to New Zealand. Definition of director 261. The relevant definition of “director” in s YA 1 provides that: YA 1 Definitions In this Act, unless the context requires otherwise— ... director— (a) means— (i) a person occupying the position of director, whatever title is used: (ii) a person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the persons occupying the position of directors of a company are accustomed to act: (iii) a person treated as being a director by any other provision of this Act: (iv) in the case of an entity that does not have directors and that is treated as, or assumed to be, a company by a provision of this Act, any trustee, manager, or other person who acts in relation to the entity in the same way as a director would act, or in a similar way to that in which a director would act, were the entity a company incorporated in New Zealand under the Companies Act 1993: ... 262. This extended definition of director ensures de facto directors are included when considering whether a company is a New Zealand tax resident under the director control test. Persons carrying out director’s duties 263. A person is treated as a director if they occupy the position of director, whether or not that title is used. That is, any person carrying out the duties of a director is a director. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 79 of 133 Persons giving directions or instructions to nominated directors 264. A person is also treated as a director if those occupying the position of directors of a company are accustomed to act in accordance with the person’s directions or instructions. For example, if the directors of a company incorporated in Hong Kong are accustomed to act in accordance with instructions from a New Zealand resident individual, that individual would be a director of the company. The company may therefore potentially be a New Zealand tax resident under the director control test, as control of the company by a director is exercised from here. The discussion from \[283\] explains the considerations to have regard to when there is exercise of directorial control both in New Zealand and elsewhere. 265. In practical terms, it is necessary to consider a pattern of decision-making to determine whether the nominated directors are accustomed to act in accordance with another person’s directions or instructions (whether formal or otherwise). 266. The Commissioner considers that the directions or instructions do not need to be given directly to the persons occupying the position of directors. For example, where a chain of companies has directors who are accustomed to act in accordance with the directions or instructions of another person, the chain must be traced through to establish on whose directions or instructions the directors are accustomed to act. That person will be considered a director under the Act. For example, if the directors of company X are accustomed to act under instructions from the directors of company Y, and the directors of company Y act under instructions from a New Zealand resident A, then A is a director of both X and Y under the definition of director in s YA 1. Companies without conventional directors 267. The definition of director in the Act extends to entities that do not have directors in the conventional sense. In the case of an entity that is treated as or assumed to be a company under the Act, a person who acts in the same way or a similar way as a director would act is treated as a director. A person falls within this part of the definition if they are involved in making the types of decisions a director of a company would normally make. These decisions would include major strategic and policy decisions. 268. Therefore, the manager of a unit trust is a director because they are involved in making the major decisions in relation to the unit trust (for example, the decisions in relation to the management of the unit trust’s investments, the marketing of interests in the unit trust, and the distribution policy of the unit trust). If the manager exercises control of the unit trust from New Zealand, the unit trust is a New Zealand tax resident. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 80 of 133 Companies as directors 269. The definition of director in the Act is broad enough to encompass both natural persons and companies that are appointed as or that act as directors. This may result in a company that is a New Zealand tax resident being treated as a director of a company established in another jurisdiction (see Example | Tauira 23). This could be relevant in considering whether directorial control of the foreign company is exercised in New Zealand. Control by directors 270. The director control test focuses on where the directors exercise their directorial control of the company from – that is, the place from which the strategic and policy decisions are made. A company is resident in New Zealand under this test if directors are effectively controlling the company from New Zealand – that is, if the central and directing mind of the company is here. 271. The test is satisfied only if directors acting in their capacity as directors exercise control from New Zealand. If directors control a company from New Zealand in their capacity as shareholders, but not in their capacity as directors, the company is not tax resident here under the director control test. De facto test 272. The director control test is satisfied if control of a company is exercised in New Zealand, whether or not decision-making by directors is confined to New Zealand. The test is one of de facto control – that is, the question is whether control of the company by directors is actually exercised from New Zealand. 273. Directors may exercise control of a company in several ways. For example, control may be exercised through:  decisions made during formal directors’ meetings;  decisions made during a telephone call or video conference between directors;  the signing of resolutions outside directors’ meetings; or  informal decisions made by directors, acting in their capacity as directors, outside the course of the directors’ meetings. 274. The method by which directors exercise control of a company may vary considerably from case to case. Each case must be considered on its facts to determine the place from which the directors actually exercise control of the company. 275. The significance of the location of directors’ meetings will vary from case to case. If directors exercise control only during directors’ meetings, then the location of the IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 81 of 133 meetings is of paramount importance. On the other hand, if control is exercised outside of directors’ meetings, and the meetings are merely to formalise decisions that have already been made, the location of the meetings is of little significance. 276. The fact directors of a company exercise directorial functions from New Zealand does not necessarily mean control of the company by its directors is exercised from New Zealand. For example, if the directors ordinarily exercise their powers during directors’ meetings in Australia, the fact New Zealand directors occasionally sign resolutions in New Zealand or occasionally participate in online meetings from New Zealand does not mean the directors are exercising control of the company from New Zealand. See Case 11/2011 (2011) 25 NZTC 1-011 (TRA) . All of the circumstances would be relevant to consider in terms of what is ordinarily the case. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a relevant consideration was travel restrictions that resulted in directors exercising their functions from New Zealand when that would not ordinarily be the case or would not ordinarily be the case to the extent it was during that period. 277. If the nominated directors do not exercise control of a company, but rather de facto directors exercise control from New Zealand, the company is resident in New Zealand even though the de facto directors are not directors under the company’s constitution. 278. Determining whether the nominated directors exercise true control requires consideration of how the company is, in reality, controlled. The fact the nominated directors may be accustomed to act in accordance with the directions or instructions of another person does not necessarily mean they are not exercising true control of the company. However, it means the person in accordance with whose directions or instructions they are accustomed to act would also be a director under the definition in s YA 1. If the nominated directors exercise their independent minds in undertaking their directorial functions, rather than acting as mere pawns or “rubber stamping” others’ decisions, they are exercising true control of the company. 279. In considering whether the nominated directors are truly exercising directorial control, the remuneration provided to them may be a relevant consideration. If their remuneration does not reflect their apparent duties and responsibilities, the nominated directors may not be carrying the burden of decision-making responsibility. It is also appropriate to consider who the nominated directors are. In tax havens, for example, directors commonly have several hundred directorships. Such a situation may suggest the directors are not actively involved in making decisions, and that their directorial functions are exercised in accordance with outside instructions without the independent thought required for them to be considered to be exercising true control of the company. The circumstances of the exercise of the directorial functions need to be considered closely to determine whether the nominated directors are in fact exercising the directorial function independently or merely doing the bidding of others who are in reality controlling the company. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 82 of 133 Distinction between de facto control, influence and the provision of services 280. In practice, it may be difficult to determine whether the nominated directors of a company are acting under directions or instructions from another person or are merely influenced but not controlled by another person. A majority shareholder, for example a parent company, normally influences to some extent the actions of the company in which it is a shareholder. However, if the majority shareholder exercises only the powers that such a shareholder would have in general meetings — for example, to appoint and dismiss members of the board, and to approve and initiate changes to the financial structure of the company — that shareholder is not controlling the company in terms of the director control test. 281. By contrast, if the majority shareholder assumes the functions of the company’s board, or if that board merely rubber-stamps decisions made by the majority shareholder without independent consideration being given to the decisions, the majority shareholder is a director of the company under the definition in the Act. This is consistent with the common law approach (see, for example, Unit Construction Co Ltd v Bullock \[1959\] 3 All ER 831 (HL)). If this is the case and if the majority shareholder exercises control of the company from New Zealand, the company is resident here under the director control test. In considering whether someone has de facto control over a company, the degree of autonomy exercised by the members of the company’s board in relation to matters such as investment, production, marketing, finance and procurement must be considered. If the board cannot make decisions about matters of this type without prior approval from the majority shareholder, then the majority shareholder is likely to be in de facto control of the company. 282. In relation to companies that are subsidiaries, the de facto exercise of control by the parent company must be distinguished from the mere provision of advisory services. Often, large corporate organisations establish centralised advisory departments to provide administrative, financial, accounting, and other services for companies that are members of the organisation. When a parent company provides services of this nature to a subsidiary, it is not in control of the subsidiary under the director control test merely because of the provision of those services. Exercise of powers in New Zealand and in another country 283. In cases where a company has both New Zealand and foreign directors, the functions performed by the New Zealand directors from New Zealand must be considered to determine whether they constitute the exercise of control of the company by its directors from New Zealand. If the powers of all directors are equal, the issue may be resolved by simply looking to where the majority exercise their control. For example, if a company has directors with equal powers, three of whom live in Australia and two in New Zealand, and control is exercised through directors’ meetings held in Australia IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 83 of 133 and through occasional video meetings between the Australian and New Zealand directors, the company is not tax resident in New Zealand under the director control test. In these circumstances, when the directors exercise their powers concurrently from New Zealand and Australia, the majority of the directors are located in Australia. Consequently, on a simple majority approach, control of the company by its directors is not exercised from New Zealand. 284. However, a simple majority approach is not appropriate where any of the directors have exclusive special powers that enable them to control the company. Nor is it appropriate where any of the directors are otherwise in de facto control of the company, for example, because the other directors are merely nominees. In these circumstances, it is necessary to determine whether the controlling directors exercise control of the company from New Zealand. Tax residence of directors 285. The tax residence status of a company’s directors is not relevant in determining whether the director control test has been satisfied. The focus of the test is on whether the directors exercise control of the company from New Zealand. In cases where the simple majority approach outlined at \[283\] is appropriate, the question is not whether a simple majority of the directors are tax resident in New Zealand but rather whether a simple majority of the directors exercise their directorial powers from New Zealand. Continuing test 286. The director control test is satisfied if the directors exercise control of a company from New Zealand on a continuing basis. If control is ordinarily exercised from New Zealand, but is occasionally exercised from outside New Zealand, the company is tax resident in New Zealand on the basis that the directors exercise control from here. Control of the entire company 287. A company is not tax resident here under the director control test unless the control exercised by directors from New Zealand is control of the company as a whole. Therefore, if New Zealand directors exercise control only in relation to the New Zealand operations of the company, and directors elsewhere exercise control of the company as a whole, the company is not tax resident here under the director control test. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 84 of 133 Comparison between the director control test and the head office and centre of management tests 288. The centre of management test focuses on the management of the company as a whole. Acts of management at various levels may be relevant to determining where the centre of management is. This differs from the director control test, which concentrates on the directorial control of the company – that is, the place from which the strategic and policy decisions are made. In some cases, there may not be a clear distinction between aspects of the management of the company and the directorial decision making and control, because, for example, the directors are involved in managing the company. 289. The head office of a company may also be the place from which the directors exercise control of the company. However, the two tests are different in nature. The head office test focuses on a physical place – that is, on the office from which the business of the company is directed and carried on. In contrast, the director control test looks to the place from which the directors ultimately control the company. Examples illustrating the company tax residence tests Example | Tauira 23 – Company tax resident under the director control test Facts: Company A is incorporated in Hong Kong and carries on a business manufacturing clothes there. Company A’s operations are all managed from Hong Kong. Company A has no office in New Zealand. All meetings of the board of directors are held in Hong Kong, but the Hong Kong directors always act on the instructions of Company A’s New Zealand parent company, and unquestioningly implement the decisions the parent company makes. Result: Company A is tax resident in New Zealand under the director control test. Explanation: Company A is incorporated in Hong Kong, so is not tax resident in New Zealand under the incorporation test. The centre of Company A’s operations is in Hong Kong, and Company A has its centre of management there. Company A has no office in New Zealand. Therefore, Company A is not tax resident in New Zealand under either the head office test or the centre of management test. The Hong Kong directors of Company A act on the instructions of the New Zealand parent company. Therefore, the New Zealand parent is a director of Company A (under para (a)(ii) of the definition of “director” in s YA (1)). The New Zealand parent is exercising de facto control of Company A, because the Hong Kong directors implement the decisions of the parent company without question. The Hong Kong directors are IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 85 of 133 not exercising true directorial control of Company A. Company A is tax resident in New Zealand because the parent company is a director of Company A and exercises directorial control of Company A from New Zealand. The Hong Kong directors of Company A do not exercise true directorial control, so this is not a situation where it is necessary to weigh up the level of control exercised from New Zealand and from elsewhere. Example | Tauira 24 – Company not tax resident in New Zealand Facts: Company B is a holding company incorporated in Singapore. Company B has an office in Singapore and its operations are managed from this office. Company B has no office in New Zealand. Company B has five directors – three live in Australia and two in New Zealand. The powers of the directors are equal. The board of directors meets 6-monthly in Singapore to review decisions made by its subsidiaries. The directors regularly hold video meetings to discuss issues, and investment decisions are made during these meetings. Result: Company B is not tax resident in New Zealand. Explanation: Company B is incorporated in Singapore, so is not tax resident in New Zealand under the incorporation test. Company B has no office in New Zealand, so is not tax resident here under the head office test. Company B is managed from Singapore, so has its centre of management in Singapore rather than in New Zealand. Although the board of directors meets only in Singapore, control of the company is also exercised outside the board meetings during the video meetings between the New Zealand and Australian directors. Therefore, the New Zealand directors occasionally exercise their directorial functions from New Zealand. However, as the powers of each director are equal, Company B is not controlled by its directors from New Zealand, as the majority of directors are in Australia. Therefore, Company B is not tax resident in New Zealand under the director control test. Example | Tauira 25 – Company not tax resident in New Zealand Facts: Company C is an Australian incorporated bank. Company C conducts business in New Zealand through a branch. The New Zealand branch has its own executives and board of directors who operate from the bank’s Wellington office. The worldwide operations of Company C are conducted from the Australian office, and all the major IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 86 of 133 decisions concerning Company C are made by the Australian directors in Australia. The New Zealand executives and board are responsible only for managing Company C’s New Zealand operations. Result: Company C is not tax resident in New Zealand. Explanation: Company C is incorporated in Australia, so is not tax resident in New Zealand under the incorporation test. Company C’s head office is not in New Zealand. The Wellington office is the company’s highest New Zealand office, but it is not the highest office of the company as a whole. Company C’s Australian office is its head office. The centre of Company C’s management is in Australia. The New Zealand branch management is responsible only for managing Company C’s New Zealand operations. Therefore, Company C does not have its centre of management in New Zealand. The Australian directors exercise control of Company C from Australia. The director control test is satisfied only if the directors exercise control of the company as a whole in New Zealand. However, in this case the control exercised by the New Zealand directors relates only to Company C’s New Zealand branch. Therefore, Company C is not tax resident in New Zealand by virtue of the director control test. Example | Tauira 26 – Unit trust tax resident in New Zealand under the director control test Facts: D is a unit trust. D invests primarily in shares issued by New Zealand and overseas publicly listed companies. The manager of D is a New Zealand incorporated company. The manager makes all major decisions relating to marketing interests in D, investments, distributions, and so on. These decisions are all made from New Zealand. Result: D is a company under the extended definition of “company” in the Act. D is tax resident in New Zealand under the director control test. Explanation: D is not incorporated. Therefore, the incorporation test is not applicable. The fact D’s manager is incorporated in New Zealand is irrelevant to D’s tax residence status. D’s manager is a director of D under para (a)(iv) of the extended definition of “director” in s YA 1 because D’s manager acts in the same way a director of a company incorporated under the Companies Act 1993 would act – that is, it makes all the major decisions in relation to investments. The manager exercises control from New Zealand. Therefore, D is tax resident in New Zealand because its director exercises control of D from New Zealand. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 87 of 133 Example | Tauira 27 – Company tax resident in New Zealand under the head office and centre of management tests Facts: Company E is incorporated in Australia and is a 100% owned subsidiary of an Australian company. The Australian parent is in the business of manufacturing several products. Company E’s business mainly involves the marketing of those products in New Zealand. The management of Company E takes place from its Auckland office. Company E does not have an office in Australia, but it has several branch offices in New Zealand outside Auckland. The overall strategic control of the company by its directors is exercised from Australia. Result: Company E is tax resident in New Zealand under the head office and centre of management tests. Explanation: Company E is not tax resident in New Zealand under the director control test because its directors exercise control from Australia. Company E’s Auckland office constitutes its head office because it is the office from which the business of the company is managed and carried on. Therefore, Company E is tax resident in New Zealand under the head office test. The management of Company E takes place from the Auckland office. Therefore, Company E is also tax resident in New Zealand because its centre of management is here. Example | Tauira 28 – Companies tax resident in New Zealand under the director control test Facts: Company F is a company incorporated in the Cook Islands, and is used as a financing vehicle for a group of companies based in New Zealand. Company G, which is also incorporated in the Cook Islands, is the sole nominated director of Company F. With respect to the affairs of both Company F and Company G, the directors of Company G act on instructions received from a New Zealand resident company (NZ Co) that is a member of the group, without discussing or considering those instructions. Both Company F and Company G are managed from the Cook Islands. Neither Company F nor Company G has an office in New Zealand. Result: Both Company F and Company G are tax resident in New Zealand under the director control test. Explanation: Company F and Company G are both incorporated in the Cook Islands. Therefore, they are not tax resident in New Zealand under the incorporation test. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 88 of 133 Company F and Company G are both managed from the Cook Islands. Therefore, they are not tax resident in New Zealand under the centre of management test. Further, as neither Company F nor Company G has an office in New Zealand, neither is tax resident here under the head office test. The nominated directors of Company G act in accordance with instructions from NZ Co in relation to Company G’s affairs. Therefore, NZ Co is a director of Company G. NZ Co exercises de facto control of Company G because the directors of Company G act on NZ Co’s instructions without discussing or considering those instructions. The directors of Company G are not exercising true directorial control of Company G. As NZ Co exercises control of Company G from New Zealand, Company G is tax resident here under the director control test. The nominated director of Company F (that is, Company G) acts in accordance with instructions from the nominated directors of Company G, who in turn act in accordance with instructions from NZ Co. Therefore, the nominated director of Company F acts in accordance with instructions from NZ Co, making NZ Co a director of Company F. NZ Co exercises de facto control of Company F because the directors of Company G (which is the director of Company F) act on NZ Co’s instructions with respect to the affairs of Company F (as with the affairs of Company G) without discussing or considering those instructions. Company G, the nominated director of Company F, is not exercising true directorial control. Company F is tax resident in New Zealand because NZ Co is a director of Company F and exercises directorial control of Company F from New Zealand. Company G does not exercise true directorial control, so this is not a situation where it is necessary to weigh up the level of control exercised from New Zealand and from elsewhere. Example | Tauira 29 – Foreign-incorporated, sole-director personal services company, not tax resident in New Zealand Facts: Company H is incorporated in the United States of America. It is a personal services company through which Hugh, who works in the film industry, contracts. Hugh is the sole director of Company H. Company H secures a 12-month contract to provide services in New Zealand for a film being made here. Company H has no office in New Zealand. There are no directorial decisions or acts of management of the company as a whole made during the period of the contract, while Hugh is in New Zealand. Any control or management decisions made from New Zealand during the period of the contract relate only to the New Zealand operations of the company. Result: Company H is not tax resident in New Zealand. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 89 of 133 Explanation: Company H is incorporated in the United States of America, so is not tax resident in New Zealand under the incorporation test. Company H is not tax resident under the head office test, as it does not have an office in New Zealand, so cannot have its head office here. Company H is not tax resident under either the centre of management test or the director control test, as there are no directorial decisions or acts of management relating to the company as a whole made in New Zealand during the period of the contract. Any control or management decisions made from New Zealand during the period of the contract relate only to the New Zealand operations of the company. Company H is a non-resident contractor. For information about the withholding tax obligations in relation to non-resident contractors see Inland Revenue’s website (Non- resident contractors) and IS 10/04: Non-resident contractor schedular payments. Changes in company tax residence 290. As a company will be tax resident in New Zealand if it has its head office or centre of management here or its directors exercise control of the company here, a company’s tax residence may change if the location of its head office, centre of management or place of directorial control changes. For example, a company that is resident in New Zealand under the centre of management test may cease to be resident here if it moves its centre of management to Australia, or a company that is not resident in New Zealand may become resident here if it shifts its head office here. A company may also transfer its place of incorporation from New Zealand to overseas. 291. Some of the more significant income tax consequences that may arise when the tax residence of a company changes between New Zealand and another country are set out from \[292\] to \[315\]. A change in tax residence may also have implications for the application of a DTA. Further, if a company is a settlor or beneficiary of a trust and its residence status changes there may be tax implications – see from \[431\]. Company migration rules 292. A company that ceases to be a New Zealand tax resident is an “emigrating company”, and under the company migration rules it is treated for tax purposes as if, immediately before emigrating, it had disposed of its property at market value, liquidated, and distributed the full amount available for distribution as dividends (s FL 1). IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 90 of 133 Taxation of foreign-sourced income 293. A company is assessable for income tax on foreign-sourced income it derives while tax resident in New Zealand (s BD 1(5)(c)). In the case of a change in tax residence, therefore, the foreign-sourced income a company derived while it was tax resident in New Zealand must be calculated or a reasonable apportionment of the total foreign- sourced income must be made to the periods of residence and non-residence. Company imputation 294. A company that is tax resident in New Zealand is generally required to establish and maintain an imputation credit account (ICA) (s OB 1). Such a company is known as an “ICA company” (defined in s YA 1). Some companies are specifically excluded from being ICA companies – see \[340\]. 295. A company that is tax resident in Australia may, in some circumstances, elect to establish and maintain an ICA in New Zealand (s OB 2). Such a company is known as an “Australian ICA company” (see para (a) of the definition in s YA 1). Otherwise, companies that are not tax resident in New Zealand are not permitted to establish an ICA. 296. If a company that is tax resident in New Zealand under domestic law stops being a company that is required by s OB 1 to maintain an ICA because its tax residence tie- breaks to Australia under the DTA between New Zealand and Australia, the company continues to be required to maintain an ICA (see s OB 2(3B)). Such a company is also an Australian ICA company (see para (b) of the definition of “Australian ICA company” in s YA 1). 297. Australian ICA companies also fall within the definition of ICA company. 298. A company that becomes tax resident in New Zealand during an imputation year:  needs to establish and maintain an ICA; and  is not entitled to credit to its ICA any income tax paid in respect of income derived when it was resident outside New Zealand (s OB 4(3)(b)). 299. A company that ceases to be tax resident in New Zealand during an imputation year:  loses the right to maintain an ICA (unless it becomes an Australian ICA company); and  is required to debit its ICA by the amount of any credit existing in the account immediately before the company stopped being an ICA company (that is, when it ceased being resident) (s OB 56), or to pay further income tax for a debit balance in its ICA when it ceased being an ICA company (s OB 66). IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 91 of 133 300. A company that ceases to be an ICA company is also required to furnish an annual ICA return within 2 months from the day on which it ceased to be an ICA company (s 70(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). Controlled foreign company regime 301. A change of tax residence between New Zealand and another country may also have implications in relation to the CFC regime. Under s EX 24(1), when a company becomes a “foreign company” (being a company that is not tax resident in New Zealand or is treated as not tax resident in New Zealand under a DTA) a new accounting period of the company starts on that day. The result is that if the company becomes a CFC because of its change in tax residence, only income derived after the company became a CFC is attributed under the CFC regime to tax residents holding interests in the company. 302. In the converse situation, a new accounting period starts on the day when a company ceases to be a foreign company (s EX 24(2)). The effect is that if the company was a CFC before it ceased to be a foreign company, only income derived before the company ceased to be a foreign company is attributed to tax residents under the CFC regime. The financial arrangements rules 303. When a company becomes a New Zealand tax resident during an income year and the company is a party to a financial arrangement, the company may become subject to the FA rules. Note, it may be that the company was already within the FA rules because prior to becoming a New Zealand tax resident it carried on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment and was a party to a financial arrangement for the purposes of that business. 304. Where a company enters the FA rules as a result of becoming a tax resident in New Zealand, the company is treated as having:  assumed the accrued obligation to pay consideration under the financial arrangement immediately after the time at which it became tax resident; and  paid the market value that a contract to assume the obligation had at that time (s EW 37(2)). 305. The deemed acquisition price will then be taken into account in any subsequent base price adjustment required under s EW 29. 306. To the extent that the exemption from the FA rules for non-residents (s EW 9) previously applied, that exemption ceases to apply when the company becomes tax resident. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 92 of 133 307. When a company ceases to be tax resident in New Zealand and the company is a party to a financial arrangement, generally it must calculate a base price adjustment for the financial arrangement as at the date of ceasing to be resident (s EW 29). If the base price adjustment is positive, it is income derived by the company in the year for which the calculation is made (s EW 31(3)). If the base price adjustment is negative, it is expenditure incurred by the company in the year for which the calculation is made, and a deduction is allowed for that expenditure (s EW 31(4)). 308. Two exceptions to this may be relevant:  If a cash basis person ceases to be a New Zealand tax resident before the first day of the fourth income year following the income year in which they first became a New Zealand tax resident, they do not need to calculate a base price adjustment for a financial arrangement they were a party to both before becoming and after ceasing to be a New Zealand tax resident (s EW 30(1)).  A party to a financial arrangement who ceases to be a New Zealand tax resident does not need to calculate a base price adjustment for a financial arrangement to the extent to which the arrangement relates to a business the party carries on through a fixed establishment in New Zealand (s EW 30(2)). 309. When a company ceases to be a New Zealand tax resident, the FA rules cease to apply to the company except to the extent to which the company is a party to a financial arrangement for the purpose of a business carried on through a fixed establishment in New Zealand (s EW 9). Grouping of losses 310. A change in tax residence between New Zealand and another country may also affect the grouping of tax losses under subpart IC. 311. Historically, for a company to be able to make its tax losses available to another company in the group, the company with the losses had to (among other things) meet certain tax residence requirements. In particular, the company could not group losses if it was:  treated as not being tax resident in New Zealand under a DTA for the purposes of the DTA; or  liable to income tax in another country because of domicile, residence, or place of incorporation. 312. Those tax residence requirements were repealed with effect on 15 March 2017. As a result, a company that is both New Zealand tax resident and tax resident in another jurisdiction may be able to offset its losses against the profits of another company in the same group of companies for New Zealand tax purposes. The company still needs IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 93 of 133 to satisfy other requirements, including that for the commonality period it is either incorporated in New Zealand or carrying on a business through a fixed establishment in New Zealand (see ss IC 5 and IC 7). 313. The historical residence requirements are still relevant for a commonality period that started before 15 March 2017 and continued after 15 March 2017, for losses incurred after the 1990–91 tax year. In that situation, the historical tax residence requirements would apply up to 15 March 2017 and cease from that date. As such, a dual resident company may offset a tax loss that arose before 15 March 2017 (so long as it was incurred after the 1990–91 tax year), provided the period of dual residence started after 15 March 2017. (See ss IC 5(8) and IZ 7B.) 314. Losses not available for grouping may be available for carry forward under s IA 3. Provisional tax 315. When a company becomes a New Zealand tax resident during an income year it may become a provisional taxpayer that is subject to the provisional tax regime contained in subpart RC. When a company ceases to be a New Zealand tax resident it may cease to be a provisional taxpayer (s RC 3). Dual tax resident companies Dual tax residence 316. A company may be tax resident in both New Zealand under s YD 2 and in another country under the domestic tax law of that country. Dual residence has several implications in relation to the application of the Act and New Zealand’s DTAs. 317. For income tax purposes, dual tax residence has implications in the following areas: imputation, the dividend withholding payment regime, the CFC and FIF regimes, and the grouping of losses. Dual tax residence and double taxation agreements 318. Double taxation may arise where a company is tax resident in both New Zealand and another country if each country taxes the worldwide income of the company. This double taxation may be resolved where there is a DTA between New Zealand and the other country. General position 319. If there is a DTA, it generally allocates tax residence to one of the countries for the purposes of the DTA. In determining the treatment of income covered by the DTA, the IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 94 of 133 company is then treated as being tax resident in only the country to which tax residence has been allocated. This gives that country the primary taxing right, so reduces the incidence of double taxation. 320. Where a New Zealand tax resident company (under s YD 2) is deemed to be tax resident in another country for the purposes of a DTA, New Zealand’s right to tax foreign-sourced income may be restricted and limitations may be imposed on New Zealand’s right to tax New Zealand–sourced income. The company remains liable to New Zealand income tax on income treated (under s YD 4) as having a source in New Zealand (s BD 1(5)). However, the liability is modified by any restrictions the DTA imposes on New Zealand’s right to tax persons who are deemed to be resident in the other country for the purposes of the DTA. Therefore, the tax residence rules in s YD 2 cannot always be read in isolation. When a company satisfies the domestic tax residence requirements in both New Zealand and another country, the impact of the DTA (if there is one) must be considered. 321. New Zealand’s DTAs contain different rules for allocating company tax residence for DTA purposes. These rules do not apply for non-DTA purposes. Under these rules, which vary from one DTA to another, residence may be allocated according to the company’s “place of effective management”, its “day-to-day management”, the “centre of its administrative or practical management” or the location of its “head office”. Under some of New Zealand’s DTAs it may fall to the competent authorities of the Contracting States to settle the question by mutual agreement (in some instances with regard to specified factors). Note: DTAs may be modified by the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting – the multilateral Instrument (the MLI ). See from \[325\]. 322. As noted at \[202\] in relation to individuals, if a DTA between New Zealand and another country uses the wording of a particular article in the OECD Model Convention (or very similar wording), the Commissioner considers it can be inferred that the OECD commentary on that article reflects the meaning the parties intended to be given to any undefined terms in that article. In such circumstances the OECD commentary is a significant aid to interpreting the relevant undefined terms. In such a case, the Commissioner considers that the context requires the meaning of the undefined terms to be considered without reference to any meaning those terms may have under domestic law. 323. There is only one residence tie-breaker test for dual-resident non-individuals in the OECD Model Convention. That tie-breaker allocates residence, for DTA purposes, to the state in which the person’s “place of effective management” is situated. Where IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 95 of 133 New Zealand’s DTAs adopt this test, the Commissioner considers that reference should be made to the OECD commentary on the meaning of this term. 324. Where New Zealand’s DTAs adopt residence allocation tests for non-individuals other than place of effective management, it may be necessary to have recourse to the domestic law meaning (if any) of any undefined term in that test. If the DTA is modified by the MLI 325. As noted at \[321\], the relevant DTA may be modified by the MLI. If the other country has ratified the MLI, the MLI positions of New Zealand and the other country need to be considered. 326. If the MLI applies to modify the residence article in respect of companies (generally art 4(3) of New Zealand’s DTAs), the competent authorities of both countries must endeavour to determine the company’s residence by mutual agreement having regard to “its place of effective management, the place where it is incorporated or otherwise constituted and any other relevant factors”. 327. To obtain a determination of residence by the competent authorities under the above conventions, an application is required 23 (see Tax treaties: Australia o n Inland Revenue’s tax policy website). 328. If the authorities cannot agree, or no application has been made, the company is not entitled to access the reliefs and exemptions available under the DTA, except as the competent authorities agree. 329. Note that art 4 of the MLI does not affect existing provisions of a “covered tax agreement” (defined in art 2 of the MLI) that deal with the tax residence of a company that is participating in a dual-listed company arrangement (see art 4(2)). This means it will not affect (for example) paras 5 and 6 of art 4 of the Australia–New Zealand DTA. New Zealand and Australia’s administrative approach to article 4 of the MLI 330. New Zealand and Australia have agreed a joint administrative approach to art 4 of the MLI. This approach was agreed as a measured risk-based approach to provide certainty and minimise compliance costs for taxpayers. It was agreed against the backdrop of the single economic market agenda between Australia and New Zealand, which seeks to create a seamless trans-Tasman business environment, and the fact the respective tax systems and administrations are comparable and both countries are committed to adopting measures to address risks associated with base erosion and profit shifting. 23 Other than in the case of some Australian–New Zealand dual resident companies – see from \[330\]. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 96 of 133 331. In short, under the administrative approach, if an eligible taxpayer reasonably self- determines its place of effective management to be located in:  A ustralia, it is deemed to be a resident of Australia for the purposes of the Australia–New Zealand DTA; and  New Zealand, it is deemed to be a resident of New Zealand for the purposes of the Australia–New Zealand DTA. 332. Eligibility criteria must be met for a taxpayer to use the administrative approach, including that:  the taxpayer is an ordinary company incorporated under the Companies Act 1993 (in New Zealand) or the Corporations Act 2001 (in Australia);  the taxpayer’s group annual accounting income is less than 250 million AUD or 260 million NZD for the most recent reporting period; and  the taxpayer's gross passive income is less than 20% of its total assessable income for the most recent income tax year. 333. There are also eligibility criteria in relation to the taxpayer or any member of the group not being subject to certain compliance activity. 334. If the administrative approach is used, there are conditions that must be satisfied on an ongoing basis, relating to:  the taxpayer and members of the group not being involved in certain tax avoidance and other arrangements; and  the taxpayer notifying the relevant revenue authority, in the event of new compliance activity, that the administrative approach has been used to determine tax residence for DTA purposes. 335. If there is a material change, the taxpayer must re-assess their eligibility, and approach either competent authority if the administrative approach no longer applies to their circumstances. 336. The full details of the eligibility criteria and on-going conditions are on Inland Revenue’s website: Australia and New Zealand's administrative approach to MLI Article 4(1) . 337. If a taxpayer is uncertain whether they satisfy the eligibility criteria or uncertain as to the self-determination of their place of effective management, it is recommended they engage with either competent authority about their circumstances. 338. If a taxpayer does not meet the eligibility criteria to use the administrative approach, an application will need to be lodged. See Tax treaties: Australia o n Inland Revenue’s tax policy website. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 97 of 133 Dual tax residence and imputation 339. Section OB 1 provides that, subject to several exclusions, a company that is tax resident in New Zealand must establish and maintain an ICA for each tax year. ICA companies may attach imputation credits to dividends they pay (s OB 60). 340. Several categories of company are excluded from being ICA companies and, therefore, from passing on imputation credits to their shareholders (s OB 1(2)). Among these are companies that are tax resident in New Zealand but are treated as not being tax resident in New Zealand under a DTA. To ensure dual resident companies cannot be used to undermine the international tax regime by obtaining the benefit of the imputation regime even though treated as not resident here, companies in this category cannot pass on imputation credits. 341. As discussed at \[296\], there is an exception to this for companies that cease to be required by s OB 1 to maintain an ICA because their tax residence tie-breaks to Australia under the Australia–New Zealand DTA. In this situation, the company continues to be required to maintain an ICA. Dual tax residence and the controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund regimes 342. The CFC and FIF regimes are in subpart EX. When a tax resident has an interest in a CFC, income and losses of the CFC may be attributed to the tax resident for income tax purposes. When a tax resident has an interest in a FIF, the annual change in value of the interest is taken into account for income tax purposes. 343. The CFC and FIF regimes both apply in relation to foreign companies. A foreign company is one that is not tax resident in New Zealand, or is treated under a DTA as not being tax resident in New Zealand. As such, companies that are dual resident under domestic law, but treated as tax resident outside of New Zealand for DTA purposes, may be brought within the CFC and FIF regimes. In the case of the CFC regime, this occurs if the closely held ownership test is satisfied. In the case of the FIF regime, it occurs if none of the exemptions applies. 24 This ensures dual resident companies cannot be structured with a view to defeating the CFC and FIF regimes. Dual tax residence and the grouping of losses 344. Section IA 3(2) allows companies within the same group of companies to group their income and losses (see also subpart IC, and the definition of “group of companies” in s IC 3). 24 See ss EX 31 to EX 43. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 98 of 133 345. As discussed from \[310\], historically one of the requirements for this was that the company with the available losses must meet certain tax residence requirements, including that it not be treated as non-tax resident in New Zealand under a DTA and that it not be liable by the law of another country or territory to income tax there through domicile, residence, or place of incorporation. Therefore, a dual resident company was not able to make its tax losses available to another company in the same group. 346. As discussed from \[312\], those tax residence requirements were repealed with effect on 15 March 2017. But the historical residence requirements are still relevant for a commonality period that started before 15 March 2017 and continued after 15 March 2017, for losses incurred after the 1990–91 tax year. Potential for dual tax residence if central management and control is exercised in Australia 347. There have been developments in relation to one of Australia’s domestic tax residence tests, the “central management and control” test, that New Zealand companies carrying on business should be aware of if central management and control of the company is exercised in Australia. 348. Under the central management and control test, a company is tax resident in Australia if it:  carries on business in Australia; and  has its central management and control in Australia. 349. The Australian High Court decision of Bywater Investments Ltd & Ors v Commissioner of Taxation; Hua Wang Bank Berhad v Commissioner of Taxation \[2016\] HCA 45 represented a shift in the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO’s) approach to the central management and control test. Following the decision, the ATO published a new ruling on the test (TR 2018/5 – Income Tax: central management and control test of residency). 350. As explained in TR 2018/5, it is not necessary for any part of the actual trading or investment operations of the business of the company to take place in Australia for a company to be considered to be carrying on business in Australia. If a company that carries on business has its central management and control in Australia, it is carrying on business in Australia within the meaning of the central management and control test. This is because the central management and control of a business is part of carrying on that business. It is considered that a company carrying on business does so both where its trading and investment activities take place and where the central management and control of those activities occurs. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 99 of 133 351. Central management and control is the control and direction of a company’s operations. The key element of this is the high-level decision making that sets the company’s general policies, and determines the direction of its operations and the type of transactions it will enter. 352. As a result of the Bywater decision, New Zealand companies that carry on business are Australian tax resident if central management and control of the company is exercised in Australia, even if the company’s commercial activities are carried on outside Australia. Affected New Zealand companies may therefore be dual resident. 353. This could be relevant, for example, to a company that carries on business and has directors that are in, or move to, Australia. However, it is noted that while it will usually be a company’s directors who exercise central management and control of the company, this will not always be the case. When determining who exercises a company’s central management and control, all the relevant facts and circumstances must be considered. 354. Given the close relationship between Australia and New Zealand and the ease and volume of movement between the countries, New Zealand companies carrying on business should be aware of the potential implications of the Bywater decision, particularly if persons who exercise central management and control of the company are considering migrating to Australia. 355. In addition to TR 2018/5, the ATO have published Practical Compliance Guidance, PCG 2018/9 – Central management and control test of residency: identifying where a company’s central management and control is located, which includes examples that illustrate the central management and control test. Example illustrating migration to Australia triggering dual tax residence of a company Example | Tauira 30 – Look-through company owners moving to Australia Facts: Ben and Ruth are New Zealand tax residents. They own an LTC that holds and manages a portfolio of New Zealand residential rental properties. The activity amounts to a business. Ben and Ruth emigrate to Australia, and exercise central management and control of the LTC from Australia. Result: The LTC becomes tax resident in Australia under the central management and control test. It continues to be tax resident in New Zealand as it was incorporated here. Its tax residence tie-breaks to Australia under the DTA, for DTA purposes. As a result, it ceases to be an LTC. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 100 of 133 Explanation: The LTC becomes tax resident in Australia under the central management and control test. The LTC is considered to be carrying on business in Australia, even though all its assets are in New Zealand. This is because central management and control of the LTC is exercised in Australia. The LTC is treated as tax resident in Australia under the tie-breaker provision in the Australia–New Zealand DTA. Therefore, the company ceases being eligible to be an LTC (as it no longer satisfies para (c) of the definition of “look-through company” in s YA 1) . Because the company ceases to be an LTC, Ben and Ruth are deemed to have disposed of their interest in the LTC’s property at market value to a notional third party, and the company (no longer an LTC) is deemed to have acquired that property at market value (s HB 4(6)). There may be tax implications as a result of this. For example, if any of the properties were acquired less than 2 years before Ben and Ruth moved to Australia the deemed disposal would trigger a tax liability to Ben and Ruth under the bright-line test for residential land (s CB 6A). See further IS xx/xx: Look-through companies and disposal of residential land under the bright-line test at \[xx147\]. Further, whether or not any of the properties were acquired less than 2 years before Ben and Ruth moved to Australia, t he company’s bright-line start-date for all of the properties in the portfolio would reset to the date the company ceased to be an LTC (see IS xx/xx from \[xx149\]). There may also be other tax implications in Australia or New Zealand or both, such as assets becoming CGT assets, filing obligations in both countries, and the potential need to claim a tax credit for tax paid in the other jurisdiction. The implications of the timing of migration to Australia and the management of affairs prior to migration should be carefully considered. Tax residence of foreign companies 356. As noted at \[238\], a “foreign company” is a company that is not tax resident in New Zealand and is not treated as tax resident in New Zealand under a DTA (s YA 1). Section YD 3 sets out different tests to determine the country in which a foreign company is treated as tax resident for the purposes of the “international tax rules” (which are defined in s YA 1 as including the rules relating to controlled foreign companies, foreign investment funds and foreign tax credits). 357. Section YD 3 provides: IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 101 of 133 YD 3 Country of residence of foreign companies When this section applies (1) This section applies for the purposes of the international tax rules to determine the country in which a foreign company is treated as resident for an accounting period. Liability to income tax (2) The company is treated as resident in a country if, at any time during the accounting period, it is liable to income tax in the country because any of the following is located in the country— (a) its domicile: (b) its residence: (c) its place of management: (d) any other criterion of a similar nature. Further rule: first application (3) Subsection (4) applies if the application of subsection (2) for an accounting period means that— (a) the company is resident in 2 or more countries: (b) the company is not resident in any country. Applying New Zealand rules (4) The company is treated as resident in the country in which— (a) it is incorporated: (b) it has its head office: (c) it has its centre of management: (d) its directors, in their capacity as directors, exercise control of the company, even if the directors’ decision-making also occurs outside the country. Further rule: second application (5) The company is treated as resident in the country in which its centre of management is located for the accounting period if no 1 country of residence is identified under subsection (4). Final rule (6) The Commissioner must determine the country of residence if no 1 country of residence is identified under subsection (5). 358. Section YD 3(2) provides that a foreign company will be treated as tax resident in a country if, at any time during the accounting period, it is liable to income tax in the IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 102 of 133 country because its domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature is located in the country. 359. If subs (2) results in the company being tax resident in multiple countries, or not in any country, the company is treated (under subs (4)) as tax resident in the country in which it is incorporated, has its head office or centre of management, or in which its directors, in their capacity as such, exercise control of the company (even if the directors’ decision-making also occurs outside the country). 360. If the application of subs (4) results in no one country of tax residence being identified, the company is treated (under subs (5)) as tax resident in the country in which its centre of management is located for the accounting period. 361. Finally, if the application of subs (5) results in no one country of tax residence being identified, subs (6) provides that the Commissioner must determine the country of tax residence. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 103 of 133 Part 3: Tax residence and trusts Introduction 362. Trusts are not treated as separate entities for income tax purposes, so there are no rules in the Act governing the tax residence of trusts. The tax residence of the persons connected with the trust (that is, the trustees, settlors and beneficiaries) is relevant to the tax treatment of trust income and distributions. The tax residence rules for individuals and companies apply (as relevant) to the trustees, settlors and beneficiaries. 363. The trust rules in the Act modify the general position that New Zealand tax resident trustees are assessable on worldwide income and non-residents are assessable on only New Zealand–sourced income. In general, the tax residence of the trustees alone does not determine the treatment of foreign-sourced amounts trustees derive – the tax residence of the settlors is also relevant. Therefore, if the tax residence of the settlors of a trust changes, there may be tax implications for the treatment of income derived by a trustee. The trust rules allow trustees, settlors and beneficiaries to make elections to change the way income derived by a trustee would otherwise be taxed according to residence. 364. Beneficiary income and taxable distributions are taxed according to the normal residence and source rules, but there is a specific rule for beneficiaries who cease to be tax resident in New Zealand and become tax resident again within 5 years (see \[429\]). 365. This part provides an overview of:  how beneficiaries are taxed;  how trust income is taxed, including the implications of the residence status of settlors and trustees for the taxation of income trustees derive;  disclosure obligations trustees may have; and  the impact of changes in the tax residence of persons connected with a trust – the trustee, settlors and beneficiaries. 366. For more detailed information about the taxation of trusts, see xxIS 24/01: Taxation of trusts and xxIS 19/04: Distributions from foreign trusts and Overview: trusts on Inland Revenue’s tax technical website. Table – How beneficiary income and trustee income are taxed 367. Table | Tūtohi 1 shows how income trustees derive can be beneficiary income or trustee income and how the income is taxed. Beneficiaries may also derive income from a foreign trust or a non-complying trust in the form of taxable distributions, as discussed from \[ 375\]. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 104 of 133 Table | Tūtohi 1 – How beneficiary income and trustee income are taxed Beneficiary income Beneficiary tax resident in New Zealand • All beneficiary income is included as assessable income except minor and close company beneficiary income. • Transitional residents do not include most foreign-sourced amounts. Beneficiary not tax resident in New Zealand • Only New Zealand–sourced beneficiary income is included as assessable income. Notes: • Beneficiaries who ceased to be tax resident in New Zealand and become tax resident again within 5 years must include beneficiary income and taxable distributions received from foreign and non-complying trusts while non-resident. • Trustees are generally liable as agent for the income tax liability of a beneficiary for their beneficiary income and any taxable distributions they derive. Trustee income New Zealand–sourced income is included in assessable income whether or not the trustee is tax resident in New Zealand. If a non-resident trustee only has non-resident withholding income and it has been taxed correctly, the tax withheld is a final tax. Note: Trustee income also includes minor beneficiary income, close company beneficiary income and certain property settlements. Foreign-sourced income is included in assessable income if: • the trustee was not tax resident when the income was derived; and • a settlor of the trust was tax resident (and not a transitional resident) in New Zealand at any point during the income year. In general, this rule does not apply if: • no settlement has been made on the trust after 17 December 1987; or • a settlement has been made but the settlor was non-resident between 17 December 1987 and the date of the settlement. Foreign-sourced income is exempt if: • the trustee was tax resident when the income was derived; and • no settlor of the trust was tax resident (and not a transitional resident) in New Zealand at any point during the income year; provided that: • if no settlor exists in the income year, the last surviving settlor was not a tax resident at the time of ceasing to exist; • the trust is not at any time in the income year a superannuation fund, or a testamentary or inter vivos trust of which any settlor was tax resident in New Zealand when they died; • no s HC 33 election has been made; and • the registration and reporting obligations for foreign exemption trusts have been met. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 105 of 133 Trustee income, beneficiary income, and taxable distributions Trustee income 368. Income a trustee derives from property held in trust is taxed as either beneficiary income or trustee income. Only trustees can claim deductions for expenditure or losses incurred in deriving the income (s DV 9). 369. Trustee income is the income the trustee of a trust derives, to the extent to which it is not beneficiary income (s HC 7(1)). This means amounts a trustee derives can be wholly beneficiary income, wholly trustee income or a mixture of both. 370. Beneficiary income is also treated as if it were trustee income for the purposes of paying tax and providing returns of income if it was derived by a:  minor to whom s HC 35 applies (s HC 7(2)); or  close company to which s HC 38 applies (s HC 7(2B)). 371. Section HC 7(3) extends trustee income to include the market value of any property settlement a trust receives that is excluded from corpus under ss HC 4(3) to (5). The amount is reduced by the market value that the trustee treats as beneficiary income or as a taxable distribution in the income year. Section CV 13(b) includes such amounts in the income of the trustee. 372. Trustee income is taxed at 33% or 39% from the 2024–25 income year. Trustee income that is minor or close company beneficiary income is taxed at 39%. 25 Beneficiary income 373. Section HC 6 provides that an amount a trustee derives in an income year is beneficiary income to the extent to which either it vests absolutely in interest in a beneficiary of the trust in the income year, or it is paid to a beneficiary of the trust during the income year or by the later of:  a date within 6 months of the end of the income year; or  the earlier of the date: o on which the trustee files a return of income for the year; or o by which they must file a return for the year. 25 xxSee clauses 59(1) and 60(1) in Taxation (Annual Rates for 2024-25, Emergency Response, and Remedial Measures) Bill. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 106 of 133 374. Beneficiary income derived by a New Zealand resident is taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal rate. However, as noted at \[370\], minor and close company beneficiary income is treated as trustee income. It is excluded income for the beneficiary. Taxable distributions Classifications of trusts 375. The tax treatment of distributions to beneficiaries of amounts that are not beneficiary income depends in part on the classification of the trust. For income tax purposes, trusts are classified as:  complying trusts – essentially trusts where tax has always been paid in New Zealand on the worldwide income a trustee derives, whether by obligation or election, and the tax obligations relating to the trustee’s income tax liability have been satisfied;  foreign trusts – essentially trusts that have not had a New Zealand tax resident settlor (including a settlor who is a transitional resident) at any time since 17 December 1987; and  non-complying trusts – trusts that are neither complying nor foreign trusts. 376. It is possible for a trust to be both a complying trust and a foreign trust. This type of trust is referred to as a dual status trust. This could occur, for example, where a New Zealand tax resident trustee of a foreign trust derives only New Zealand–sourced income as trustee income and satisfies their tax obligations relating to the trustee’s income tax liability. The taxation of distributions 377. In addition to the classification of the trust being relevant, the taxation of distributions also depends on whether the distribution is accumulated trustee income, capital gains or corpus, whether the source of the amount is in New Zealand or foreign, and the tax residence of the beneficiary. 378. In general, distributions to New Zealand tax resident beneficiaries of a trust, other than distributions of beneficiary income, are:  exempt income, where the distribution comes from a complying trust or dual status trust;  a taxable distribution, where the distribution consists of: o accumulated trustee income or certain capital gains derived through a transaction with an associated person, distributed by a foreign trust; or IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 107 of 133 o accumulated trustee income or capital gains distributed by a non- complying trust; or  a non-taxable distribution, where the distribution consists of: o capital gains of a foreign trust (other than certain capital gains derived through a transaction with an associated person); or o corpus of a foreign or non-complying trust. 379. As noted at \[375\], distributions a trustee makes from a dual status trust are treated as being from a complying trust. If a trust that was a dual status trust loses its status as a complying trust, it remains a foreign trust if it still meets the requirements to be one. 380. Ordering rules treat distributions as comprising of taxable amounts before non-taxable amounts. 381. Taxable distributions from a foreign trust to a New Zealand tax resident beneficiary are taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal rate. 382. The tax on New Zealand–sourced non-resident passive income distributed to a non- resident beneficiary, such as interest and dividends, may be a final tax if the beneficiary has no other income sourced in New Zealand, but is otherwise an interim tax. Other New Zealand–sourced income, such as rental income, is taxed at the non-resident beneficiary’s marginal rate. DTAs may affect New Zealand’s taxing rights. Foreign- sourced amounts distributed to a non-resident are not subject to tax in New Zealand. 383. New Zealand–sourced taxable distributions from a non-complying trust are taxed at 45% whether the beneficiary is tax resident or non-resident. Foreign-sourced amounts distributed to a New Zealand tax resident are also taxed at 45%. However, foreign- sourced amounts distributed to non-resident beneficiaries as either beneficiary income or taxable distributions are not subject to tax in New Zealand. 384. Where a foreign trust or non-complying trust distributes accumulated trustee income that has been taxed, economic double taxation arises as the income is taxed to the trustee and then to the beneficiary. 385. Table | Tūtohi 2 summarises the tax treatment where the amount distributed is New Zealand–sourced, whether the beneficiary is a New Zealand tax resident or not. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 108 of 133 Table | Tūtohi 2 – Tax treatment of New Zealand–sourced distributions from a trust Type of distribution from the trust Complying trust Foreign trust Non-complying trust Accumulated trustee income Not taxable T axed at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate Taxed at 45% Non- associated capital gains and profits Not taxable N ot taxable Taxed at 45% Associated capital gains and profits Not taxable T axed at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate Taxed at 45% Corpus Not taxable Not taxable Not taxable Settlor tax residence Settlor tax residence and liability of trustees 386. Trustees are liable to tax on New Zealand–sourced trustee income as if they were an individual beneficially entitled to that income (s HC 24). This is the case whether or not the trustee or any settlor is tax resident in New Zealand. However, the tax residence of a settlor of the trust is relevant in determining whether foreign-sourced income a trustee derives is liable to tax in New Zealand. 387. Either s YD 1 or s YD 2 determines a settlor’s tax residence, depending on whether the settlor is a natural person or a company. In general, a settlor is a person who transfers value to a trust. Foreign-sourced amounts may be exempt 388. A foreign-sourced amount derived by a New Zealand tax resident trustee and included in trustee income for the income year is exempt income (s HC 26) if the following are all satisfied:  No settlor of the trust is at any time in the income year a New Zealand tax resident (who is not a transitional resident) or, if no settlor exists in the income year, the last surviving settlor was a non-resident when that settlor ceased to exist. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 109 of 133  No election under s HC 33 has been made for the trust. 26  The trust is not a: o superannuation fund; or o testamentary trust or an inter vivos trust of which any settlor was tax resident in New Zealand when they died (whether or not they died during the relevant income year).  The requirements in s HC 26(1)(c) or s HC 26(1) (d) , as applicable, are met (these deal with registration and reporting obligations of foreign exemption trusts – see from \[401\]).  The amount is not beneficiary income derived by a minor that is treated as if it were trustee income. 389. Provided registration and reporting requirements are met, foreign-sourced income derived by a New Zealand tax resident trustee of a foreign trust is exempt. The exemption continues during the period a settlor of a foreign trust is a transitional resident. Where an election is made under s HC 33, the tax obligations of the trustee are determined as if the trustee and a settlor of the trust are New Zealand tax residents so the exemption does not apply. Foreign-sourced amounts may be taxable 390. A foreign-sourced amount derived by a non-resident trustee as trustee income that would be assessable income if derived by a person tax resident in New Zealand will, subject to the exceptions noted at \[392\], be assessable income of the trustee (under s HC 25) if, at any time in the income year:  a settlor of the trust is a New Zealand tax resident (who is not a transitional resident); or  the trust is a superannuation fund; or  the trust is a testamentary trust or an inter vivos trust of which: o a trustee is tax resident in New Zealand; and o any settlor was tax resident in New Zealand when they died (whether or not they died during the relevant income year) or the last surviving settlor was tax resident in New Zealand when that settlor ceased to exist. 391. Section HC 25(2) applies so foreign-sourced amounts are assessable if any one of the settlors of the trust (if there is more than one settlor) is tax resident in New Zealand at 26 Under s HC 33, a trustee, settlor or beneficiary can make an election to satisfy the income tax liability of a trustee. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 110 of 133 any time during an income year. An entire year of tax residence is not required. The amount must be one that would be assessable income if derived by a person tax resident in New Zealand, so it excludes, for example, some capital gains. 392. The two exceptions to this (in s HC 25(3) and (4)) are where the trustee is tax resident outside New Zealand for the entire income year and either:  no settlement has been made on the trust after 17 December 1987, and the trustee has not made an election referred to in s HZ 2 (an election under the Income Tax Act 1976 on or before 31 May 1989 to pay tax on trustee income); or  any settlement made on the trust after 17 December 1987 was made only by a settlor who was not resident in New Zealand at any time from 17 December 1987 up to (and including) the date of settlement. 393. The second exception does not apply if the settlement is made by a transitional resident as they are tax resident in New Zealand. 394. Where the trustees are non-resident and foreign-sourced amounts are assessable as trustee income under s HC 25(2), the trustees are treated as tax resident in New Zealand under other provisions for the purpose of calculating the taxable income of the trustees. These provisions are:  ss EW 9 and EW 11, which state the situations where the financial arrangements rules will or will not apply;  s LJ 2 , which states when a person can claim a tax credit for foreign income tax paid;  s OE 1, which states when a person can choose to be a branch equivalent tax account person; and  the international tax rules, which are defined in s YA 1 as including the rules relating to controlled foreign companies, foreign investment funds and foreign tax credits. Settlor residence and liability of settlor 395. Under s HC 29, a settlor may be liable as agent of the trustee for income tax payable by the trustee on trustee income derived in an income year. This section facilitates the collection of tax on trustee income in cases where it may be difficult due to the trustee being non-resident. 396. This provision may apply where the:  settlor has made a settlement to or for the benefit of a trust after 17 December 1987 (whether or not they settled property on the trust on or before that date); and IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 111 of 133  trustee derives trustee income in an income year in which the settlor is resident in New Zealand. 397. Where there is more than one settlor to whom s HC 29 applies, the liability is joint and several. 398. However, the rule does not apply:  to income tax that the trustee is liable for under s HC 32, which relates to the trustee’s liability as agent for the tax liability of a beneficiary for their beneficiary income and taxable distributions derived;  if the trust has a New Zealand tax resident trustee for the whole income year, or if the first settlement was made during the income year, from the day of that settlement until the end of the income year;  where the trust is a tax charity or superannuation fund;  to the extent to which the trustee income is derived from the settlor remitting an amount under a financial arrangement to which either s EW 31 or s EZ 38, which relate to base price adjustments, applies;  if the settlor is a natural person who was not tax resident at the time of any settlement on the trust, and had not after 17 December 1987 previously been tax resident in New Zealand (unless they have made an election under s HC 33 to satisfy the income tax liability of the trustee); or  to the extent to which the settlor can establish through full disclosure to the Commissioner of settlements made that, having regard to the settlements made by that settlor and by other settlors, another settlor should be liable. 399. Where s HC 29 applies, the settlor is liable for tax on trustee income as agent for the trustee. Therefore, the trustee remains liable for the tax on the trustee income. The provisions of subpart HD, dealing with the liability for tax of principals and agents, are relevant. Settlor residence and disclosure rules 400. In general, trustees of trusts need to comply with either the foreign exemption trust disclosure rules or the domestic trust disclosure rules. Foreign exemption trust disclosure rules 401. Foreign exemption trusts are required to register with the Commissioner, disclose information about the trust and file annual returns. One consequence of not doing so may be the loss of the exemption for foreign-sourced income under s HC 26. 402. A foreign exemption trust is a: IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 112 of 133  foreign trust that has one or more trustees who are New Zealand tax residents; or  trust for which the trustee uses, or has previously used, the foreign-sourced income exemption in s HC 26. 403. The tax residence of the settlor determines whether the foreign exemption trust registration rules apply. If the trust has always had non-resident settlors, it is a foreign trust. 404. If a non-resident settlor becomes a transitional resident, the trust is no longer a foreign trust, but can use the foreign-sourced exemption until the end of the settlor’s transitional residence if the registration and disclosure obligations are met. 405. Foreign exemption trusts must apply for registration within 30 days of the:  trust’s establishment date if it has a New Zealand tax resident trustee;  appointment of a New Zealand tax resident trustee; or  due date for an income tax return in which the trustee takes a tax position that foreign-sourced income is exempt under s HC 26. 406. Foreign exemption trusts with natural persons who are not professional trustees have up to 4 years and 30 days to register. 407. Foreign exemption trusts do not need to comply with the domestic trust disclosure rules. 408. IS 24/01 ex plains the foreign exemption trust disclosure rules in more detail. Domestic trust disclosure rules 409. The domestic trust disclosure rules apply to trustees who derive assessable income and must file a return under s 59BA(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Unless the trust is an excluded trust under s 59BA(3), such as a foreign exemption trust, the trustees are required to include the information set out in s 59BA(2)(a) to (f). 410. The Tax Administration (Financial Statements – Domestic Trusts) Order 2022 requires trustees to prepare financial statements. However, these financial statements are not required to be provided to the Commissioner (unless the Commissioner requests them). Certain information needs to be copied from the financial statements and included in the tax return filed with the Commissioner. 411. If the trustee is non-resident, New Zealand tax resident settlors of the trust are responsible for ensuring performance of the obligations imposed on the trustee. 412. The domestic disclosure rules are explained in more detail in OS 22/02: Reporting requirements for domestic trusts. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 113 of 133 Trustee tax residence 413. The tax residence of the trustee is determined under the rules in either s YD 1 or s YD 2, depending on whether the trustee is a natural person or a company. Section YD 1(12) clarifies that a natural person includes a natural person who is acting in the capacity of trustee. Similarly, s YD 2(1B) clarifies that a company includes one that is acting in the capacity of trustee. 414. When a trust has multiple trustees, the trustees are treated as a notional single person when considering tax residence (s HC 2). 27 Where one of the trustees is tax resident, all the trustees as the notional single person under s HC 2 are tax resident in that capacity. If all the trustees are non-resident, then the notional single person under s HC 2 is non-resident as long as no election has been made under s HC 33. 415. As noted at \[386\], trustees are liable to tax on trustee income as if they were an individual beneficially entitled to that income (s HC 24). New Zealand–sourced income derived by the trustee is assessable whether or not the trustee, or any settlor, is tax resident in New Zealand. The tax treatment of foreign-sourced amounts depends on the tax residence of settlors. 416. As noted at \[373\], s HC 6 provides that an amount a trustee derives in an income year will be beneficiary income to the extent to which either it vests absolutely in interest in a beneficiary of the trust in the income year, or it is paid to a beneficiary of the trust in the relevant timeframes. A trustee who allocates all income derived during the year to beneficiaries has no trustee income. 417. The trustee of a trust is generally liable as agent for the income tax liability of the beneficiary for their beneficiary income and taxable distributions derived (s HC 32). This liability, therefore, depends on the tax residence of the beneficiary. If the beneficiary is tax resident in New Zealand, the trustee is liable for tax as agent of the beneficiary on worldwide beneficiary income and taxable distributions. If the beneficiary is tax resident outside New Zealand, the trustee is generally liable for tax as agent in respect of only New Zealand–sourced beneficiary income and taxable distributions. 418. The trustee’s tax residence (without reference to the settlor’s tax residence) is relevant if they derive passive income such as interest and dividends. If the trustee is not tax resident and derives “non-resident passive income” as defined in s RF 2, NRWT is payable on that amount. This may be a final tax if the non-resident trustee has no other income sourced in New Zealand. If the trustee is tax resident, RWT is deducted from passive income paid to them, unless they have RWT-exempt status. If an election has been made under s HC 33(1), non-resident passive income derived by a non- 27 They are also treated as a notional single person in their capacity as trustees and are jointly and severally liable to satisfy obligations imposed by s BB 2, such as filing returns. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 114 of 133 resident trustee is excluded as non-resident passive income from the effective date of the election and RWT should be deducted. 419. The treatment of trustees, whether an individual or a group of persons as a notional single person, is relevant for the purpose of applying the tie-breaker tests in DTAs. Many countries, such as Australia, tax trusts based on the tax residence of trustees, so dual resident situations can arise. For example, if a trust had two New Zealand tax resident trustees and one becomes tax resident in Australia, the notional single person is still tax resident in New Zealand due to one trustee being tax resident here, and the trust is also tax resident in Australia by virtue of one trustee being tax resident there. 420. In the case of the Australia–New Zealand DTA, under art 4(3), as modified by art 4(1) of the MLI, 28 the competent authorities of both countries must endeavour to determine the tax residence of the trust by mutual agreement having regard to “its place of effective management, the place where it is incorporated or otherwise constituted and any other relevant factors”. To obtain a determination of tax residence by the competent authorities under the above conventions, an application is required (see Tax treaties: Australia on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website). If the authorities cannot agree, or no application has been made, the trustees are not entitled to access the reliefs and exemptions available under the DTA, such as reduced rates on non-resident withholding income. 421. As discussed from \[330\], the competent authorities of Australia and New Zealand have agreed an administrative approach for certain dual resident companies, which allows those companies to self-assess residence if they meet the criteria. However, this agreement does not apply to trusts. 422. The tie-breaker provisions apply only for the purposes of a DTA. Even if a trust’s tax residence tie-breaks to Australia, for example, it may still have obligations as a tax resident of New Zealand, such as under the disclosure rules. Beneficiary tax residence 423. The normal rules about tax residence and source apply to determine which items of beneficiary income and taxable distributions are included in a beneficiary’s assessable income. 424. Beneficiaries are required to include in their assessable income all beneficiary income and taxable distributions they derive in an income year (ss HC 17 and CV 13) except where the income is derived by a:  minor to which s HC 35 applies; or 28 Each DTA is different and other DTAs and the MLI positions of different countries (if they have ratified the MLI) need to be examined individually. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 115 of 133  close company to which s HC 38 applies. 425. Where either of the above exceptions applies, the income is excluded income of the minor (s CX 58) or close company (s CX 58B), as relevant, and treated as trustee income under s HC 35 or s HC 38 to which a tax rate of 39% applies. 29 426. When a beneficiary is tax resident in New Zealand, the beneficiary is required to include all beneficiary income and taxable distributions in their assessable income (s BD 1). Taxable distributions from non-complying trusts are taxed at 45%. 427. When a beneficiary is not tax resident in New Zealand, only New Zealand–sourced beneficiary income and taxable distributions are included in assessable income. In this situation, there is an NRWT liability if the New Zealand–sourced income is non-resident passive income. This may be a final tax if the non-resident beneficiary has no other income sourced in New Zealand. Income derived by a beneficiary from a trust will have a source in New Zealand to the extent to which the income of the trust fund has a source in New Zealand (s YD 4(13)) . 428. As noted at \[417\], the trustee of a trust is generally liable as agent for the income tax liability of the beneficiary for their beneficiary income and taxable distributions derived (s HC 32). 429. There is a specific rule for beneficiaries who cease to be tax resident in New Zealand and who become tax resident again within 5 years of the date of the end of their residence. In this situation, the beneficiary is treated as deriving income to the extent to which they would have been treated as deriving beneficiary income or taxable distributions from a foreign trust or a non-complying trust if they had remained in New Zealand during the period of their absence. Any such income is treated as derived on the day on which the beneficiary becomes resident again (ss CV 15 and HC 23). 430. The tax residence of a beneficiary is determined under the rules in s YD 1 or s YD 2, depending on whether the beneficiary is a natural person or a company. Changes in tax residence 431. The following discussion considers the implications in some situations of settlors, trustees and beneficiaries changing tax residence. Inbound settlor of a foreign trust and a tax resident trustee 432. If a non-resident settlor of a foreign trust with a tax resident trustee becomes tax resident in New Zealand (and is not a transitional resident), foreign-sourced amounts derived by a trustee in the year the settlor becomes tax resident are generally 29 xxSee footnote 25 o n page 105. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 116 of 133 assessable. This is because the exemption in s HC 26 no longer applies. The trust becomes a non-complying trust. 433. However, it is possible for an election to be made for the trust to be treated as a complying trust for some distributions. This is done through a settlor, trustee or beneficiary of a trust electing to satisfy the income tax liability of the trustee. This applies if a settlor of the trust is a natural person who:  becomes a New Zealand tax resident (and is not a transitional resident); or  stops being a transitional resident and continues to be a New Zealand tax resident (either of these days is the “transition date”); provided the trust would be a foreign trust in relation to a distribution if a distribution were made immediately before the settlor became tax resident (ss HC 30 and HC 33) . 434. If such an election is made, the person making the election is liable for the income tax payable by the trustee, other than income tax that the trustee is liable for as agent of a beneficiary (s HC 33(2)). 435. The election must be made before the election expiry date – being the first anniversary of the transition date. If an election is made, the trust is treated as a:  foreign trust to the extent to which distributions consist of an amount derived by the trustee before the date of the election and that do not give rise after the transition date to an income tax liability that is paid before the distribution is made;  complying trust to the extent to which distributions consist of an amount derived by the trustee: o before the date of the election and give rise on or after the transition date to an income tax liability that is paid before the distribution is made; or o on or after the date of the election, if the requirements of s HC 10(1)(a) are met for the trustee income derived after the date of the election; and  non-complying trust to the extent to which the distribution consists of an amount that would not be included in the above. 436. This treatment means, for example, foreign-sourced trustee income accumulated while the trust is a foreign trust can be distributed to a non-resident or transitional resident beneficiary tax free. It also means accumulated trustee income derived after the election can be distributed tax free if the tax obligations in relation to trustee income have been met. Conversely, if an amount is derived after the date of the election and the requirements of s HC 10(1)(a) are not met, the distribution is treated as coming from a non-complying trust. If it is a New Zealand–sourced amount, it is taxed at 45% whether or not the beneficiary is a tax resident. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 117 of 133 437. If an election is not made within the 12-month period, the trust is treated as a:  foreign trust to the extent to which distributions consist of an amount derived by the trustee before the election expiry date and which does not give rise on or after the transition date to an income tax liability;  complying trust to the extent to which the distribution consists of an amount derived by the trustee that gives rise on or after the transition date to an income tax liability meeting the requirements of s HC 30(4B) or s HC 10(1)(ab); or  non-complying trust to the extent to which distributions consist of an amount derived by the trustee that gives rise on or after the transition date to an income tax liability that is not satisfied before the distribution is made. 438. An income tax liability that meets the requirements of s HC 30(4B) can be treated as coming from a complying trust if:  the income tax liability is satisfied before the distribution is made, other than for the trust as a complying trust under an election under s HC 33;  the income tax liability gives rise to a tax shortfall for the trustee for an income year ending before the distribution is made; and  where a shortfall penalty arises for the tax shortfall, the shortfall penalty is satisfied before the distribution is made. 439. This provision allows for errors to be corrected before distributions are made so the tax treatment for a non-complying trust does not apply. 440. Retrospective elections are permitted if the requirements of s HC 10(1)(ab) are met so that complying trust status can apply to a distribution, but the period for making such an election is limited to 4 years before the start of the electing year. The ability to make retrospective elections assists migrants who were not aware of the impact of a foreign trust not making an election by the election expiry day. It is not compulsory to make an election. Some trusts may prefer not to do so depending on the circumstances. 441. If a settlor of a dual status trust becomes tax resident, the trust remains a complying trust. No election is required. Outbound settlor of a complying trust and a tax resident trustee 442. If a New Zealand tax resident settlor of a trust ceases to be New Zealand tax resident and there are no other New Zealand tax resident settlors of the trust, foreign-sourced amounts derived by a tax resident trustee in the following year are exempt (provided that no settlor is tax resident in New Zealand at any point in that income year and the registration and reporting obligations for a foreign exemption trust are met). IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 118 of 133 443. The change in residence could mean the trust loses its status as a complying trust if there are no other tax resident settlors and the trustee, for example, derives foreign- sourced income that is exempt. However, this will not happen if the trustee elects to continue being taxed on worldwide income retained as trustee income and indicates that by ticking the relevant box in their return, Income tax return: Estate or trust – IR6 . If the trustee is not required to file a return, they must notify the Commissioner in the return for foreign exemption trusts. 444. A retrospective election can also be made under s HC 33 to maintain complying trust status, but only up to 4 years before the income year in which the election is made. It may be necessary to pay shortfall penalties and use of money interest. Outbound trustees of a complying trust and a resident settlor 445. If a New Zealand trustee becomes non-resident, the trust’s status as a complying trust may be lost if there are no other New Zealand tax resident trustees and the trustee derives non-resident passive income or non-residents’ foreign-sourced income. An election can be made under s HC 33 to continue paying tax on worldwide income. The effect of the election is that the trustee is treated as tax resident. This means resident withholding tax will apply to any passive income sourced in New Zealand, instead of non-resident withholding tax. 446. If no trustees remain tax resident in New Zealand, the settlor may become liable as agent of the trustee. 447. In addition, if no trustees remain tax resident in New Zealand, the settlor needs to make a disclosure about the trust within 3 months on Settlors of trusts disclosure – IR462. This requirement also applies even if an election is made. 448. If New Zealand tax resident trustees remain, the trust may become a dual resident depending on where the departing trustee becomes tax resident. The trustees need to consider making an application to the competent authorities of both countries to determine tax residence for the purposes of the applicable DTA. Failure to do so may result in DTA relief not being available. Inbound trustees and a non-resident settlor of a foreign trust 449. If a non-resident trustee of a foreign trust becomes tax resident, foreign-sourced income derived by the trustee is exempt if the trustee meets their obligations under the foreign exemption trust disclosure rules. 450. It also changes how passive income is taxed. If the trustee receives non-resident withholding income, they are taxed at the resident withholding tax rate. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 119 of 133 Outbound beneficiaries 451. If a New Zealand tax resident beneficiary becomes non-resident, they must continue to pay tax on New Zealand–sourced beneficiary income and New Zealand–sourced taxable distributions from a foreign or non-complying trust unless a DTA provides relief. Where the non-resident has income, the applicable return is Income tax return: Non-resident individual taxpayers – IR3NR . However, if the only income is non- resident withholding income, no return is required and the amount withheld is a final tax assuming the withholding is correct. 452. Trustees need to deduct non-resident withholding tax if the distributions include non- resident withholding income such as interest or dividends. Where applicable, they may arrange for the payer of the amounts to deduct the withholding. 453. As noted at \[429\], there is also a specific rule in relation to beneficiaries who cease to be tax resident in New Zealand and who become tax resident again within 5 years of ceasing to be tax resident and receive distributions from a foreign trust or non- complying trust. Inbound beneficiaries 454. A non-resident beneficiary who becomes tax resident may be eligible to be a transitional resident. This means foreign-sourced distributions from a foreign trust or non-complying trust would be exempt for the period of transitional tax residence.

They set out the Commissioner’s views and guidance on how New Zealand’s tax laws apply. They may address specific situations we have been asked to provide guidance on, or they may be about how legislative provisions apply more generally. While they set out the Commissioner’s considered views, interpretation statements are not binding on the Commissioner. However, taxpayers can generally rely on them in determining their tax affairs. See further Status of Commissioner’s advice (C ommissioner’s Statement, Inland Revenue, December 2012). It is important to note that a general similarity between a taxpayer’s circumstances and an example in an interpretation statement will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case must be considered on its own facts. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 125 of 133 Appendix: Legislation Income Tax Act 2007 A1.

Tax residence – refresh of IS 16/03 Reference: PUB0483 Reading guide for public consultation Background This reading guide is for the accompanying draft interpretation statement that will update and replace IS 16/03: Ta x residence. IS 16/03 updated IS 14/01: Tax residence, but that update covered only changes to the discussion of the permanent place of abode test as a result of the decision in CIR v Diamond \[2015\] NZCA 613 (CA). It has been just over 10 years since the tax residence interpretation statement had a full refresh. It is one of our most downloaded tax technical publications, so because there have been numerous legislative and other changes, it is timely to fully update the statement. After incorporating changes, the draft statement is now much longer than the previous statement (from 83 to 1 33 pages). However, some of the additional length is because we now use more white space to make our items easier to read. This guide is to help readers understand the high-level similarities and differences between IS 16/03 and the new draft interpretation statement. Accompanying the draft statement are three draft fact sheets – one each in respect of tax residence and individuals, companies and trusts. The draft statement is structured in the same way as IS 16/01. Readers familiar with IS 16/01 will notice the two statements both have three parts (covering individuals, companies and trusts) and they largely order topics in the same way. The following section summarises the main changes in each part of the draft statement. Introduction  Subheadings have been added to the discussion about the relevance of tax residence to guide the reader.  New paragraphs discuss working in New Zealand during a short-term visit, Working for Families tax credits, and absentees. IS XX/XX Reading guide | Issue date Page 2 of 3 Part 1 – Tax residence of natural persons (individuals)  The discussion has been redrafted in plain English style and repetition removed (in particular in relation to the permanent place of abode test).  Attention has been drawn to the fact an application for Working for Families tax credits is treated as an election to no longer be transitional resident.  The discussion of the government service rule has been taken out of the draft statement and included in a separate publication (consultation reference: PUB00495).  We have clarified the date at which transitional residence ends if it ends due to a person or their spouse or partner applying for Working for Families tax credits. A new example (Example | Tauira 18) illustrates this point.  In relation to the habitual abode double tax agreement ( DTA) tie-breaker, we have included further guidance on how far beyond the period of dual residence it may be necessary to consider where the period of dual residence is relatively short. Part 2 – Tax residence of companies  A new example (Example | Tauira 29) in relation to a foreign-incorporated, sole- director personal services company has been included.  The discussion has been updated for legislative changes in relation to imputation and loss grouping, following the Australian High Court decision in Bywater Investments Ltd & Ors v Commissioner of Taxation; Hua Wang Bank Berhad v Commissioner of Taxation \[2016\] HCA 45. The loss grouping examples have consequently been removed.  D iscussion has been added about: o how the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI) may modify the residence article in New Zealand’s DTAs; o Australia and New Zealand’s administrative approach to art 4 of the MLI; and o the potential of dual residence if central management and control is exercised in Australia, and a new example (Example | Tauira 30) has been included to illustrate this. IS XX/XX Reading guide | Issue date Page 3 of 3 Part 3 – Tax residence and trusts  The discussion has been updated to reflect changes in the trust rules.  Discussion has been added about: o the taxation of distributions (and a new table); o the new foreign exemption trust and domestic trust disclosure rules; and o dual resident trusts, DTAs, the MLI, and the fact Australia and New Zealand’s administrative approach to art 4 of the MLI does not apply to trusts.  The discussion is more fulsome about the impact of changes of residence of persons connected with the trust (that is, settlors, trustees and beneficiaries).
\[UNCLASSIFIED\] Income tax – short-stay accommodation Reference: PUB00487 Reading guide for public consultation Why are we consulting on these items? In 2019, the Commissioner published six questions we’ve been asked (QWBAs) which explain the income tax implications of providing short-stay accommodation: QB 19/05, QB 19/06, QB 19/07, QB 19/08, QB 19/15, QB 19/16. Since 2019, there have been a number of legislative changes. Consequently, the Commissioner has decided to update these QWBAs. To assist rea ders, each draft QWBA has been given a reference that corresponds to the 2019 QWBA it updates. For example, QB XX/08 updates QB 19/08. What changes have been made? The main updates to the draft QWBAs are to reflect recent legislative changes. There has also been one relatively minor interpretive change of view. The changes are outlined below in more detail . The six 2019 QWBAs have also been put into our new template format and have been updated for consistency and plain English. QB 19/15 and QB 19/16 (t he two QWBAs on short-stay accommodation and trusts) have been merged into a single QWBA – QB XX/1516. The online marketplace rules (income tax implications only) The 2019 QWBAs pre-date the online marketplace rules. These rules require online marketplace operators (like Airbnb or Bookabach) to collect GST on supplies of listed services, which includes short-stay accommodation. The marketplace operator is then required to pass on a proportion of the GST to non-GST-registered suppliers via a flat-rate credit. GST-registered suppliers do not receive the flat-rate credit as they can deduct input tax from their expenses incurred in making supplies of short-stay accommodation. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 2 of 3 Income The flat-rate credit is currently treated as excluded income of the non-GST registered supplier. However, cl 14 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2024–2025, Emergency Response, and Remedial Measures) Bill proposes an amendment that would give a supplier the option to treat the flat-rate credit as assessable income. A supplier might do this so they can deduct all their expenses on a GST-inclusive basis, rather than having to apportion between GST- exclusive expenses (for supplies of listed services) and GST-inclusive expenses (for all other supplies). The draft QWBAs have been written on the basis that this amendment has been enacted . We do not intend to finalise and publish the draft QWBAs until the Bill has been enacted. Deductions For non-registered suppliers, expenses are currently deductible as follows:  Expenses that relate to nights the dwelling was rented through an online marketplace are deductible on a GST-exclusive basis.  Ex penses that relate to nights the dwelling was rented out other than through an online marketplace are deductible on a GST-inclusive basis.  Where expenses relate to both marketplace nights and non-marketplace nights, the expenses must be apportioned. GST-registered suppliers continue to deduct expenses on a GST-exclusive basis. However, under the proposed amendment in cl 29 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2024– 2025, Emergency Response, and Remedial Measures) Bill, if a supplier has opted to treat the flat-rate credit as assessable income, expenses that relate to marketplace nights are treated like all other expenses incurred by a non-registered supplier and are deductible on a GST- inclusive basis. Draft QWBAs QB XX/05, QB XX/07, QB XX/08 and QB XX/1516 include commentary on how the online marketplace rules apply, and new examples have also been added: Example 5 in QB XX/05, Example 2 in QB XX/07 and Example 3 in QB XX/08. Other substantive changes Other substantive changes to the draft QWBAs: IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 3 of 3  The 2019 QWBAs pre-date the residential rental ring-fencing rules. Under the ring- fencing rules, deductions for residential properties can only be used to offset income from those properties. There are updates to the following draft QWBAs as a result: QB XX/05, QB XX/07, QB XX/08 and QB XX/1516.  The 2019 QWBAs also pre-date the interest limitation rules, which restricted deductions for interest expenses incurred on certain residential rental properties. As these rules are now being gradually phased out, they are only referred to in footnotes in QB XX/07, QB XX/08, and QB XX/1516. However, QB XX/05 also clarifies that if the home you are renting out is your main home, the interest limitation rules do not apply.  A change in the Commissioner’s view regarding depreciation for mixed-use chattels. When calculating a depreciation deduction for mixed-use chattels, the formula in s EE 50(2) does not override the general permission, and therefore further apportionment is needed to account for any private use of the mixed-use chattels. This is addressed in Example 5 of QB XX/05.  An increase in the low value threshold for depreciation from $500 to $1,000 for items acquired on or after 17 March 2021. Updates are in QB XX/05 and QB XX/08.  An increase in the residual income tax threshold for provisional tax from $2,500 to $5,000. Updates are in QB XX/05, QB XX/07 and QB XX/08. Let us know what you think We are consulting on these items until 25 October 2024 and welcome all feedback. If you are familiar with the 2019 QWBAs and would like marked-up copies that highlight the substantive changes, please contact PublicConsultation@ird.govt.nz a nd we can email these to you.
EXPOSURE DRAFT - FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY | HUKIHUKI HURANGA - MŌ TE TĀKUPU ME TE MATAPAKI ANAKE Deadline for comment | Aukatinga mō te tākupu: 25 October 2024 Please quote reference | Whakahuatia te tohutoro: PUB00487a Send feedback to | Tukuna mai ngā whakahokinga kōrero ki public.consultation@ird.govt.nz Notes | Pitopito kōrero: This draft QWBA considers which rules apply where you rent out your home (or part of your home) or a separate dwelling on your property. We are interested in feedback on whether it is useful to cover all these scenarios in one item, or whether the analysis on renting out a separate dwelling on your property should be split off into another item. Clause 14 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2024–2025, Emergency Response, and Remedial Measures) Bill contains a proposed amendment that would give non-GST registered suppliers of listed services, which includes short-stay accommodation, the option to treat the flat-rate credit as assessable income instead of excluded income. A non-GST registered supplier might choose to do this so they can deduct all their expenses on a GST-inclusive basis, rather than having to apportion between GST- exclusive expenses (for supplies of listed services) and GST-inclusive expenses (for all other supplies). This draft QWBA has been prepared on the basis that this amendment will be enacted. It will not be finalised until the Bill has been enacted. QUESTIONS WE’VE BEEN ASKED | PĀTAI KUA UIA MAI Income tax – Which rules apply if I rent out my home, part of my home, or a separate dwelling on my property as short-stay accommodation? Issued | Tukuna: Issue date style Page 1 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date QB XX/05 This “question we’ve been asked” (QWBA) explains how the income tax rules apply if you occasionally rent out your home, a room in your home, or a separate dwelling on your property for short stays (for example, through Airbnb, Bookabach, Booking.com or Holiday Houses). Key provisions | Whakaratonga tāpua Income Tax Act 2007 – ss xxCH 5B, DB 2, EL 9 and GC 5 REPLACES | WHAKAKAPIA:  QB 19/05: What are my income tax obligations if I rent out my home or a separate dwelling on my property as short-stay accommodation? Question | Pātai Which rules apply if I rent out my home, part of my home, or a separate dwelling on my property as short-stay accommodation? Answer | Whakautu Renting out your home or part of your home If you rent out your home or part of your home as short-stay accommodation, any amounts you receive from guests will be rental income. However, you have different options for meeting your income tax obligations, depending on your circumstances:  You may be able to use standard costs set by the Commissioner for your expenses. If you use this approach, your rental income up to the level of the standard costs will be exempt income. You only have to declare the rental income in excess of the standard costs.  If you cannot use the standard cost approach, or you do not want to, your deductions will be based on your actual expenses related to earning the Page 2 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date rental income. This is known as the actual cost approach. Some of those expenses will only be partly deductible because they also relate to your private use of the home. If you use the actual cost approach and you are:  not GST-registered: o and have opted to treat the flat-rate credit as excluded income, expenses that relate to rental income from an online marketplace are deductible on a GST-exclusive basis and expenses that relate to rental income from other sources are deductible on a GST-inclusive basis. o and have opted to treat the flat-rate credit as assessable income, all your expenses that relate to rental income (from an online marketplace or otherwise) are deductible on a GST-inclusive basis.  GST-registered, expenses are deductible on a GST-exclusive basis. Renting out a separate dwelling on the same property as your home If you rent out a separate dwelling on the same property as your home for short-stay accommodation, different income tax rules could apply, depending on your situation. Key terms | Kīanga tau tāpua Guest means a person provided with short-stay accommodation in return for payment. Online marketplace means an electronic platform like a website, app or internet portal that sellers use to market and sell their short-stay accommodation. It does not include an online marketplace that only processes payments. Short-stay accommodation means accommodation provided for up to four consecutive weeks in a dwelling that is not the guest’s ordinary residence. It does not include accommodation provided to residential tenants, boarders or care home residents, and it does not include student or emergency accommodation. Explanation | Whakamāramatanga 1. Different income tax rules apply depending on whether you are renting out your own home or part of your home, or a separate dwelling on the same property. Page 3 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date Renting out a separate dwelling on the same property as your home 2. If you rent out a separate dwelling on the same property as your home (for example, a sleep-out or cottage on the property) for short-stay accommodation, different income tax rules could apply, depending on your situation. 3. The dwelling is considered a separate asset. If the dwelling is only rented out and never used privately, all the rental income will be taxable, and you can fully deduct your non-capital expenses in relation to the dwelling (subject to needing to claim these deductions on a GST-exclusive basis). 4. If, in addition to sometimes renting out the dwelling, you also sometimes use it privately, the dwelling will either fall under the mixed-use asset rules or the standard tax rules. To work out which rules apply, see QB XX/06: Income Tax – Which rules apply if I have a dwelling I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and also sometimes use privately? However, if the dwelling is separate from your home, but there are shared common areas (for example, the dwelling is a sleep-out and guests share a bathroom located in your home), expenses relating to that part of your home are partially deductible. Example | Tauira 3 i llustrates this. Renting out your home or part of your home 5. If you rent out your home or part of your home as short-stay accommodation, any amounts you receive from guests will be taxable as rental income. The activity does not need to be run as a business for the amounts you receive to be rental income. 6. Depending on your circumstances, you may have two options for meeting your tax obligations (summarised in Table | Tūtohi 1):  the standard-cost approach, or  the actual-cost approach. 7. If you meet certain criteria, you can calculate your deductions using a formula set by the Commissioner, which is based on a set deductible amount for each rental night. This is referred to as the standard-cost approach. If you use this approach, you do not declare income from the rental activity, up to the amount you calculate under the formula (your standard costs). You only need to declare rental income you make to the extent it exceeds your standard costs. This approach is easier, because you do not have to work out your actual deductible expenses, which would require some of the expenses being apportioned. The criteria you must meet to use this approach are set out at \[9\]. Page 4 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date 8. If you cannot use the standard-cost approach, or you do not want to, your deductions will be based on your actual costs related to earning the rental income. This is referred to as the actual-cost approach. Expenses that relate solely to your rental activity (for example, advertising fees) are fully deductible (subject to these deductions needing to be claimed on a GST-exclusive basis). 1 How ever, mixed expenses, that relate to both your rental activity and your own use of your home (for example, home loan interest, home insurance and rates), must be apportioned. This QWBA will help you understand how to calculate the percentage of your mixed expenses that’s tax deductible. Table | Tūtohi 1 – Comparison of standard-cost and actual-cost approaches Standard-cost approach Actual-cost approach Rental income up to the amount of your standard costs is exempt income. You do not include this income in your tax return. The amount of rental income in excess of your standard costs is assessable income. You need to include that amount in your tax return. You cannot claim deductions for any of your actual expenses that are covered by the standard-cost approach in DET 19/02: Standard-cost household service for short- stay accommodation providers. All the rental income is assessable income and must be declared. You can claim associated expenses and depreciation losses as deductions. You need to work out how much you can deduct, bearing in mind that:  The starting point is that expenses that relate solely to the rental activity (for example, advertising) are fully deductible.  Mixed expenses (for example, home loan interest, home insurance and rates), must be apportioned.  Depreciation losses for chattels used both privately and by paying guests must be apportioned.  Your deductions may need to be claimed on a GST-exclusive basis. 2 1 See from \[34\]. 2 See from \[34\]. Page 5 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date If you are not the only owner of the property, you will need to think about who should declare the rental income – see from \[58\]. Can I use the standard-cost determination for short-stay accommodation providers? 9. You can use the standard-cost approach in DET 19/02: Standard-cost household service for short-stay accommodation providers, if:  y ou are a natural person (an individual not a company),  you rent out a room or rooms in your home to guests for short-stay accommodation (no more than four consecutive weeks),  you do not rent out rooms in your home for more than 100 nights in the income year (counting each room that is rented out separately),  the property is not held in a trust, or if it is you paid all the costs for the income year for the use of the property (for example, home loan interest or rent, home insurance, rates, and repairs and maintenance),  you do not provide the short-stay accommodation service as part of a GST taxable activity,  your home is not used in the income year to provide both a short-stay accommodation service and a private boarding service (as defined in DET 19/01: St andard-cost household service for boarding service providers or any determination that replaces DET 19/01),  neither you nor anyone else applies any other standard-cost household service determination in relation to services provided in the home (for example, DET 09/02: St andard-cost household service for childcare providers), and  no one claims deductions for actual costs incurred in relation to the use of your home to provide accommodation to others, such as flatmates, for any time in the income year when the short-stay accommodation service is provided. 10. If you meet all these criteria and choose to use the standard-cost approach for the income year, the rest of this QWBA will not be relevant to you. If you choose to use the standard-cost approach, DET 19/02 ex plains what you need to do to meet your income tax obligations. 11. You can only use the standard-cost approach for income years in which you meet the criteria. If you do not meet the criteria for a particular income year, you will need to base your deductions for that year on your actual costs, which will involve apportioning Page 6 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date some expenses. This QWBA explains how the rules work if you have to, or choose to, use the actual-cost approach. Can I use the standard-cost determination for boarders instead? 12. A separate determination sets standard costs for expenses for people who receive income from private boarders. You cannot use that determination for income from providing short-stay accommodation. This is because short-stay accommodation guests are not boarders. A boarder is someone who lives in your home and receives meals, in return for payment. To be a boarder, the person must actually live in your home and use it as their normal residence for a period (often this is a year or a semester). Someone who pays to stay in your home for a short period and is not using it as their normal residence is not a boarder. This QWBA calls these people “guests”. 13. If you receive income from both boarders and short-stay accommodation guests, you cannot use either of the standard-cost determinations. You need to use your actual costs for your deductions. If I am using the actual-cost approach, what portion of my expenses can I claim deductions for? 14. As noted in Table | Tūtohi 1, if you are using the actual-cost approach the starting point is that some of your expenses are fully deductible and some are only be partly deductible. This is because some of your expenses (for example, home loan interest, home insurance and rates) relate partly to your rental activity and partly to your own private use of your home. 15. You can also claim deductions for the depreciation of the chattels in your home that paying guests can use. But, as with your mixed expenses, you can only claim for part of the depreciation for chattels that are used both privately and by paying guests. 16. While the starting point is that the above expenses may be fully deductible, if you rent the dwelling through an online marketplace, your deduction may need to be claimed on a GST-exclusive basis. This is discussed from \[34\]. 17. The following will help you work out what deductions you may claim – and will help you calculate what percentage of your mixed expenses and depreciation is tax deductible. Page 7 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date Expenses that may be fully deductible – relate solely to rental activity 18. You may be allowed to fully deduct expenses that relate solely to your rental activity. These expenses might include:  advertising costs, including any commissions or fees you pay to an advertising platform or transaction facilitator (this does not include any service fees the guests pay the platform – just fees you pay),  supplies used solely by your paying guests (for example, if you provide them with a welcome basket of breakfast food or chocolates),  any additional home or contents insurance premium you pay (over what you would otherwise pay) because of the rental activity, and  any additional rates you pay (over what the normal residential rates would be) because of the rental activity. 19. You may have some expenses that you can split between being related solely to your rental activity and being mixed rental and private expenses. For example, expenses that have a fixed component and a usage component, like power. If you can identify actual usage charges for a period where your home was only rented out and not used privately at all, you do not have to apportion the usage component for that period – it is fully deductible. The fixed charge component still needs to be apportioned, as it is necessary to maintain a power connection, which is used both privately and by paying guests. 20. While the starting point is that the above expenses may be fully deductible, if you rent the dwelling through an online marketplace, your deduction may need to be claimed on a GST-exclusive basis. This is discussed from \[34\]. Expenses that are non-deductible – relate solely to private use 21. Expenses that relate solely to the private use of your home are not deductible. Similarly, any consumables you use in your home are not deductible. However, if you have consumables you use in your home that are also available for guests to use (for example, tea, coffee, olive oil, shampoo, and soap), those consumables are partly deductible. 22. If you vacate your home while it is being rented out as short-stay accommodation and you need to pay for alternative accommodation for yourself (such as a hotel), the cost of that alternative accommodation is not deductible as it is private expenditure. Page 8 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date Expenses that are partly deductible –relate to both rental activity and private use 23. You can only claim deductions for part of any expenses that relate to both your rental activity and the private use of your home. These mixed expenses might include:  interest on your home loan, 3  repairs and maintenance, 4  home and content insurance premiums (or what the premiums would be if you have to pay more because of the rental activity),  rates (or what the normal residential rates would be if you have to pay more because of the rental activity),  power bills (but see \[19\], and  internet. 24. In most situations where you rent out all or part of your home you need to work out what proportion of these mixed expenses you can claim. Y ou need to take into account:  the floor area of different parts of your house, and  the number of nights during the income year that the room was rented out. 25. If there is a reasonable basis for apportioning a particular expense other than on floor area, you can use that. 26. While less common, in some situations instead of using the number of nights the room was actually rented out to apportion mixed expenses, you can use the periods it was either rented out or available to be rented out. This is explained below from \[29\]. 3 If the home you are renting out is your main home, the interest limitation rules do not apply (s EL 9). However, the actual amount claimed needs to be apportioned for any private use. See IS 23/04: The interest limitation rules and short-stay accommodation. If the home you are renting out is not your main home, from 1 April 2024, up to 80% of the interest on your home loan can be claimed, and from 1 April 2025 up to 100% of the interest can be claimed. The actual amount claimed needs to be apportioned for any private use. 4 Deductible repairs and maintenance expenditure does not include expenditure on capital improvements (see IS 12/03: Income tax – Deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure – general principles). Page 9 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date How to apportion mixed expenses based on the number of rental nights and floor area 27. Generally, you should apportion mixed expenses, like those at \[23\], based on the floor area that the guest has exclusive use of, as a proportion of the total floor area of your house. You may also add a reasonable amount based on the guest’s access to common areas – Inland Revenue will accept 50% as a reasonable amount in most situations. Generally, where you rent a room in your house you may only claim expenses for nights the room was rented out. Example | Tauira 1 – Apportioning mixed expenses based on the number of rental nights and floor area Hayley has a two-bedroom villa. She uses the second bedroom occasionally as an office, or as a bedroom when friends or family stay. She decides to rent out the second bedroom through an online marketplace to make some extra money. When she rents out the room, the guests are also able to use some common areas in the villa – the lounge, dining room, kitchen, laundry, and main bathroom. Hayley rents out the room for 120 nights during the income year. The floor areas of the different parts of Hayley’s villa are shown in the diagram below. Hayley should apportion her mixed expenses on the following basis: Used exclusively by guests – 100% deductible for days the room is rented out Common areas – 50% deductible for days someone is renting the bedroom Private area – 0% deductible 20m² 55m 2 25m 2 Page 10 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date Hayley must calculate what proportion of her mixed expenses she can deduct for the areas of the house used exclusively by guests, and what proportion she can deduct for the common areas. The results of those calculations are then added together. The areas used exclusively by guests are 20m 2 out of the total 100m 2 floor area of the villa, and are 100% deductible for the 120 out of 365 days in the year that the room is rented out: The common areas, able to be used by both Hayley and guests, are 55m 2 out of the total 100m 2 floor area of the villa, and are 50% deductible for the 120 out of 365 days in the year that the room is rented out: Adding these figures (6.58% and 9.04%) together, Hayley calculates she can deduct 15.62% of her mixed expenses for the income year. Her mixed expenses include her power and internet bills, the interest on her home loan, her home and contents insurance premiums, and her rates. In addition, Hayley can fully deduct her expenses that relate solely to the rental activity (other than the GST component). These expenses include the cost of advertising the room for rent, her host service fees, the sheets and towels she bought for guests to use (she only uses those for guests renting out the room), and the tea, coffee, sugar, cereal and milk the guests use. As Hayley is not GST-registered and has opted to treat the flat-rate credit as excluded income, and as her rental income relates to nights when part of her home was rented through an online marketplace, her expenses are deducted on a GST-exclusive basis. This is discussed in more detail from \[34\] and in Example | Tauira 5. 28. If you rent out your whole house for a period, and the guests have access to the whole house, you do not need to use the floor area calculations. Your apportionment for that period would be based only on the number of nights the house is rented out. Page 11 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date Example | Tauira 2 – Apportioning mixed expenses based on the number of rental nights Jason and Kim are saving for an overseas holiday and decide to rent out their apartment for four weeks during a high-profile sporting event in their city. They found their guests through a friend who had family wanting to come to town for the event. Jason and Kim stay with Jason’s parents during this time. Jason and Kim should apportion their mixed expenses on the following basis: The whole apartment is used exclusively by guests for 28 out of the 365 days in the income year, and the mixed expenses are 100% deductible for that period: Therefore, Jason and Kim can deduct 7.67% of their mixed expenses for the income year. Their mixed expenses include 28 days’ worth of the daily fixed charge for their power connection, internet, the interest on their home loan, their home and contents insurance premiums, and their rates. In addition, Jason and Kim may deduct 100% of their expenses that relate solely to the rental activity. These expenses include the cost of advertising the apartment for rent, their host service fees, the power usage charges for the period (if this cannot be identified precisely an average may be used), and supplies used by the guest (for example, cleaning products, toilet paper, and pantry staples). Jason and Kim are not GST-registered. However, because their rental income does not relate to nights when their home was rented through an online marketplace, their expenses are deducted on a GST-inclusive basis. This is discussed in more detail from \[34\]. How to apportion mixed expenses based on availability 29. As noted in \[26\], while less common, in some situations instead of using the number of nights the space was actually rented out as a basis for apportioning mixed expenses, you can use the periods it is either rented out or available to be rented out. 30. For a room in your home, you could only do this where you do not use the room at all, including for storage, and it is essentially not used as part of your home. This would be difficult to show, as in most situations it would be expected that expenses for a room Page 12 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date in your own home are private expenses for periods when the room is not actually rented out. One example where you might be able to show otherwise is if you operate a bed and breakfast with high occupancy, in your home, so the rental rooms are essentially not used as part of your home. Example | Tauira 4 covers a situation like this. 31. Another situation where availability could potentially be used is if you have a separate dwelling on the same property as your home that is not used as part of your home and is not a mixed-use asset. For example, a sleep-out that is only rented out and not used privately at all, or a sleep-out that is rented out and used privately but is not unused for 62 days or more in the year. In those situations, the mixed-use asset rules would not apply – see QB XX/06. Example | Tauira 3 covers a situation like this. 32. In situations where you can use the periods the space is either rented out or available to be rented out and not used privately, you need to have evidence that shows when the space was available to be rented out. Example | Tauira 3 – Apportioning mixed expenses based on availability – a separate dwelling from your home Melanie and Alistair live in a popular wine region, and regularly rent out the sleep-out in their garden. They do not use the sleep-out themselves for anything. The sleep-out is advertised year-round, and in the last income year it was available for rent at all times other than for six weeks (42 nights) when Melanie’s parents came to stay and used the sleep-out. In the income year, the sleep-out was used to earn income and was also used privately by Melanie’s parents. Melanie and Alistair used QB XX/06 to work out the sleep-out is not a mixed-use asset for the income year because it was only unused for 58 days. The sleep-out needs to have been unused for 62 days or more to be a mixed-use asset. Therefore, the rules in this QWBA apply. The sleep-out does not have a bathroom, so guests who stay there use the main bathroom in Melanie and Alistair’s house, which can be accessed from the garden. The sleep-out is on a separate power connection from the house. Guests can use Melanie and Alistair’s wi-fi. There are tea and coffee facilities in the sleep-out, and guests can order a cooked breakfast for an additional charge. Melanie and Alistair rented out the sleep-out for 265 nights during the income year. The floor areas of the different parts of the property are shown in the diagram below. Page 13 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date Melanie and Alistair should apportion their mixed expenses on the following basis: Used exclusively by guests – 100% deductible for days the sleep-out is rented out or available to be rented out, as it is not used by Melanie and Alistair Common areas – 50% deductible for days someone is renting the sleep-out Private area – 0% deductible Melanie and Alistair have to calculate what proportion of their mixed expenses they can deduct for the sleep-out, which was used exclusively by guests, and rented or available for rent for all but six weeks (42 nights) of the year, and what proportion they can deduct for the common area (the shared bathroom). T he results of those calculations are then added together. The sleep-out, used exclusively by guests, is 12m 2 out of the total 132m 2 floor area of the dwellings on the property, and is 100% deductible for the 323 out of 365 nights in the income year that it was either rented out or available to be rented out: 12m² 10m 2 110m 2 Page 14 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date The common area, the shared bathroom, which is able to be used by Melanie and Alistair and guests, is 10m 2 out of the total 132m 2 floor area of the dwellings on the property, and is 50% deductible for the 265 out of 365 nights in the income year that the sleep-out is rented out: Adding these figures (8.04% and 2.75 %) together, Melanie and Alistair calculate that they can deduct 10.79% of their mixed expenses for the income year. Their mixed expenses include their internet expenses, the interest on their home loan, their property and contents insurance premiums, and their rates. Because the sleep-out is on a separate power connection from the house, Melanie and Alistair may deduct 100% of the power bills for the sleep-out for the 323 out of 365 nights in the year that it is either rented out or available to be rented out. In addition, Melanie and Alistair can fully deduct their expenses that relate solely to the rental activity. These expenses include the cost of advertising the sleep-out for rent, the host service fees, and the tea and coffee supplies in the sleep-out. The amounts Melanie and Alistair receive for cooked breakfasts are income, and they can deduct the cost of the ingredients used. All expenses are deducted on a GST-exclusive basis because Melanie and Alistair are GST-registered. This is discussed in more detail from \[34\]. 33. As noted in \[24\], where you occasionally rent out a room in your home, normally you need to apportion your mixed expenses based on the number of nights the room is actually rented out (as shown in Example | Tauira 1). This is because when you are not renting out the room, those expenses are purely private expenses related to keeping your home. However, the following example shows a situation where the Commissioner would accept that the mixed expenses could be apportioned based on the availability of the rooms for rent. Page 15 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date Example | Tauira 4 – Apportioning mixed expenses based on availability – space within your home Josh and Sarah run a bed and breakfast (B&B) from their home in a tourism hotspot. The B&B has four bedrooms, each with an ensuite, which are advertised year-round and are available for rent at any time other than for three weeks in winter, when Josh and Sarah take a holiday. Guests can use a sunroom and a billiard room. If guests wish to dine in, meals can be enjoyed in the dining room, or room service can be requested. The B&B has approximately 60% occupancy, and Josh and Sarah had guests in at least one room for 300 days during the income year. The floor areas of the different parts of the B&B are shown in the diagram below. Josh and Sarah should apportion their mixed expenses on the following basis: Used exclusively for the B&B operations – 100% deductible Used exclusively by guests – 100% deductible for days the rooms are rented out or available to be rented out, as they are not used by Josh and Sarah Common areas – 50% deductible for days someone is renting a room in the B&B Private area – 0% deductible 100m² 120m 2 25m 2 15m² Page 16 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date Josh and Sarah must calculate what proportion of their mixed expenses they may deduct for the:  office and storage area, which is used exclusively for B&B operations,  rental rooms, which are used exclusively by guests and are available for rent for 49 weeks of the year, and  common areas. They then need to add the results of those calculations together. The office and storage area, used exclusively for B&B operations, is 15m 2 out of the 260m 2 total floor area of the house, and is 100% deductible as it is only used in relation to the rental activity: The rental rooms, used exclusively by guests, are 100m 2 out of the total 260m 2 floor area of the house, and are 100% deductible for the 49 out of 52 weeks in the year that the rooms are either rented out or available to be rented out: The common areas, which are used by Josh and Sarah and guests, are 120m 2 out of the total 260m 2 floor area of the house, and are 50% deductible for the 300 out of 365 days in the year that at least one of the rooms is rented out: Adding these figures (5.77%, 36.24% and 18.97%) together, Josh and Sarah calculate that they can deduct 60.98% of their mixed expenses for the income year. Their mixed expenses include their power bills, internet expenses, the interest on their home loan, the amount of their property insurance premium that equates to what their premium would be if they did not run the B&B from the property, and the portion of their rates that they would have to pay if they did not run the B&B from the property (what normal residential rates would be for the property). In addition, Josh and Sarah can fully deduct their expenses that relate solely to the rental activity. These expenses include: Page 17 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date  the cost of advertising the rooms for rent,  the host service fees,  the amount they pay in additional property insurance premiums (over what they’d pay if they did not run the B&B from the property),  the amount they pay in additional rates (over what the normal residential rates would be) because they run the B&B from the property, and  bathroom supplies for the rooms. The amounts Josh and Sarah receive for meals purchased by guests are income, and they can deduct the costs of providing those meals. All expenses are deducted on a GST-exclusive basis because Josh and Sarah are GST- registered. This is discussed in more detail from \[34\]. Online marketplace rules If you are not GST-registered 34. If you are not GST-registered and rent out your home, part of your home, or a separate dwelling on your property as short-stay accommodation through an online marketplace like Airbnb, Bookabach, Booking.com or Holiday Houses, the marketplace operator will give you a flat-rate credit of 8.5% of the value of the supply of short-stay accommodation. 35. You have the option to treat the flat-rate credit as either:  excluded income (which is not subject to income tax, so is not included in your income tax return), or  assessable income (which is included in your income tax return). (Section xxCH 5B). 36. If you opt to treat the flat-rate credit as assessable income, all your expenses are deducted on a GST-inclusive basis (s DB 2). 37. However, if you opt to treat the flat-rate credit as excluded income:  Expenses that relate to nights when the dwelling was rented through an online marketplace are deducted on a GST-exclusive basis. This is because the flat- rate credit you receive from the online marketplace is intended to recognise the Page 18 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date GST on the expenses you incur when deriving this income, that you would be able to deduct as input tax in your GST return if you were GST-registered.  Expenses that relate to nights when the dwelling was rented out other than through an online marketplace, or was available to be rented out, are deducted on a GST-inclusive basis. (Section DB 2). 38. If you have opted to treat the flat-rate credit as excluded income, and you have expenses that relate to both nights when the dwelling was rented through an online marketplace and nights when the dwelling was rented out other than through an online marketplace or was available to be rented out, these expenses must be apportioned. 39. Depreciation continues to be calculated on the GST-inclusive price of the asset. This is the position, even if you rent your home through an online marketplace. Example | Tauira 5 – Apportioning expenses where a person is not GST-registered, has opted to treat the flat-rate credit as excluded income, and their dwelling is rented both through and online marketplace and in some other way The facts are the same as in Example | Tauira 1, with the exceptions noted below. Hay ley rents out the room for 120 nights in the income year. Sixty of those nights we re rented out through an online marketplace and the remaining 60 were rented previous guests contacting Hayley directly. In Example | Tauira 1, Ha yl ey has calculated that she can deduct 15.62% of her mixed expenses for the income year. However, because she is not GST-registered and has opted to treat the flat-rate credit as excluded income, she needs to deduct her expenses that that relate to the online marketplace nights on a GST-exclusive basis. Her expenses that relate to non-online marketplace nights (the direct bookings) are deducted on a GST-inclusive basis. The table below sets out Hayley’s expenses and how she should calculate the deductions she can claim: Expense Amount Amount apportioned to income-earning Deduction Page 19 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date Commission charged by online marketplace $180 (incl. GST) 100% = $180 (incl. GST) $180 ÷ 1.15 5 = $156.52 (excl. GST) Interest on her home loan for the property $10,000 (GST exempt) 15.62% = $1,562 $1,562 Repairs and maintenance and other mixed expenses such as rates and property insurance $10,000 (incl. GST) 15.62% = $ 1,562 (incl. GST) Online marketplace nights: 60 (out of 120 rental nights). 60/120 x $1,562 = $781 (incl GST) ÷ 1.15 = $679.13 (excl. GST) deduction for online marketplace nights Non-online marketplace nights: 60 (out of 120 rental nights). 60/120 x $1,562 = $781 (incl. GST) deduction for non-online marketplace nights Total deduction for repairs and maintenance: $679.13 + $781 = $1,460.13 Online marketplace commission: Hay ley does not need to apportion the commission charged by the online marketplace as it relates only to the rental activity. But her deduction must be claimed on a GST-exclusive basis. The $180 commission charged is divided by 1.15 to give a GST-exclusive deduction of $156.52. Interest on her home loan for the property: From the 2025-2026 income year, Hay ley can claim up to 100% of the interest on her property loan. However, this interest needs to be apportioned between private use and income-earning use. Therefore, Hay ley can deduct 15.62% of $10,000 which is $1,562. GST is not applied to interest, so there is no need for any further calculations for the online marketplace nights. 5 Dividing the amount apportioned to income-earning by 1.15 gives you the GST-exclusive amount. Page 20 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date Repairs and maintenance and other mixed expenses: On the same basis as for interest, 15.62% of the $10,000 expense for repairs and maintenance, is attributable to income-earning. This is $1,562 (incl. GST). The proportion of the expenses that relates to online marketplace nights is 50% (as 60 out of the 120 nights Hayley’s home is rent out through an online marketplace), so $781 (incl. GST). This amount is then divided by 1.15 to give a GST-exclusive amount of $679.13 (excl. GST). The proportion of the expenses that relates to non-online marketplace nights is also 50%, so $781 (incl. GST). Therefore, the total amount of the repairs and maintenance and other mixed expenses deduction is $1,460.13 ($679.13 + $781). Hayley’s total deduction in relation to the rental activity is therefore $3,178.65 ($156.52 + $1,562 + $1,460.13). If Hayley had opted to treat the flat-rate credit as assessable income, she would not need to undertake any apportionment for GST – all her expenses would be deductible on a GST-inclusive basis. If you are GST-registered 40. If you are GST-registered, a flat-rate credit is not provided, and expenses and depreciation are deductible on a GST-exclusive basis. Depreciation of chattels 41. As noted at \[15\], you can also claim deductions for the depreciation of the chattels in your home that paying guests can use. Depreciation deductions reflect that chattels in your home are subject to wear and tear, resulting in a reduction in their value while being used to earn income. 42. If the chattels are only used by guests (for example, chattels in a bedroom you only use for renting out), the full amount of depreciation will be deductible. 43. However, you can only claim for part of the depreciation on mixed-use chattels. Mixed-use chattels include chattels in common areas that guests are able to use, and chattels in a room you rent out and also use privately. Page 21 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date 44. The approach to working out how much depreciation you can claim each year for mixed-use chattels is similar to the approach to apportioning mixed expenses. But it does differ slightly, as there is a specific apportionment formula in the Income Tax Act 2007 for depreciation of assets partly used to earn income. 45. Before you can apply the formula, you need to work out the depreciation loss for the income year for each asset. 46. For low value items ($1,0 00 or less), 6 the depreciation loss is the item’s cost. If the item is part of a group of items you purchased at the same time from the same supplier, and the items would have the same depreciation rate, the $1,0 00 threshold applies to the group of items. For example, if you bought $2,000 worth of linen at one time, you would have to depreciate the linen using one of the methods mentioned at \[47\]. 47. For other items, you work out the depreciation loss for the income year using either the diminishing value method or the straight-line method. There is information about those methods on Inland Revenue’s website , and you can find the relevant depreciation rates using Inland Revenue’s depreciation rate finder – available on Inland Revenue’s website . 48. Whichever method you use, you cannot pool assets to depreciate them as a single asset if they are partly used privately – so you will not be able to use the pooled approach for the chattels in the common areas of your home that guests can use, or for chattels in a room you rent out and also use privately. 49. Once you know the depreciation losses for the year for the chattels in your home that are both used privately and able to be used by paying guests, you need to work out what proportion of those losses you may deduct. To do this, multiply those losses by: Where – “a” is: nights in the year the space (the room, or the whole house) is rented out “b” is: nights in the year the space is available to be rented out and the mixed-use chattels are not used privately “c” is: nights in the year the mixed-use chattels are used or available for any purpose 50. For mixed-use chattels in common areas, item “b” in the formula would typically be zero. This is because when the room you rent out is available for rent, you are still 6 For items acquired on or after 17 March 2021. a + b c Page 22 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date using the chattels in your lounge or other common areas for private use. However, this would not be the case if, for example, you were away overseas and renting out your whole house for short stays. In that situation, for the periods in between paying guests, you would not be using the chattels for private use, so those days the house is vacant would be counted in item “b”. Example | Tauira 6 illustrates how to calculate a depreciation deduction for mixed-use chattels. Example | Tauira 6 – Calculating a deduction for depreciation of mixed-use chattels Jasper rents out the spare room in his house for short stays. When he has paying guests, they can use the lounge, dining room, kitchen, laundry and bathroom. Jasper rents out the room for a total of 120 nights during the year. Jasper does not use the spare room at all. Jasper may deduct the full depreciation loss he calculates for the chattels in the spare room, as these are only used by paying guests. Jasper calculates that he may deduct 16.44% of his depreciation losses in respect of the chattels in the common areas of the house that paying guests can use: The formula is multiplied by 50 to recognise the private use of the chattels in common areas on nights when the spare room is rented out (see \[ 27\]) . (Inland Revenue accepts 50% as a reasonable amount in most situations). If Jasper was away for work for 30 nights during the year, the calculation would remain the same. While Jasper did not use the chattels in the common areas privately on those days, they were also not available to be used by paying guests, as Jasper only rents out the spare room when he is home. 51. If you are GST-registered, you calculate depreciation on the GST-exclusive price of the asset. If you are not registered for GST, you claim depreciation on the GST-inclusive price of the asset. This is the position, even if you have opted to treat the flat-rate credit as excluded income and rent your dwelling through an online marketplace. Losses and the residential rental ring-fencing rules 52. If you rent out your home, a room in your home, or a separate dwelling on your property for short stays the residential rental ring-fencing rules are unlikely to apply. Page 23 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date 53. The residential rental ring-fencing rules mean you can only claim deductions for expenses incurred on your property, up to the amount of income you earned from the property in the income year. 7 If your allowable deductions exceed the income from the property, 8 the excess deductions must be carried forward to future income years. You cannot offset the excess amount against other income, such as salary or wages. 54. However, these rules do not apply if you use more than 50% of the land for most of the income year as your main home (this is known as the “main home exclusion”). 9 Your main home is the dwelling you use as a residence (or if you have more than one residence, the one you have the greatest connection with). 55. If you have a separate dwelling (such as a sleep-out or cottage) on the same land as your main home (for example, they are on the same legal title), as long as 50% of the land is used as your main home for most of the income year, the residential rental ring- fencing rules will not apply. 56. However, if you rent out a separate dwelling on your property and it is subject to the mixed-use asset rules, the mixed-use asset expenditure quarantine rules may apply if the rental activity is loss-making – see QB XX/06. 57. More details on the residential rental ring-fencing rules can be found on the Inland Revenue website or in the Appendix to IS 23/04: T he interest limitation rules and short-stay accommodation (from A48). Who must declare the income? 58. The rental income belongs to the owner of the land (including leasehold land) and they must declare it to Inland Revenue. If there is more than one owner, the income needs to be split appropriately between them. 59. If the land is owned in a trust, the rules about who must declare the income are more complicated. See QB XX/1516: Income tax – If property held in a trust is rented out 7 Or, if the property is part of a portfolio of residential rental properties you own, you can only claim deductions for expenses incurred on the portfolio of properties up to the amount of income you earned from the portfolio in the income year. 8 Or portfolio of properties, if you have one. 9 The main home exclusion will also apply if the residential land is trust property and more than 50% of the land is used for most of the income year by a beneficiary of the trust as their main home and no principal settlor of the trust has a separate main home. Page 24 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date for short-stay accommodation, who declares the income, and what deductions can be claimed? for more detailed guidance. 60. If you lease the property and use it to earn income, you should ensure you are paying an adequate rent for the property to the extent you use the property for the income- earning. If you do not, in certain circumstances the Commissioner can determine an amount of adequate rent and you will be treated as deriving this amount as rental income (s GC 5). This rule ensures that property cannot be leased between (for example) relatives or different entities for low or nominal rent to shift income for a tax benefit. What records do I need to keep? 61. You need to keep records of:  the number of nights you rent out your home, room, or separate dwelling on your property,  how much income you receive for renting out your home, room, or dwelling, and  any expenses you may claim deductions for. Provisional tax 62. If the residual income tax you have to pay at the end of the year, after you have filed your tax return, is more than $5,000, you will have to pay provisional tax the following year. This means you will pay your income in instalments during the year. The Inland Revenue website has further information about provisional tax.

Issued | Tukuna: Issue date style QB XX/06 This “question we’ve been asked” (QWBA) helps you work out which income tax rules apply to a dwelling you sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation (for example, through Airbnb, Bookabach, Booking.com or Holiday Houses) and also sometimes use privately (for example, a s a holiday home). REPLACES | WHAKAKAPIA:  QB 19/06: What income tax rules apply if I have a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use myself? (Inland Revenue, 20 May 2019) Page 1 of 7 QB XX/XX | Issue date Question | Pātai Which income tax rules apply if I have a dwelling I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and also sometimes use privately? Answer | Whakautu Different rules could apply in this situation, and this can change from year to year. At the end of each income year, you need to work out which rules apply:  the mixed-use asset rules, or  the standard tax rules. The rules that apply will determine the income tax treatment for that dwelling. The main difference between the mixed-use asset rules and the standard tax rules is how you calculate the proportion of expenses you can deduct. This QWBA helps you work out which income tax rules apply to the dwelling for each income year. You need to revisit which rules apply each year. Key terms | Kīanga tau tāpua Guest means a person provided with short-stay accommodation in return for payment. Mixed-use asset means an asset that is used both privately and to earn income, and is also unused for at least 62 days in the year. This would include many holiday homes. Short-stay accommodation means accommodation provided for up to four consecutive weeks in a dwelling that is not the guest’s ordinary residence. It does not include accommodation provided to residential tenants, boarders or care home residents, and it does not include student or emergency accommodation. Explanation | Whakamāramatanga 1. If you have a dwelling you sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and also sometimes use privately, you need to work out which income tax rules apply so you can meet your tax obligations. The dwelling could be a holiday house or a separate dwelling on the same property you live on (for example, a sleepout or cottage). 2. Depending on your circumstances, the dwelling will either fall under:  the mixed-use asset rules, or Page 2 of 7 QB XX/XX | Issue date  the standard tax rules. 3. This QWBA explains how to work out which income tax rules apply in your situation. Mixed-use asset rules or standard tax rules? 4. The mixed-use asset rules deal with deductions for certain assets (including land) that are used both privately and to earn income but are also unused for significant periods during the year. 5. Under both the mixed-use asset rules and the standard tax rules, expenses that relate solely to the use of the asset to derive income are generally fully deductible and expenses that relate solely to private use of the asset are not deductible. 6. The main difference between the two sets of rules is the method for calculating the deductible proportion of expenses for the asset that relate to both income-earning and private use. Under the mixed-use asset rules, this is based on the amount of income- earning use relative to the total use of the asset during the income year. Under the standard tax rules, this is based on the amount of time the asset is used for income- earning or available for income-earning during the income year. 7. The factor that determines which rules apply is whether the asset is unused for 62 days or more during an income year. Figure | Hoahoa 1 – Do the mixed-use asset rules or the standard tax rules apply? Page 3 of 7 QB XX/XX | Issue date 8. A dwelling can flip in and out of the mixed-use asset rules from one year to the next, so you need to look at which rules are relevant to the dwelling for each income year (for most people this is 1 April – 31 March). The mixed-use asset rules can apply to most ownership structures, so it does not matter if you own the property or if it i s owned by another entity or held in another structure such as a trust or a family company. 9. The dwelling will be a mixed-use asset if, during the income year it was:  used it to earn income,  used privately (this includes use by family members, or by friends renting it for “mates’ rates” that are less than 80% of the market value rent), and  not used for at least 62 days in the year. Standard tax rules 10. If the dwelling does not meet the three criteria at \[9\] for an income year, the standard tax rules will apply. QB XX/08: Income tax – How do the standard tax rules apply if I provide short-stay accommodation? explains how the standard tax rules work. You need to revisit which rules apply each year. Mixed-use asset rules 11. If the dwelling meets the three criteria at \[9\] f or an income year, the mixed-use asset rules are relevant. QB XX/07: Income tax – How do the mixed-use asset rules apply if I provide short-stay accommodation? explains how the mixed-use asset rules apply. 12. However, there are two situations where you can opt out of the mixed-use asset rules and the standard tax rules altogether for the rental income from the dwelling. Opting out of the tax rules if the dwelling is a mixed-use asset 13. If the dwelling is a mixed-use asset, you can opt out of the mixed-use asset rules and the standard tax rules (collectively referred to in this QWBA as “the tax rules”) if:  your rental income for the year from the dwelling is under $4,000, or Page 4 of 7 QB XX/XX | Issue date  you made a loss from the dwelling and some of your deductions for the year would be quarantined (that is, carried forward to the next year) if you applied the mixed-use asset rules. Figure | Hoahoa 2 – Opting out of the tax rules 14. If you choose to opt out of the tax rules for the rental income from the dwelling, the income is exempt. This means you do not pay tax on the rental income, and you cannot claim deductions for your expenses that relate to the dwelling. Opt-out: rental income from the dwelling is under $4,000 15. You can opt out of the tax rules for the rental income from the dwelling where the gross rental income (before expense deductions) for the income year is under $4,000. 16. The $4,000 threshold for opting out of the tax rules does not include exempt income. Exempt income is income from renting out the dwelling to associated persons (for example, family members), and income from renting out the dwelling for less than 80% of the market value rent (for example, renting it to friends for “mates’ rates”). This is explained in more detail from \[17\]. Income from renting to associated persons is exempt income 17. Income from renting out the dwelling to natural persons you are associated with (for example, close relatives such as your children, grandchildren, siblings or in-laws) is exempt income. 18. If a trust, partnership or company owns the dwelling, income from renting out the dwelling to associated natural persons (for example, for a trust, the settlors and beneficiaries) is exempt income. Page 5 of 7 QB XX/XX | Issue date 19. A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes – IR620 can help you work out if someone is associated with you. Income from renting at “mates’ rates” is exempt income 20. Income from renting out the dwelling at “mates’ rates” of less than 80% of the market value rent is exempt income. 21. This does not include income from renting out the dwelling at a lower price because it is off-peak season, a longer-term rental, or for other similar reasons. This is because in those situations the market rate is the lower price. Opt out: quarantined expenditure 22. You can also opt out of the tax rules for the rental income from the dwelling if for the income year you would have had quarantined expenditure under the mixed-use asset rules for the dwelling. 23. You would have had quarantined expenditure under the mixed-use asset rules if:  your income from renting out the dwelling during the income year was less than 2% of the property’s value, and  you made a loss from renting out the dwelling (that is, the expenses you can deduct for the income year under the mixed-use asset rules exceed the income). 24. In this situation, if you do not opt out of the tax rules, you can only deduct your expenses for the dwelling up to the amount of the rental income. Your expenses over and above your income from the dwelling are “quarantined” – meaning they are carried forward to a future income year to offset against any future income from the dwelling. 25. Alternatively, you can opt out of the tax rules by treating the income for the year as exempt, and not claiming any deductions for your expenses related to the dwelling. 26. In working out if your income was less than 2% of the property’s value, you do not include exempt income (amounts of income described in \[16\]). It i s only your taxable income from the dwelling that counts towards the 2% threshold. 27. The property value you use to measure the 2% threshold against is generally the local rating value. However, if you bought the property from someone you are not associated with since the rates value was last set, you use the purchase price. 28. If there is another dwelling on the same property, the 2% threshold is measured against a proportion of the local rating valuation, based on the percentage of the total land area that the asset is on. For example, if you have a sleepout that i s a mixed-use Page 6 of 7 QB XX/XX | Issue date asset on the same property as your house, and the area of the sleepout is 20% of the total section, you measure the 2% threshold against 20% of the rating valuation. If you decide to opt out 29. If one of above situations applies, and you choose to opt out of the tax rules for the rental income from the dwelling, you do not need to declare that income in your tax return for that income year. All the income from renting out the dwelling is classed as exempt income, and you cannot claim any related expenses as deductions. 30. For each income year, you need to revisit whether the dwelling is a mixed-use asset and if it is, whether you are able to opt out of the tax rules. If you cannot or do not opt out 31. If the dwelling is a mixed-use asset and you cannot or do not opt out of the tax rules for the rental income, the mixed-use asset rules will apply for the income year. QB XX/07 explains how the mixed-use asset rules work. You’ll need to revisit which rules apply each income year. What records do I need to keep? 32. You need to keep good records to work out each year which rules apply. This includes records of:  the number of nights the dwelling is used privately (this includes by you, by people you are associated with, and by anyone else if they pay less than 80% of the market value rent),  the number of nights you rent out the dwelling, and how much income you receive,  when the dwelling was available to be rented out (this will be relevant if the standard tax rules apply), and  any expenses you may claim deductions for. Draft items produced by the Tax Counsel Office represent the preliminary, though considered, views of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. In draft form these items may not be relied on by taxation officers, taxpayers, or practitioners. Only finalised items represent authoritative statements by Inland Revenue of its stance on the particular issues covered.

About this document | Mō tēnei tuhinga Questions we’ve been asked (QWBAs) are issued by the Tax Counsel Office. QWBAs answer specific tax questions we have been asked that may be of general interest to taxpayers. While they set out the Commissioner’s considered views, QWBAs are not binding on the Commissioner. However, taxpayers can generally rely on them in determining their tax affairs. See further Status of Commissioner’s advice (C ommissioner’s statement, Inland Revenue, December 2012). It is important to note that a general similarity between a taxpayer’s circumstances and an example in a QWBA will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case must be considered on its own facts.

A non-GST registered supplier might choose to do this so they can deduct all their expenses on a GST-inclusive basis, rather than having to apportion between GST-exclusive expenses (for supplies of listed services) and GST-inclusive expenses (for all other supplies). This draft QWBA has been prepared on the basis that this amendment will be enacted. It will not be finalised until the Bill has been enacted. QUESTIONS WE’VE BEEN ASKED | PĀTAI KUA UIA MAI Income tax – How do the mixed-use asset rules apply if I provide short- stay accommodation? Issued | Tukuna: Issue date QB XX/07 This “question we’ve been asked” (QWBA) explains how the mixed-use asset rules apply to a dwelling you sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation (for example, through Airbnb, Bookabach, Booking.com or Holiday Houses) and also sometimes use privately (for example, as a holiday home). Page 1 of 19 QB XX/XX | Issue date Before you use this QWBA, you need to work out if the mixed-use asset rules or the standard tax rules apply to the dwelling. QB XX/06: Income tax – Which rules apply if I have a dwelling I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and also sometimes use privately? will help you work that out. Key provisions | Whakaratonga tāpua Income Tax Act 2007 – ss CC 1, xxCH 5B, DB 2, DG 9 and GC 5 REPLACES | WHAKAKAPIA:  QB 19/07: How do the mixed-use asset income tax rules apply to a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use privately? Question | Pātai How do the mixed-use asset rules apply if I provide short-stay accommodation? Answer | Whakautu Where the mixed-use asset rules apply, rental income from the dwelling will generally be taxable. The only exceptions are:  Income from renting the dwelling to associated persons or to others at “mates’ rates” (less than 80% of the market value rent), which is exempt income.  Any flat-rate credits you receive from an online marketplace operator, which you have opted to treat as excluded income. The mixed-use asset rules set out how to calculate the proportion of expenses you can deduct against your income from providing the short-stay accommodation. Expenses that relate solely to renting out the dwelling (for example, advertising) are generally fully deductible. Expenses that relate solely to your private use of the dwelling are not deductible. Expenses that relate both to income-earning and private use are partly deductible – the deductible proportion is based on the number of rental nights relative to the total number of nights the dwelling is used during the year. If you are not GST-registered and have opted to treat the flat-rate credit as excluded income, expenses that relate to rental income from an online marketplace are deductible on a GST-exclusive basis and expenses that relate to rental income from Page 2 of 19 QB XX/XX | Issue date other sources are deductible on a GST-inclusive basis. However, if you have opted to treat the flat-rate credit as assessable income, all your expenses that relate to rental income (from an online marketplace or otherwise) are deductible on a GST-inclusive basis. If you are GST registered, expenses are deductible on a GST-exclusive basis. If you make a loss from renting out the dwelling, you may not be able to deduct all your expenses that income year – some of your deductions might have to be carried forward to future income years. Key terms | Kīanga tau tāpua Guest means a person provided with short-stay accommodation in return for payment. Mixed-use asset means an asset that is used both privately and to earn income, and is also unused for at least 62 days in the year. This would include many holiday homes. Online marketplace means an electronic platform like a website, app or internet portal that sellers use to market and sell their short-stay accommodation. It does not include an online marketplace that only processes payments. Short-stay accommodation means accommodation provided for up to four consecutive weeks in a dwelling that is not the guest’s ordinary residence. It does not include accommodation provided to residential tenants, boarders or care home residents, and it does not include student or emergency accommodation. Explanation | Whakamāramatanga 1. If you have a dwelling you sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and also sometimes use yourself, you need to work out which income tax rules apply, so you can meet your tax obligations. The dwelling could be a holiday house, or a separate dwelling on the same property you live on (for example, a sleep-out or cottage). 1 2. Depending on your circumstances, the dwelling will either fall under:  the mixed-use asset rules, or 1 There could be situations where the mixed-use asset rules apply to your home because it has been unused for more than 62 days in the income year. But generally, if you provide short-stay accommodation in your home, QB XX/05 will be relevant. Page 3 of 19 QB XX/XX | Issue date  the standard tax rules. 3. To work out which rules apply in your situation, see QB XX/06: Income tax – Which rules apply if I have a dwelling I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and also sometimes use privately? You need to revisit which rules apply each income year (for most people this is 1 April – 31 March). 4. This QWBA is relevant if:  you have determined that for a particular income year the dwelling is a mixed- use asset, and  yo u have not opted out of the tax rules. You can only opt out in certain circumstances – see QB XX/06. 5. This QWBA does not apply if the dwelling is owned by a company. What rental income is taxable and what rental income is exempt? 6. Income you receive from renting out the dwelling is generally taxable. However, there are two situations where it will be exempt income:  When it is income from renting to associated persons.  When it is income from renting at “mates’ rates”. 7. You do not pay tax on exempt income, and you cannot deduct expenses that relate solely to days the dwelling is used to derive exempt income. Days that you derive exempt income are taken into account in the formula for calculating the proportion of partly deductible expenses you can claim (see from \[28\]). 8. Figure | Hoahoa 1 summarises what you need to consider when working out whether your rental income is taxable or exempt. Page 4 of 19 QB XX/XX | Issue date Figure | Hoahoa 1 – Is my rental income taxable or exempt? Exempt income: renting out the dwelling to an associated person 9. Income you receive from renting out the dwelling is exempt where you rent the dwelling out to a natural person who is associated with you (such as close relatives like your children, grandchildren, siblings, or in-laws). This is the outcome, even if you rent it out to an associated person at market value rent. 10. If a trust or partnership owns the dwelling, income from renting out the dwelling to associated natural persons (for example, for a trust, the settlors and beneficiaries) is exempt income. 11. A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes – IR620 can help you work out if someone is associated with you. Exempt income: renting out the dwelling at “mates’ rates” 12. Income you receive from renting out the dwelling is exempt where you rent it out for less than 80% of the market value rent. This includes income from renting the dwelling to friends at “mates’ rates” of less than 80% of the market value rent. 13. It does not include income from renting out the dwelling at a lower price because it i s off-peak season, a longer-term rental, or other similar reasons. This is because in those situations the market rate is the lower price. Rental income from the dwelling Income from renting the dwelling to associated persons See from \[9\] Income from renting the dwelling at "mates' rates" See from \[12\] All other income from renting the dwelling Seefrom \[14\] Exempt TaxableExempt Page 5 of 19 QB XX/XX | Issue date Taxable rental income 14. Other than the two situations mentioned at \[ 9\] and \[12\], any amounts you receive from renting out the dwelling are taxable. The activity does not need to be run as a business for the amounts you receive to be income. 15. You will be able to deduct expenses related to the dwelling. The discussion from \[25\] explains how to work out what proportion of expenses is deductible. Treatment of any flat-rate credits received from an online marketplace operator 16. If you are not GST-registered and list your dwelling through an online marketplace like AirBnB, Bookabach, Booking.com or Holiday Homes, the marketplace operator will give you a flat-rate credit of 8.5% of the value of your supply of short-stay accommodation. 17. You have the option to treat the flat-rate credit as either:  excluded income (which is not subject to income tax, so is not included in your income tax return), or  assessable income (which is included in your income tax return). (Section xxCH 5B). 18. The option you choose will have implications for how you deduct expenses (see from \[39\]). 19. The flat-rate credit is intended to recognise the GST on your expenses that, if you were GST-registered, you would be able to deduct as input tax in your GST return on any supplies of goods and services that you bought to make supplies of short-stay accommodation. 20. If you are GST-registered and list your dwelling through an online marketplace, you will not receive a flat-rate credit. This is because you can deduct input tax from your actual expenses incurred in making supplies of short-stay accommodation. 21. You must notify your online marketplace operator of your GST registration status and any changes in that status, so they can work out whether they need to pay you the flat- rate credit. Page 6 of 19 QB XX/XX | Issue date What portion of my expenses can I claim deductions for? 22. The starting point is that you can fully deduct expenses that relate solely to your rental activity. Any expenses that relate solely to private use of the dwelling are not deductible. Private use includes use by you, by natural persons you are associated with, and by anyone for less than 80% of the market value rent. Many of your expenses will relate to both your income-earning and private use of the dwelling (for example, rates, loan interest and property insurance) – these mixed expenses are only partly deductible. 23. It is important to note that if you are not GST-registered and opt to treat the flat-rate credit as excluded income, any expenses that relate to nights when the dwelling was rented through an online marketplace must be deducted on a GST-exclusive basis. Expenses that relate to nights when the dwelling was rented out other than through an online marketplace are deductible on a GST-inclusive basis. However, if you opt to treat the flat-rate credit as assessable income, all your expenses are deducted on a GST-inclusive basis. 24. If you are GST-registered, you deduct your expenses on a GST-exclusive basis. This is discussed in more detail in Example | Tauira 2. Expenses that may be fully deductible – relate solely to rental activity 25. You may be allowed to fully deduct some expenses. To be fully deductible, the expense (which cannot be a capital expense) must:  relate solely to the use of the dwelling to derive income (not including exempt income), and  meet either or both of the following: o be an expense you would not reasonably expect to receive a personal benefit from, and / or o be an expense you must reasonably incur to meet a regulatory requirement to be able to use the dwelling to derive income, and you would not have incurred the expense otherwise. 26. These expenses might include: Page 7 of 19 QB XX/XX | Issue date  advertising costs, including any commissions or fees you pay to an advertising platform or transaction facilitator (this does not include any service fees the guests pay the platform – just fees you pay),  supplies used solely by your paying guests (for example, if you provide them with a welcome basket of breakfast food or chocolates),  cleaning costs for the rental periods,  any additional property or contents insurance premium you pay (over what you would otherwise pay) because you rent out the property, and  any additional rates you pay (over what the normal residential rates would be) because you rent out the property. 27. You may have some expenses that you can split between being related solely to your rental activity and being mixed rental and private expenses. For example, expenses that have a fixed component and a usage component, like power. If you can identify actual usage charges for a period where the dwelling was only rented out and not used privately at all, you do not have to apportion the usage component for that period – it may be fully deductible. The fixed charge component still needs to be apportioned, as it is necessary to maintain a power connection, which is used both privately and by paying guests. 28. You may also be allowed to fully deduct the cost of repairing damage to the property that occurred when it was being used to earn income. This does not include when the property is used to earn exempt income (the two situations mentioned at \[ 6\]). It also does not include damage that is the result of ordinary wear and tear, as that occurs during periods the dwelling is rented and periods it is used privately. 29. While the starting point is that the above expenses may be fully deductible, if you rent the dwelling through an online marketplace, your deduction may need to be claimed on a GST-exclusive basis. This is discussed from \[39\]. Expenses that are non-deductible – relate solely to private use 30. Expenses that relate solely to the private use of the dwelling are not deductible. Private use includes use by you, by natural persons you are associated with, and by anyone for less than 80% of the market value rent. For example, if you use the dwelling for a month over the summer and you can identify actual usage charges that are a component of some of your expenses (for example, power), you cannot deduct any of the usage component for that period as it relates solely to your private use of the dwelling. Similarly, any consumables you use at the dwelling are not deductible. However, if you have consumables you use at the dwelling that are also available for Page 8 of 19 QB XX/XX | Issue date guests to use (for example, tea, coffee, olive oil, shampoo, and soap), those consumables are partly deductible. Expenses that are partly deductible – relate to both rental activity and private use 31. All your other deductible expenses must be apportioned between the income-earning use of the dwelling, and the private use of the dwelling. This might include expenses such as:  interest on your loan for the property, 2  repairs and maintenance, 3  property and contents insurance premiums (or what the premiums would be if you have to pay more because you rent out the property),  rates (or what the normal residential rates would be if you have to pay more because you rent out the property)  power bills (but see \[27\] and \[30\]),  internet, and  depreciation on chattels. 32. There is a formula in the mixed-use asset rules to use to apportion these expenses, so you know what proportion is deductible. Under the formula, the proportion of expenses that are deductible reflects the income-earning use of the dwelling relative to the private use. Only days the dwelling is actually used are counted, so days the dwelling is available to be rented out but is not actually rented out do not alter the proportion of expenses you can deduct. 33. For example, if the dwelling was used privately for 30 nights in a particular income year, and rented out for 25 nights, you could deduct 45.45% of your expenses (25 income-earning nights out of a total of 55 nights the dwelling was used). 34. The formula (in s DG 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007) refers to “days”, but if a different unit of measure would give a more appropriate apportionment, you use that measure 2 From 1 April 2024, up to 80% of the interest can be claimed, and from 1 April 2025 up to 100% of the interest can be claimed. The actual amount claimed needs to be apportioned to account for any private use. 3 Deductible repairs and maintenance expenditure does not include expenditure on capital improvements (see IS 12/03: Income tax – Deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure – general principles). Page 9 of 19 QB XX/XX | Issue date instead. For accommodation, “nights” is the appropriate measure to use. Therefore, the formula is: 35. “Income-earning nights” are:  Nights the dwelling is used to earn income, other than exempt income Nights where you rent out the dwelling to someone who is associated with you or for “mates’ rates” (less than 80% of the market value rent, discussed from \[ 12\]) are not counted as income-earning nights.  Nights you use the dwelling to repair damage caused by a guest This does not include nights you stay at the dwelling to repair damage caused by guests you get exempt income from (mentioned at \[9\] and \[12\] – associated persons and people paying “mates’ rates”). It also does not include nights you stay at the dwelling to repair damage that is the result of ordinary wear and tear. Your use of the dwelling to carry out the repairs must be necessary for you to be able to count those nights as income-earning nights. Therefore, you can only count the nights you need to stay at the dwelling to complete the repairs from damage caused on an income-earning night.  Nights the dwelling was reserved by someone who did not end up using it These nights may be counted as income-earning nights if the dwelling is not available for use because the person who reserved it did not end up using it. For example, a no-show, or a cancellation close to the reserved date which means the dwelling cannot be used by someone else. 36. “Counted nights” are:  Nights the dwelling is used, but are not income-earning nights. This includes nights you use the dwelling, nights someone associated with you uses the dwelling, and nights the dwelling is rented out for less than 80% of the market value rent. 37. Table | Tūtohi 1 provides some examples of income-earning nights and counted nights. income-earning nights income-earning nights + counted nights your expenditure x Page 10 of 19 QB XX/XX | Issue date Table | Tūtohi 1 – Examples of income-earning nights and counted nights Income-earning nights Counted nights  You rent the dwelling to a non- associated person at market rates.  A non-associated guest paying market rates damages the dwelling and you stay there for two nights repairing the damage.  A guest cancels the day before their 3- night booking and no one else books the dwelling for those nights.  You stay at the dwelling for a holiday.  You rent the dwelling to your in-laws at market rates.  You rent the dwelling to your best friend for “mates’ rates” of $50 a night rather than the usual price of $100.  Your friend who stayed at “mates’ rates” damages the dwelling and you stay there for two nights repairing the damage.  The paint in the bedrooms is looking shabby, so you stay at the dwelling for a week re-painting.  A non-associated guest paying market rates damages the dwelling. After staying at the property for two nights repairing the damage you decide to stay on for three more nights. The three additional nights are counted nights.  A non-associated guest paying market rates damages the dwelling, but the damage is only minor and you fix it in a couple of hours on your next family holiday at the dwelling. 38. Example | Tauira 1 shows how the apportionment formula works. If you do not want to do the calculations yourself, there is a calculator o n the Inland Revenue website that you can use to work out how much you can deduct for the expenses that need to be apportioned (for example, the expenses listed at \[31\]). Page 11 of 19 QB XX/XX | Issue date Example | Tauira 1 – Using the mixed-use asset apportionment formula Matt’s holiday home has a rating value of $300,000. He bought the holiday home before the last time the rating value was reset. Matt rented out his holiday home for 20 nights in the income year, at $200 a night, through his own website (which is not an online marketplace). All of the rental nights were to people Matt is not associated with and were at full market rate. Matt used the holiday home for 35 nights, and his brother (an associated person) used it for 12 nights. Matt’s fully deductible expenses (which relate solely to the rental use of the holiday home) for the year were $230 for advertising, and a total of $500 for cleaning services after each guest (not including associates or friends paying “mates’ rates”). Matt does not have any expenses that relate solely to his private use of the holiday home. The expenses Matt has that relate to both the rental activity and the private use of the holiday home total $10,000 (which includes interest on Matt’s loan for the property, rates, insurance, utility bills and general maintenance). Using the apportionment formula, Matt calculates that he can deduct $2,985.07 of those expenses: So, the total amount Matt can deduct is $3,715.07 ($230 + $500 + $2,985.07). His total income from renting out the holiday home was $4,000 (20 nights × $200). Therefore, Matt has a net profit of $284.93 for the dwelling for the income year. Are my expenses deducted on a GST-inclusive or GST-exclusive basis? 39. If you are GST-registered, you deduct your expenses on a GST-exclusive basis. 40. If you are not GST-registered and have opted to treat the flat-rate credit as assessable income, you deduct your expenses on a GST-inclusive basis (s DB 2). 41. If you are not GST-registered and have opted to treat the flat-rate credit as excluded income:  Expenses that relate to nights when the dwelling was rented through an online marketplace are deducted on a GST-exclusive basis. This is because the flat-rate Page 12 of 19 QB XX/XX | Issue date credit you receive from the online marketplace is intended to recognise the GST on the expenses you incur when deriving this income, that you would be able to deduct as input tax in your GST return if you were GST-registered.  Expenses that relate to nights when the dwelling was rented out other than through an online marketplace, are deducted on a GST-inclusive basis. (Section DB 2). 42. If you are not GST-registered and have opted to treat the flat-rate credit as excluded income, you may need to apportion your expenses. If you have expenses that relate to both nights when the dwelling was rented out through an online marketplace and nights when the dwelling was rented out other than through an online marketplace, these expenses need to be apportioned. Example | Tauira 2 explains how to do this. Example | Tauira 2 – Apportioning expenses where a person is not GST-registered, has opted to treat the flat-rate credit as excluded income, and their dwelling is rented both through an online marketplace and in some other way The facts are the same as in Example | Tauira 1, with the exceptions noted below. For the 2025-2026 income year, Matt rented out his holiday home for 20 nights, at $200 a night. All of the rental nights were to people Matt is not associated with, and were at full market rate. Ten of those nights were rented through an online marketplace and 10 were rented through Matt’s own website (which is not an online marketplace). Matt used the holiday home for 35 nights, and his brother (an associated person) used it for 12 nights. This is summarised in the table below: Use Number of nights Private use 47 Rented through online marketplace 10 Rented through website 10 Because Matt is not GST-registered and has opted to treat the flat-rate credit as excluded income, he needs to deduct his expenses that relate to the online marketplace nights on a GST-exclusive basis. His expenses that relate to non-online Page 13 of 19 QB XX/XX | Issue date marketplace nights are deducted on a GST-inclusive basis. The table below sets out Matt’s expenses and how he should calculate the deductions he can claim: Expense Amount Amount apportioned to income-earning Deduction Commission charged by online marketplace $60 (incl. GST) 100% = $60 (incl. GST) $60 ÷ 1.15 4 = $52.17 (excl. GST) Interest on loan for the property $20,000 (GST exempt) 29.85% (20/67) =$5,970 $5,970 Repairs and maintenance and other mixed expenses such as rates and property insurance $10,000 (incl. GST) 29.85% (20/67) = $2,985 (incl. GST) Online marketplace nights: 10 nights (out of 20 rental nights). 10/20 x $2,985 = $1,492.50 (incl. GST) ÷ 1.15 = $1,297.83 (excl. GST) deduction for online marketplace nights. Non-online marketplace (Matt’s website) nights: 10 nights (out of 20 rental nights). 10/20 x $2,985 = $1,492.50 $1,492.50 (incl . GST) deduction for non-online marketplace nights. Total deduction for repairs and maintenance: $1,297.83 + $1,492.50 = $2,790.33 Online marketplace commission: Matt does not need to apportion the commission charged by the online marketplace as it relates only to the rental activity. But his 4 Dividing the amount apportioned to income-earning by 1.15 gives you the GST-exclusive amount. Page 14 of 19 QB XX/XX | Issue date deduction must be claimed on a GST-exclusive basis. The $60 commission charged is divided by 1.15 to give a GST-exclusive deduction of $52.17. Interest on loan for the property: From the 2025-2026 income year, Matt can claim up to 100% of the interest on his property loan. However, this interest needs to be apportioned between private use and income-earning use. As discussed in this QWBA, under the mixed-use asset rules this is done based on the amount of income-earning use relative to the total use of the asset during the income year. For the income year, there are 20 income-earning nights and 67 total use nights. Therefore, Matt can deduct 29.85% (20/67) of $20,000 which is $5,970.15. GST is not applied to interest, so there is no need for any further calculations for the online marketplace nights. Repairs and maintenance and other mixed expenses: On the same basis as for interest, 29.85% of the $10,000 expense for repairs and maintenance and other mixed expenses is attributable to income-earning. This is $2,985 (incl. GST). The proportion of the expenses attributable to income-earning that relates to online marketplace nights is 50% (as 10 out of the 20 rental nights are online marketplace nights), so $1,492.50. This amount is then divided by 1.15 to give a GST-exclusive amount of $1,297.83. The proportion of the expenses attributable to income-earning that relates to non- online marketplace nights (50%) is $1,492.50 (incl. GST). Therefore, the total amount of the repairs and maintenance deduction is $2,790.33 ($1,297.83 + $1,492.50). Matt’s total deduction in relation to the rental activity is therefore $8,812.65 ($52.17 + $5,970.15 + $2,790.33). If Matt had opted to treat the flat-rate credit as assessable income, he would not need to undertake any apportionment – all his expenses would be deductible on a GST- inclusive basis. Losses and the mixed-use asset expenditure quarantine rules 43. The residential ring-fencing rules do not apply to mixed-use assets. However, there are specific rules for loss-making mixed-use assets that may apply. These rules are called the mixed-use asset expenditure quarantine rules. Under these rules, if you make a loss from renting out the dwelling (that is, the deductible expenses for the year exceeded the rental income), you might not be allowed to deduct all your expenses for that income year. Page 15 of 19 QB XX/XX | Issue date 44. If the mixed-use asset expenditure quarantine rules apply, you can only deduct your expenses up to the amount of the rental income from the dwelling. Any deductions in excess of that are carried forward to future income years until they are able to be offset against any future profits from the dwelling. 45. The mixed-use asset expenditure quarantine rules apply if:  your income from renting out the dwelling during the income year was less than 2% of the property’s value, and  you made a loss from renting out the dwelling (that is, the deductible expenses for the year exceeded the income). 46. In working out if your income was less than 2% of the property’s value, you do not include exempt income. It is your taxable income from the dwelling that must meet the 2% threshold. 47. The property value you use to measure the 2% threshold against is generally the local rating value. However, if you bought the property from someone you are not associated with since the rates value was last set, you use the purchase price. This is illustrated in Example | Tauira 3. Example | Tauira 3 – The mixed-use asset expenditure quarantine rules The facts are the same as in Example | Tauira 1. However, Matt has deductions of $6,700.15 and therefore a net loss of -$2,700.15. Matt’s holiday home has a rating value of $300,000. Two percent of the property value for the holiday home is $6,000. Because Matt’s income from renting the holiday home ($4,000) is less than that, he can only deduct expenses up to the amount of income – so $4,000 worth. The remaining deductible expenses ($2,700.15) are carried forward to the next income year. 48. If you woul d otherwise have quarantined expenditure for an income year, you may instead choose to opt out of the mixed-use asset rules. This is discussed in QB XX/06. If you do this, all the income from renting out the dwelling is exempt income, and you cannot claim any related expenses as deductions. Who must declare the income? 49. The rental income belongs to the owner of the land (including leasehold land) and they must declare it to Inland Revenue. If there is more than one owner, the income needs to be split appropriately between them. Page 16 of 19 QB XX/XX | Issue date 50. If the dwelling is owned in a trust, the rules about who must declare the income are more complicated. You should refer to QB XX/1516: If property held in a trust is rented out for short-stay accommodation, who should declare the income, and what deductions can be claimed? for more detailed guidance. 51. If you lease the property and use it to earn income, you should ensure you are paying an adequate rent for the property to the extent you use the property for income- earning. If you do not, in certain circumstances the Commissioner can determine an amount of adequate rent and you will be treated as deriving this amount as rental income (s GC 5). This rule ensures that property cannot be leased between (for example) relatives or different entities for low or nominal rent to shift income for a tax benefit. What records do I need to keep? 52. Because the dwelling may or may not fall within the mixed-use asset rules (remember, you need to work out each year whether it does), you need to keep good records so you can apply the income tax rules correctly. This includes records of:  the number of nights you rent out the dwelling at market value, and how much income you receive,  the number of nights you rent out the dwelling at “mates’ rates”, and how much income you receive,  the number of nights you, or people you are associated with, used the dwelling,  when the dwelling was available to be rented out (this will be relevant if the standard tax rules apply),  any expenses you may claim deductions for, and  any quarantined expenditure you have in respect of the dwelling. Provisional tax 53. If the residual income tax you have to pay at the end of the year, after you have filed your tax return, is more than $5,000, you will have to pay provisional tax the following year. This means you will pay your income tax in instalments during the year. The Inland Revenue website ha s further information about provisional tax.

QWBAs answer specific tax questions we have been asked that may be of general interest to taxpayers. While they set out the Commissioner’s considered views, QWBAs are not binding on the Commissioner. However, taxpayers can generally rely on them in determining their tax affairs. See further Status of Commissioner’s advice (C ommissioner’s statement, Inland Revenue, December 2012). It is important to note that a general similarity between a taxpayer’s circumstances and an example in a QWBA will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case must be considered on its own facts.

A non-GST registered supplier might choose to do this so they can deduct all their expenses on a GST-inclusive basis, rather than having to apportion between GST-exclusive expenses (for supplies of listed services) and GST-inclusive expenses (for all other supplies).

QUESTIONS WE’VE BEEN ASKED | PĀTAI KUA UIA MAI Income tax – How do the standard tax rules apply if I provide short- stay accommodation? Issued | Tukuna: Issue date style QB XX/08 This “question we’ve been asked” (QWBA) explains how the standard tax rules apply to a dwelling you sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation (for example, through Airbnb, Bookabach, Booking.com or Holiday Houses) and also sometimes use privately (for example, as a holiday home). Page 1 of 18 QB XX/XX | Issue date Before you use this QWBA, you need to work out if the standard tax rules or the mixed- use asset rules apply to the dwelling. QB XX/06: Income tax – Which rules apply if I have a dwelling I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and also sometimes use privately? will help you work that out. Key provisions | Whakaratonga tāpua Income Tax Act 2007 – ss CC 1, xxCH 5B, DB 2 and GC 5 REPLACES | WHAKAKAPIA:  QB 19/08: How do the standard income tax rules apply to a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use privately? Question | Pātai How do the standard tax rules apply if I provide short-stay accommodation? Answer | Whakautu Where the standard tax rules apply, rental income from the dwelling will generally be taxable, including “mates’ rates” rental income. The only exceptions are:  Minor contributions to expenses from family and friends, which are exempt income.  Any flat-rate credits you receive from an online marketplace operator, which you have opted to treat as excluded income. Expenses that relate solely to renting out the dwelling (for example, advertising) are generally fully deductible. Expenses that relate solely to your private use of the dwelling are not deductible. Expenses that relate to both income-earning and private use are partly deductible – the deductible proportion is based on the number of nights the dwelling is rented or available to be rented, relative to the total number of nights in the year. If you are not GST-registered and have opted to treat the flat-rate credit as excluded income, expenses that relate to rental income from an online marketplace are Page 2 of 18 QB XX/XX | Issue date deductible on a GST-exclusive basis and expenses that relate to rental income from other sources are deductible on a GST-inclusive basis. However, if you have opted to treat the flat-rate credit as assessable income, all your expenses that relate to rental income (from an online marketplace or otherwise) are deductible on a GST-inclusive basis. If you are GST-registered, expenses are deductible on a GST-exclusive basis. If you make a loss from renting out the dwelling, you may not be able to deduct all your expenses that income year – some of your deductions might have to be carried forward to future income years. Key terms | Kīanga tau tāpua Guest means a person provided with short-stay accommodation in return for payment. Online marketplace means an electronic platform like a website, app or internet portal that sellers use to market and sell their short-stay accommodation. It does not include an online marketplace that only processes payments. Short-stay accommodation means accommodation provided for up to four consecutive weeks in a dwelling that is not the guest’s ordinary residence. It does not include accommodation provided to residential tenants, boarders or care home residents, and it does not include student or emergency accommodation. Explanation | Whakamāramatanga 1. If you have a dwelling you sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and also sometimes use yourself, you need to work out which income tax rules apply, so you can meet your tax obligations. The dwelling could be a holiday house, or a separate dwelling on the same property you live on (for example, a sleepout or cottage). 2. Depending on your circumstances, the dwelling will either fall under:  the mixed-use asset rules, or  the standard tax rules. 3. To work out which rules apply in your situation see QB XX/06: Income tax – Which rules apply if I have a dwelling I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and also sometimes use privately? You need to revisit which rules apply each income year (for most people this is 1 April – 31 March). Page 3 of 18 QB XX/XX | Issue date 4. This QWBA is relevant if you have determined that for a particular income year the dwelling is subject to the standard tax rules. 5. This QWBA does not apply if the dwelling is owned by a company. What rental income is taxable and what rental income is exempt? Taxable rental income: amounts received from paying guests 6. Amounts you receive from paying guests will generally be taxable income under s CC 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The activity does not need to be run as a business for the amounts you receive to be income. 7. You will be able to deduct expenses related to the dwelling. The discussion from \[16\] explains how to work out what proportion of expenses is deductible. Taxable rental income: renting the dwelling at “mates’ rates” 8. If you rent the dwelling at less than full market rent (for example, to family or friends at “mates’ rates”), the rent will be taxable income. In this situation, Inland Revenue will accept a deduction for your expenses for those nights up to the amount of rent received for those night. Exempt income: minor contributions to expenses 9. Amounts you receive from family or friends who use the dwelling and are not charged rent but make a minor contribution to your expenses (for example, they pay you $20 towards power and heating) are exempt income. In that situation, the contribution is not taxable rental income, and you cannot claim any deductions for those nights. Treatment of any flat-rate credits received from an online marketplace operator 10. If you are not GST-registered and list your dwelling through an online marketplace like AirBnB, Bookabach, Booking.com or Holiday Homes, the marketplace operator will give you a flat-rate credit of 8.5% of the value of your supply of short-stay accommodation. 11. You have the option to treat the flat-rate credit as either: Page 4 of 18 QB XX/XX | Issue date  excluded income (which is not subject to income tax, so is not included in your income tax return), or  assessable income (which is included in your income tax return). (Section xxCH 5B). 12. The option you choose will have implications for how you deduct expenses (see from \[32\]). 13. The flat-rate credit is intended to recognise the GST on your expenses that, if you were GST-registered, you would be able to deduct as input tax in your GST return on any supplies of goods and services that you bought to make supplies of short-stay accommodation. 14. If you are GST-registered and list your dwelling through an online marketplace, you will not receive a flat-rate credit. This is because you can deduct input tax from your expenses incurred in making supplies of short-stay accommodation. 15. You must notify your online marketplace operator of your GST registration status and any changes in that status, so they can work out whether they need to pay you the flat- rate credit. What portion of my expenses can I claim deductions for? 16. The starting point is that you can fully deduct expenses that relate solely to your rental activity. Any expenses that relate solely to private use of the dwelling are not deductible. Private use includes use by you and by natural persons you are associated with but who are not charged rent. Many of your expenses will relate to both your income-earning and private use of the dwelling (for example, rates, loan interest and property insurance) – these mixed expenses are only partly deductible. 17. A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes – IR620 can help you work out if someone is associated with you. 18. You will also be able to claim deductions for the depreciation of the chattels in the dwelling that paying guests can use. But, as with your mixed expenses, you can only claim for part of the depreciation because the chattels are used when the dwelling is rented out to earn income and also when it is used privately. 19. It is important to note that if you are not GST-registered and opt to treat the flat-rate credit as excluded income, any expenses that relate to nights when the dwelling was rented through an online marketplace must be deducted on a GST-exclusive basis. Expenses that relate to nights when the dwelling was rented out other than through an online marketplace are deductible on a GST-inclusive basis. However, if you opt to Page 5 of 18 QB XX/XX | Issue date treat the flat-rate credit as assessable income, all your expenses are deducted on a GST-inclusive basis (s DB 2). 20. If you are GST-registered, you deduct your expenses on a GST-exclusive basis. This is discussed in more detail in Example | Tauira 3. Expenses that may be fully deductible – relate solely to rental activity 21. You may be allowed to fully deduct expenses that relate solely to your rental activity. These expenses might include:  advertising costs, including any commissions or fees you pay to an advertising platform or transaction facilitator (this does not include any service fees the guests pay the platform – just fees you pay),  supplies used solely by your paying guests (for example, if you provide them with a welcome basket of breakfast food or chocolates),  cleaning costs for the rental periods,  any additional property or contents insurance premium you pay (over what you would otherwise pay) because you rent out the property, and  any additional rates you pay (over what the normal residential rates would be) because you rent out the property. 22. You may have some expenses that you can split between being related solely to your rental activity and being mixed rental and private expenses. For example, expenses that have a fixed component and a usage component, like power. If you can identify actual usage charges for a period where the dwelling was only rented out and not used privately at all, you do not have to apportion the usage component for that period – it is fully deductible. The fixed charge component still needs to be apportioned, as it i s necessary to maintain a power connection, which is used both privately and by paying guests. 23. While the starting point is that the above expenses may be fully deductible, if you rent the dwelling through an online marketplace, your deduction may need to be claimed on a GST-exclusive basis. This is discussed from \[32\]. Expenses that are non-deductible – relate solely to private use 24. Expenses that relate solely to the private use of the dwelling are not deductible (this includes use by you and by natural persons you are associated with but who are not charged rent). For example, if you use the dwelling for a month over the summer and you can identify actual usage charges that are a component of some of your expenses Page 6 of 18 QB XX/XX | Issue date (for example, power), you cannot deduct any of the usage component for that period as it relates solely to your private use of the dwelling. Similarly, any consumables you use at the dwelling are not deductible. However, if you have consumables you use at the dwelling that are also available for guests to use (for example, tea, coffee, olive oil, shampoo, and soap), those consumables are partly deductible. Expenses that are partly deductible – relate to both rental activity and private use 25. You can only claim deductions for part of any expenses that relate to both your rental activity and the private use of the dwelling. These mixed expenses might include:  interest on your loan for the property, 1  repairs and maintenance, 2  property and contents insurance premiums (or what the premiums would be if you have to pay more because you rent out the property),  rates (or what the normal residential rates would be if you have to pay more because you rent out the property),  power bills (but see \[19\] and \[21\]), and  internet. 26. To work out what proportion of these mixed expenses you can claim, you need to consider:  the periods the property is rented out (including at “mates’ rates”) or available to be rented out, and  the periods the property is used privately (this includes use by family or friends who are not charged rent). 27. Generally, to work out the proportion of expenses you can deduct, you multiply those expenses by: 1 From 1 April 2024, up to 80% of the interest can be claimed, and from 1 April 2025 up to 100% of the interest can be claimed. The actual amount claimed needs to be apportioned to account for any private use and any periods the property is not available to be rented out. 2 Deductible repairs and maintenance expenditure does not include expenditure on capital improvements (see IS 12/03: Income tax – Deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure – general principles). Page 7 of 18 QB XX/XX | Issue date 28. You need to keep track of the number of nights you rent out the dwelling, and you need to have evidence of when it was available to be rented out. This evidence needs to be more than a mere statement of its availability, sporadic or limited advertising, or advertising that isn’t likely to attract many customers. You need to have evidence of active and regular marketing of the dwelling at market rates, and that it’s available at times and for periods that demonstrate it is genuinely available to rent. 29. Nights the dwelling is used privately are not counted as nights it is available to be rented out. This is the case even if the property remains advertised (for example, if you do not mark it as “unavailable” or “blocked” in an online booking system). Private use includes when you use the dwelling, and also when family or friends use it if they are not charged rent (even if they make a minor contribution to your expenses, as noted at \[9\]). In some situations, there may be an element of private use when a dwelling is vacant but available for rent. This might occur, for example, where a person uses the dwelling as a second home. In these circumstances, apportionment would be required for those periods (see IS 23/10: D eductibility of holding costs for land from \[94\]). 30. If guests have access to the whole dwelling (that is, there are no parts they are not permitted to use), your apportionment is based on the number of nights the dwelling is rented out or available to be rented out, as a proportion of the total nights in the year. Example | Tauira 1 explains how to apportion expenses where guests have access to the entire dwelling. Example | Tauira 1 – Apportioning expenses where guests have access to the entire dwelling Nathan and Joel have a holiday house in Queenstown that they and their extended family use for a total of 100 nights during the 2025-2026 income year. Their extended family do not pay rent. The house is rented out through their website (which is not an online marketplace) for 240 nights during the year and is advertised and available to be rented out throughout the year except when the family use it (so, 25 nights). The holiday house is not in the mixed-use asset rules, as it i s not unused for 62 days or more during the year. nights the dwelling is rented out or available to be rented out nights in the year Page 8 of 18 QB XX/XX | Issue date Nathan and Joel can deduct 100% of their expenses that relate solely to the rental activity. These expenses include the cost of advertising the house for rent, their host service fees, the additional rates they pay (over what the normal residential rates would be) because they rent the property out, and the additional insurance premium they pay (over what they woul d otherwise pay) because they rent the property out. The house is rented out or available to be rented out for 265 out of the 365 nights of the year, so Nathan and Joel calculate that they can deduct 72.60% of their mixed expenses: These mixed expenses include the interest on Nathan and Joel’s loan for the property, utility bills, repairs and maintenance costs, the amount of their rates that equates to what the standard residential rates would be if the property was not in a higher rating category, and the amount of their insurance premium that equates to what their premium would be if the property was not rented out. 31. If part of the dwelling is not available for use by guests (for example, a locked room where you store your personal possessions), you cannot deduct the proportion of mixed expenses that relate to that space. You need to factor in the floor area calculations. Example | Tauira 2 explains how to do this. Example | Tauira 2 – Apportioning expenses where part of the dwelling is not available to guests Nathan and Joel from Example | Tauira 1 k eep items they and their family use on holiday in one of the bedrooms in the house, which is locked, and cannot be used by guests. The bedroom is 25m 2 , and the whole house is 200m 2 . Nathan and Joel calculate that they can deduct 63.53% of their mixed expenses: Are my expenses deducted on a GST-inclusive or GST-exclusive basis? 32. If you are GST-registered, you deduct your expenses on a GST-exclusive basis. Page 9 of 18 QB XX/XX | Issue date 33. If you are not GST-registered and have opted to treat the flat-rate credit as assessable income, you deduct your expenses on a GST-inclusive basis (s DB 2). 34. If you are not GST-registered and have opted to treat the flat-rate credit as excluded income:  Expenses that relate to nights when the dwelling was rented through an online marketplace are deducted on a GST-exclusive basis. This is because the flat-rate credit you receive from the online marketplace is intended to recognise the GST on the expenses you incur when deriving this income, that you would be able to deduct as input tax in your GST return if you were GST-registered.  Expenses that relate to nights when the dwelling was rented out other than through an online marketplace, or was available to be rented out, are deducted on a GST-inclusive basis. (Section DB 2). 35. If you are not GST-registered and have opted to treat the flat-rate credit as excluded income, you may need to apportion your expenses. If you have expenses that relate to both nights when the dwelling was rented out through an online marketplace and nights when the dwelling was rented out other than through an online marketplace or was available to be rented out, these expenses need to be apportioned. Example | Tauira 3 explains how to do this. Example | Tauira 3 – Apportioning expenses where a person is not GST-registered and has opted to treat the flat-rate credit as excluded income, and their dwelling is rented both through an online marketplace and in some other way The facts are the same as in Example | Tauira 1, with the exceptions noted below. Of the 240 nights that the house was rented out, 100 of those nights were rented out through an online marketplace and the remaining 140 nights were rented out through Nathan and Joel’s website (which is not an online marketplace). The house is available for rent but not rented out for 25 nights. This is summarised in the table below: Use Number of nights Private use 100 Page 10 of 18 QB XX/XX | Issue date Rented through online marketplace 100 Rented through website or available to be rented 165 Because the house is rented out or available to be rented out for 265 out of the 365 nights of the year, Nathan and Joel can potentially deduct 72.60% of their mixed expenses: However, because Nathan and Joel are not GST-registered and have opted to treat the flat-rate credit as excluded income, they need to deduct their expenses that relate to the online marketplace nights on a GST-exclusive basis. Their expenses that relate to non-online marketplace nights are deducted on a GST-inclusive basis. The table below sets out Nathan and Joel’s expenses and how they should calculate the deductions they can claim: Expense Amount Amount apportioned to income-earning Deduction Commission charged by online marketplace $600 (incl. GST) 100% = $600 (incl. GST) $600 ÷ 1.15 3 = $521.74 (excl. GST) Interest on loan for the property $10,000 (GST exempt) 72.60% (265/365) = $7,260 $7,260 Repairs and maintenance and other mixed expenses such as rates and $10,000 (incl. GST) 72.60% (265/365) = $7,260 (incl. GST) Online marketplace nights: 100 nights (out of 265 nights for which deductions are allowed). 100/265 x $7,260 = $2,739 (incl GST) ÷ 1.15 = 3 Dividing the amount apportioned to income-earning by 1.15 gives you the GST-exclusive amount. Page 11 of 18 QB XX/XX | Issue date property insurance $2,381.74 (excl. GST) deduction for online marketplace nights Non-online marketplace nights: 165 (out of 265 nights for which deductions are allowed). 165/265 x $7,260 = $4,520.37 (incl. GST) deduction for non- online marketplace nights Total deduction for repairs and maintenance: $2,381.74 + $4,520.37 = $6,902.11 Online marketplace commission: Nathan and Joel do not need to apportion the commission charged by the online marketplace as it relates only to the rental activity. But their deduction must be claimed on a GST-exclusive basis. The $600 commission charged is divided by 1.15 to give a GST-exclusive deduction of $521.74. Interest on loan for the property: From the 2025-2026 income year, Nathan and Joel can claim up to 100% of the interest on their property loan. However, this interest needs to be apportioned between private use and income-earning use. As discussed in this QWBA, under the standard income tax rules this is done based on the amount time the asset is used for income-earning or available for income-earning during the income year. For the income year, there are 265 nights the property is used or available for income-earning nights. Therefore, Nathan and Joel can deduct 72.60%, (265/365) of $10,000 which is $7,260 .27. GST is not applied to interest, so there is no need for any further calculations for the online marketplace nights. Repairs and maintenance and other mixed expenses: On the same basis as for interest, 72.60% of the $10,000 expense for repairs and maintenance, is attributable to income-earning. This is $7,260.27 (incl. GST). The proportion of the expenses attributable to income-earning that relates to online marketplace nights is 37.73% (as 100 out of the 265 nights the dwelling is used or available for income-earning are online marketplace nights), so $2,739.73 (incl. GST). This amount is then divided by 1.15 to give a GST-exclusive amount of $2,382.37. The proportion of the expenses attributable to income-earning that relates to non- online marketplace nights, which includes available to rent nights, (62.26%) is $4,520.55 (incl. GST). Page 12 of 18 QB XX/XX | Issue date Therefore, the total amount of the repairs and maintenance and other mixed expenses deduction is $6,902.92 ($2,382.37 + $4,520.55). Nathan and Joel’s total deduction in relation to the rental activity is therefore $14,684.93 ($521.74 + $7,260.27 + $6,902.92). If Nathan and Joel had opted to treat the flat-rate credit as assessable income, they would not need to undertake any apportionment – all their expenses would be deductible on a GST-inclusive basis. Depreciation of chattels 36. As noted at \[18\], you can also claim deductions for the depreciation of the chattels in the dwelling that paying guests can use. Depreciation deductions reflect that chattels in the dwelling are subject to wear and tear, resulting in a reduction in their value while being used to earn income. 37. As with mixed expenses, you can only claim for part of the depreciation because the chattels are used when the dwelling is rented out to earn income and also when it i s used privately. 38. The approach to working out how much depreciation you can claim each year is similar to the approach for apportioning mixed expenses. But it does differ slightly, as there is a specific apportionment formula in the Income Tax Act 2007 for depreciation of assets partly used to earn income. 39. Before you can apply the formula, you need to work out the depreciation loss for the income year for each asset. 40. For low value items ($1,000 or less), 4 the depreciation loss is the item’s cost. If the item is part of a group of items you purchased at the same time from the same supplier, and the items would have the same depreciation rate, the $1,000 threshold applies to the group of items. For example, if you bought $2,000 worth of linen at one time, you would have to depreciate the linen using one of the methods mentioned at \[37\]. 41. For other items, you work out the depreciation loss for the income year using either the diminishing value method or the straight-line method. There is information about those methods on Inland Revenue’s website, and you can find the relevant 4 For items acquired on or after 17 March 2021. Page 13 of 18 QB XX/XX | Issue date depreciation rates using Inland Revenue’s depreciation rate finder – available on Inland Revenue’s website. 42. Whichever method you use, you cannot pool assets to depreciate them as a single asset if they are partly used privately – so you will not be able to use the pooled approach for the chattels in the dwelling. 43. Once you know the depreciation losses for the year for the chattels in the dwelling that paying guests can use, you need to work out what proportion of those losses you may deduct. To do this, multiply those losses by: 44. While it is the chattel depreciation that is being worked out, the chattels are only used or available for use when the dwelling is – which is why the dwelling rental and availability nights are used to calculate the allowable chattel depreciation loss. 45. The difference between this formula and the approach for mixed expenses is that you are identifying the number of nights the dwelling is rented out or available to be rented out as a proportion of all the nights in the year it is available for any purpose, rather than as a proportion of all of the nights in the year. So, if the dwelling is not available for use by anyone for a period, those nights are not counted. Example | Tauira 4 illustrates this situation. Example | Tauira 4 – Depreciation of chattels where the chattels are also used privately Nicola has a holiday home in a popular tourist town. Nicola and her friends used it for a total of 80 nights during the year, and it was rented out for 230 nights. The house was uninhabitable for 52 days during the year, while Nicola had the house extended by building a loft bedroom and deck with lake views. The house was advertised and available to be rented out throughout the year, except when booked out for Nicola and her friends to use, and over the building period. The holiday home is not in the mixed-use asset rules, as it i s not unused for 62 days or more during the year. Nicola calculates that she can deduct 63.84% of her mixed expenses (property loan interest, insurance, rates, power bills and internet): nights the dwelling is rented out or available to be rented out nights in the year the dwelling is used or available for any purpose Page 14 of 18 QB XX/XX | Issue date However, for depreciation the calculation is slightly different. Instead of dividing the rental and available for rental days by the number of days in the year, the total of those days is divided by the number of days the property is used or available for any purpose, which would exclude the 52 building days when it could not be used. Nicola calculates that she can deduct 74.44% of her depreciation losses for the chattels in the house: 46. If you are GST-registered, you calculate depreciation on the GST-exclusive price of the asset. If you are not registered for GST, you claim depreciation on the GST-inclusive price of the asset. This is the position, even if you rent your dwelling through an online marketplace. Losses and the residential rental ring-fencing rules 47. The residential rental ring-fencing rules mean you can only claim deductions for expenses incurred on the property up to the amount of income you earned from the property in the income year. 5 If your allowable deductions exceed the income from the property, 6 the excess deductions must be carried forward to future income years. You cannot offset the excess amount against other income, such as salary or wages. 48. There is more information about the residential rental ring-fencing rules in the Appendix to IS 23/04: T he interest limitation rules and short-stay accommodation (from A48). 5 Or, if the property is part of a portfolio of residential rental properties you own, you can only claim deductions for expenses incurred on the portfolio of properties up to the amount of income you earned from the portfolio in the income year. 6 Or portfolio of properties, if you have one. Page 15 of 18 QB XX/XX | Issue date Who must declare the income? 49. The rental income belongs to the owner of the land (including leasehold land) and they must declare it to Inland Revenue. If there is more than one owner, the income needs to be split appropriately between them. 50. If the dwelling is owned in a trust, the rules about who must declare the income are more complicated. You should refer to QB XX/1516: If property held in a trust is rented out for short-stay accommodation, who should declare the income, and what deductions can be claimed? for more detailed guidance. 51. If you lease the property and use it to earn income, you should ensure you are paying an adequate rent for the property to the extent you use the property for the income- earning. If you do not, in certain circumstances the Commissioner can determine an amount of adequate rent and you will be treated as deriving this amount as rental income (s GC 5). This rule ensures that property cannot be leased between (for example) relatives or different entities for low or nominal rent to shift income for a tax benefit. What records do I need to keep? 52. Because the dwelling may or may not fall within the mixed-use asset rules (remember, you need to work out each year whether it does), you need to keep good records so you can apply the income tax rules correctly. This includes records of:  the number of nights you rent out the dwelling at market value, and how much income you receive,  the number of nights you rent out the dwelling at “mates’ rates”, and how much income you receive,  the number of nights you, or people you are associated with, used the dwelling,  when the dwelling was available to be rented out (see \[28\] and \[29\]),  any expenses you may claim deductions for, and  any ring-fenced expenditure you have in respect of the dwelling. Provisional tax 53. If the residual income tax you have to pay at the end of the year, after you have filed your tax return, is more than $5,000, you will have to pay provisional tax the following Page 16 of 18 QB XX/XX | Issue date year. This means you will pay your income tax in instalments during the year. The Inland Revenue website ha s further information about provisional tax.

About this document | Mō tēnei tuhinga Questions we've been asked (QWBAs) are issued by the Tax Counsel Office. QWBAs answer specific tax questions we have been asked that may be of general interest to taxpayers. While they set out the Commissioner’s considered views, QWBAs are not binding on the Commissioner. However, taxpayers can generally rely on them in determining their tax affairs. See further Status of Commissioner’s advice (C ommissioner’s statement, Inland Revenue, December 2012). It is important to note that a general similarity between a taxpayer’s circumstances and an example in a QWBA will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case must be considered on its own facts.
EXPOSURE DRAFT - FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY | HUKIHUKI HURANGA - MŌ TE TĀKUPU ME TE MATAPAKI ANAKE Deadline for comment | Aukatinga mō te tākupu: 25 October 2024 Please quote reference | Whakahuatia te tohutoro: PUB00487e Send feedback to | Tukuna mai ngā whakahokinga kōrero ki public.consultation@ird.govt.nz Notes | Pitopito kōrero: This draft QWBA is an update and merge of QB 19/15 and QB 19/16 – the two short-stay accommodation QWBAs that relate to trusts. We thought readers might appreciate having both topics covered in the same QWBA. We are interested in feedback on whether this approach is helpful, or whether you would prefer the QWBAs to stay separate. Clause 14 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2024–2025, Emergency Response, and Remedial Measures) Bill contains a proposed amendment that would give non-GST registered suppliers of listed services, which includes short-stay accommodation, the option to treat the flat-rate credit as assessable income instead of excluded income. A non-GST registered supplier might choose to do this so they can deduct all their expenses on a GST-inclusive basis, rather than having to apportion between GST- exclusive expenses (for supplies of listed services) and GST-inclusive expenses (for all other supplies). This draft QWBA has been prepared on the basis that this amendment will be enacted. It will not be finalised until the Bill has been enacted. QUESTIONS WE’VE BEEN ASKED | PĀTAI KUA UIA MAI Income tax – If property held in a trust is rented out for short-stay accommodation, who declares the income and what deductions can be claimed? Issued | Tukuna: Issue date style Page 1 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date QB XX/1516 This “question we’ve been asked” (QWBA) explains how the income tax rules apply if property held in a trust is rented out as short-stay accommodation (for example, through Airbnb, Bookabach, Booking.com or Holiday Houses). All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Key provisions | Whakaratonga tāpua Income Tax Act 2007 – ss CC 1, CG 4, xxCH 5B, DA 1, DB 2, DV 9, subpart EE, subpart EL, YB 4, YB 11, and YA 1 Tax Administration Act 1994 – s 43B REPLACES | WHAKAKAPIA:  QB 19/15: If property held in a trust is rented out by a beneficiary of the trust for short-stay accommodation, who should declare the income, and what deductions can be claimed?  QB 19/16: If property held in a trust is rented out by the trustees for short- stay accommodation, who should declare the income, and what deductions can be claimed? Question | Pātai If property held in a discretionary trust is rented out for short-stay accommodation, who declares the income, and what deductions can be claimed? Answer | Whakautu The answer depends on who rents out the property – the trustees or a beneficiary. Income If the trustees rent out the property for short-stay accommodation (for example, a holiday home or a dedicated short-stay accommodation property), the income belongs Page 2 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date to the trustees, and it will generally have to be declared in the trust’s tax return and taxed at the trust tax rate. However, if some or all of the income is allocated as beneficiary income, the income belongs to the beneficiary and it will generally have to be declared in the beneficiary’s tax return and taxed at the beneficiary’s tax rate. If a beneficiary rents out all or part of the property for short-stay accommodation (for example, the property is the beneficiary’s home and they rent out a room), the income belongs to the beneficiary as they grant the licence to the guests to stay. The income will generally have to be declared in the beneficiary’s tax return and will be taxed at the beneficiary’s tax rate. Deductions Non-capital expenses related to earning the income are deductible. However, these expenses will only be partly deductible where they also relate to private use or non income-earning use of the property. Some or all deductions may need to be claimed on a GST-exclusive basis, depending on whether the person renting out the property is GST-registered and whether the property is rented out through an online marketplace. This is discussed in more detail from \[85\]. If the rental activity is loss-making, the person renting out the property may be unable to claim all their deductible expenses in that income year. Some deductions might have to be carried forward to future income years. Key terms | Kīanga tau tāpua Guest means a person provided with short-stay accommodation in return for payment. Online marketplace means an electronic platform like a website, app or internet portal that sellers use to market and sell their short-stay accommodation. It does not include an online marketplace that only processes payments. Renting out and similar terms are used in this QWBA to refer to granting a licence to short- stay accommodation guests for use of the property. Short-stay accommodation means accommodation provided for up to four consecutive weeks in a dwelling that is not the guest’s ordinary residence. It does not include accommodation provided to residential tenants, boarders or care home residents, and it does not include student or emergency accommodation. Trust is sometimes used in this QWBA to mean the trustees of the trust, for simplicity. Page 3 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date Explanation | Whakamāramatanga Who rents out the property? 1. Rental income from land belongs to the owner of the land and they must declare it to Inland Revenue. 2. Owning land is not limited to having the legal title. Under the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act), someone will own land if they have an estate or interest in land. This could be freehold, leasehold, or any other interest in land. 3. Beneficiaries of a discretionary trust do not have an interest in the trust property simply because they are beneficiaries. In many situations where a property is held in a trust, it will be only the trustees, who legally own the land, who have an interest in the land. This will generally be the case for a dedicated short-stay accommodation property, or for a holiday home that is also sometimes rented out to third parties. Where only the trustees have an interest in the land, it will be the trustees renting out the property, and the rental income will belong to the trustees. 4. However, in some situations there will be other people with interests relating to the same underlying piece of land, and they will also be owners of land for income tax purposes. In these situations, where the property is rented out, the rental income will belong to the person whose interest in land is affected. 5. For example, if a beneficiary of a trust has a right to possession of the property, or if they in fact occupy it, they have an interest in land as defined in the Act. A right to possession of land is specifically defined as an “interest in land” (s YA 1). Even if a beneficiary did not have the right to possession of the property, if they occupy the property, there is a “tenancy at will”, 1 which gives rise to an interest in land. 2 The most common situation where a beneficiary will have an interest in the land is where the property is the beneficiary’s family home. 6. Where a beneficiary has an interest in the land and they rent the property out to short- stay accommodation guests, it is their interest that is affected. It is their right to possession of the property, or their interest as tenant at will, that is affected by the property being rented out, not the trustees’ legal interest in the land. Therefore, if a 1 DW McMorland and others, Hinde, McMorland and Sim, Land Law in New Zealand (online ed, LexisNexis), at \[11.022\], and Laws of New Zealand Lessor and Lessee (online ed, accessed 12 June 2024) at \[108\] – \[112\]). 2 DW McMorland and others, Hinde, McMorland and Sim, Land Law in New Zealand (online ed, LexisNexis) at \[10.010(c)\]. Page 4 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date beneficiary has an interest in the land and rents out all or part of the property for short-stay accommodation, the income belongs to them. This QWBA is in two parts:  PART 1: explains who must declare the income to Inland Revenue and what deductions can be claimed if the person renting out the property for short- stay accommodation is a trustee (from \[7\]) .  PART 2: explains who must declare the income to Inland Revenue and what deductions can be claimed if the person renting out the property for short- stay accommodation is a beneficiary (from \[49\]). Part 1: The trustees rent out the property 7. This part of the QWBA considers the situation where the trustees of the trust rent out the property for short-stay accommodation. 8. The most common situations where trustees of a trust rent out property held in a trust for short-stay accommodation are where the property is:  a dedicated short-stay accommodation property, or  a family holiday home that is sometimes rented out. Summary – income tax implications if the trustees rent out the property 9. Table | Tūtohi 1 summarises the income tax implications for short-stay accommodation properties held in a trust, where the rental income is derived by the trustees. Table | Tūtohi 1 – Summary – income tax implications if the trustees rent out the property Item Explanation Income Generally, all amounts received from paying guests are income to the trustees. However, if the property is subject to the mixed-use asset rules (the MUA rules) – see from \[14\], the following amounts are exempt income:  Amounts received for renting the property to associated natural persons (for example, settlors and beneficiaries). Page 5 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date  Amounts received from renting the property at “mates’ rates” (less than 80% of the market value rent). Expenses incurred by and paid by the trustees Expenses incurred by and paid by the trustees:  are deductible to the trustees, but  must be apportioned (so will be only partly deductible) if the property is also used for non income-earning purposes, and  the deduction may need to be claimed on a GST-exclusive basis (see from \[85\]). See from \[24\] for how to apportion expenses for property subject to the MUA rules, or from \[31\] for property not subject to the MUA rules. Expenses incurred by the trustees and paid by a beneficiary For the beneficiary These expenses are not deductible to the beneficiary, as there is no connection between the expenses and the beneficiary earning income. For the trustees These expenses:  are deductible to the trustees, but  must be apportioned (so will be only partly deductible) if the property is also used for non income-earning purposes, and  the deduction may need to be claimed on a GST-exclusive basis (see from \[85\]). If the trustees do not reimburse the beneficiary, the amount of the expenses paid by the beneficiary is income to the trustees as either:  rental income under s CC 1, if paid by the beneficiary for their use of and/or ability to use the property, (provided the property is not subject to the MUA rules), or  income under s CG 4, to the extent of the deduction the trustees have been allowed, if not paid by the beneficiary for their use of and/or ability to use the property, or if the property is subject to the MUA rules. Expenses incurred by a beneficiary If the trustees reimburse the beneficiary for expenses the beneficiary has incurred (by actual payment or through their beneficiary current account), the reimbursement:  is deductible to the trustees, but Page 6 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date  must be apportioned (so will be only partly deductible) if the property is also used for non income-earning purposes, and  the deduction may need to be claimed on a GST-exclusive basis (see from \[85\]). If the trustees do not reimburse the beneficiary, the expenses cannot be deducted by anyone. If the trustees do not reimburse the beneficiary, the amount of the expense incurred by the beneficiary could be:  Rental income of the trustees, but only if the property is not subject to the MUA rules, and the beneficiary incurred the expense for their use of and/or ability to use the property.  A settlement on the trust or a distribution from the trust to the beneficiary. This will depend on the value of what the beneficiary and the trust are providing to each other under the arrangement. This includes the value of expenses incurred by the beneficiary that are of value to the trust and the market value of any use of and/or the ability to use the property the beneficiary gets in return for incurring those expenses. Which tax rules apply? 10. If the property is sometimes rented out and sometimes used by people associated with the trust (for example, a holiday home that is sometimes rented out to beneficiaries), the first step is to work out which rules apply to the property for the income year:  the mixed-use asset rules (the MUA rules), or  the standard tax rules. 11. QB XX/06: Income tax – Which rules apply if I have a dwelling I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and also sometimes use privately? explains how to work out which rules apply. You need to revisit which rules apply each income year (for most people this is 1 April – 31 March). 12. The property will be a mixed-use asset if, during the income year it was:  used it to earn income,  used privately (this includes use by family members, or by friends renting it for “mates’ rates” that are less than 80% of the market value rent), and  not used for at least 62 days in the year. 13. If the property is a mixed-use asset, there are some situations where the taxpayer can choose to opt out of the tax rules. This is explained in QB XX/06. Page 7 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date The rental income is derived by the trustees 14. If the trustees rent out the short-stay accommodation, the rental income belongs to the trustees. 15. Generally, all amounts the trustees receive from paying guests will be rental income. However, this does not include minor contributions from family or friends who are not charged rent (for example, if they pay $20 towards their power usage). 16. In addition, if the MUA rules apply, the following amounts will be exempt income:  amounts received for renting the property to associated natural persons (for example, a settlor or beneficiary of the trust), and  amounts received from renting the property at “mates’ rates” (less than 80% of the market value rent). 17. What amounts are taxable income or exempt income under the MUA rules is discussed in detail in QB XX/07: Income tax - How do the mixed-use asset rules apply if I provide short-stay accommodation? Expenses incurred by the trustees are deductible to them 18. Because the rental income belongs to the trustees, non-capital property-related expenses incurred by the trustees will be deductible to them under s DA 1, subject to any apportionment required. This is the case regardless of whether the expenses are paid by the trustees or by a beneficiary. These expenses might include:  interest on the loan for the property, 3  repairs and maintenance, 4  property and contents insurance premiums (or what the premiums would be if the trustees have to pay more because they rent out the property),  rates (or what the normal residential rates would be if the trustees have to pay more because they rent out the property),  utility bills, 3 From 1 April 2024, up to 80% of the interest on the loan can be claimed, and from 1 April 2025 up to 100% of the interest can be claimed. 4 Deductible repairs and maintenance expenditure does not include expenditure on capital improvements (see IS 12/03: Income tax – Deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure – general principles). Page 8 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date  advertising costs, including any commissions or fees the trustees pay to an advertising platform or transaction facilitator (this does not include any service fees the guests pay the platform, just fees the trustees pay). 19. Expenses are incurred by the trustees if they either paid or became definitively committed to the expenses in the income year. This includes the following:  Where the trustees have incurred the obligation themselves (for example, rates and property insurance).  Where the trustees have agreed they will reimburse a beneficiary for expenses incurred by the beneficiary. For example, if a beneficiary gets the power, pay-TV or internet connected in their name (which is often the case, as it is easier than getting those services connected in the trustees’ names). In those situations, the agreement to reimburse the beneficiary is an obligation incurred by the trustees. Example | Tauira 1 illustrates this scenario. 20. It may be that a beneficiary of the trust is also a trustee and connects services such as power or internet in their individual name. Generally, the person would be incurring the expenses in their capacity as trustee, so the expenses would be incurred directly by the trustees. 21. Some or all of the rental income may be allocated as beneficiary income, which means it is taxed at the beneficiary’s tax rate rather than at the trust rate. However, for the purpose of determining the deductions the trust is allowed, the beneficiary income is treated as trustee income (s DV 9(2)). This means all the non-capital expenses the trust incurs in relation to the rental activity will be deductible to the trustees, subject to any apportionment required. Dedicated short-stay accommodation property 22. If the property is a dedicated short-stay accommodation property, non-capital property-related expenses will be fully deductible and no apportionment is necessary. Depreciation losses on the property’s chattels would also be fully deductible. Example | Tauira 1 concerns a dedicated short-stay accommodation property. Example | Tauira 1 – A dedicated short-stay accommodation property The B-F Family Trust is GST-registered and owns an investment property in Queenstown that is rented out on Airbnb. The property is not used at all by the settlors (who are deceased) or by beneficiaries of the trust. It is therefore a dedicated short-stay accommodation property. Page 9 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date The corporate trustee pays all the property-related expenses from its bank account. This includes the power, internet, and pay-TV bills. The connections for those services are in the names of Ani and Charlie, who are beneficiaries (but not trustees) of the trust. The connections were signed up for in Ani and Charlie’s names as this was easier. But there is an agreement that the trustee will pay all those expenses. All the rental income is income to the trustee. All the non-capital property-related expenses are deductible to the trustee, on a GST-exclusive basis. This includes the power, internet and pay-TV bills, as the trustee pays those. Because the property is only used for rental purposes, the expenses are all fully deductible. A holiday home that is sometimes rented out 23. If the property is sometimes rented out and sometimes used by people associated with the trust (for example, a family holiday home that’s sometimes rented out to beneficiaries of the trust), the proportion of the expenses that can be deducted will depend on whether the MUA rules or the standard tax rules apply (see from \[10\]). If the MUA rules apply to the holiday home 24. If the MUA rules apply to the holiday home, the starting point is that expenses that relate solely to the rental activity (for example, advertising fees) are fully deductible. However, the deduction may need to be claimed on a GST-exclusive basis, depending on whether the trust is GST registered and whether the property is rented out through an online marketplace (see from \[85\]). 25. Mixed expenses – those that relate to both the rental activity and the private use of the property – must be apportioned. Mixed expenses include things like rates, insurance, utility bills, and property loan interest. Again, these deductions may need to be claimed on a GST-exclusive basis. 26. Use of the holiday home by natural persons who are associated with the trustees counts as private use for the apportionment formula in the MUA rules. Use by anyone else for less than 80% market value rent (for example, friends staying and paying “mates’ rates”) will also be private use. 27. Persons associated with the trustees include:  beneficiaries of the trust,  settlors of the trust, Page 10 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date  persons associated with beneficiaries of the trust under the “two relatives” test 5 (s YB 4), and  persons with a power of appointment or removal of trustees – unless within the exclusion for providers of professional services (s YB 11(2)). 28. A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes – IR620 explains how to work out if someone is associated with the trustees. 29. QB XX/07 explains how to calculate the percentage of the mixed expenses that is deductible under the MUA rules. The same formula is generally used to calculate the portion of deductible depreciation losses for the property’s chattels. However, depreciation losses or depreciation recovery income on disposal, is calculated under the depreciation provisions in subpart EE. 30. Example | Tauira 2 explains how the MUA rules apply to a holiday house. Example | Tauira 2 – Where the MUA rules apply to a holiday house The Fab Five Family Trust is GST-registered and owns the Brown family’s holiday home. The Browns use the holiday home for 45 nights during the income year. The trustees of the Fab Five Family Trust rent it out to friends of the Browns for 15 nights in the year for “mates’ rates” of $50 a night, and the trustees rent it out to unrelated third parties for 80 nights in the year for $200 a night. The trustees have used QB XX/06 to work out the holiday house is a mixed-use asset for the income year because it was:  used privately (by the Browns, who are beneficiaries and settlors of the trust, and by friends for less than 80% of the market value rent),  used to earn income, and  vacant for 62 days or more in the income year. Therefore, the MUA rules apply. The trustees pay most of the property-related expenses from their bank account. This includes the power and internet bills, even though the connections for those services are in the name of Mrs Brown, who is a settlor and beneficiary of the trust. The connections were signed up for in Mrs Brown’s name as this was easier, but there is an 5 Essentially, two people are associated if they are within two degrees of blood relationship, married, in a civil union or de facto relationship, or one person is within two degrees of blood relationship to the other person’s spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner. Page 11 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date agreement that the trustees will pay those expenses. However, Mr and Mrs Brown have a loan (in their names, with a guarantee provided to the bank by the trustees) from when they bought the property and settled it on the trust, and they pay the loan repayments. The trustees reimburse Mr and Mrs Brown for the interest component of the loan repayments. This is recorded in Mr and Mrs Brown’s beneficiary current accounts. The rental income from the full-rate paying guests is income to the trustees. The $50 a night “mates’ rates” paid by the Browns’ friends is not income to the trustees – it is exempt income because it is less than 80% of the market value rent. Some of the trustees’ expenses are fully deductible. This includes the fees they pay to Airbnb and Bookabach, and the cost of cleaners who come in after the full-rate paying guests. Other expenses the trustees incur need to be apportioned under the formula in the MUA rules, as they relate to both the rental activity and the private use of the holiday home (by the Browns and their friends who pay less than 80% of market value rent). These expenses include the power and internet bills, as the trustees pay those, and the loan interest the trustees reimburse Mr and Mrs Brown for. The trustees use QB XX/07 to work out the deductible portion of these mixed expenses. As the Trust is GST-registered, all expenses are deducted on a GST-exclusive basis. Note: There may be a settlement on the trust or a distribution from the trust. This depends on the value of what Mr and Mrs Brown and the trust are providing each other under the arrangement. If the standard tax rules apply to the holiday home 31. If the standard tax rules apply to the holiday home, the starting point is that expenses that relate solely to the rental activity (for example, advertising fees) are fully deductible. However, the deduction may need to be claimed on a GST-exclusive basis, depending on whether the trust is GST registered and whether the property is rented out through an online marketplace (see from \[85\]). 32. Mixed expenses – those that relate to both the rental activity and non income-earning use of the property (for example, use by beneficiaries or settlors of the trust) – must be apportioned. Mixed expenses include things like rates, insurance, utility bills, and property loan interest. Again, these deductions may need to be claimed on a GST- exclusive basis. Page 12 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date 33. QB XX/08 explains how to calculate the percentage of mixed expenses that is deductible under the standard tax rules. Although QB XX/08 refers to expenses not being deductible for private use (which a trust cannot have), the same approach can be used. This is because there will only be the required nexus between the expenses and income-earning to the extent the property is rented out or available to be rented out. 34. Depreciation losses on the property’s chattels will also be partly deductible. QB XX/08 explains how to calculate the percentage of depreciation losses that is deductible. 35. Example | Tauira 3 explains how the standard tax rules apply to a holiday house. Example | Tauira 3 – Where the standard tax rules apply to a holiday house The We Are Family Trust owns the Miller family’s holiday house in a popular tourist destination. The Millers use the holiday house for 90 nights during the income year and rent it out as short-stay accommodation for 220 nights in the income year. The trustees have used QB XX/06 to work out the holiday house is not subject to the MUA rules for the income year, so the standard rules apply. This is because the holiday house was not vacant for 62 days or more during the income year. Short-stay accommodation guests pay rental income into the trustees’ bank account, and the trustees pay most of the property-related expenses from their bank account. This includes the power, pay-TV and internet bills, even though the connections for those services are in the name of Mr Miller, who is a settlor and beneficiary of the trust. The connections were signed up for in Mr Miller’s name as this was easier, but there is an agreement that the trustees will pay those expenses. However, Mr and Mrs Miller have a loan (in their names) from when they bought the property and settled it on the trust, and they pay the loan repayments. The trustees reimburse Mr and Mrs Miller for the interest component of the loan repayments. This is recorded in Mr and Mrs Miller’s beneficiary current accounts. The rental income from the short-stay accommodation guests is income to the trustees. Some of the trustees’ expenses are fully deductible. This includes the fees they pay to the Holiday Houses and Bookabach websites, which they advertise on, and the cost of cleaners who come in after the paying guests’ stays. Other expenses the trustees incur need to be apportioned, as they relate to both the rental activity and the non income-earning use of the holiday home (when it is used by the Millers). These expenses include the power and internet bills, as the trustees pay Page 13 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date those, and the loan interest the trustees reimburse Mr and Mrs Miller for. The trustees use QB XX/08 to help them work out the deductible portion of these expenses. As the Trust is GST-registered, all expenses are deductible on a GST-exclusive basis. Note: There may be a settlement on the trust or a distribution from the trust. This depends on the value of what Mr and Mrs Miller and the trust are providing each other under the arrangement. Beneficiary not reimbursed for paying an expense incurred by the trustees 36. For properties that are either dedicated short-stay accommodation properties or holiday homes that are sometimes rented out, the trust will likely have a bank account that guests pay rental income into. Therefore, where the trustees have incurred an obligation themselves (for example, rates and property insurance), they will likely have the funds to pay the expense. But if the trustees do not have the funds to pay the expense, or for some other reason a beneficiary pays it instead, the expense would still be deductible to the trustees as they have incurred the legal obligation. 37. However, if the trustees do not reimburse the beneficiary (either directly or through the beneficiary’s current account), the amount of the expense paid by the beneficiary will be income to the trustees either:  under s CC 1, if: o the amount is paid by the beneficiary for their use of and/or ability to use the property, and o the property is not subject to the MUA rules, or  under s CG 4, to the extent of the deduction the trustees have been allowed. Expenses incurred by a beneficiary and reimbursed by the trustees 38. A beneficiary (who is not also a trustee) may incur an obligation to pay some property- related expenses (such as power or internet bills), because it is easier to have those services connected in an individual’s name. 39. Those expenses are not deductible to the beneficiary, as there is no nexus between the expenses and the beneficiary earning income. The income from the rental activity belongs to the trustees. Page 14 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date 40. However, there may be agreement that the trustees will reimburse the beneficiary for these expenses. If this is the case, the agreement to reimburse the beneficiary is an obligation incurred by the trustees. The trustees can therefore deduct the amount they reimburse the beneficiary (whether directly or through the beneficiary’s current account), subject to any apportionment required (see from \[23\]). Expenses incurred by a beneficiary and not reimbursed by the trustees 41. If a beneficiary has incurred a property-related expense that the trustees do not reimburse them for, the expense cannot be deducted by anyone. 42. The amount could be rental income of the trustees, but only if the property is not subject to the MUA rules, and the beneficiary incurred the expense for their use of and/or ability to use the property. 43. Otherwise, the amount could be a settlement on the trust or a distribution from the trust to the beneficiary. Whether there is a settlement or distribution and if so the amount of the settlement or distribution, will depend on the value of what the beneficiary and the trust are providing each other under the arrangement. This includes the value of property-related expenses incurred by the beneficiary that are of value to the trust and the market value of any use of and/or ability to use the property the beneficiary gets in return for incurring those expenses. These concepts are discussed in more detail in IS 24/01: Taxation of trusts. Allocation of deductions if the rental activity is loss-making 44. If the MUA rules do not apply and the rental activity is loss-making, the residential rental ring-fencing rules in subpart EL may limit the deductions that can be allocated to the income year. 45. The residential rental ring-fencing rules mean trustees can only claim deductions for expenses incurred on the property up to the amount of income earned from the property in the income year. 6 46. Any deductions that cannot be allocated to the income year because of the residential rental ring-fencing rules will be carried forward to the next income year the trustees derive residential income. 6 Or, if the property is part of a portfolio of residential rental properties owned by the trust, deductions for expenses incurred on the portfolio of properties can only be claimed up to the amount of income earned from the portfolio in the income year. Page 15 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date 47. There is more information about the residential rental ring-fencing rules in the Appendix to IS 23/04: T he interest limitation rules and short-stay accommodation (from A48). 48. If the MUA rules apply, there are separate rules called the mixed-use asset expenditure quarantine rules that may apply in this situation if the rental activity is loss-making – see QB XX/07. Part 2: A beneficiary rents out the property 49. This part of the QWBA considers the situation where a beneficiary of the trust rents out the property for short-stay accommodation. 50. The most common situation where a beneficiary of a trust may rent out property held in a trust for short-stay accommodation is where the property is the beneficiary’s home. Summary – income tax implications if a beneficiary rents out the property 51. Table | Tūtohi 2 summarises the income tax implications for short-stay accommodation properties held in a trust, where the income is derived by a beneficiary of the trust. Table | Tūtohi 2 - Summary – where the beneficiary rents out the property and the property is the beneficiary’s home Item Explanation Income Generally, all amounts received from paying guests are income to the beneficiary. However, some amounts may be exempt income. This will be the case if:  DET 19/02: S tandard-cost household service for short-stay accommodation providers (discussed from \[53\]) is used, or  the MUA rules apply (see from \[54\]). Expenses incurred by the trustees and paid by a beneficiary OR For the beneficiary If the beneficiary pays all the property-related outgoings, they may be eligible to use DET 19/02. This is a simplified method for meeting the tax obligations for the short-stay accommodation activity. If D ET 19/02 i s used: Page 16 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date Expenses incurred by a beneficiary  The rental income the beneficiary gets from the property is exempt income up to the amount of the standard-costs.  Only income over the amount of the standard-costs needs to be declared.  The beneficiary cannot deduct any of their actual expenses, unless it is for something not covered by the standard-costs and they have assessable income from providing the short-stay accommodation (for example, their income from providing the short-stay accommodation exceeds their standard-costs). If DET 19/02 is not used, the expenses are deductible to the beneficiary, subject to :  apportionment for private use (see QB XX/05), and  the deduction needing to be claimed on a GST-exclusive basis (see from \[85\]). For the trustees The amount of any expenses incurred by the trustees and paid by the beneficiary is rental income to the trustees. This will be cancelled out by the expenditure being deductible to the trustees because it is incurred by them. If the trust is a non-active trust and has filed a Declaration for trusts and estates not required to file returns – IR633, the trustees do not need to file a return. Otherwise, the trustees do need to file a return and include the rental income and deductions. Expenses incurred by and paid by trustees Expenses incurred by and paid by trustees are not deductible to anyone, unless the beneficiary pays rent to the trustees (including through reimbursement of the expenses, for the right to use the property). The beneficiary’s income and deductions Income 52. Generally, all amounts received from paying guests will be income, and for the reasons discussed at \[1\] to \[6\], the income is derived by the beneficiary. 53. The beneficiary may be eligible to use the simplified method in DET 19/02 f or meeting their tax obligations from providing the short-stay accommodation (discussed from \[58\]). If they use this method, some or all of the income will be exempt, and it will only Page 17 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date be necessary to return income over a certain level. This reflects the typical costs incurred in providing short-stay accommodation in your home. 54. If DET 19/02 is not used and the MUA rules apply there may also be some exempt income. The MUA rules could apply, for example, if a separate dwelling on the same property as the beneficiary’s home is rented out (for example, a sleepout), or if the home is vacant for 62 days or more in the year (for instance, if the beneficiary was away for an extended holiday and the home was unused during that time). 55. If the MUA rules apply, the following amounts will be exempt income:  amounts received for renting the property to associated natural persons (for example, close relatives of the beneficiary such as their children, grandchildren, siblings or in-laws), and  amounts received from renting the property at “mates’ rates” (less than 80% of the market value rent). 56. What will be income or exempt income under the MUA rules is discussed in detail in QB XX/07. Deductions 57. Often where a beneficiary’s home is held in a trust the beneficiary will pay all the outgoings for the property, irrespective of who the expenses are legally incurred by (for example, rates, insurance, repairs and maintenance, and any loan repayments for the property). 58. Where the beneficiary’s home is used to earn short-stay accommodation income (for example, through renting out a room or the whole property from time to time) and the beneficiary pays all of the property-related outgoings, they may be eligible to use standard-cost determination DET 19/02 . This is a simplified method for a taxpayer to use to meet their tax obligations from providing short-stay accommodation in all or part of their home. 59. If DET 19/02 i s used, income up to the amount of set standard-costs is exempt. Only income in excess of the standard-costs needs to be returned. No deductions for expenditure actually incurred are allowed, unless the expenditure is for things not covered by the standard-costs in the determination. 60. If DET 19/02 is not used, non-capital property-related expenses the beneficiary pays will be deductible to the beneficiary, subject to:  a ppropriate apportionment for any expenses that do not solely relate to the income-earning use of the property, and Page 18 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date  the deduction needing to be claimed on a GST-exclusive basis (see from \[85\]). 61. These deductible expenses might include:  interest on the loan for the property, 7  repairs and maintenance, 8  property and contents insurance premiums (or what the premiums would be if the beneficiary has to pay more because they rent out the property),  rates (or what the normal residential rates would be if the beneficiary has to pay more because they rent out the property),  utility bills,  advertising costs, including any commissions or fees the beneficiary pays to an advertising platform or transaction facilitator (this does not include any service fees the guests pay the platform, just fees the beneficiary pays). 62. The starting point is that expenses that relate solely to the rental activity (for example, advertising fees) are fully deductible. However, the deduction may need to be claimed on a GST-exclusive basis, depending on whether the beneficiary is GST registered and whether the property is rented out through an online marketplace (see from \[85\]). 63. Mixed expenses – those that relate to both the private use of the home and the rental activity – must be apportioned. Mixed expenses include things like rates, insurance, utility bills, and home loan interest. Again, these deductions may need to be claimed on a GST-exclusive basis. 64. Generally, the appropriate basis for apportionment will be as discussed in QB XX/05. But in some situations, a different basis may be required. For example, if a separate dwelling on the same property as the beneficiary’s home is rented out, or if the home is vacant for 62 days or more in the year. QB XX/06 explains how to work out which tax rules apply. 65. Depreciation losses on chattels in the property owned by the beneficiary and available for use by paying guests can be deducted either in full or in part (depending on whether the chattels are used solely by paying guests). QB XX/05 explains how to 7 From 1 April 2024, up to 80% of the interest on the loan can be claimed, and from 1 April 2025 up to 100% of the interest can be claimed. 8 Deductible repairs and maintenance expenditure does not include expenditure on capital improvements (see IS 12/03: Income tax – Deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure – general principles). Page 19 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date calculate the percentage of depreciation losses that is tax deductible (except if the MUA rules apply – in which case see QB XX/07). Allocation of deductions if the rental activity is loss-making 66. If the MUA rules do not apply and the rental activity is loss-making, the residential rental ring-fencing rules in subpart EL may limit the deductions that can be allocated to the income year. 67. Those rules will often not apply where the property the beneficiary is renting out is their main home. However, the rules could apply in some situations, for example, if a principal settlor of the trust has a separate main home, or if the property the beneficiary is renting out is not their main home. 68. Any deductions that cannot be allocated to the income year because of the residential rental ring-fencing rules will be carried forward to the next income year the beneficiary derives residential income. 69. There is more information about the residential rental ring-fencing rules in the Appendix to IS 23/04 (from A48). 70. Where the MUA rules apply, there are separate rules called the expenditure quarantine rules that may apply in this situation if the rental activity is loss-making – see QB XX/07. Trustees – income and deductions 71. In the family home context, it is likely that most of the property-related expenses will be incurred by the beneficiary who lives there. However, some expenses may be incurred by the trustees, for example, rates and property insurance. 72. Often the beneficiary who lives in the property will pay the property-related outgoings incurred by the trust as part of the arrangement that allows them to live in the property. The payment of those amounts by the beneficiary would be rental income to the trustees under s CC 1. However, this rental income would be offset as the trustees are able to deduct the expenditure, as it is incurred by them in deriving the rental income. 73. If the trust is non-active, the trustees may not need to file a tax return. A return would not be required if the trust:  is a complying trust (an ordinary New Zealand trust with New Zealand resident trustees and settlors), Page 20 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date  is a non-active trust,  has submitted a non-active trust declaration – IR633 to Inland Revenue, and  has not stopped being a non-active trust since making the declaration. 74. A trust will be a non-active trust if it has not derived (or been deemed to have derived) any income for the year and does not have any deductions for the year. There also cannot have been any transactions involving assets of the trust that give rise to income to any person, or give rise to fringe benefits to any employee or former employee. 75. In determining whether a trust is non-active, the following payments are not taken into account (s 43B(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994): 43B Trustees, administrators, or executors of certain trusts or estates not required to file returns ... In determining whether a trust or estate complies with the requirements of subsection (2), no account shall be taken of any— (a) reasonable fees paid to professional persons to administer the trust or estate; or (b) bank charges or other minimal administration costs totalling not more than $1,500 in the tax year; or (c) income derived by the trustee of a trust or an administrator or executor of an estate during the tax year that would be reportable income, as defined in section 22D of the Tax Administration Act 1994, if the trust or estate were an individual, to the extent to which the total amount of that income does not exceed $1,000; or (d) insurance, rates, interest, and other expenditure incidental to the occupation of a dwelling owned by the trust or estate and incurred by the beneficiaries of the trust or estate. \[Emphasis added\] 76. So, if a beneficiary is paying the trustee-incurred outgoings for the property because they live there, while those amounts may technically be rent, if the trust does not otherwise have income or make any payments other than those mentioned at \[75\], it may be able to submit a non-active trust declaration (see the requirements at \[73\]). If the trust meets the requirements and does this, the trustees will not need to file a tax return so long as the trust continues to be non-active. 77. Trusts that are not non-active trusts will have to file a tax return. Example | Tauira 4 explains what rental income the trustees will have and what deductions they can claim Page 21 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date when a beneficiary lives in property held in the trust, uses it to provide short-stay accommodation, and pays the outgoings incurred by the trustees. Example | Tauira 4 – A beneficiary living in trust property pays property outgoings Harry and Theresa’s home is held in a family trust. They settled the trust when they bought the home, and they are beneficiaries of the trust. They have a spare room and rent it out on Airbnb, earning $5,000 from this during the income year. Because they live in the property, Harry and Theresa pay the following outgoings that are incurred by the trust: the rates ($3,300 for the year) and the property insurance ($1,200 for the year). Harry and Theresa have other expenses related to earning the Airbnb income: loan interest (the home loan is in their names), utility bills, contents insurance, and Airbnb host service fees. They also have depreciation losses for chattels in the home that guests can use. Airbnb income $5,000 Harry and Theresa pay these property outgoings (incurred by the trust): −rates $3,300 −property insurance $1,200 Other expenses/losses (incurred by Harry and Theresa): −loan interest −utility bills −contents insurance −Airbnb host service fees −depreciation losses for chattels used by guests T Harry and Theresa pay these outgoings (incurred by the trust) Rent from Harry and Theresa = $4,500 (rates and property insurance paid ) Associated deductible expenses (incurred by trust): −rates $3,300 − property insurance $1,200 $10,000 income from other investments Rent $4,500 (payment of outgoings incurred by the trust) Legal liability Rates $3,300 Property insurance $1,200 Page 22 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date Because Harry and Theresa are paying the outgoings for the property that are incurred by the trust (the rates and property insurance), on the basis they can live there, those amounts would be rent to the trust. The trust can deduct the amount of the rates and property insurance because it has incurred them, having a legal liability to pay them. The result is that the rent and the deductions for the trust net off. However, the trust has $10,000 income from other investments, so it is not a non-active trust. As such, the trustees need to file a tax return, which needs to include the rental income and associated deductions (even though they net off). If Harry and Theresa meet the criteria to use Inland Revenue’s standard-cost determination DET 19/02, they might choose to do that, to simplify their tax obligations. But otherwise, they will need to return all the Airbnb income they receive, and can deduct a portion of the rates, property insurance and other expenses (and depreciation losses) they have. QB XX/05 will help them work out what proportion of their expenses they can claim as deductions. Could s GC 5 apply to deem adequate rent to be paid from the beneficiary to the trust? 78. Section GC 5 may apply where property is leased to someone who uses it to derive income. If no rent is payable by the lessee, or the rent is inadequate, s GC 5 could deem “adequate rent” to be paid by the lessee and derived by the lessor. 79. “Lease” in s GC 5 means a tenancy of any duration, including a sublease or bailment. As noted at \[5\], where a beneficiary of a trust lives in property held in the trust, there will be a tenancy at will, which meets the definition of lease. 80. Section GC 5 will only apply to certain leases. 9 This includes a lease by a person to a relative. “Relative” includes a person connected with another person by being the trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefitted or is eligible to benefit (s YA 1). 81. So, in a family trust situation, where a beneficiary is living in trust property and using it to derive income (for example, renting out a room for short-stay accommodation), s GC 5 could potentially apply to deem adequate rent to be paid by the beneficiary to the trust. 82. However, the Commissioner would not apply s GC 5 in this situation. This is because s GC 5 is aimed at ensuring income cannot be assigned to someone else through leasing income-producing property to a relative or related company at a nominal rent. 9 Listed in s GC 5(2). Page 23 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date That mischief is not present in the trust context, where a trust can legitimately allocate any income as beneficiary income. The Commissioner will not use s GC 5 to deem there to be adequate rent paid for a lease in a situation where the lease is not creating an opportunity for a tax benefit through the shifting of income from one person to another. Provision of below market value accommodation to the beneficiary 83. If the trust is a complying trust (an ordinary New Zealand trust with New Zealand resident trustees and settlors), and the trustees allow a beneficiary to live in the trust- owned property rent-free or for less than market rent, this will be an exempt distribution from the trust (ss CW 53 and HC 20). 84. However, if the trust is a foreign trust or a non-complying trust, this will be a taxable distribution from the trust, and not subject to the ordering rules (s HC 15(6)). In these circumstances, there are special rules that determine the value of the distribution, see from \[8.8\] of IS 24/01 . Online marketplace rules 85. If the person renting out the property is not GST-registered and rents the property through an online marketplace like Airbnb, Bookabach, Booking.com or Holiday Houses, the marketplace operator will give the person a flat-rate credit of 8.5% of the value of the supply of short-stay accommodation. 86. The person has the option to treat the flat-rate credit as either:  excluded income (which is not subject to income tax, so is not included in the person’s income tax return), or  assessable income (which is included in the person’s income tax return). (Section xxCH 5B). 87. If the person renting out the property is not GST-registered and opts to treat the flat- rate credit as assessable income, all their expenses are deducted on a GST-inclusive basis (s DB 2). 88. If the person renting out the property is not GST-registered and opts to treat the flat- rate credit as excluded income:  Expenses that relate to nights when the dwelling was rented through an online marketplace must be deducted on a GST-exclusive basis. This is because the flat-rate credit is intended to recognise the GST on the expenses incurred when Page 24 of 26 QB XX/XX | Issue date deriving this income that the person would have been able to deduct as input tax in their GST return if they were GST-registered.  Expenses that relate to nights when the dwelling was rented out other than through an online marketplace are deductible on a GST-inclusive basis. (Section DB 2). 89. If the person renting out the property is GST-registered, a flat-rate credit is not provided, and expenses are deductible on a GST-exclusive basis. 90. The rules are discussed in more detail in QB XX/07 and QB XX/08 and worked examples are provided.

BR PUB 18/06 1 UNCLASSIFIED PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 18/06: GOODS AND SERVICES TAX - PAYMENTS MADE BY PARENTS TO STATE AND STATE INTEGRATED SCHOOLS This Public Ruling, BR Pub 18/06, is a reissue of BR Pub 14/06. For more information about earlier publications of this Public Ruling see the Commentary to this Ruling. This Ruling is substantially the same as the BR Pub 14/06, which expired on 20 June 2018. Some parts have been rewritten to improve readability, legislative changes have been included, and a new example (Example 5) has been added. This is a public ruling made under s 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation law All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss 8 and 10(2) and the definition of “consideration” in s 2. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is: the payment of amounts (whether described as “school fees”, “donations”, “voluntary contributions”, “activity fees” or otherwise) to the board of trustees of a state or state integrated school by parents or guardians of students enrolled at such a school (who are not international students under the Education Act 1989). How the taxation law applies to the Arrangement The taxation law applies to the Arrangement as follows: GST is not chargeable on payments made to the board of trustees of a state or state integrated school by parents or guardians of students enrolled at such a school (and who are not international students under the Education Act 1989), where the payments are made to assist the school with the cost of delivering the education services that the student has a statutory entitlement to receive free of charge. GST is chargeable on payments made for supplies of other goods or services, not integral to the supply of education to which the student has a statutory entitlement, where that supply is conditional on the payment being made. WITHDRAWN BR PUB 18/06 2 UNCLASSIFIED In this Ruling state non-integrated schools and partnership schools kura hourua, are referred to as “state schools”. Any references to a state school’s board of trustees should be read as also a reference to the sponsor of a partnership school kura hourua. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning 21 June 2018 and ending on 20 June 2023. This Ruling is signed by me on 21 June 2018.

In addition, schools may offer for sale consumables, stationery, clothing and optional activities that do not form part of the delivery of the school’s curriculum. Schools are permitted to charge for these additional things, but students are not obliged to buy them. 2.This Ruling addresses whether payments (however described) made by parents to state and state integrated schools are subject to GST. In this commentary, state non-integrated schools, including partnership schools kura hourua, are referred to as “state schools”, and similarly any references to a state school’s board of trustees should be read as a reference to the sponsor of a partnership school kura hourua. Further, the word “parents” includes guardians or caregivers of students who also make payments to state or state integrated schools. WITHDRAWN 4 UNCLASSIFIED Background Application of this Ruling 3.This Ruling applies for the period from 21 June 2018 to 20 June 2023. 4.The subject matter covered in this Ruling was addressed in: “Public Ruling BR Pub 14/06: Payments made by parents or guardians of students to state schools – GST treatment” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 9 (October 2014): 3 (expired); “Public Ruling BR Pub 09/01: Payments made by parents or guardians of students to state schools – GST treatment” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 21, No 3 (May 2009): 4 (expired); and “Public Ruling BR Pub 03/04” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 15, No 7 (July 2003): 6 (expired). 5.This Ruling also withdraws and replaces “Question 70” Public Information Bulletin No 158 (November 1986). Ministry of Education guidance in Circular 2018/01 6.The Ministry of Education provides guidance to boards of trustees, proprietors, sponsors, parents and students in relation to requests for donations and other forms of payments to schools. This guidance is provided in Circular 2018/01: Payments by parents of students in schools (Ministry of Education, 2018). The circular explains the types of payments boards of trustees, proprietors and sponsors may seek from parents and students at state and state integrated schools. 7.The circular states that no payments sought by boards of trustees and proprietors from parents are compulsory except for the attendance dues payable to the proprietors of state integrated schools and charges by schools for voluntary purchases of goods and services where parents have agreed to the purchase. No charges, including “fees” or “levies” should be associated with the delivery of the curriculum. Education framework School governance 8.Every state and state integrated school must have a board of trustees: s 93 of the Education Act 1989. A board is responsible for the governance of a school, including setting the policies by which the school is to be controlled and managed. A board’s primary objective in governing the school is that every student at the school is able to attain his or her highest possible standard in educational achievement. A board has complete discretion to perform its functions and exercise its powers as it thinks fit, subject to the Education Act and any other enactment and the general law of New Zealand: Schedule 6 to the Education Act. Grants are paid out of public money to boards for the purpose of administering their schools: s 79 of the Education Act. WITHDRAWN 5 UNCLASSIFIED 9.State integrated schools were mostly private schools established to provide education with a special character that have become part of the state system of education. When a private school is integrated into the state system it must be controlled and managed and operate in all respects as if it were a state school: s 440 of the Education Act. Therefore, as with other state schools, a state integrated school’s governing body is its board of trustees. State integrated schools also have a proprietor, who looks after the school’s land and buildings and determines and supervises the school’s special character. 10.Every board must have a written charter. The purpose of the charter is to establish the missions, aims, objectives, directions and targets of the school board. The charter gives effect to both the Government’s goals, curriculum statements, performance measures and guidelines published under s 60A of the Education Act and the board’s priorities: s 61 of the Education Act. 11.The effect of a school charter is that it is an undertaking by the board to the Minister of Education to take all reasonable steps to ensure the school is managed, organised and administered for the purposes set out in the school charter and that the school and its students and community will achieve the aims and objectives set out in the school charter: s 63 of the Education Act. A school charter will not take effect if the Secretary for Education determines it is inconsistent with the Education Act or the national administration guidelines: s 63A of the Education Act. (From 2019, school charters will be replaced by four-year strategic plans and annual implementation plans.) Free education 12.Everyone who is not an international student (that is, generally, a New Zealand citizen or resident) is entitled to free enrolment and free education at any state school during the period beginning on their fifth birthday and ending on 1 January after their 19th birthday: s 3 of the Education Act. 13.Students enrolled at any state integrated school must be given free education on the same terms and conditions as students enrolled at other state schools: s 441 of the Education Act. However, the proprietor of a state integrated school may require payment of attendance dues as a condition of enrolment and attendance: s 447 of the Education Act. The money received from attendance dues may be used only for improvements to the school buildings and associated facilities as required by any integration agreement, for capital works required by the Minister of Education under s 456(2)(d) of the Education Act, and for meeting debts, mortgages, liens or other charges relating to the school premises. Attendance dues paid to the proprietors of state integrated schools are subject to GST, being payments to secure the enrolment of a student in a school for which the proprietors provide the buildings and ensure the special character: Turakina Maori Girls College Board of Trustees v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,032 (CA). 14.Each year, parents or guardians of students enrolled at state and state integrated schools may be asked by their school’s board to pay nominated amounts to assist the school with its costs, including the cost of delivering its curriculum. Schools may refer to these payments as “donations”, “voluntary contributions” or the like. In the case of state integrated schools, such payments are in addition to attendance dues payable to the proprietor. WITHDRAWN 6 UNCLASSIFIED Application of the legislation Scheme of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 15.GST is chargeable on a supply of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person by reference to the value of the supply: s 8(1). The value of the supply is the consideration provided for the supply (including both monetary and non-monetary consideration): s 10(2). 16.GST is chargeable on payments made to the board of trustees of a state school that is a registered person if such payments are “consideration”, as defined in the Act. Any charitable trusts or parent–teacher associations for the same school should be considered separately when determining the school’s GST registration. Generally, the board of a state or state integrated school will be a registered person, because the activities of a school board are taxable activities for GST purposes. This is on the basis that every board of trustees of a state or state integrated school is a Crown entity for the purposes of the Crown Entities Act 2004: s 7(1)(d). A Crown entity is a “public authority” (s 2) and, pursuant to s 6(1)(b), the term “taxable activity” includes the activities of any public authority. Section 5(6) deems that a school board (as a public authority) is supplying goods and services where it receives revenue from the Crown for the supply of outputs (in this case, the supply of education services). For example, a school board is deemed to be making a GST supply when it receives operational funding from the Crown for the supply of education services. The operational funding is the consideration for that supply. 17.GST is chargeable on that supply by the board of trustees of a state or state integrated school by reference to the “consideration” provided for the supply: s 8. Definition of “consideration” for GST purposes 18.The statutory definition of “consideration” in the Act is wider than the contract law meaning of the term. In Trustee, Executors and Agency Co NZ Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,076 (HC), Chisholm J commented in respect of the definition of “consideration” (at 13,085): In the context of this matter I am not persuaded that it is helpful or appropriate to reflect upon the ordinary meaning of the word. The statutory definition extends the ordinary meaning and it is the scope of the extended statutory definition which needs to be determined. 19.The following seven principles are drawn from the cases on the definition of “consideration” in the Act. Whether the payment is voluntary is irrelevant 20.Under the first part of the definition of “consideration”, it is irrelevant whether the payment is voluntary. No contract between the person making the supply and the person providing the consideration is necessary. The supply need not be made to the person who makes the payment: Turakina. In Turakina, McKay J, referring to the definition, said (at 10,036): It is clear from this definition that the supply of any service for consideration is part of a “taxable activity” under sec 6, even though it is to a person other than the person who provides the consideration. Likewise, the value of the supply is to be measured by the consideration, whether or not the consideration is provided by the person to whom the service is supplied. It is not necessary that there should be a WITHDRAWN 7 UNCLASSIFIED contract between the supplier and the person providing the consideration, so long as the consideration is “in respect of, in response to or for the inducement of the supply. Supply need not be made by the person who receives the payment 21.The supply also need not be made by the person who receives the payment. In Trustee, Executors and Agency Co, Chisholm J said (at 13,086): in my opinion the crucial factor is the strength of the connection between the payment and the supply. If there is sufficient proximity between the supply and payment to satisfy the requirement that the payment is “in respect of” (or “in response to, or for the inducement of”) the supply of goods then the payment qualifies as “consideration” notwithstanding that the payment is made to a third party. Not every payment received is “consideration” 22.Although the statutory definition of “consideration” is wider than the contract law meaning, not every payment a registered person receives is “consideration” for GST purposes. A distinction is drawn between a payment in respect of the payee’s taxable activity and a payment that is consideration for a supply of goods and services: Director-General of Social Welfare v De Morgan (1996) 17 NZTC 12,636 (CA). Payment and the supply must be connected 23.For a payment to be “consideration” within the first part of the definition, a sufficient relationship must exist between the making of the payment and the supply of goods or services: CIR v NZ Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 (CA); Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075 (CA); Taupo Ika Nui Body Corporate v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,147 (HC); Trustee, Executors and Agency Co; Rotorua Regional Airport Ltd v CIR (2010) 24 NZTC 23,979 (HC). 24.In NZ Refining, Blanchard J said (at 13,193): It is fundamental to the GST Act that the tax is levied on or in respect of supplies. It is not a tax on receipts or on turnover; it is a tax on transactions ... It is therefore necessary, as Mr Green submitted, to distinguish between supplies and the taxable activity (as defined in s 6) in the course of which they are made. The definition in s 6 itself requires a nexus between a supply and consideration, as does s 10. The tax itself is levied by s 8 on a supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity and is “by reference to the value of that supply”. Section 10 provides that the value of a supply is “to the extent of the consideration for the supply” the amount of the money involved or the non-monetary open market value of the consideration. Already, before turning to the definition of “consideration”, it can be seen that, again, a linkage between supply and consideration is requisite to the imposition of the tax. The definition of “consideration”, though broad, cannot and does not dispense with that requirement. To constitute consideration for supply a payment must be made for that supply, though it need not be made to the supplier nor does the supply have to be made to the payer. There is a practical necessity for a sufficient connection between the payment and the supply. The mechanics of the legislation will otherwise make it impossible to collect the GST. \[Emphasis added\] Expectation of a supply of goods and services is not enough 25.An expectation that the payee will supply goods and services is not enough. It is not sufficient that the person who receives the payment carries out some activity WITHDRAWN 8 UNCLASSIFIED that has the effect of benefiting either the person making the payment or some other person. 26.It is also not sufficient that the payment enables the payee to carry on its activity. Hence, a payment by the Crown to a charitable trust the Crown had established to promote the economic development and well-being of the Chatham Islands’ inhabitants and the provision of services in the interests of the community was not consideration for GST purposes. The trustees were fulfilling their fiduciary duties under the trust, and the payment was not an inducement for the performance of services by the trustees: Chatham Islands. Element of reciprocity must exist 27.The expression “in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of” in the definition of “consideration” involves an element of reciprocity: Taupo Ika Nui; Chatham Islands; Rotorua Regional Airport. What are the legal arrangements between the parties 28.It is necessary to consider the legal arrangements between the parties to determine whether a payment is consideration. In Chatham Islands, Blanchard J commented (at \[17\]): Although the linkage or nexus between a payment and the activity to which it gives rise may be very broad, it is still necessary to have regard to the legal form which is being employed: ... in taxation disputes the Court is concerned with the legal arrangements actually entered into ... not with the economic or other consequences of the arrangements. (C of IR v New Zealand Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 at p 13,192 citing Marac Life Assurance Ltd v C of IR \[1986\] 1 NZLR 694 at p 706. The tax being one on transactions, it is necessary to pay close attention to the legal nature of what has been done. Role and accountability of school boards 29.In Maddever v Umawera School Board \[1993\] 2 NZLR 478 (HC), Williams J discussed the role of school boards (at 505): The \[Education Act 1989\] was based on Administering for Excellence: The Report of the Task Force to Review Education Administration (the Picot report (1988)) which found that the existing administrative structure of the Education Act 1964 was over- centralised and overly complex. Its recommendations for change were largely implemented in the Education Act 1989, the title of which states that it is “An Act to reform the administration of education”. The statute brought about a marked devolution of decision making away from the Minister of Education and the Department of Education so that schools became the basic unit of education administration. The primary mechanisms in the statute to achieve the legislative objectives were the novel concept of boards of Trustees who were given by s 75 broad powers to manage schools and the idea of the school charter. WITHDRAWN 9 UNCLASSIFIED 30.Williams J then referred to the requirements relating to charters in s 61 of the Education Act and went on to say (at 505): It is thus clear that the \[Education Act 1989\] contemplates that the board, in consultation with the Minister, should have a significant role in determining the school’s educational goals and a degree of independence in deciding how those goals should be achieved. While the Ministry of Education influences a school’s broad objectives through the application of the national educational guidelines established under s 60A ... and the Minister also has a power of approval of school charters, the guidance thus provided is in rather general terms. It is for the parents, staff and other persons to largely determine the distinctive character of the charter for a particular school. 31.Williams J noted that the accountability of school boards was achieved in several ways, including the requirement that boards must adhere to their charters. 32.The policy of the Education Act, therefore, is to decentralise the administration of education so boards of trustees are responsible for controlling and managing the schools. Although school boards have considerable power to manage schools, such powers are subject to any enactment and the law of New Zealand: Schedule 6 to the Education Act. The Education Act provides for several ways to achieve accountability by boards, including the obligation for boards to adhere to their school charters (which must incorporate guidelines specified by the Minister of Education for the education services to be provided). Scope of free education 33.A student’s statutory entitlement to free education is established in s 3 of the Education Act: 3 Right to free primary and secondary education Except as provided in this Act, every person who is not an international student is entitled to free enrolment and free education at any State school or partnership school kura hourua during the period beginning on the person’s fifth birthday and ending on 1 January after the person’s 19th birthday. 34.“Education” is not defined in the Education Act. The term “education” is defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary ( 12th ed, Oxford University Press, 2011) as: the process of educating or being educated. > the theory and practice of teaching. > information about or training in a particular subject. 35.It is possible to define the limits of the obligation of school boards to provide education services (and, therefore, the scope of a student’s entitlement to free education). The national education guidelines issued by the Minister of Education specify the: outcomes desired from the school system; policy concerning teaching, learning, and assessment for the purposes of underpinning and giving direction to how curriculum and assessment responsibilities are to be managed; and subjects in which education is to be provided (including areas and levels of knowledge). 36.The Minister of Education specifies through national education guidelines or by regulation, in broad terms, the type, level, and standard of instruction or education to be provided in state schools. The national education guidelines are all the national education goals, foundation curriculum policy statements, national WITHDRAWN 10 UNCLASSIFIED curriculum statements, national standards, and national administration guidelines in force at the time under s 60A of the Education Act. 37.Every school must have a school charter. The purpose of the charter is to establish the missions, aims, objectives, directions and targets of the school board that will give effect to the Government’s national education guidelines and the board’s priorities: s 61 of the Education Act. Although the board has a significant role (through the preparation of the school’s charter) in determining the school’s aims and objectives and how these are to be achieved, the charter does not take effect if the Secretary for Education determines that it is inconsistent with the Education Act or the national administration guidelines: s 63A of the Education Act. The effect of a school charter is that it is an undertaking by the board to the Minister of Education to take all reasonable steps to ensure the school is managed, organised and administered for the purposes set out in the school charter and that the school and its students and community achieve the aims and objectives set out in the school charter: s 63 of the Education Act. (From 2019, school charters will be replaced by four-year strategic plans and annual implementation plans.) 38.Therefore, school boards have an obligation to provide education that complies with the requirements of the national education guidelines. New Zealand citizens and residents (and not international students under the Education Act) have a statutory right to free enrolment and free education at any state school: s 3 of the Education Act. The provision of free education in state schools is supported by a grant from the Crown: s 79 of the Education Act. Ministry of Education Circular 2018/01 39.The Ministry of Education provides guidance to boards of trustees and principals of state and state integrated schools and the proprietors of state integrated schools, and the sponsors of partnership schools kura hourua on the rights of boards, proprietors, sponsors, parents, and students in relation to requests for donations and other forms of payments in schools. That guidance is in Circular 2018/01. 40.In the circular, the Ministry makes the following nine points. Payments sought from parents are not compulsory except for attendance dues and charges for voluntary purchases 41.Payments sought from parents are not compulsory except for the attendance dues payable to the proprietors of integrated schools. Charges by schools for voluntary purchases of goods and services can be enforced, but only if the parent has agreed to make the purchase. 42.When communicating with parents, boards of trustees must clearly distinguish between requests for donations and for charges. The circular states: Requests for payment must make a clear distinction between attendance dues, charges, and donations - and between board of trustees’ and proprietors’ items. Ideally, invoices should specify attendance dues (for state-integrated schools) and charges for agreed optional goods or services only. Strictly speaking, schools cannot “invoice” donations as non-payment of donations does not give rise to a debt that is owed. On the other hand, it can make practical sense to list all requests for payments in a single document. In such cases, it must be made very clear which payments are voluntary and which are not. It is misleading to include a donation within a total which is described as ‘Balance Due’, or as being owed by a family. WITHDRAWN 11 UNCLASSIFIED Charges may not be imposed for materials used in delivering the curriculum 43.Charges may not be imposed for materials used in delivering the curriculum such as for using photocopiers, musical instruments or computer facilities. The most a school board can do is ask for a donation in the same way as it asks for a general donation. This is because the statutory right to free education implies there should be no charge for materials or equipment used in the delivery of the curriculum. 44.However, students may be charged for the hire of musical instruments owned by the school and used outside the delivery of the music curriculum. A charge may be made for costs involved in project work (such as the production of a T-shirt in a design class) but only if the student agrees to take ownership of the finished product. Schools cannot insist that students take finished products home. Charges may not be imposed for attendance at a school camp as part of the curriculum 45.Charges may not be imposed for a student’s attendance at a school camp that is part of the school’s curriculum, including part of the content of a particular course at the school. The Ministry of Education considers it is reasonable for parents to be asked to contribute towards the cost of food and the cost of travelling. Such a request for a contribution is a request for a donation. Students may not be excluded from attending a camp that is part of curriculum delivery. 46.If students are given the choice of participating in a school camp that does not form part of the delivery of the curriculum, the school may impose a charge. Students may not be excluded from attending a camp that is part of the curriculum because they cannot or will not pay a donation towards the cost 47.Students may not be excluded from attending a camp or going on a trip that is part of curriculum delivery (for example, field work in geography, biology and outdoor education programmes) because of an inability or unwillingness to pay a donation towards the activity’s cost. It is reasonable for parents to be asked to contribute towards the cost of food and towards the costs which are involved in travel. Such a request for a contribution is a request for a donation. Boards cannot require students to purchase a workbook that accompanies a course 48.Boards cannot require a student to purchase a workbook that accompanies a course and in which answers are written. Boards of trustees may sell workbooks, but purchase cannot be compelled. 49.Once a parent has opted to purchase the workbook, the cost becomes an enforceable charge. The circular states that if a workbook is made compulsory then a board of trustees may ask for only a donation towards the costs. Charges may not be imposed for some special curriculum programmes 50.Charges may not be imposed for curriculum programmes such as Reading Recovery, English for Speakers of Other Languages, special education services (speech therapy, behaviour or learning difficulties) or music tuition from Itinerant Teachers of Music. WITHDRAWN 12 UNCLASSIFIED Charges may not be imposed where tertiary-level courses are purchased as part of a secondary school programme 51.Charges may not be imposed where secondary schools purchase tertiary-level courses that they offer to senior students as part of the school programme. However, where the school merely facilitates a student’s enrolment in a tertiary course, meaning the student would be enrolled only part time at the school, the student is required to pay the fees associated with the tertiary course. Charges may be imposed for in-school activities at which attendance is voluntary 52.A charge may be imposed for in-school activities at which attendance is voluntary and conditional on payment being made such as performances by visiting drama groups, lunchtime sport or education outside the classroom opportunities. Boards may not withhold items such as leaving certificates to motivate parents to pay school donations 53.Boards must report on student progress and are subject to the Official Information Act 1982 and Privacy Act 1993. Therefore, boards are not entitled to withhold items such as students’ reports or leaving certificates to encourage parents to pay school donations or resolve unpaid debts for goods or services the school has provided. Commissioner accepts the views in Circular 2018/01 54.The Commissioner accepts the Ministry of Education’s views as expressed in Circular 2018/01. The supply of services that are necessary to the supply of education services (in which a school board has an obligation under its charter to provide instruction and in which participation by students is compulsory) is within the scope of education services to which there is a statutory entitlement to receive free of charge. 55.Services that are necessary to the supply of education services include the: use of materials or goods necessary for delivering the curriculum (for example, the use of computers, of photocopiers for copying materials used in delivering the curriculum, and for materials for practical subjects); the right to participate in activities that are a compulsory part of the curriculum (for example, camps that are part of the curriculum or fieldwork in geography or biology); and the provision of programmes such as Reading Recovery, English for Speakers of Other Languages and special education services (for speech therapy or behavioural or learning difficulties). 56.A distinction exists between the supplies described above and supplies made in circumstances where the supply made is not necessary to the supply of education services, and students or their parents have a choice as to whether to receive the supply. Such supplies include: goods supplied with a clear take-home component (such as stationery or materials) where a student is entitled to ownership of a finished product from practical classes, although a school may not insist that the student take ownership of such products; and attendance at or participation in extra-curricular activities that are optional. WITHDRAWN 13 UNCLASSIFIED Supply of education services 57.Where a school board brings to charge as revenue amounts received from the Crown, such as operational grants for the supply of education services, the delivery of outputs by the grant recipient is deemed to be a supply for GST purposes: s 5(6). This means payments the Crown makes, such as operational grants, are consideration, being payments made for a school’s supply of education services to students. 58.The Crown’s grant is provided for the supply of education services in terms of the undertaking given by the board to the Minister of Education. A supply may be taxed only once, although GST may be chargeable on any separate supplies the board makes to parents: Case R34 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,190 (TRA); Suzuki NZ Ltd v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,096 (CA). 59.In Suzuki, the taxpayer was obligated to repair defective vehicles under a warranty the taxpayer gave to its customers. In turn, the taxpayer had a warranty from its parent company (from which the taxpayer had purchased the vehicles) and had received payments from the parent company for carrying out the obligations of the parent company under the parent company’s warranty. There were two separate supplies: the supply of repair services under the warranty to customers and the supply of repair services to satisfy the obligations of the parent company under its warranty. As two separate supplies were made, the Court of Appeal did not accept that the Commissioner had sought to impose tax on the same supply (at \[24\]). 60.The Court of Appeal said at \[23\]: This is simply an instance of the common enough situation in which performance obligations under two separate contracts with different counter-parties overlap, so that performance of an obligation under one contract also happens to perform an obligation under another. In such case a supply can simultaneously occur for GST purposes under both contracts. There is a nexus in both cases between the performance and the consideration given by the other party. 61.Suzuki clarifies that sometimes simultaneous GST supplies might arise under arrangements with different parties, but for GST to be chargeable on those supplies a sufficient relationship must exist between each supply and the consideration given in return for that supply. Link between payment and supply where a statutory right exists 62.In some circumstances an existing statutory obligation may mean the relationship between the payment and a supply is insufficient. Two GST cases have addressed the situation where the parties had statutory rights or obligations outside any contractual relationship that might have existed between the parties: Television NZ Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,295 (HC); Case U1 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,001 (TRA). 63.Television NZ concerned payments the Department of Maori Affairs made to the Broadcasting Council (the assets and liabilities of which were later vested in Television New Zealand). The payments were for a training scheme operated by the Broadcasting Council (and later Television New Zealand) for Māori trainees. Television New Zealand argued that a supply had not been made for the payment because, in collaborating with the Department of Maori Affairs, the Broadcasting Council was merely discharging a statutory obligation to be a good employer. Being a good employer included operating a personnel policy that complied with the principle of being a good employer, including recognising the aims and aspirations WITHDRAWN 14 UNCLASSIFIED of Māori, the employment requirements of Māori, and the need for greater involvement of Māori as employees of the Broadcasting Council. 64.Tompkins J held that the Broadcasting Council had made a supply of services, being the provision of the training programme. A contractual obligation existed to provide the services, and the fact the supply was in accordance with the statutory obligations of the Broadcasting Council did not affect the conclusion that a supply was made under the contract. 65.Under contract law, the performance of a statutory duty is not consideration, although the undertaking of something more than the bare discharge of the duty can be good consideration: Ward v Byham \[1956\] 2 All ER 318 (CA); Williams v Williams \[1957\] 1 All ER 305 (CA). The Television NZ case is consistent with that principle. Reciprocity existed between the Broadcasting Council and the Department of Maori Affairs. Payment would not have been made if the services had not been provided. The Broadcasting Council had discretion about how it would carry out its statutory obligation to be a good employer. The provision of training services under the agreement with the Department of Maori Affairs was in accordance with the Broadcasting Council’s statutory obligations, but there was no direct and specific statutory obligation to provide the training. 66.In Case U1, the taxpayer had granted a lease under which the tenant had an obligation to pay rates (in addition to rental). The tenant was an “occupier” under the Rating Powers Act 1988 (being the lessee of a property under a lease for a term of not less than 12 months). Under the Rating Powers Act 1988, the occupier had primary liability to pay rates. The issue in Case U1 was whether the payment of rates formed part of the consideration for the lease. (Hence, the issue considered in Case U1 is slightly different from that considered in the Television NZ case.) 67.Judge Barber considered and rejected the argument that the payment of rates was consideration (because the obligation contained in the lease to pay rates was “in respect of” the lease). He also rejected the argument that the payment of rates by the lessee was part of the inducement to persuade the landlord to lease the farm at the rental figure agreed on and was part of the lessee’s response to the granting of the lease. Judge Barber considered that the lease merely recorded the legal position and was not consideration, because the payment of rates by the lessee satisfied the lessee’s own statutory obligation rather than an obligation of the lessor. (However, the payment of rates by a lessee under a lease would be part of the consideration for the lease, if the lessor were primarily liable for the payment of rates, and the lessee had accepted an obligation under the lease to meet the lessor’s liability.) 68.In Television NZ, the statutory obligation was expressed in general terms. However, in Case U1, the lessee had a specific statutory obligation to pay rates. Payments by parents and the statutory right to free education 69.Payments made by parents or guardians may supplement the Crown grant to the school. School boards have a considerable degree of autonomy as to how their funds are used. How the amounts paid are used is not the test of whether a supply is made for the payment: Chatham Islands. 70.Turakina also confirms that how payments are used does not determine the nature of the supply for the payments. In Turakina, the court (at 10,037) rejected the taxpayers’ argument that because attendance dues were applied to meet mortgage obligations of the proprietors of the schools, the attendance dues were paid for WITHDRAWN 15 UNCLASSIFIED exempt supplies (being the payment or collection of any amount of interest, principal or any other amount in respect of a debt security in terms of ss 14(1)(a) (previously ss 14(a)) and 3(1)(ka)). 71.An expectation exists that amounts paid by parents will be used for the purposes of the school. However, the Commissioner considers that, because the supply of education services is not conditional on payment being made by parents and because students have a statutory right to receive education services in a state or state integrated school free of charge (if they are not international students), the relationship is insufficient between the payments made by parents and the supply of education services to which a statutory entitlement exists. In addition, the Commissioner considers that when the payments made by parents are not made for any particular purpose and the school boards do not undertake any obligations in return for payment, this more strongly supports the conclusion that a sufficient relationship does not exist between the payment and any other supply: Chatham Islands. 72.Some school boards may attempt to collect amounts unpaid by withholding items (for example, school reports, leaving certificates or school magazines) until payment is made. It is possible to argue that, although school boards have an obligation to the Minister of Education to supply education services, if a threat is made to withhold education services unless payment is made, a separate obligation exists to parents to supply education services under a separate transaction with the parents. On that basis, it could be argued that the payments are consideration, being a payment for the inducement of the supply of education services. 73.The relationship between students and the school board is based at least in part on the Education Act: Grant v Victoria University of Wellington \[2003\] NZAR 185 (HC); A-G v Daniels \[2003\] 2 NZLR 742 (CA). A statutory right exists to free education: s 3 of the Education Act. All children from the ages of 6 to 16 must be enrolled at a school: s 20 of the Education Act. This means school boards have a corresponding statutory obligation to provide education in state and state integrated schools free of charge. Although boards may represent that education services would not be supplied if payment is not made, the true legal nature of the transaction is that the board cannot require payment for the supply of education services as students have a statutory entitlement to receive education free of charge. This is clearly supported by Circular 2018/01. 74.In Chatham Islands, Tipping J commented at \[25\]: GST is payable on transactions. When deciding whether a particular transaction is of a kind which attracts GST, it is important to analyse carefully its legal characteristics. No waiver of statutory right 75.A person may waive a statutory benefit conferred on that person under a statute if the waiver does not infringe some public right or public policy: Bowmaker Ltd v Tabor \[1941\] 2 All ER 72 (CA); Reckitt & Colman (NZ) Ltd v Taxation Board of Review \[1966\] NZLR 1,032 (CA). To determine whether a statutory right to free education can be waived, it is appropriate to consider whether the purpose of the legislation under which the right is conferred would be infringed by the waiver or contracting out: Johnson v Moreton \[1978\] 3 All ER 37 (HL); Lieberman v Morris (1944) 69 CLR 69 (HCA). 76.All New Zealand citizens and residents aged from 6 to 16 must be enrolled at a registered school and attend the school: ss 20 and 25 of the Education Act. WITHDRAWN 16 UNCLASSIFIED 77.Parents can choose to have their children educated at non-state schools. It could be argued that in that sense the statutory entitlement to free education can be waived. However, the public policy objective expressed in the Education Act is that all children are to receive education of a minimum standard. The provision of public funding for education and the entitlement to free education are intended to ensure cost is not a barrier to access to education. That free education is provided for a public purpose is confirmed by the 1993 statement of national education goals (New Zealand Gazette No 58, 29 April 1993), which states: Education is at the core of our nation’s efforts to achieve economic and social progress. In recognition of the fundamental importance of education, the Government sets the following goals for the education system of New Zealand. 1.The highest standards of achievement, through programmes which enable all students to realise their full potential as individuals, and to develop the values needed to become full members of New Zealand’s society. 2.Equality of educational opportunity for all New Zealanders, by identifying and removing barriers to achievement ... ... 6.Excellence achieved through the establishment of clear learning objectives, monitoring student performance against those objectives, and programmes to meet individual need. \[Emphasis added\] 78.Therefore, the right to free education is not solely a private right. If boards were able to impose a requirement for the payment of “fees” and individual parents were able to waive the right to free education, the purpose of the legislation would be infringed. 79.Although school boards have wide discretion to manage and control schools, such powers cannot be exercised in a manner inconsistent with a statutory provision: Part 2 of Schedule 6 of the Education Act. The Commissioner’s view is that school boards do not have the power to require payment as a condition of the provision of education or any other services or items that are properly regarded as being integral to the supply of education to which a statutory entitlement exists. This is confirmed in Circular 2018/01. 80.The Commissioner acknowledges that, given an illegal activity can be a taxable activity and given the definition of “consideration” does not require a contract to exist between the supplier and recipient for a payment to be consideration, payment need not be enforceable for the payment to be consideration. Therefore, the fact the transaction is invalid because the parties do not have the power to enter into a transaction, does not mean the transaction would not be recognised for GST purposes: C & E Commrs v Oliver \[1980\] 1 All ER 353 (QBD). However, the statutory entitlement to education cannot be altered by a representation that education services are conditional on the payment of “fees”. 81.Therefore, contributions paid to the board of trustees of a state school, whether for general or specific purposes, are not consideration for the supply of education services, even if there were a representation that schools reports or other information relating to the assessment of students would be withheld unless payment was made (albeit contrary to the legal position). However, if school boards supplied other goods or services beyond the supply of education services on the basis that the supply was conditional on payment being made, the payment would be consideration for that supply. WITHDRAWN 17 UNCLASSIFIED 82.If a contribution made includes a charge for an item that is beyond the supply of education services, such as a school magazine, a case may be made for apportionment of the payment. Section 10(18) states: Where a taxable supply is not the only matter to which a consideration relates, the supply shall be deemed to be for such part of the consideration as is properly attributable to it. Conclusion 83.Amounts paid by parents are not consideration for the supply of education services to which there is a statutory entitlement. This is for the following six reasons. 84.The first reason is that the definition of consideration under the Act is not the same as the contract law definition. A contract is not required between parents and school boards for the payments to be consideration for GST purposes: Turakina. However, for the payments to be consideration for a supply, a sufficient relationship must exist between payments and a supply: NZ Refining; Chatham Islands; Suzuki; Trustee, Executors and Agency Co. 85.The second reason is that because free education is a statutory right, when an amount is not paid for any particular purpose or for the undertaking of any specific obligation, a sufficient connection does not exist between the payments and a supply. This is so even though an expectation exists that the payments will be used for the taxable activity: Chatham Islands; NZ Refining. The fact the amounts parents pay to boards may be used to meet the cost of things not covered by the Crown grant does not establish the necessary connection that the amounts are paid for services of a particular nature: Turakina; Chatham Islands. 86.The third reason is that GST consequences are determined on the basis of the legal character of the transaction: Chatham Islands. The relationship between parents and school boards is based on the Education Act, which requires boards of state and state integrated schools to provide education, entitles students at state schools to free enrolment and free education, and entitles students enrolled at state integrated schools to free education on the same terms and conditions as students in state schools. The true legal nature of the arrangement between parents and the school board is that school boards have a statutory obligation to provide free education and students have a right to free education. The supply of education services is not conditional on the payment being made, and payment is not required for the supply of education services. 87.The fourth reason is that it can be argued that where a representation is made that education services would be withheld if payment is not made, the payments would be made “in respect of, in response to or for the inducement of” the supply of education services. However, because a statutory entitlement to free education exists in State schools, the true legal position is that education services would be provided whether or not payment were made. Therefore, a sufficient connection would not exist between the payment of general or specific amounts and the supply of education services to which there is a statutory entitlement. 88.The fifth reason is that a statutory right conferred on a person may be waived only if the waiver does not infringe the purpose of the legislation: Bowmaker Ltd; Reckitt & Colman; Johnson; Lieberman. The purpose of the Education Act is that all children should receive education of a minimum standard, and there should be no barriers to access to such education. That purpose would be infringed by a waiver WITHDRAWN 18 UNCLASSIFIED of the right to free education and an ability of school boards to require the payment of “fees” for education. 89.The sixth and final reason is that the scope of the obligation to provide education services is defined by the national education guidelines and by the school’s charter (into which the guidelines are incorporated). The supply of reports and other information relating to the assessment of students is integral to the supply of education services, and such information must be supplied free. The amounts would not be consideration, even if there were a representation that the supply of such information would be withheld unless payment was made (albeit contrary to the legal position). 90.Therefore, GST is not payable on amounts paid by parents or guardians to school boards to assist the school with meeting the cost of delivering goods and activities that are an integral part of the curriculum that the school has a statutory obligation to provide and in which participation by pupils is compulsory. However, if other services not integral to the supply of those education services are supplied on the basis that the supply is conditional on payment being made, the payment will be consideration for that supply. If a separate charge is not made for such an item, apportionment may apply: s 10(18). 91.For payments made by parents or guardians to schools to be consideration, it must be possible to identify a supply of goods or services other than the supply of education services that the schools are obliged to supply in terms of their charters. The two issues that need to be considered are: whether what is provided to students is within the scope of the statutory entitlement to education services; and if the supply made is for goods or services outside the scope of the statutory entitlement, whether a sufficient relationship exists between the supply and the payment for the payment to be consideration for those goods or services. Examples 92.The following eight examples explain the application of the law. The examples are consistent with the guidance in Circular 2018/01. None of the students in the examples are international students. Example 1 – General donation Each year the board of trustees of a state school asks the parents or guardians of students enrolled at the school to make a financial contribution to assist with meeting school costs. The board is not required to use the contribution for any particular purpose. The contribution is paid for the general purposes of the school, such as the school library, swimming pool and shared computer facilities, all of which are facilities available to any student. The payment is not consideration for the supply of education services because there is a statutory entitlement for students to receive education free of charge. Because the payment is received for the general purposes of the school and the board of trustees does not undertake any obligation to supply any goods or services in return for the payment, such payments are not consideration for any supply. Therefore, GST is not chargeable by the school board on the payments. WITHDRAWN 19 UNCLASSIFIED Example 2 – Payment for materials Students at a state school are asked to contribute towards the cost of materials used in a clothing class. The students are not required to take ownership of the completed item and will be entitled to ownership only if payment is made. A charge cannot be made for the use of materials necessary for the delivery of education services to which a statutory entitlement exists. However, a charge can be made for the right to ownership of an item constructed using such materials. The payment is not consideration for the use of the materials, because the use of such materials is necessary for the provision of instruction in the subject. However, if a student elects to take the completed item home, the payment is consideration for the right to ownership of the item, and the board is liable to account for GST on the payment. Example–3 - Photocopying In addition to a general school donation, parents of students at a state school are asked to pay photocopying charges for materials (such as articles, extracts from textbooks and homework exercises) used in teaching, even though such materials should be provided free of charge. The payment is not consideration. It is implicit in the right to free education that there should be no charge for the cost of materials used in the delivery of the curriculum. The provision of photocopied materials necessary for teaching is integral to the supply of education services. GST is not chargeable on the payment. However, if a student chooses to purchase their own copy of a photocopied school magazine produced by students, the payment made would be consideration for the supply of that item, and GST would be chargeable on the payment. Example 4 – School camp Students at a state integrated school are asked by the board for a donation towards the costs of a school camp (such as a year 12 outdoor education camp or a year 9 beginning of the year camp). Attendance at the camp is a compulsory part of the school’s curriculum. The donation amount is not subject to GST. This is because the payment is not consideration for the supply of education services as students have a statutory entitlement to receive education free of charge. The camp forms part of the supply of education services by the school. The student is entitled to attend the camp regardless of whether payment is made. Therefore, the payment does not have the requisite relationship to any supply for it to be consideration. Example 5 – Ski trip Each year, year 11 students have the option of going on a weekend ski trip to Mount Ruapehu. The trip is not compulsory and does not form part of the school’s curriculum. Parents are asked to pay $200 to cover costs. Students whose parents do not pay in full are not entitled to attend the ski trip. This payment is consideration for the right to participate in the ski trip. Therefore, GST is chargeable on the payment. WITHDRAWN 20 UNCLASSIFIED Example 6 – Stationery and workbooks A state school charges students for stationery packs and optional workbooks that students are entitled to keep. Parents may choose whether to purchase the stationery packs or workbooks from the school. The payment is made for the supply of the stationery and the workbook, so is consideration. Therefore, GST is chargeable on the payment. (The school may occasionally waive a payment for stationery by some students but this does not mean the payments for stationery made by other students are not made for the supply of stationery.) Example 7 – Visiting drama group A drama group puts on a performance at a state school. Attendance by students is optional but if students choose to attend a charge is payable. The payment is consideration for the right to attend the performance, and GST is chargeable on the payment. However, when students are required to attend a drama performance as a compulsory part of the curriculum, parents are not obligated to pay. Any payment by parents towards the cost of their child attending a compulsory performance will not be subject to GST. Example 8 – Advance payment of charges The board of trustees of a state integrated school asks parents or guardians of students enrolled at the school to make a single payment in advance, in return for future items to be supplied by the school, such as stationery and visiting drama groups, which the family has agreed to receive. The advance payment also includes an amount for a take-home item (such as a letterbox that will be made in workshop technology) that the student chooses to take home once they have built it. These goods and activities are not integral to the supply of education that the school has a statutory obligation to provide. The payment is made for the right to participate in the activities to which the payment relates or for the right to ownership of an item. The entitlement of students to these rights is conditional on payment being made, and GST is chargeable on the payment.

Background The depreciation rate for long-lived buildings was set to zero from the beginning of the 2011–12 income year. Long-lived buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. Buildings with a shorter estimated useful life have continued to be depreciable. The adjusted tax value of these buildings remained in the owner’s tax accounts. There was a transitional rule for building owners who had not previously separated out items of fit-out from the building. This rule allowed deductions for a portion of the building’s value each year. New Zealand’s position of a zero-depreciation rate for almost all buildings is unusual internationally. International studies have generally found that buildings do depreciate. The Tax Working Group reviewed and recommended changes to these tax settings. The Government has accepted the Group’s recommendation to reinstate depreciation for industrial and commercial buildings. However, the Government did not support reinstating depreciation on residential buildings because the data shows these buildings have a slower rate of economic depreciation. Key features Depreciation deductions for non-residential buildings are allowed from the beginning of the 2020–21 income year. The amendments apply to non-residential buildings owned at the beginning of the 2020–21 income year or acquired after the beginning of that year. This includes capital improvements. New definitions of “non-residential building” and “residential building” have been added. Page 3 of 25 UNCLASSIFIED Public 2020 No 8 | 25 Mar 2020 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The depreciation rate for a building with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more is 2% diminishing value or 1.5% straight line. Application date The amendments apply for the 2020–21 and later income years. Detailed analysis Setting a positive depreciation rate reinstates depreciation deductions for long-lived non- residential buildings from the beginning of the 2020–21 income year. While these buildings have always been depreciable property, they were subject to a zero percent depreciation rate. From the beginning of the 2020–21 income year the depreciation rate for long-lived non-residential buildings is either 2% diminishing value or 1.5% straight line. Opening tax book value The depreciation rate for long-lived buildings was set to zero from the beginning of the 2011–12 income year. The adjusted tax value of such buildings was effectively suspended at this point. Now a positive depreciation rate applies to long-lived non-residential buildings, owners of these assets can begin to claim depreciation deductions. For buildings owned at the end of the 2010–11 income year, the opening value for the 2020– 21 income year is the:  adjusted tax value at the end of the 2010–11 income year, less fit-out deductions taken under the section DB 65 transitional rule (if applicable); plus  non-deductible capital expenditure incurred on that building from the end of the 2010–11 income year to the start of the 2020–21 income year. For buildings acquired after the end of the 2010–11 income year, the opening value for the 2020–21 income year is the:  cost of the building; plus  non-deductible capital expenditure incurred on the building from the time it was acquired until the beginning of the 2020–21 income year. Page 4 of 25 UNCLASSIFIED Public 2020 No 8 | 25 Mar 2020 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Depreciation recovery If a building is sold, the amount of depreciation recovery income continues to be calculated taking into account total depreciation deductions taken before 2011–12 (if any). As a result of these amendments, the depreciation recovery calculation for non-residential buildings disposed of after the beginning of the 2020–21 income year will also need to account for depreciation deductions in the 2020–21 and future income years. Non-residential buildings Section YA 1 is amended. Two new definitions have been inserted and the definition of “building” has been repealed. A “non-residential building” is any building that is not a “residential building”. A “residential building” is defined as:  a “dwelling” as defined in Section YA 1; and  a building in which accommodation is ordinarily provided for periods of less than 28 days at a time if the building, together with other buildings on the same land, has less than four units intended for separate occupation. The definition of “dwelling” encompasses owner-occupied houses and apartments, and houses and apartments subject to residential tenancies. The second limb of the definition of residential building ensures there is certainty that the definition of “residential building” includes buildings such as a bach that the owner uses but also rents out on a short-term basis, and also buildings used exclusively for short-term accommodation provided by owners such as Airbnb properties. These may be within the definition of “dwelling”, but this amendment puts beyond doubt that those buildings remain subject to the zero depreciation rate. The less-than four units provision excludes larger commercial premises such as motels from being treated as residential buildings. Repeal of the 2010 transitional rule As a result of reinstating a positive depreciation rate for non-residential buildings, the transitional building fit-out rule introduced as part of the 2010 reforms is no longer required. Accordingly, section DB 65 has been repealed. As noted above, the adjusted book value of the building is required to be adjusted for past section DB 65 deductions. Page 5 of 25 UNCLASSIFIED Public 2020 No 8 | 25 Mar 2020 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Special depreciation rate The ability to apply for and be granted a special depreciation rate from the Commissioner has been restored for non-residential buildings. Page 6 of 25 UNCLASSIFIED Public 2020 No 8 | 25 Mar 2020 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Increase in the provisional tax threshold Sections RC 3, RC 4, RC 6, RC 9, RC 13, RC 14, RC 16, RM 12, and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 This amendment permanently increases the residual income tax threshold for being required to pay provisional tax from $2,500 to $5,000. As a result, a number of taxpayers are no longer required to make provisional tax payments throughout the year. This will assist those businesses with cashflow issues during the COVID-19 outbreak and beyond. Background Section RC 3(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 previously provided that a person whose residual income tax in an income year is more than $2,500 was required to pay provisional tax. This threshold is used several times throughout subpart RC and elsewhere, such as for dealing with:  voluntary provisional tax payments;  the standard uplift method;  provisional tax instalments; and  the GST ratio method. The threshold referred to in these sections, and others, has been changed in accordance with the implementation of this measure (with the exception of a terminating provision in section RZ 1). Provisional tax is paid in three equal instalments over an income year. The requirement to make these payments imposes compliance costs on taxpayers. It also has an impact on cashflow as provisional tax instalments comprise cash that a taxpayer is unable to use during the year before terminal tax is due. This measure removes around 95,000 taxpayers from the provisional tax regime. Key features This measure changes the threshold for paying provisional tax so that fewer taxpayers are required to pay provisional tax instalments throughout the year. For taxpayers with residual Page 7 of 25 UNCLASSIFIED Public 2020 No 8 | 25 Mar 2020 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] income tax of between $2,500 and $5,000, instead of paying provisional tax throughout the income year, they will now only have to pay by 7 February following the end of the income year. Example 1: Increase in the provisional tax threshold Jenny is a tour guide who provides tours of the Lord of the Rings filming location sites around Wellington through her company Jenstar Tours Limited (JTL). She gets the majority of her customers from tourist ships visiting Wellington. In the 2019–20 income year, JTL’s tax liability was $8,000, but because of the recent changes to restrict tourist ships in response to COVID-19, JTL’s tax liability in 2020–21 is expected to be half of that amount. The Government’s change to the provisional tax threshold from $2,500 to $5,000 means that JTL is not a provisional taxpayer for the 2020–21 income year. Instead of paying tax in instalments throughout the 2020–21 income year, JTL will not have to pay tax until 7 February 2022, which improves its cashflow during the year. Application date The amendment applies for the 2020–21 and later income years. Page 8 of 25 UNCLASSIFIED Public 2020 No 8 | 25 Mar 2020 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Increase in the low-value asset write-off threshold Section EE 38(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 This amendment temporarily increases the low-value asset write-off threshold from $500 to $5,000 in the short term before decreasing this threshold to $1,000 on a permanent basis. This allows taxpayers to immediately deduct expenditure on assets that cost up to $5,000 (and subsequently $1,000) rather than depreciating them over the life of the asset. This will decrease the tax liabilities of taxpayers in the short term and therefore assist with cashflow including during the COVID-19 outbreak. It may also encourage continued investment by businesses in the short term. Background Since 2005, the threshold value in section EE 38(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 for low- value asset write-offs had been $500. Assets costing up to this threshold could be immediately expensed, which provides all of the tax benefit in the year the asset was purchased. For example, capital expenditure on property that costs $2,000 exceeded the previous low- value asset write-off threshold and so was required to be depreciated over a number of years. Expenditure on an asset costing $300, however, could be immediately deducted so that all of the tax benefit was generated in the year of purchase, even if the asset lasts much longer than one year. Key features This measure increases the value of property that is eligible to be written off in the year of purchase from $500 to $5,000, before decreasing that threshold to $1,000. This means that expenditure on assets costing up to the new threshold can be deducted immediately, so that all of the tax benefit is claimed up front. This will provide increased cashflow in the short term.

The store’s owner, Clark, wants to expand by investing in two new display cabinets worth $4,600 in total. Clark believes that this will increase his sales of high-value action figures. However, with the COVID-19 restrictions, he is anxious about investing $4,600, especially given that he can only deduct the cost of the cabinets over time through tax depreciation (rather than immediately). The Government’s change to the low-value asset write-off threshold means that Capes can claim an immediate deduction for the cost of the cabinets. This allows Capes to reduce its tax paid this year by $1,288 (28% of $4,600), instead of that amount being spread over a number of years. Application dates The amendment to increase the low-value asset write-off threshold to $5,000 applies for property purchased on or after 17 March 2020. The amendment to subsequently lower this threshold to $1,000 will apply for property purchased on or after 17 March 2021.

Background COVID-19 has caused significant disruption to all businesses in New Zealand. There is a significant risk that this disruption could cause many R&D-performing businesses in New Zealand to reduce or stop their R&D. While ceasing R&D saves businesses money now, it means some New Zealanders will lose their jobs, fewer innovative products will be developed, and there will be a deeper and more protracted decline in economic activity. This weakens our economy’s ability to recover once the global economy has stabilised. The Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Act 2019 introduced an R&D Tax Incentive regime from the 2019–20 income year (“year 1”). The R&D Tax Incentive was developed under tight timeframes, so there was insufficient time to develop comprehensive refundability rules before the legislation was enacted. As a consequence, in year 1 of the Incentive, limited refundability rules (based on another R&D scheme, the R&D Tax Loss Credit) were put in place to provide refundable credits for a small portion of eligible R&D tax credit claimants (“year 1 limited refundability rules”). The Government reviewed the R&D Tax Incentive’s refundability rules in 2019 and developed some new, broader refundability rules. These new rules were put into place by the recently enacted Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020, and were originally intended to apply from the 2020–21 income year (“the year 2 broader refundability rules”). To provide cash to businesses now and encourage them to continue with their R&D despite COVID-19, this amendment brings the application date of the year 2 broader refundability rules forward to the 2019–20 income year. This is intended to enable more businesses to access refundable R&D tax credits, and provide some businesses with larger refunds than they would have obtained under the year 1 limited refundability rules. Page 11 of 25 UNCLASSIFIED Public 2020 No 8 | 25 Mar 2020 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Key features The amendment to section LA 5 changes the rules for R&D tax credit refunds in the 2019–20 income year, to make refundable credits more accessible for businesses. It does this by bringing forward the application date of year 2 broader refundability rules to the 2019–20 income year (year 1 of the R&D Tax Incentive scheme). These rules would otherwise have applied from the 2020–21 income year (year 2 of the R&D Tax Incentive scheme). Prior to this amendment, limited refundability rules applied in the 2019–20 income year, which only allowed businesses who met certain prescriptive criteria to access refundable credits. A $255,000 cap also applied to limit the total amount of credits that could be refunded. The year 2 broader refundability rules, which now apply from the 2019–20 income year, remove the prescriptive refundability eligibility criteria and replace the $255,000 cap with a new refundability cap based on labour-related taxes. These new rules are aimed at enabling more businesses to access R&D tax credit refunds, and allowing more of these businesses to access greater amounts of refundable credits. The year 2 broader refundability rules now apply by default to all claimants in the 2019–20 income year. Businesses have the option of using the previous year 1 limited refundability rules if they prefer. When filing an R&D supplementary return, each business will be asked to confirm which set of refundability rules they intend to apply to their claim. From the 2020–21 income year onwards (year 2 of the R&D Tax Incentive scheme), all businesses are required to use the year 2 broader refundability rules. Detailed analysis The amendment brings forward the application date of the year 2 broader refundability rules introduced in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020. Instead of applying from the 2020–21 income year, these new rules will apply from the 2019– 20 income year. Page 12 of 25 UNCLASSIFIED Public 2020 No 8 | 25 Mar 2020 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The broader refundability rules (default option) The year 2 broader refundability rules now apply from the 2019–20 income year (sections LA 5(4B), (5B) and (5C)). They apply by default, unless a business chooses to apply the limited refundability rules in section LZ 14 (section LA 5 (5D)). Under these rules, a loss-making business (or a business with insufficient income tax to pay to offset its R&D tax credits against) can be eligible for R&D tax credit refunds provided it is eligible for the tax credit more generally. It can obtain R&D tax credit refunds up to a new labour-related tax cap. The cap is made up of any labour-related taxes (PAYE, ESCT, and FBT):  paid by the business, and  paid by companies the business is controlled by or which sit within the same wholly- owned group, if these companies have allocated amounts to the business for the purposes of the cap. No cap applies to refundable R&D tax credits paid to levy bodies, or derived from eligible expenditure on approved research providers. Transitional 2020–21 amount deleted This amendment deletes the “transitional 2020–21 amount” portion of the refundability cap formula (see section 101 of the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans and Remedial Matters) Act 2020). The “transitional 2020–21 amount” is no longer needed because businesses can apply the year 2 broader refundability rules if they provide a better outcome for them in the 2019–20 income year. Eligibility of tax-exempt entities for refundability The amendment to LA 5(4B) means that tax exempt entities that otherwise satisfy the R&D Tax Incentive’s general eligibility criteria may now be eligible for refundability in the 2019–20 income year. These entities and their associates were previously largely ineligible for refundability under the limited refundability rules. Note that from the 2020–21 income year, entities which receive income that is tax exempt under sections CW 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 and/or 55BA of the Income Tax Act 2007 will be ineligible for the R&D tax credit. Refer to the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 for more information on this exclusion. Page 13 of 25 UNCLASSIFIED Public 2020 No 8 | 25 Mar 2020 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The limited refundability rules New section LZ 14 sets out the limited refundability rules, which businesses can choose to apply instead of the broader refundability rules if they prefer (section LA 5(5D)). A business can obtain R&D tax credit refunds under the limited refundability rules, provided it is a company and:  is in a tax loss position, or has insufficient income tax liability to utilise all of its R&D tax credits in the 2019–20 income year;  satisfies the R&D tax loss cash-out corporate eligibility and wage intensity criteria in sections MX 2 and MX 3;  does not derive exempt income (other than certain exempt income from dividends), and is not associated with a person who derives exempt income;  is not a listed company, and is not associated with a listed company; and  does not have an outstanding tax liability. Only the first $255,000 of the business’s R&D tax credits is refundable, which is the equivalent of $1.7 million of eligible expenditure. Any remaining R&D tax credits may be carried forward to the 2020–21 income year if the entity is eligible for the Incentive that year and the shareholder continuity requirements in section LY 8 are met. Choosing between the year 1 and year 2 refundability rules Businesses may choose to use the limited refundability rules or the broader refundability rules in the 2019–20 income year, but they cannot use both. Only the broader refundability rules are available from the 2020–21 income year. Example 3: Applying the broader refundability rules Moppy’s Chicken Factory (“Moppy”) has brought forward tax losses from the 2018–19 income year. It claims R&D tax credits in the 2019–20 income year, but does not have enough income tax to pay to use all of its credits. Moppy determines that it will be able to receive more refundable R&D tax credits if it applies the broader refundability rules, because it has $500,000 of surplus R&D tax credits and has paid $500,000 of PAYE in the 2019–20 income year (so its refundability cap is $500,000). Moppy files its income tax and R&D supplementary returns soon after 31 March 2020. It advises Inland Revenue that it would like to apply the broader refundability rules. Inland Revenue processes Moppy’s claim and refunds Moppy $500,000 of R&D tax credits. Page 14 of 25 UNCLASSIFIED Public 2020 No 8 | 25 Mar 2020 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Use of money interest remission Section 183ABAB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Use of money interest (UOMI) is charged when a taxpayer fails to make a payment of tax on time. This measure adds to existing legislative mechanisms that allow UOMI to be remitted. However, these pre-existing legislative mechanisms are not fit for purpose to respond to an event such as COVID-19. The amendment allows Inland Revenue to remit interest on a late payment if the taxpayer’s ability to make the payment on time was significantly adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. This would include both when a taxpayer is physically unable to make a tax payment on time and when a taxpayer’s financial capability to pay tax on time is adversely affected because of the economic nature of the COVID-19 outbreak. Background The purpose of UOMI is to encourage taxpayers to pay their tax on time and compensate the Government for the loss of use of money from taxpayers underpaying their tax. It applies to all tax types administered by Inland Revenue, including income tax and GST. UOMI also applies to underpayments of tax that are withheld at source, such as PAYE and RWT. UOMI also applies to Working for Families debt. In certain circumstances the Commissioner may remit UOMI on a late tax payment. For the remission of interest in response to emergency events, the pre-existing rules provided for an Order in Council process to allow the Commissioner to remit UOMI where a taxpayer is “physically prevented” from making a payment. However, the Commissioner could not remit interest for a taxpayer that was financially unable to make a payment on time because of the emergency event. The pre-existing rules around remitting UOMI in emergency events were directed at situations or events where public safety is of paramount concern because of the risk of injury or death, typically due to a natural disaster. This statutory framework was not fit for purpose to respond to the nature of the economic shock of COVID-19 where a taxpayer may be financially unable to pay their tax on time. Page 15 of 25 UNCLASSIFIED Public 2020 No 8 | 25 Mar 2020 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Key features Interest remission New section 183ABAB allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest if a taxpayer’s ability to make a tax payment on time is significantly adversely affected by an outbreak of COVID-19. This includes both where a taxpayer has been physically unable to make a payment on time, for example, because they have been quarantined and do not have the ability to make the payment electronically while quarantined, and where a taxpayer’s financial capability to make a payment on time has been adversely affected because of the economic impacts of COVID-19. For interest to be remitted the taxpayer must ask for it to be remitted and the Commissioner must be satisfied that the taxpayer has asked for the relief as soon as practicable and made the payment of tax as soon as practicable. The interest would not be remitted until the core tax debt has been paid. Further guidance on how the Commissioner will determine if a taxpayer’s ability to make a payment on time has been significantly adversely affected by COVID-19 is available at https://www.ird.govt.nz/covid-19/manage-my-tax/penalties-and-interest Sunset provision The Commissioner’s ability to remit interest only applies for the 24 months following the enactment date of 25 March 2020. However, this period can be extended by an Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue. This Order in Council would need to be made within the initial 24 months during which the Commissioner can remit interest. The extension to the time limit would expire after the period given by the order or 6 months after the order came into force if the order did not specify a time limit. However, the time limit could be extended further by subsequent Orders in Council so long as they are made before the date on which the preceding order would expire. In recommending the making of an Order in Council, the Minister of Revenue would need to be satisfied that the ability of taxpayers to pay tax on time is likely to continue to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19 beyond the expiry of the time limit. Page 16 of 25 UNCLASSIFIED Public 2020 No 8 | 25 Mar 2020 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Application dates The Commissioner’s ability to remit interest has applied since 25 March 2020. However, the Commissioner may remit interest that has accrued on tax payments due on or after 14 February 2020. Unless extended by Order in Council, the Commissioner’s ability to remit interest will expire after 24 March 2022. Page 17 of 25 UNCLASSIFIED Public 2020 No 8 | 25 Mar 2020 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Information sharing Schedule 7, part C, clause 23B Tax Administration Act 1994 The amendment enables Inland Revenue to share taxpayer information with other government departments to assist the efficient and effective delivery of the Government’s COVID-19 response. Background Currently, tax legislation requires Inland Revenue staff to keep taxpayer information confidential unless a specific legislative exception authorises the disclosure. Current exceptions in the tax legislation enable Inland Revenue to share information with specific agencies. These existing exceptions will be used, where possible, to share information with other agencies to assist in the response to the COVID-19 outbreak. However, there may be situations where, as a result of the outbreak, it is desirable for Inland Revenue to share information with other agencies with which Inland Revenue does not have any existing arrangements or where the existing arrangements are not flexible enough to allow the required sharing to occur. A similar provision to this one applied during the Canterbury earthquake and allowed Inland Revenue to share information with other government agencies as part of the government’s response to the Earthquake. This amendment is modelled on that provision. Key features The amendment inserts a new clause 23B into schedule 7 of the Tax Administration Act to allow Inland Revenue to share information with other government agencies in order to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. This provision is targeted, time limited, and only used when existing legislative provisions are not adequate to share information. The other agencies Inland Revenue could share information about persons or entities with are government departments, the New Zealand Police, ACC, and Kāinga Ora – Homes and Communities. The information would only be shared for the purpose of enabling those agencies to provide assistance to individuals and businesses, to fulfil any obligation or function, or exercise any power in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The information Page 18 of 25 UNCLASSIFIED Public 2020 No 8 | 25 Mar 2020 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] shared would not be available for use in administering other assistance not related to COVID-19. The information that could be shared would be both individual and non-individual information and may include, but is not limited to, identifying information, contact and location information, financial information, and family information. The provision would also enable information to be shared to enable the government agency to undertake compliance activity related to that COVID-19 assistance. This provision will be used, for example, to share information with the Ministry of Social Development to assist in determining employers’ entitlement to the wage subsidy and in auditing claims to counter fraud. Currently, tax legislation requires those persons who have access to taxpayer information to keep that information confidential and not disclose or use it for a purpose other than that for which it was provided. This requirement would also apply to the information sharing to assist the response to the COVID-19 outbreak. As a safeguard, Inland Revenue retains a discretion as to whether to share information and sharing would only occur where the information is readily available, it is reasonable and practicable to share, and it is not undesirable to share the information. Application dates The amendment applies from the date of announcement of the change, being 17 March 2020. The amendment will apply for a period of two years only unless extended by an Order in Council. This would allow the Government to continue sharing information, if required, in response to COVID-19 after the two-year period.

This amendment will remove the requirement for recipient families to normally be working at least 20 hours per week as a sole parent or a combined 30 hours per week as a couple. Background Currently, families that work a fluctuating number of hours from week-to-week or are unable to increase their hours of work do not receive the In-Work Tax Credit for weeks that they do not work – 20 hours for sole parents or 30 hours for couples. The number of families working reduced hours, or an unpredictable and varying number of hours, will increase as New Zealand’s economy feels the impact of COVID-19. Application date The amendments apply from 1 July 2020. Detailed analysis The hours-test Recipients of the In-Work Tax Credit are currently required to normally be working at least 20 hours per week as a sole parent or a combined 30 hours per week as a couple. This can result in families losing their entitlement to the In-Work Tax Credit in weeks where their hours have been reduced or families with unpredictable and varying hours, such as shift workers and those with multiple jobs, only being eligible for the credit in some weeks. Removing the hours test will ensure families that have their hours worked affected by COVID-19 will continue to receive the In-Work Tax Credit if they do not go onto an income tested benefit or student allowance and are earning some employment income. Page 20 of 25 UNCLASSIFIED Public 2020 No 8 | 25 Mar 2020 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 4 Janice is a sole parent who works two jobs and receives the In-Work Tax Credit. She is employed for 15 hours per week in one job, and 10 hours per week in another, working a combined 25 hours per week. Janice’s second employer ceases operations and she is now only working 15 hours per week for the foreseeable future. From 1 July 2020 onwards, Janice would continue to receive the In-Work Tax Credit despite her weekly hours of work being reduced below 20. Page 21 of 25 UNCLASSIFIED Public 2020 No 8 | 25 Mar 2020 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Working for Families tax credits entitlement for emergency benefit recipients Section MC 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendment allows people on a temporary visa who would not otherwise meet the Working for Families (WFF) residency criteria, to qualify for WFF, if the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) has granted them an emergency benefit. This ensures that people on a temporary visa who are granted an emergency benefit will qualify for the same WFF components as other beneficiaries. Background Prior to the amendment, emergency benefit recipients with dependent children and who are on a temporary visa, did not qualify for WFF tax credits. This was because they did not meet the residency criteria for WFF. The result was a difference in the financial support that these families could access, compared with other main benefit recipients with children. In general, to receive a main benefit (including an emergency benefit) a person must be a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident and have resided in New Zealand for at least two years since becoming a citizen or resident. However, MSD has discretion to grant an emergency benefit in other circumstances 1 when those residency criteria are not met. Existing WFF legislation did not contain any comparable discretion. The WFF residency requirements can be met by the child or the parent. The WFF residency requirements can be met by the child if:  the child is ordinarily resident in New Zealand; and  is present in New Zealand for the period of entitlement. 1 These circumstances can include not being eligible for another benefit, that they are in hardship and unable to earn a sufficient livelihood. Page 22 of 25 UNCLASSIFIED Public 2020 No 8 | 25 Mar 2020 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The WFF residency requirements can be met by the parent if:  the parent is ordinarily resident in New Zealand; and  has been in New Zealand for 12 months continuously at any time Those on a temporary visa are specifically excluded from the definition of New Zealand resident for WFF. This exclusion was intended to prevent short-term visitors from accessing WFF but not those in exceptional circumstances. The amendment ensures that families on a temporary visa who are granted an emergency benefit are able to access a comparable level of financial support to other recipients of main benefits. Key features If MSD grants an emergency benefit, to a person on a temporary visa, that person will qualify for the same WFF payment as other beneficiaries. That is, they could qualify for the family tax credit and Best Start, assuming they meet the other qualifying criteria. They will not qualify for the In-Work Tax Credit or minimum family tax credit because these payments are not available to a person receiving a main benefit. Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 2020. Page 23 of 25 UNCLASSIFIED Public 2020 No 8 | 25 Mar 2020 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] GST on COVID-19 related social assistance payments Section 89 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 The amendment provides that payments made by the Ministry of Social Development in relation to wages or other income, or leave taken, as a consequence of COVID-19, are not to be regarded as taxable grants and subsidies for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Background The Goods and Services Tax (Grants and Subsidies) Amendment Order 2020 (2020/44) added two new COVID-19 related payments made by the Ministry of Social Development to the schedule of non-taxable grants and subsidies contained in the Goods and Services Tax (Grants and Subsidies) Order 1992. The purpose of this Order was to ensure that GST- registered businesses that received these payments from the Ministry of Social Development did not need to return GST on them. This Order came into force on 24 March 2020, and consequently did not apply in respect of payments made by the Ministry of Social Development before that date. New section 89 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is intended to ensure that GST- registered businesses that received these payments from the Ministry of Social Development before 24 March 2020 do not need to return GST on them. Application date The amendment came into force on 25 March 2020, the date of enactment. The amendment applies retrospectively to payments made from 17 March 2020. Page 24 of 25 UNCLASSIFIED Public 2020 No 8 | 25 Mar 2020 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Winter energy payment Schedule 4, Part 8, Clause (1)(a), (b) and (c) of the Social Security Act 2018 This amendment reduced the rates of winter energy payment for 2021 and later years to $450 for single people with no dependent children (down from $900) and $700 for couples or single people with dependent children (down from $1,400). This restored the 2019 rates after a temporary doubling in the rates for 2020. Background In response to the economic impacts of COVID-19, the Government agreed that the annual rates of winter energy payments for 2020 would be $900 for single people with no dependent children, and $1,400 for couples or single people with dependent children. The increase is double the normal rate and was only intended to apply for the 2020 winter period (1 May to 1 October) when the impacts of COVID-19 are likely to be most pronounced. Key features The amendment ensures that the doubling of the winter energy payment rates for 2020 as part of the COVID-19 Recovery Package is only temporary. It reduces the rates back to their previous amounts of $450 and $700 for 2021 and later years. Application date The amendments to the winter energy payments rates come into force on 1 May 2021.

NEW LEGISLATION > NEW ACT Taxation (COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments and Other Matters) Act 2021 Issued: 18 February 2021 Public Act 2021 No 1 The Taxation (COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments and Other Matters) Bill was passed under urgency on 16 February 2021. The new Act received Royal assent on 18 February 2021. It amends the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 2007. The new legislation allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to make grants to eligible businesses impacted by increases to the COVID-19 alert levels and increases the minimum family tax credit threshold.

Background The Act contains a number of amendments to support the scheme to assist businesses who are adversely affected by increases to the COVID-19 alert levels. The scheme is administered by Inland Revenue. More detailed information on the operation of the scheme is available at https://www.ird.govt.nz/covid-19/business-and-organisations/employing-staff/financial- support/resurgence-support-payment Key features The new Act makes the following changes to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA).  Inserting new section 7AAB authorising the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to make grants to eligible businesses.  Inserting new section 7AAC which allows the scheme to be activated by Order in Council.  Amending the definition of “tax” in section 3 of the TAA to allow Inland Revenue to use its existing debt management and care and management powers to administer the scheme.  Amending schedule 7 of the TAA to allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to publish information relating to the scheme, including names of persons to whom the Commissioner has made a grant under the scheme. Application date The amendments apply from the date the Act received Royal assent. Page 3 of 8 Public Act 2021 No 1 | 18 February 2021 Detailed analysis The Act amends the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 2007. Section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The definition of “tax” in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is amended to include an amount payable in relation to the grant made under the scheme. The amendment would allow Inland Revenue to use its existing debt management and care and management powers to administer the grant. Section 7AAB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The new section 7AAB authorises the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to make a grant under the scheme to an eligible applicant when the scheme has been activated. The subsection (1) outlines:  the main criteria for activating the scheme – an escalation in alert levels, and  the main eligibility criteria – that the applicant has suffered a significant reduction in revenue as a result of the escalation in alert levels. While the details of these two criteria have not been specified in the Act, the policies underpinning the scheme are as follows.  The scheme may be activated when there is an increase in alert level from alert level 1 to alert level 2 or higher, and after remaining at an alert level higher than 1 for 7 days or more.  A reduction in revenue of 30% or more constitutes “a significant reduction in revenue”. This is to be calculated by comparing a 7-day period at alert level 2 or higher with the typical weekly revenue in the 6 weeks preceding the move from alert level 1.  The amount of decline in revenue will also be used to determine the size of the grant the applicant is eligible to receive. The amount of the grant will be the lower of the amount calculated using the formula ($1,500 plus $400 per FTE) and four times the amount the applicant’s revenue has declined by as declared by them in their application. In the event of an increase in alert levels from alert level 1, subsection (2) authorises the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to make a grant under the scheme to an eligible person provided that the scheme has been activated by an Order in Council made under the new section 7AAC. Page 4 of 8 Public Act 2021 No 1 | 18 February 2021 Once the scheme has been activated, subsection (3) requires the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to determine and publish the eligibility criteria and determine the terms and conditions of the scheme. Subsections (6) and (7) require the entire amount of the grant, and any amount payable under the terms such as interest and penalties if any, to be paid back to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under particular circumstances. This would ordinarily be when a person receives the grant despite not meeting the eligibility requirements, or when the recipient of the grant breaches the terms and conditions of the grant. However other circumstances may be specified in the terms and conditions. Subsection (8) clarifies that the recipient of the grant must keep sufficient records to demonstrate that they meet the eligibility requirements and that they have not breached the terms and conditions. This information keeping requirement extends to the person who applied for the grant on behalf of the recipient. Subsection (10) allows for the scheme to be activated and grants made under this scheme for increases in alert levels prior to the enactment of this Bill. Section 7AAC of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The new section 7AAC allows the scheme to be activated by Order in Council. Such an Order in Council may describe a class or classes of persons who may apply for support under the scheme and specify:  the period in which the scheme will operate  the amount of the grant, and  any amendments to the scheme as required. Section 7AAC also allows the Order in Council to extend, renew, or replace a time limit in relation to the publication of information in relation to the scheme. Section 157 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The definition of “income tax” in section 157(10) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is amended to include the entire amount of the grant that the recipient has to pay back. In the event that the recipient makes a default in the repayment of the grant to the Commissioner Page 5 of 8 Public Act 2021 No 1 | 18 February 2021 of Inland Revenue, the Commissioner is able to pursue the outstanding balance by issuing a notice under section 157. Schedule 7, part A, clause 13B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The new clause 13B in schedule 7, part A, of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to publish information relating to the scheme. Information that the Commissioner intends to publish includes the names of the persons to whom the Commissioner makes a grant under the scheme. However, the Commissioner is limited in the types of information that can be published and the clause imposes a time limit of 24 months for the information to remain published. This time limit may be extended by Order in Council made under section 7AAC on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue. Although this is not specified in the Act, the current policy on the publication of information is that only the following will be published:  the name of the recipient of the grant  the amount paid, and  the period of alert level escalation for which this payment relates. However, the above will not be published if:  the recipient has fewer than three employees, or  the amount paid is capped four times the declared revenue decline. The information will be published on a searchable database on the Inland Revenue website. Section MB 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The amendment to section MB 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 excludes a payment under the scheme from the calculation of a person’s family scheme income. The rationale behind this is a grant made under the scheme is for business purposes only. As the grant is not available for private use, it should not be included in calculating a person’s family scheme income. Section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The definition of “exempt interest” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is amended to include interest payable in relation to the repayment of a grant under the scheme. This Page 6 of 8 Public Act 2021 No 1 | 18 February 2021 amendment relates to resident withholding tax (RWT) and ensures the grant recipient does not have to deduct RWT on any interest charged by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Page 7 of 8 Public Act 2021 No 1 | 18 February 2021 Minimum family tax credit threshold increased Section ME 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The Act increases the minimum family tax credit (MFTC) threshold to align with the increases in benefit abatement thresholds. Background From 1 April 2021, the benefit abatement thresholds will increase, allowing beneficiaries to earn a greater amount of additional income before their benefits start to reduce. As a consequence, the MFTC threshold is increased from 1 April 2021. Key features The Act increases the MFTC threshold (described as the “prescribed amount” in section ME 1(3)(a)) of the Income Tax Act 2007) from $29,432 to $30,576, for the purposes of calculating MFTC entitlements (section ME 1(2)). The increase in the prescribed amount represents a $22 increase in weekly income for MFTC recipients. Application date The increase applies from 1 April 2021.

This item is intended to resolve uncertainties relating to ownership for certain transactions under the revised bright-line test. This item deals with the 10 year bright-line period. It will complement IS 23/02 which addresses the 5 year bright-line period. Closed. Item no longer required due to reduction of bright-line period. PUB00489 Income Tax – Land – Bright- line test – rollover relief This project will provide guidance on the application of the rollover relief rules for the bright-line test. It may be challenging for customers to understand all the circumstances in which rollover relief is available, including who is an associated person for the new rollover rule, and what the effect of rollover relief is. It is appropriate that more guidance is available for customers Considering issues PUB00488 Income Tax – Land – Bright- line test – updating public items for changes This project will update existing public items containing guidance on the bright- line test for recent legislative changes.

This item arises from a question we were asked. With the extended bright-line test more New Zealanders will find themselves subject to both Australian capital gains tax and New Zealand income tax when they dispose of property they own in Australia. Closed. Existing public guidance is available in IS 16/05. Item no longer required due to reduction of bright-line period.

With high property values and the increasing cost of living more people are living permanently in tiny homes and caravans etc. This item will explain whether the main home exclusion applies to disposal of the land they are sited on. Closed. Existing public guidance is available on the scope of the main home exclusion and its application. Item no longer required due to reduction of bright-line period. PUB00429 Income tax – Land – Main home exclusion and secondees This item will consider how the main-home exclusion for the bright-line test applies if someone leaves their home vacant or occupied by other family members when on secondment to another city/place or country. We have been asked to provide guidance on the operation of the main home exclusion for people on secondment or who leave their house for other reasons. This project was closed on the basis guidance is no longer needed due to reduction of bright-line period. In its place a new related item was published on 31 May 2024 as QB 24/01.

PUB00482 Income tax – Land – Moving between the different land regimes People’s circumstances and how they use their property can change. This item will work through some scenarios to show how the loss ring fencing rules and the mixed- use asset rules interact when a person changes how they use their property. We recognise it can be challenging applying the land rules, but this is especially so when a person changes how they use their property – as that change can affect which land rules apply to them.

This item will consider the tax treatment of such payments. Periodically Inland Revenue is asked for advice on this issue and given that advice is usually sought at a difficult time for the employer and families, it seems appropriate to publish some public guidance on the tax treatment of such payments.
