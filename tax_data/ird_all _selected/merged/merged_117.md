The main changes include:  introducing a principal purpose method for goods and services acquired for $10,000 or less (GST exclusive) that allows a registered person to claim a full GST input tax deduction (instead of apportioning the deduction based on the percentage taxable use)  no subsequent adjustments are made for goods or services acquired for $10,000 or less  reducing the number of adjustment periods that GST-registered persons need to monitor their percentage actual use of assets and make annual adjustments to ten years for land and two years for goods and services acquired for between $10,000 to $20,000 (GST exclusive), and  allowing GST-registered persons to elect to treat certain goods that have mainly private or exempt use, such as dwellings, as if they only had private or exempt use. This means no input tax deduction is claimed when purchasing the goods, and no output tax is charged when the goods are sold. Background To ensure GST is not a cost on business production, businesses can claim input tax deductions on purchases of goods and services they use to make taxable supplies. However, where the asset is used both to make taxable supplies and for non-taxable use, such as a van delivering packages during the week and used privately in the weekend, the taxpayer can only deduct a percentage of the total input tax deduction. The deduction is based on their estimate of the percentage of taxable use. This is known as apportionment. Apportionment ensures GST is collected on the asset’s non-taxable use. Once a business has claimed an input tax deduction based on their estimated taxable use, they are generally required to monitor their actual use of the asset over time. If the estimate is inaccurate, they must account for this difference in their GST return at the end of each adjustment period (tax year). This is known as an adjustment or change in use. The previous GST apportionment and adjustment rules were complex and imposed high compliance costs. For example, the apportionment rules apply to all goods and services acquired by registered persons. This imposed undue compliance costs for low-value assets, Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 4 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 such as computers, phones, and tools, which often only have a minor amount of private or exempt use. Also, the previous rules could generate large and unexpected GST liabilities. For example, if a registered person sold an asset (for example, land or a dwelling) that they had used a small percentage of to make taxable supplies (for example, as a home office or workshop), the sale could be a taxable supply. However, such disposals would often not be taxable supplies if a different ownership structure had been used, for example, owning the asset through a company, partnership or trust that was separate to the registered person using part of the asset in their taxable activity. To address these issues, reforms have been made to reduce business compliance costs, better align the rules with current taxpayer practices, and improve fairness between different types of ownership structures. Key features The amendments have made the following key changes:  For goods and services acquired for $10,000 or less (GST exclusive), there is a new principal purpose method in sections 20(3CB) and (3CC) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act). This method allows a registered person to claim a full GST input tax deduction for goods or services that they acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. This is instead of applying the apportionment or adjustment rules. If a registered person chooses not to apply the principal purpose method, they will be required to continue to apply the general apportionment method to all their purchases of $10,000 or less for at least 24 months. Registered persons who have agreed an alternative apportionment method with Inland Revenue should continue to apply the alternative method.  No subsequent adjustments are made for goods or services acquired for $10,000 or less.  The number of adjustment periods that GST-registered persons need to monitor their percentage actual use of assets and make annual adjustments is reduced to ten years for land and two years for goods and services acquired for between $10,000 and $20,000 (GST exclusive).  Sections 6(3)(e) and 91 allow GST-registered persons to elect to treat certain assets that have mainly private or exempt use, such as dwellings, as if they only had private or exempt use. The goods cannot have been acquired or used for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies and the person cannot have claimed GST deductions for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 5 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 cost 1 or capital improvements to the goods. When the goods are subsequently sold or disposed of, the registered person can elect for the sale of those goods to not be considered part of their taxable activity.  In contrast, the disposal of an asset for which a registered person has previously claimed taxable use is deemed to be a taxable supply under sections 5(16) and (16C). In addition, where the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (Commissioner) considers a registered person has increased their non-taxable use of goods or services and then applied the wash-up rule in section 21FB in contemplation of the sale of the goods or services or ceasing their taxable activity, the disposal of the relevant asset is deemed to be a taxable supply.  The wash-up rule in section 21FB can now apply when there has been any permanent change in use and at the end of the adjustment period in which the change of use occurred.  Amendments to sections 20(3E), (3EB), 21(4) and (4B) allow Inland Revenue to approve a wider range of apportionment methods that are more practical for GST-registered businesses to apply. Inland Revenue can also publish certain alternative apportionment methods considered acceptable to use by certain GST-registered persons and the circumstances in which they can be used.  The special mixed-use asset rules in sections 20(3JB) and 20G of the GST Act, which apply to certain holiday houses, boats and aircraft with private, taxable and at least 62 days vacant use during the owner’s tax year, will be repealed from 1 April 2024. GST input tax deductions and adjustments will instead be calculated using the general GST apportionment rules that apply to other assets.  Section 61B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 enables Inland Revenue to prescribe an information disclosure for certain GST-registered persons who acquire land, ships or aircraft they intend to use to make taxable supplies. Effective date Most of the changes have effect for goods and services supplied, or adjustment periods beginning, on or after 1 April 2023. The exceptions to this are noted below: 1 If the goods were acquired as a zero-rated supply, the registered person must have returned output tax for the amount of GST they would have been charged if the supply had been standard-rated (15%). Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 6 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023  The amendments to allow GST-registered businesses to elect to treat the supply of certain goods, with mainly private or exempt use, as a non-taxable supply generally have effect for supplies made on or after 1 April 2011. This is retrospective so it aligns with previous GST positions taken and ensures affected businesses do not incur additional GST and compliance costs.  Remedial amendments to the definition of “actual deduction” in the wash-up calculation in section 21FB of the GST Act and the definition of “percentage actual use” in section 21G have effect on 30 June 2014, which is the date that section 21FB was first introduced.  The amendments to the asset value thresholds determining the number of years that post-acquisition adjustments are required take effect on1 April 2023.  The amendments to sections 20(3E), (3EB), 21(4) and (4B) of the GST Act to allow Inland Revenue to approve a wider range of agreed apportionment methods and publish approved apportionment methods take effect on 1 April 2023.  The repeal of the mixed-use asset rules in sections 20(3JB) and 20G of the GST Act have effect for a registered person’s first adjustment period beginning on or after 1 April 2024. Detailed analysis Principal purpose method for goods and services acquired for $10,000 or less Sections 20(3CB) to (3CH) of the GST Act provide a principal purpose method that allows a registered person to claim a full input tax deduction for a supply of goods and services acquired for $10,000 or less (excluding GST) for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Principal purpose is intended to have the same meaning in section 20(3CC) as the reference to principal purpose used in the pre-2011 GST Act definition of “input tax”. The principal purpose is the main, primary, or fundamental purpose. This does not necessarily equate with more than 50 percent taxable use. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 7 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 Example 1: Goods acquired for $10,000 or less with a principal purpose of making taxable supplies Phil is a GST-registered contractor who acquires a laptop for $3,000 (plus $450 GST) for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, although he may also use it occasionally for private use. Because the laptop was acquired for $10,000 or less (GST exclusive) and for a principal purpose of making taxable supplies, Phil can claim a full input tax deduction for the $450 GST he paid on acquisition in his next GST return. If a supply of goods or services is acquired for $10,000 or less (excluding GST) but not for a principal purpose of making taxable supplies, a registered person is not typically able to claim an input tax deduction for the acquisition of the good or service. Example 2: Goods acquired for $10,000 or less with mostly private use Amy acquires a car for $9,000 (plus $1,350 GST) for the principal purpose of private use, but she may also use it occasionally in her business to make taxable supplies (estimated 20 p ercent taxable use by kilometres travelled). Because the car was acquired for $10,000 or less (GST exclusive) and not for a principal purpose of making taxable supplies, Amy is unable to claim an input tax deduction on acquisition or make any subsequent adjustment for the 20 percent taxable use. It is expected that most registered persons will use the principal purpose method. If they elect to use it, they will need to apply it to all goods and services they acquire for $10,000 or less. The general apportionment rules continue to apply for higher value purchases when the good or service is used by the registered person to make both taxable and non-taxable supplies, such as exempt supplies or for private use. When the acquired goods or services can be identified as being exclusively used for making taxable supplies, making exempt supplies or private use, the registered person should directly attribute and either claim a full input tax deduction (if only taxable use) or no deduction (if only non-taxable use). Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 8 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 When apportionment is required, the general apportionment method requires the registered person to apportion input tax deductions and make adjustments based on the percentage (e.g. time, space or value) of the good or service that is used to make taxable supplies. Choosing not to use the principal purpose method If a registered person would prefer not to use the principal purpose method for purchases of $10,000 or less, they can instead choose to continue to apply the general apportionment method to all their inputs. This may be because it is simpler for them to use the general apportionment rules for all their purchases, rather than two different methods. If they choose not to use the principal purpose method, they must do this for a minimum period of 24 months. T he 24-month period applies from the first date that the registered person files a tax position in a GST return where they have elected not to use the principal purpose method. They then cannot apply the principal purpose method for other input tax deductions claimed in their GST returns for the next 24 months. Once those 24 months have passed, they can choose to start using the principal purpose method for their subsequent purchases of $10,000 or less, or they can again elect out of using it for the next 24-month period. Example 3: Electing not to use the principal purpose method for 24 months Property Co purchases certain inputs, such as vehicles and leasing an office space, that it uses to make both taxable supplies of commercial leases and exempt supplies of residential tenancies. Property Co has established an apportionment method for tracking its percentage of taxable use of these inputs and would prefer not to change from this method to a principal purpose method for goods and services that are newly acquired for $10,000 or less. In its GST return filed on 29 May 2023, Property Co takes input tax deductions for all its expenses (including goods and services acquired for $10,000 or less in the taxable period since 1 April 2023) based on the general apportionment rules rather than using the principal purpose method. Property Co cannot apply the principal purpose method until at least 29 May 2025 when 24 months have elapsed since it first elected not to apply the principal purpose method. In early 2025, Property Co has sold most of its properties that it used to make exempt supplies and decides it would now be simpler to begin using the principal purpose method for newly acquired goods and services purchased for $10,000 or less and chooses to do this in its GST returns that are filed after 29 May 2025. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 9 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 Some registered persons have agreed to use an alternative apportionment method with Inland Revenue. In these cases, the registered person should continue to use the agreed alternative apportionment method (to the inputs that this agreement applies to) rather than apply the principal purpose method. This is provided for by section 20(3CB) not applying to a person who has agreed an apportionment method with the Commissioner under section 20(3E), 20(3EB), 21(4), or 21(4B). Registered persons can choose to use an alternative apportionment method that has been agreed between Inland Revenue and an industry association of which the person is a member. They can also choose to use an alternative apportionment method that has been published by the Inland Revenue and made available for persons in their circumstances to use. In such cases, the agreed method would apply instead of the principal purpose method. This is provided for by sections 20(3EB) and 21(4B). Required number of adjustment periods Adjustments are no longer made for goods or services valued at $10,000 (excluding GST) or less. This means that once a registered person has claimed an input tax deduction at the time these goods or services were acquired (or when they first use the goods or services to make taxable supplies), they cannot make subsequent adjustments based on the actual use of those goods or services. Adjustments are still required at the end of a registered person’s adjustment period (tax year) for goods or services valued at more than $10,000. The required minimum number of adjustment periods are displayed in the following table. They depend on whether the goods are land and on the value of other types of goods or service (other than land). Table 1: Required number of adjustment periods Value of good or service, excluding GST Required number of adjustment periods (Balance dates since acquisition or first taxable use) $10,000 or less No adjustment to the input tax deduction taken when the goods or services were acquired. $10,001 to $20,000 Two $20,001 to $500,000 Five $500,000 or more Ten Land (regardless of the value of the land) Ten Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 10 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 Alternatively, a registered person can use the number of adjustment periods equal to the estimated useful life of the asset as set by the Commissioner in the Tax Depreciation Rates Determinations. For goods or services acquired for more than $10,000, the above requirements are a minimum limit, which means the registered person can elect to make annual adjustments for a higher number of adjustment periods, if they would prefer to do so. If the registered person sells the asset in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity or has a deemed disposal because they cease their taxable activity, they may still need to make a final adjustment under section 21F, which provides an additional input tax deduction to account for their non-taxable use of the asset. Example 4: Required number of adjustment periods Belinda bought a car for $18,400 (including $2,400 GST) in February 2021. Belinda was initially working as employee of a surveying business, but in August 2021, she decides to start her own surveying business and registers for GST. As she will now be using the car to make taxable supplies, she makes annual adjustments at the end of each adjustment period (her tax year) to claim a percentage of the GST she paid for the car based on the percentage she has used it to make taxable supplies. She calculates this percentage by measuring the kilometres travelled for her GST-registered business as a percentage of the total kilometres travelled by the car since she purchased it in February 2021. Belinda has made GST adjustments for two adjustment periods (ending on 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2023) for the car, which was valued for more than $10,000 and less than $20,000 (GST exclusive) when she bought it. Her taxable use of the car at the end of 31 March 2023 was 77 percent, which means she has claimed input tax deductions totalling 77 percent of the $2,400 GST she paid when she bought the car. From 1 April 2023, Belinda is not required to make further adjustments for the car at the end of her tax year as she has already made adjustments for two adjustment periods. Although she could choose to continue to make adjustments at the end of each tax year, she decides not to do so. Belinda sells the car in May 2024 for $9,200 (including $ 1,200 GST). She makes a final adjustment under section 21F to claim a further input tax deduction of $276 (0.15 x Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 11 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 9200 x (1-0.77)). Belinda returns $1,200 output tax and claims a $276 input tax deduction in her next GST return following the sale of the car. Election to treat supply of certain goods as non-taxable supply Section (6)(3)(e) has been added to the list of activities that are not a taxable activity in the GST Act. This provision allows registered persons to elect to treat the sale of goods that were not acquired or used for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies as not part of their taxable activity. This means a sale of qualifying goods is not in the course or furtherance of the registered person’s taxable activity so would not be a taxable supply (and therefore not subject to GST). This aligns the GST rules with current practices for GST-registered persons who may own goods, such as private dwellings, that are principally for private or exempt use, but who may also use the goods for a small percentage of the time or use a small percentage of the goods to make taxable supplies. These GST-registered persons may not have considered these goods to be part of their taxable activity and therefore not included GST positions for acquiring, using, or disposing of them in their GST returns. The rule is limited to goods (and not services) as it is intended to be used for tangible assets, such as land, dwellings or vehicles, which are likely to have minimal use in making taxable supplies, rather than intangibles, such as brands or intellectual property, which are likely to have a mainly taxable use when acquired by registered persons. The rule deems the sale or disposal of the goods (including a deemed disposal because the person ceases to carry out a taxable activity) not to be a taxable supply. Where land or dwellings are provided by way of a lease, the GST treatment of the lease is determined under other GST rules, such as whether the lease is consideration for an exempt supply of accommodation in a dwelling or for a taxable supply of services. To qualify as a supply that is not in the course or furtherance of the person’s taxable activity, the goods must satisfy the following requirements outlined in section 6(3)(e):  No previous input tax deductions were claimed by the registered person for the goods under section 20(3) before the goods were sold.  The goods were not acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies.  The goods were not used for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 12 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023  The goods were not acquired as zero-rated supplies under section 11(1)(m) or (mb), or if they were acquired as a zero-rated supply, the recipient has made an output tax adjustment for the nominal GST component under section 20(3J)(a)(iv). These requirements are explained below. No input tax deductions under section 20(3) The first requirement is that the registered person cannot have claimed a deduction under section 20(3) for the supply of goods before the goods are sold. If they have claimed a deduction for the goods under section 20(3), the sale of the goods by the registered person will generally be a taxable supply. The exception is if the goods were acquired before 1 April 2023 and the registered person applies the transitional rule in section 91 before 1 April 2025 (the transitional rule is further explained in a later section). The relevant deductions that the registered person may have claimed under section 20(3) could include:  an input tax deduction under section 20(3)(a) or (b) at the time the goods were acquired  a subsequent deduction under section 20(3)(e) after applying the adjustment rules to the goods at the end of the person’s adjustment period, or  deductions under section 20(3) for other goods and services that were acquired and became an integral part of the goods that are sold. Integral part means the goods would be considered incomplete or unable to function without the item. When determining if inputs that the registered person claimed an input tax deduction for became an integral part of the goods being sold, it may be useful to consider if the input represents capital expenditure for income tax purposes and whether it is a separate capital item for income tax depreciation. Further guidance on these concepts is available in Interpretation Statement: IS 12/03 Income tax – deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure – general principles and Interpretation Statement IS 10/01 Residential Rental Properties—Depreciation of Items of Depreciable Property. The registered person will still be able to satisfy the requirement if they claim input tax deductions for inputs that did not become an integral part of the goods that are sold, such as overheads, repairs and maintenance, or operating costs. They would not satisfy the requirement if they claimed deductions for inputs that made a substantial capital improvement to the goods. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 13 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 Example 5: Dwelling with minor use in registered person’s taxable activity Rebecca is a registered person who acquired a dwelling that was not a zero-rated supply when it was acquired. She did not claim deductions under section 20(3) for the cost of acquiring the dwelling or any subsequent capital improvements to the dwelling. Although part of the dwelling is used to run Rebecca’s taxable activity of farming, t he dwelling’s principal purpose is a private residence. Rebecca claimed input tax deductions for certain overheads and operating costs, such as insurance, utilities, and local authority rates, based on the percentage that these services were used to make taxable supplies. When Rebecca sells the dwelling, she can elect to treat the sale as a supply that is not in the course or furtherance of her taxable activity (not subject to GST on sale). Example 6: Dwelling where deductions are claimed for taxable use Vincent is a registered person who acquired a dwelling for $920,000 from an unregistered person. Vincent intends to use 20 percent of the dwelling (a dedicated office) to make taxable supplies for his GST-registered consulting business. He therefore claims an input tax deduction of $24,000, which is 20 percent of the GST fraction of the purchase price. He later spends $23,000 (including GST) on substantial renovations (for example, building a new internal wall, replacing the electrical wiring, and upgrading to double-glazed windows) to improve the office, which he uses exclusively to make taxable supplies for his consulting business. Vincent claims a deduction for the $3,000 of input tax paid for the renovations. The dwelling would not meet the requirements of section 6(3)(e) because relevant deductions were taken for the goods under section 20(3). A deduction was claimed on acquisition, and deductions were also claimed for substantial improvements that became an integral part of the dwelling that is eventually sold. Because the dwelling is partly used to make taxable supplies, it will be a taxable supply when sold. Vincent can claim an additional deduction under section 21F for the non- taxable percentage use of the consideration he receives when he sells the dwelling. In this case, the office used to make taxable supplies comprised 20 percent of the use of the dwelling, so the non-taxable percentage use is 80 percent. If Vincent sold the dwelling for $1.15m, he would return the output tax of $150,000 but c ould claim an Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 14 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 adjustment under section 21F for an additional deduction of $120,000. The net GST he would return on the sale would therefore be $30,000. Example 7: Business use of a home garage Charlie has a GST-registered business hiring bicycles. Because she has run out of storage space in her retail shop, she begins to use her home garage to store some of her hire bikes. She does not claim input tax deductions for part of the acquisition cost of her house, even though it is now partly used (the garage) to make taxable supplies. Charlie claims input tax deductions for purchasing bike hooks and shelving that she attaches to her garage and uses to store the hire bikes and related equipment in her garage. These items do not form an integral part of her dwelling. Because Charlie has not claimed input tax deductions for any costs that became an integral part of her dwelling, and the dwelling was acquired and used for the principal purpose of a private residence, she can choose to treat the sale of the dwelling as not being made in the course or furtherance of her taxable activity (and therefore not subject to GST on the sale). Not acquired for principal purpose of making taxable supplies The goods cannot have been acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Principal purpose is intended to have the same meaning as when “p rincipal purpose” was previously used in the pre-2011 GST Act definition of “input tax”. Previous public guidance on the meaning of “ principal purpose” has defined this as being the main, primary or fundamental purpose and that it does not necessarily equate with a more than 50 percent test. Not used for principal purpose of making taxable supplies During the time the registered person owned the goods, they cannot have been used by the person for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. In other words, the primary use of the goods, from the time the person acquired them until their disposal, must be a non- taxable use, that is, a private or exempt use. In the case of dwellings, the private use will often be as an owner-occupied home. Some holiday houses may also have a principally private purpose if they are mainly used for their Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 15 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 owner’s private recreation. Other types of holiday houses may instead be primarily used to provide taxable supplies of short-stay accommodation to paying guests. A dwelling used for worker accommodation could have a principal purpose of providing an exempt supply of accommodation in a dwelling (if the dwelling is a principal place of residence for occupants who have quiet enjoyment of the dwelling). The goods will not satisfy the test in section 6(3)(e) if their principal purpose involves the registered person selling those types of goods as their taxable activity. For example, if a property developer builds or develops a house for sale, the sale of the house would remain a taxable supply. T rading stock that is sold by a business would also remain a taxable supply. Not acquired as a zero-rated supply, or the recipient has made an output tax adjustment for the nominal GST component Certain goods may have been acquired by a registered person as a zero-rated going concern under section 11(1)(m) or as a zero-rated supply of land under section 11(1)(mb). These goods will only satisfy section 6(3)(e) if the registered person has made an output tax adjustment equal to the nominal GST component and this adjustment has been made after 1 April 2023 and before the goods being sold or disposed of. For section 11(1)(m) to apply, the registered person who acquires the goods must acquire a taxable activity, or part of a taxable activity, that is a going concern at the time of supply and capable of continuing as a going concern. For section 11(1)(mb) to apply, the registered person must acquire land with the intention of using it to make taxable supplies. In most cases, when a GST-registered purchaser acquires land or business assets that qualify for zero-rating under section 11(1)(m) or (mb), they will be acquiring these goods for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. However, in other cases, the purchaser’s taxable use of the goods, while sufficient for the supply of the goods to qualify as a zero-rated supply under section 11(1)(m) or (mb), may be minor and secondary to their non-taxable (exempt or private) use of the goods. To accommodate these cases, the registered person can return an amount of output tax under section 20(3J)(a)(iv) equal to the full nominal GST amount as calculated by section 20(3J)(a)(i). If the registered person makes this output tax adjustment, the exclusion under section 6(3)(e) for goods acquired as zero-rated goods no longer applies. Although the person acquired the goods as a zero-rated supply, making the output tax adjustment puts them in the same position as a person who acquired standard-rated or secondhand goods and did not claim an input tax deduction on acquisition. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 16 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 Example 8: Acquiring a holiday home as a zero-rated supply of land Gavin is a registered person who acquires a holiday home from another registered person. Gavin’s principal purpose for acquiring the holiday home is to use it for his own private recreation (and not as his principal place of residence). However, because Gavin also intends to use the holiday home for a secondary and more minor purpose of making taxable supplies of guest accommodation, he acquires the holiday home as a zero-rated supply under section 11(1)(mb) for $1m (rather than a standard-rated supply of $1m plus $150,000 of GST, which would have been the price had section 11(1)(mb) not applied to the supply). If Gavin intends to use section 6(3)(e) to make his future disposal of the holiday home a non-taxable supply, he can choose to return output tax of $150,000, being the full amount of the nominal GST component, i n his next GST return after acquiring the holiday home. If he does this, section 6(3)(e) could then be satisfied to deem the future disposal of the holiday home as not being made in the course or furtherance of Gavin’s taxable activity. Gavin would therefore not be required to charge GST on that disposal. Alternatively, Gavin can choose to return the smaller amount of $105,000 output tax under section 20(3J) based on his 70 percent expected non-taxable use of the holiday home at the time he acquires the holiday home. However, if he does this, a future disposal of the holiday home would not satisfy section 6(3)(e) as he would not have returned the full amount of the nominal GST component on acquisition of the zero-rated supply of land. Electing to use section 6 (3)(e) The registered person elects to use section 6(3)(e) by taking a tax position of not charging GST at the time they sell (or otherwise dispose of) the qualifying goods and not accounting for a taxable supply of the goods in their next GST return. The registered person will not generally have to disclose to, or notify, the Commissioner that they have made the election to apply section 6(3)(e). Instead, they would simply not account for GST on the asset (by not claiming deductions for the secondary taxable use and not returning output tax on disposal). Note, however, there is a requirement for a registered person to notify the Commissioner if they intend to apply the transitional rule in section 91 for certain goods acquired before Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 17 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 1 April 2023. This transitional rule allows the registered person to make an output tax adjustment before 1 April 2025 for taxable use that was previously claimed and is explained below. Effective date of section 6(3)(e) Section 6(3)(e) generally has effect for taxable supplies made on or after 1 April 2011. This retrospective application date means that if a registered person has previously taken a tax position consistent with the requirements of section 6(3)(e), that tax position is now correct. This could include a person having treated their dwelling as not being part of their taxable activity even though it may have been partly used to make taxable supplies. However, in cases where an assessment has already been made for a taxable supply before 30 August 2022, that is, the registered person has returned output tax on goods they sold or disposed of before that date, the supply of those goods remains a taxable supply. For goods that a registered person sells or disposes of between 30 August 2022 and 1 April 2023 that would qualify as non-taxable supplies under section 6(3)(e), the registered person can amend their GST position to apply section 6(3)(e). In these cases, the person may have initially taken a GST position that treated the sale of the goods as a taxable supply and claimed a deduction for non-taxable use of the asset under section 21F at the time they sold the goods. If they subsequently wanted to apply section 6(3)(e), the fact that they initially may have claimed a deduction under section 21F for their percentage of non-taxable use at the time they sold the goods would not disqualify them from applying section 6(3)(e). This is because the condition in section 6(3)(e) only refers to deductions taken before selling the relevant goods. Their amended GST position would have to reverse out any deduction taken under section 21F as that section would no longer apply once the sale of the goods was changed to be a non-taxable supply under section 6(3)(e). The amendments to sections 6(3)(e)(iv) and 20(3J), allowing a registered person to make an output tax adjustment for the full nominal GST component of goods acquired as zero-rated land or a zero-rated going concern so that the acquisition is no longer treated as a zero- rated supply, have effect for taxable periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023. Transitional rule for certain goods acquired before 1 April 2023 Section 91 provides a transitional rule that allows a registered person to return an amount of output tax for certain goods acquired before 1 April 2023 that cannot qualify for the main rule in section 6(3)(e). The transitional rule applies for the 24-month period between 1 April 2023 and 1 April 2025. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 18 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 Section 91 applies when a registered person has acquired goods before 1 April 2023 and previously claimed a deduction under section 20(3) for the goods or acquired them as zero- rated supplies. Provided the relevant goods were not acquired or used for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, the registered person can elect to notify the Commissioner before 1 April 2025 and return a certain amount of output tax in their next GST return. The amount of output tax the registered person returns is equal to either the previous taxable use that was claimed for the goods (where deductions have been claimed under section 20(3)) or, in those cases where the goods were acquired as a zero-rated supply, the current taxable use percentage of the goods multiplied by the nominal GST component. If a registered person applies section 91 and returns the relevant output tax amount, a future disposal of the relevant goods is not a taxable supply. This is unless the registered person later chooses to claim a deduction under section 20(3) for any taxable use of the goods after applying section 91. Consequential amendments to sections 5(15) and 21(2) A consequential amendment to section 21(2) ensures that a registered person does not need to monitor their actual taxable use and make adjustments at the end of their adjustment period for any goods for which they apply the rules in section 6(3)(e) or 91. This reflects the fact that to apply these new rules the person treats the goods as though they had no taxable use of the goods. No adjustments are necessary when a person has no taxable use of their goods. The amendment to section 21(2) has effect for supplies made on or after 1 April 2011 other than supplies for which an assessment has been made before 30 August 2022. Consequential amendments are also made to section 5(15). Section 5(15) applies if a person makes a supply of real property (land) that includes a principal place of residence (such as the person’s home). It provides that the principal place of residence is treated as a separate (and usually non-taxable) supply to the supply of other parts of the real property, such as farmland or business premises, which may be a taxable supply. The amendments expand the scope of section 5(15) so it also applies to a supply of real property that includes goods the registered person has elected to treat as a non-taxable supply under section 6(3)(e) or 91. The non-taxable supply of these goods is treated as a separate supply to the supply of any other real property. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 19 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 The relevant goods will usually be a dwelling. For example, the person’s principal place of residence, a second house that is not any person’s main home, a holiday house or a dwelling used to provide temporary worker accommodation. Section 5(15)(c), relating to section 6(3)(e), has the same retrospective effective date as section 6(3)(e) itself. It has effect for supplies made on or after 1 April 2011 other than supplies for which an assessment has been made before 30 August 2022. Section 5(15)(d), relating to section 91, has the same effective date as section 91, that is, 1 April 2023. Example 9: Dwelling deemed to be separate supply to farmland Francis is a GST-registered farmer who owns a farm that includes a farmhouse. After some years, Francis buys a second farm and moves his principal place of residence to the newer and larger farmhouse on this new farm. He continues to operate both farms for several years. Francis eventually decides to sell his old, original farm. Throughout the time Francis owned the original farmhouse, its principal purpose was non-taxable private use, even though it was also partly used in his farming business and to provide taxable supplies of accommodation to paying guests or workers. Francis uses a property valuer to determine the value of the farmhouse and curtilage and then applies section 6(3)(e) so that the sale of the farmhouse and curtilage is a non-taxable supply that is a separate supply to the rest of the farmland. The sale of the rest of the farmland is a zero-rated supply as it is sold to another registered person who will use the farmland to make taxable supplies. Deeming the disposal of an asset to be a taxable supply Under the GST Act, supplies of goods or services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity are taxable supplies. This includes selling or otherwise disposing of assets used by the registered person in their taxable activity. A person’s taxable activity includes anything done in connection with the beginning or ending of that activity, including a premature ending. However, even with this broad definition, it may be unclear whether the disposal of an asset, such as land, is a taxable supply when the registered person is no longer using the asset to make taxable supplies, or Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 20 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 when they previously claimed they had a taxable use of the asset but did not in fact use the asset to make any taxable supplies. New sections 5(16) and 5(16C) clarify that the disposal of such goods and services are taxable supplies. An asset for which a registered person has previously claimed a taxable use Section 5(16) applies to goods and services that a person has previously claimed a taxable use for, even though the person is not using the goods or services in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity at the time the goods or services are disposed of. Section 5(16C) deems the disposal of these goods and services to be made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the person (a taxable supply). The disposal could be the sale of the relevant goods or services to another person, or it could be a deemed disposal under section 5(16C)(b) because the person ceases to be a registered person. In cases where a person ceases to be a registered person, section 10(7A) deems the relevant assets to be disposed of at market value immediately before the time the person ceases to be a registered person. This is the same valuation rule that applies when a registered person ceases to carry out a taxable activity and has a deemed disposal of all the goods and services that previously formed part of the assets of their taxable activity under section 5(3). The definition of “registered person” includes a person who is liable to register for GST. This means that the deeming rule in section 5(16C) also applies to a person who has previously deregistered from GST but becomes liable to register for GST because of the application of the section and the fact they are making taxable supplies of more than $60,000 in a 12- month period (including the consideration received for the section 5(16C) taxable supply). There are three ways a person may have previously claimed a taxable use for the relevant goods or services:  by claiming an input tax deduction for taxable use under section 20(3)  by acquiring the goods or services from another registered person as a zero-rated supply of land under section 11(1)(mb), or  by acquiring the goods or services as a zero-rated supply of a taxable activity (that is, a business) as a going concern under section 11(1)(m). The deeming rule will not apply in situations where the registered person has previously returned an amount of output tax on the goods or services equal to or greater than either Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 21 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 the deductions taken for the relevant goods or services under section 20(3) or the nominal GST component under section 20(3J) in the case of a supply that was acquired by them as a zero-rated supply of land or a going concern. The person could have previously returned this amount of output tax because of one or more of the following circumstances:  The person deregistered for GST and returned output tax on the market value of the asset (which was higher than the acquisition cost) under section 5(3).  Section 20(3J) applied, and the registered person’s percentage intended use for making taxable supplies was nil at the time they acquired the supply, which was initially treated as a zero-rated supply of land or a going concern. For example, at the time of supply the person initially planned to use the land to make taxable supplies, but once they acquired the land their plans changed, and they would only have private or exempt use of the land.  The wash-up rule in section 21FB was applied by a registered person who had total non- taxable use, and therefore they repaid an amount of output tax equal to their earlier deductions or nominal GST component for their earlier taxable use.  The registered person applied the transitional rule in section 91 for qualifying goods acquired before 1 April 2023 and notified the Commissioner and returned output tax equal to the previous deductions (or nominal GST component) claimed for their taxable use of the goods. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 22 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 Example 10: Output tax adjustment equal to previous deductions taken Scott is a registered person who acquired a dwelling for $1.15m in 2022 from an unregistered person. Scott intends to use 20 percent of the dwelling (a dedicated office) to make taxable supplies for his GST-registered consulting business. He claims an input tax deduction of $30,000, which is 20 percent of the tax fraction of the purchase price. During 2023, Scott finds he is no longer using his home office as he prefers to work from his client's offices and a co-working space he has started to lease. He makes an output tax adjustment of $30,000 at the end of his next adjustment period to reflect the fact he no longer uses his home office to make taxable supplies. Scott uses the wash-up rule in section 21FB to make this adjustment as he now has zero percent taxable use of his dwelling and expects this to remain the case for the foreseeable future. Alternatively, if Scott had still expected to continue to have some taxable use of his dwelling (such as using his home office to make taxable supplies on certain days of the week), and this was not the principal purpose of the dwelling, he could choose to apply the transitional rule in section 91 for goods acquired before 1 April 2023. To apply the transitional rule, he would need to make the $30,000 output tax adjustment before 1 April 2025 and notify the Commissioner that this output tax is because he intends to apply section 91. In 2026, Scott sells the dwelling and as he has already made output tax adjustments to return the full amount of input tax deduction he originally claimed ($30,000), section 5(16) will not apply. Instead, Scott can treat the sale as not being made in the course or furtherance of his taxable activity, either because it is no longer used in his taxable activity, or because he has applied the transitional rule in section 91. Section 5(19) of the GST Act is repealed as it has been superseded by the new section 5(16). Section 5(19) provided an election that a registered person could use before 1 August 1996 to pay output tax on a dwelling for which the person had previously claimed deductions under section 20(3) to ensure a future disposal of the dwelling would not be subject to the deeming rule in section 5(16). The new section 5(16) means that a disposal of such a dwelling will not be deemed to be a taxable supply, provided the registered person who applied the section 5(19) election has not claimed a subsequent deduction under section 20(3) for a taxable use of the dwelling since returning the output tax in 1996. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 23 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 Assets sold after a non-taxable wash-up is performed Section 21FB of the GST Act applies when a person changes their taxable use of an asset permanently to a new percentage use. If a person’s use becomes fully non-taxable, the asset may no longer be used in the course or furtherance of the person’s taxable activity and therefore its subsequent sale or disposal is not a taxable supply. This provides a potential opportunity for tax avoidance. For example, registered persons could try to minimise their output tax liability on assets, such as land, that are used to make taxable supplies but which they plan to sell soon. The output tax that needs to be returned under section 21FB on a change to non-taxable use is based on the full input tax deduction that could have been claimed for the GST charged on the asset at the time it was originally acquired. This means that for appreciating assets, such as land, the output tax liability from claiming a change of use and applying section 21FB may be significantly less than the output tax that would be charged at the time of disposal if the asset was sold as a taxable supply. To address this risk, section 5(16B) provides that the deeming rule in section 5(16C) also applies in circumstances where the Commissioner considers the registered person has increased their non-taxable use of the goods or services and then applied section 21FB in contemplation of the sale of the goods or services or of ceasing their taxable activity. If section 5(16B) applies, the disposal of the relevant asset is deemed by section 5(16C) to be made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the person (that is, it would be a taxable supply). The disposal could be the sale of the relevant goods or services or a deemed disposal under another deeming rule (such as section 5(3), which deems the disposal at market value of any assets held by a person who ceases to be a registered person). The amendments to sections 5(16), (16B) and (16C) have effect for goods and services supplied on or after 1 April 2023. Expanding the ability to use the wash-up rule for permanent change in use The wash-up calculation in section 21FB has been amended with effect for adjustment periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023. It can now be applied:  at the end of a registered person’s current adjustment period, and  for any new permanent percentage use. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 24 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 Under the previous section 21FB, which applied before 1 April 2023, the registered person had to have 100 percent taxable use or 100 percent non-taxable use of an asset for the remainder of their current adjustment period and all the following adjustment period (tax year). The wash-up rule in section 21FB can now be applied at the end of the adjustment period in which the permanent change in use occurred. This may be particularly relevant for persons who have acquired assets before registering for GST that they then begin using to make taxable supplies. Example 11: Adjustment for asset acquired before registering for GST In July 2023, Sam buys a small van for $23,000 (including GST of $3,000) to start a part-time business moving furniture a few days a week. His business grows and he registers for GST in November 2023. Since registering for GST, he uses the van exclusively for making taxable supplies in his furniture-moving business and expects this 100 percent taxable use to continue for the foreseeable future. Sam applies the wash-up calculation in section 21FB to claim an input tax adjustment for $3,000 at the end of his current adjustment period, which ends on 31 March 2024. He claims this adjustment in his GST return for the period ending 31 March 2024. The wash-up rule has also been amended to allow it to be used for any permanent change to a particular fixed percentage use. For example, if a registered person’s use of a particular good or service permanently changes to 50 percent taxable use and they expect this percentage to remain stable for the foreseeable future, they can now perform the wash-up calculation. Example 12: Permanent change in use Tōtara is a registered person that acquires an apartment building for $23m from an unregistered person. Tōtara will use 80 percent of the building to make exempt supplies of accommodation in a dwelling and lease the remaining 20 percent to Rimu under a commercial lease. Rimu is a registered person who uses these apartments to supply commercial accommodation of hotel units and serviced apartments. Tōtara claims a deduction for 20 percent of the $3m input tax on acquisition ($0.6m). Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 25 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 After 24 months, Tōtara negotiates a long-term commercial lease to supply 50 percent of the building to Rimu for making taxable supplies of commercial accommodation. This results in a permanent change to 50 percent of the apartment building being supplied by Tōtara for making taxable supplies for the foreseeable future. The new permanent percentage use is 50 percent and the actual use in the previous adjustment period was 20 percent, a difference of 30 percent additional taxable use. Under section 21FB, Tōtara can make an adjustment at the end of their adjustment period (on their next annual balance date) to deduct $0.9m, which is equal to 30 percent of the $3m input tax on acquisition. They would include this adjustment in their first GST return filed after the end of their adjustment period. After applying section 21FB, the registered person would not make any further adjustments in future adjustment periods unless their actual use changed from their new percentage taxable use of the goods or services. T his outcome is provided for by section 21(2)(ac) of the GST Act. Remedial amendments to the wash-up rule in section 21FB Assets that were zero-rated when they were acquired A remedial amendment has been made to the definition of “actual deduction” in section 21FB to ensure the formula in the previous section 21FB correctly accounts for land acquired as a zero-rated supply. The amendment clarifies that if a registered person changes their use of land to 100 percent non-taxable use, they will have an output tax adjustment equal to the nominal GST component that they previously benefited from by paying a reduced amount of consideration when they acquired a zero-rated supply of land. For example, they acquired the land for $1m plus zero GST instead of $1m plus $150,000 GST, so their nominal GST component is $150,000. The remedial amendment takes effect on 30 June 2014, which is the date the wash-up calculation in section 21FB was originally introduced. Remedial amendment to definition of “percentage actual use” A remedial amendment has been made to the definition of “percentage actual use” in section 21G to clarify that after the wash-up rule in section 21FB has been applied, the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 26 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 registered person should only measure their percentage actual use from the date the wash- up calculation was performed, rather than the date they acquired the asset. The amendment ensures the earlier adjustment taken under section 21FB is properly accounted for when the person makes a final adjustment either on disposal under section 21F or because they had to make a subsequent annual adjustment because their percentage use had changed since they applied the wash-up calculation. The remedial amendment takes effect on 30 June 2014, which is the date the wash-up calculation in section 21FB was originally introduced. Alternative apportionment methods The apportionment and adjustment rules allow registered persons to apply to the Commissioner to agree an alternative apportionment method. This is intended to reduce compliance costs, as an alternative apportionment method could produce similar GST outcomes to the default apportionment rules but with lower compliance costs. Previously, there was a requirement that the alternative apportionment method “have regard to the tenor” of the default apportionment rules and formula. The default apportionment and adjustment rules require a person to apportion deductions based on their intended taxable percentage use or actual use in the current adjustment period, even though their current use may be temporary and incidental to their ultimate use of the goods or services. This requirement prevented the Commissioner from agreeing to some methods that may simplify the apportionment and adjustments required but use a different approach to the default apportionment and adjustment rules. To accommodate a wider range of methods, the previous requirements in sections 20(3E), (3EB), 21(4) and (4B) that the alternative method “have regard to the tenor of” the default apportionment rules and formula have been removed. The new sections retain the more general requirement that the alternative method provides “a fair and reasonable method” of apportionment or calculating adjustments. Sections 20(EB)(b) and 21(4B)(b) allow an industry association to agree a method with the Commissioner on behalf of their members. Sections 20(EB)(c) and 21(4B)(c) allow the Commissioner to publish certain alternative apportionment methods considered acceptable to use by certain registered persons and the circumstances in which they can be used. Instead of developing and agreeing their own bespoke method with the Commissioner, registered persons could reduce their compliance costs by choosing to apply a published method if it applies to their circumstances. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 27 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 The amendments to allow the Commissioner to agree to, or publish, alternative apportionment methods take effect on 1 April 2023. Repealing the mixed-use asset rules in sections 20(3JB) and 20G The mixed-use asset rules in sections 20(3JB) and 20G add the complexity of another potential formula but have limited application. The rules only apply to certain assets, such as holiday homes, aircraft, and boats, and only when their use is a mixture of private days, taxable days and at least 62 unused days. In addition, many of the holiday homes that would otherwise become subject to these mixed-use asset rules could become excluded from a registered person’s taxable activity due to the operation of sections 6(3)(e) and 91 (discussed above), which allow registered persons to elect for mainly private or exempt assets to be treated as if they only had non-taxable use. The mixed-use asset rules in sections 20(3JB) and 20G will therefore be repealed from 1 April 2024. In cases where GST apportionment continues to apply to a registered person’s mixed- use assets, their GST input tax deductions and adjustments will instead be calculated using the same general GST apportionment rules that apply to other assets. These general rules will allow an apportionment percentage to be calculated based on days of taxable use. This is a similar method to the current formula in section 20G, but the calculation is less prescriptive, and it is not limited to the set of “mixed-use assets” described in section DG 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The repeal of sections 20(3JB) and 20G has effect from the registered person’s first adjustment period beginning on or after 1 April 2024. This means that if, on 31 March 2024, a registered person has begun an adjustment period for a mixed-use asset to which section 20G applies, they will continue to use section 20G until the end of that adjustment period. At their first adjustment period beginning on or after 1 April 2024, they will then begin to use the ordinary adjustment rules in sections 21 and 21A. Information disclosure for GST-registered persons purchasing land, ships, or aircraft they intend to use to make taxable supplies Section 61B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides the Commissioner with the ability to prescribe a new information disclosure to apply when a GST-registered person acquires land, a ship, or an aircraft with the intention of using it to make taxable supplies. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 28 of 29 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 “Land” is defined in section 2 of the GST Act 1985, “ship” has the meaning set out in section 2 of the Maritime Transport Act 1994, and ”aircraft” has the meaning set out in section 2 of the Civil Aviation Act 1990. The information disclosure will assist Inland Revenue to better monitor and promote compliance by registered persons who have previously claimed large input tax deductions (or acquired zero-rated land) but no longer appear to be proceeding with, or carrying on, a taxable activity (for example, they have been continuously filing GST returns with no or low sales). Section 61B(1) enables the Commissioner to prescribe and adjust the specific requirements to ensure the rules are practical and effective. It allows the Commissioner to set (and adjust) what information would be reported and the form and deadlines for the disclosure, including the start date for the first disclosure period. The information required to be disclosed could include the amount of consideration paid for the asset, the initial amount of GST input tax deducted on purchase (or the nominal GST amount that would otherwise have been charged if the asset was purchased from another registered person as a zero-rated supply of land or a going concern), and a statement of how the asset will be used to make taxable supplies. Section 61B(2) allows the Commissioner to exempt certain types of registered persons from being required to disclose the information if they are considered by the Commissioner to represent a low risk of using the relevant asset for a private or exempt use. For example, the exemption could be designed to define certain categories of registered persons who have a well-established business of making taxable supplies of land development, commercial leasing, or dealing in aircraft or pleasure craft, whether by themselves or through associated persons. Before implementing an information disclosure requirement, Inland Revenue will work with GST practitioners and software developers to test the proposed design (including the specific information that would be disclosed, the timing and format of the disclosure and which groups or assets should be exempt as they represent a low risk) to ensure it is well-targeted and practical. Because of the further design and testing required and the need to provide sufficient time for affected businesses and accounting software providers to update their systems, it is expected that the earliest possible implementation date to apply the new disclosure rules will be for land, pleasure craft or aircraft acquired on or after 1 April 2024.

It sets 31 March 2023 as the revised final date for filing an approval application or supplementary return required under sections 33E, 68CB, and 68CC of the Tax Administration Act 1994, in relation to applying for and claiming the Research and Development Tax Incentive, if an existing deadline falls between 26 January 2023 and 7 March 2023. Background Between 26 January 2023 and 3 February 2023, a series of fronts crossed the upper North Island delivering extremely heavy rain, high winds, and widespread flooding. Then, from 12 February 2023 to 16 February 2023, Cyclone Gabrielle moved across the North Island, also resulting in heavy rain, high winds, and flooding. These weather events have impacted the ability of some businesses enrolled in the Research and Development Tax Incentive (RDTI) to be able to file on time. Filing may be for either an approval (a general approval, a criteria and methodologies approval, or a variation of those approvals) or for a supplementary return. Both an approval application and a supplementary return must be filed in time to claim R&D tax credits for the year. The due dates for these filings vary depending on factors like the taxpayer’s balance date and whether they have an extension of time for filing their income tax return. Inland Revenue has no operational discretion it can apply in response to the weather events to accept late RDTI filings. Key features The Order provides relief from the weather events by allowing taxpayers more time to make an RDTI filing. Specifically, taxpayers with an RDTI filing deadline that falls between 26 January 2023 and 7 March 2023, and is required under sections 33E, 68CB, and 68CC of the Tax Administration Act 1994, are allowed an extension of that deadline until 31 March 2023. The extension applies to taxpayers whose ability to meet the filing deadline is significantly adversely affected by the weather events. Due dates that may potentially be affected include:  31 January 2023, for criteria and methodologies approval applications for July 2023 balance dates;  7 February 2023, for: Page 4 of 5 Special report SL2023/0011 | 7 March 2023 - general approval variation requests for 2023 supporting activities for December 2021 balance dates; - general approval applications for September 2022 balance dates; - general approval applications and variation requests for December 2022 balance dates; - criteria and methodologies approval variation requests for December 2022 balance dates;  14 February 2023, for supplementary returns for September 2022 balance dates for taxpayers with no extension of time for their income tax return;  28 February 2023, for criterial and methodologies approval applications for August 2023 balance dates;  7 March 2023, for: - general approval variation requests for 2023 supporting activities for January 2022 balance dates; - general approval applications and variations requests for January 2023 balance dates; - criteria and methodologies approval variation requests for January 2023 balance dates. The Order is made under section 226 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. That section allows for extensions of time to be granted by Order in Council to meet requirements under some of the Inland Revenue Acts, even if the deadline has already expired. Effective date The Order came into force on 20 February 2023.

Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 1 of 45 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 NEW LEGISLATION > ACT > SPECIAL REPORT Rollover relief – bright-line test and interest limitation Issued: 22 May 2023 Public Act 2023 No 5 This special report provides early information on amendments i ncluded in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 to rollover relief for the bright-line test and interest limitation rules, ahead of an upcoming edition of the Tax Information Bulletin. This special report is organised into two parts. Part One (pages 5 to 22) is best suited for readers already familiar with the rollover relief rules. It provides a brief overview and detailed analysis of the most recent amendments to help readers identify what has changed. Part Two (pages 23 to 45) provides in-depth guidance on the consolidated amendments from the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Act 2022 that first introduced the new rollover relief rules, and the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023, specifically in the context of rollover relief for the bright-line test. This provides a comprehensive view of the new rollover relief provisions as they apply for the purposes of the bright-line test at the date of this publication.

Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 PART ONE Changes enacted in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 6 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 Rollover relief – bright-line test and interest limitation Sections CB 6A(1AB)(b), CB 6AB, CB 6AC, CZ 39(1B) and FC 9(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 Various remedial amendments have been made to the new rules providing rollover relief for the bright-line test and the interest limitation rules to ensure that the relief works as intended. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Background Rollover relief under the bright-line test ensures certain transfers of residential land are not taxed at the time of the transfer. Instead, the recipient takes on the original owner’s acquisition cost and date. When the recipient disposes of the residential land, this cost and acquisition date determines whether the disposal is taxed under the bright-line test and the amount of the gain that is taxable. In the context of interest limitation, interest deductions for residential property are being gradually phased out between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025 for loans drawn down for residential property before 27 March 2021. For residential property loans drawn down on or after 27 March 2021, interest deductions have generally been denied since 1 October 2021 except in simple refinancing scenarios. Rollover relief ensures certain restructures of the property’s legal ownership and the accompanying loan do not exclude someone from this phasing-out period and instead place them into full interest denial before 31 March 2025 for loan amounts first drawn down before 27 March 2021. Bright-line test The bright-line test, as introduced in 2015, included limited relief for certain transfers: relationship property, inherited land, and company amalgamations. The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Act 2022 introduced additional rollover relief rules for certain legal transfers of residential land when there is no underlying change in economic ownership. The changes extended coverage of rollover relief to the following legal structures from 1 April 2022, provided certain conditions are met:  family trusts: standard trusts and Māori authority trusts  look-through companies Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 7 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023  partnerships  te Tiriti o Waitangi – the Treaty of Waitangi settlements  transfers within wholly-owned groups of companies. The extent of relief under the bright-line test for these new categories generally depends on the amount of consideration paid for the transfer:  If the transfer occurs at or below the original owner’s acquisition cost (that is, the person has not realised a gain), no tax consequences arise for the original owner if the transfer is made within the relevant bright-line period. The recipient then takes on the original owner’s bright-line start date and cost base.  If the transfer occurs for more than the original owner’s cost (that is, they have realised a profit), then that gain is taxed if the transfer is made within the relevant bright-line period. A rule that deems bright-line disposals to be made at market value is switched off to ensure any “paper profit” is not taxed. The recipient then takes on the original owner’s bright-line start date, but with an updated cost base of the amount for the transfer. Interest limitation Rollover relief for interest limitation purposes is provided in the same situations as the bright-line test but with no requirement regarding consideration. The new interest limitation rules in subpart DH of the Income Tax Act 2007 deny deductions for interest incurred on loans on or after 1 October 2021 where those loans are drawn down on or after 27 March 2021 for “disallowed residential property” (DRP). Loans drawn down before 27 March 2021 are “grandparented transitional loans”, meaning interest deductions are progressively denied over the period from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2025 as “grandparented residential interest”. In limited circumstances, rollover relief is provided so loans drawn down on or after 27 March 2021 also qualify as grandparented transitional loans. If certain conditions are met, section DH 5(5)(d) provides that New Zealand dollar denominated loan amounts (ignoring re-drawings or additional borrowings on or after 27 March 2021) are grandparented transitional loans to the extent the loans are for DRP for which a previous owner (the original owner) also had a loan. The loan amounts must be equal to or less than the amount of the original owner’s loan at the time the original owner transferred the property. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 8 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 Key features Redrafting of rollover trust provisions Several of the rollover relief provisions applying to transfers to or from family trusts have been substantially redrafted to clarify their application. As part of this redrafting, the following remedial changes have been made:  Amendments to sections CB 6AB(2) and (3), and CB 6AC(2) and (3) ensure rollover relief applies to a transfer of residential land or DRP out of a family trust, either back to the principal settlor or the group of settlors that originally transferred the land to the trust (provided that, for a group, at least one of the settlors is a principal settlor), even if the settlor (or settlors) is not an “original settlor” (as was required by the originally enacted provisions).  Rollover relief now applies to a transfer of residential land or DRP out of a family trust to a principal settlor, even if the settlor did not originally transfer the residential property in question to the trust.  Amendments to sections CB 6AB(2), (3) and (4), and CB 6AC(2), (3) and (4) clarify the wording and intention of the rollover relief provisions for transfers involving multiple legal structures or between different legal capacities.  New sections CB 6AB(1)(b) and CB 6AC(1)(b) provide that rollover relief applies when residential land or DRP held in a qualifying family trust is resettled onto another family trust, provided certain conditions are met.  The definition of “close family beneficiary” in section CB 6AB(6) has been amended to include: o a trustee of another trust if at least one beneficiary of the other trust is a close family associate of a beneficiary of the relevant trust o a wider class of charitable or non-profit beneficiaries beyond registered charities, so that discretionary trusts that have in their trust deeds the standard clause defining a broad class of charitable/non-profit beneficiaries may qualify as “rollover” trusts o a company in which a 50 percent or more voting interest (or a 50 percent or more market value interest if a market value circumstance exists) is owned by a beneficiary that is a principal settlor of the trust, and the trustee of another Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 9 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 trust if at least one beneficiary of the other trust is a close family associate of a beneficiary of the first trust.  An amendment to section CB 6AC(5) ensures rollover relief is available for certain transfers to or from qualifying family trusts that are Māori authorities, or eligible to be Māori authorities, regardless of how they are eligible to be Māori authorities. Other remedial changes Amendments also clarify that when any of the rollover relief provisions applies to a transfer of residential land, the recipient of the land is subject to the same bright-line test settings as the transferor was. This includes having the same bright-line test length as the transferor had, being five or ten years, or not being subject to the bright-line test at all if the transferor first acquired the land before 29 March 2018 (see new sections CB 6A(1AB)(b) and CZ 39(1B)). Along similar lines, new section FC 9(4) provides that when inherited land is transferred to a “rollover person”, the transferor’s exemption for inherited land is rolled over to the person so that a subsequent disposal by them is also exempt from the bright-line test. Application date The amendments came into force on 27 March 2021, except for the new section CB 6AB(2)(c) and (6)(c) which came into force on 1 April 2023. Detailed analysis Transfers to settlors (sections CB 6AB(2) and CB 6AC(2)) Rollover relief is available under either section CB 6AB(2) or CB 6AC(2) for a transfer of residential land or DRP from a qualifying family trust to the settlors of the trust, provided certain conditions are met. Rollover relief may apply if the property was originally transferred to the trust by those settlors or if the settlors had not transferred the property to the trust. Different conditions apply in these two cases to determine whether rollover relief applies. Previously, a settlor receiving residential land or DRP from their family trust had to be an “original settlor”, meaning they made the original settlement of property on the trust (being any property, not necessarily land or even the specific land now being transferred from the trust to the settlor). Consequently, rollover relief was arguably not available if the land was transferred to a person who became a settlor of the trust after the trust was originally settled. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 10 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 This was the case even if the settlor was in fact the original owner of the land and had become a principal settlor at, or by, the time they transferred the land to the trustee. Sections CB 6AB(2) and (3) and CB 6AC(2) and (3) have been redrafted to clarify that rollover relief does apply in these situations. Note former sections CB 6AB(1) and CB 6AC(1) have also been redrafted as new sections CB 6AB(1)(a) and CB 6AC(1)(a), respectively. This is not intended as a policy change, but rather a streamlining of the provisions in the style of new sections CB 6AB(2) and CB 6AC(2) which has also removed a number of minor inconsistencies that were in the provisions as originally enacted. 1 Removal of “original settlor” requirement New section CB 6AB(2)(a) and (b) provides that the bright-line start date for land (referred to as the “bright-line acquisition date” in the legislation) when a person (the transferee) disposes of the land is the bright-line start date of the trustee (being the previous owner), provided the following conditions are met:  the trustee transfers the land to the transferee(s) on or after 1 April 2022  the transferee (along with all other transferees if there is more than one) is a settlor of the trust and had originally transferred the land to the trustee  if there is more than one transferee, the transferees acquire proportionally the same amount of land they originally transferred to the trustee, and  at the time the trustee transfers the land to the transferee(s): o all transferees are beneficiaries of the trust o at least one transferee is a principal settlor, and o the trust is a “rollover trust”. 1 The only substantive change to sections CB 6AB(1) and CB 6AC(1) is the addition of a new paragraph (b) to each of these sections, which provides rollover relief for resettlements of family trusts in certain circumstances. Previously, rollover relief for trust resettlements was not explicitly provided for in the legislation, although the intention was always that rollover relief should apply in such situations provided the usual conditions relating to the principal settlors and beneficiaries were met for both trusts. This is discussed in more detail below at ‘Resettlements of family trusts’. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 11 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 The definition of “rollover trust” in section CB 6AB(5) has been amended so it no longer refers to the former “original settlor” requirement. The amended definition provides that “rollover trust” means, at the time of a relevant transfer to or from the trust:  all principal settlors are beneficiaries of the trust  all principal settlors are close family associates, 2 and  all beneficiaries are close family beneficiaries. 3 The amendments ensure rollover relief applies under section CB 6AB in the situation where a settlor receives land back from a qualifying family trust that the settlor previously sold the land to or settled the land on – including circumstances where the transferee is not the “original settlor” of the trust. 2 Two people are “close family associates” under section CB 6AB(7) if they are within four degrees of blood relationship, or are married, in a civil union or de facto relationship, or one person is within four degrees of blood relationship to the other person’s spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner. 3 “Close family beneficiary” is defined in section CB 6AB(6) to mean, for the relevant trust, a beneficiary that is one or more of the following: a principal settlor; a trustee of another trust and at least one beneficiary of the other trust is a close family associate of a beneficiary of the relevant trust; a close family associate of another beneficiary who is also a principal settlor; a company in which a 50 percent or more voting interest, or a 50 percent or more market value interest if a market value circumstance exists, is owned by a beneficiary who is a principal settlor or a close family associate of another beneficiary who is a principal settlor; a charity registered under the Charities Act 2005; or any association, club, institution, society, organisation or trust not carried on for the private profit of any person whose funds are applied wholly or principally to any civic, community, charitable , philanthropic, religious, benevolent or cultural purpose, whether in New Zealand or elsewhere – provided that if the family trust only has one principal settlor, there is at least one other natural person beneficiary who is a close family associate of the principal settlor. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 12 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 Example 1: Sale to family trust by non-original settlor In 2005, Martha settles a new family trust, with herself, her husband Bill and their children, Jack and Sean, as the beneficiaries of the trust. In 2007, Jack makes substantial settlements on the trust such that he becomes the principal settlor. In 2009, Jack acquires an investment property for $250,000. In May 2019, Jack sells the investment property to the trust for $600,000. In November 2022, the trust sells the property back to Jack for $600,000, even though the market value of the property is now over $1 million. At the time of the sale, Jack is still the principal settlor of the trust. As the amount paid by Jack for the property is equal to the amount the trustee originally paid for the property, full rollover relief would apply to the transfer under the proposed amendments. This means the trust would not be subject to tax under the bright-line test on the transfer of the property to Jack in November 2022. This is because the trustee would be treated as disposing of the land at cost, meaning their net income arising under the bright-line test is zero. Jack would be deemed to have a bright-line start date of May 2019 for the land (being the trustee’s bright-line start date for the land) and a cost base of $600,000. New section CB 6AC(2) similarly provides that the bright-line start date for land when a person (the transferee) disposes of it is the bright-line start date of the Māori trustee (being the previous owner), provided certain conditions are met. Like the amendments to section CB 6AB, references to “original settlor” have been removed from section CB 6AC(2) and its surrounding subsections, including the definition of “Māori rollover trust” in subsection (4). Rollover relief applies under section CB 6AC(2) if:  the Māori trustee transfers the land to the transferee(s) on or after 1 April 2022  the transferee (along with all other transferees if there is more than one) is a settlor of the trust and had originally transferred the land to the Māori trustee  if there is more than one transferee, the transferees are all settlors of the trust and acquire proportionally the same amount of land they originally transferred to the Māori trustee, and Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 13 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023  at the time that the trustee transfers the land to the transferee(s): o all transferees are beneficiaries of the trust o the trust is a “Māori rollover trust”. As mentioned above, the definition of “Māori rollover trust” in section CB 6AC(4) has been amended. “Māori rollover trust” now means, at the time of a relevant transfer:  all beneficiaries of the trust are either members of the same iwi or hapū, or descendants of the same tīpuna (living or dead), and  the land being transferred is subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993. Provided the above conditions are met, rollover relief applies if the trustee is a Māori authority or eligible to be one (see the definition of “Māori trustee” in section CB 6AC(5)). Principal settlor not original owner of land New section CB 6AB(2)(c) provides another route for rollover relief to apply when residential land or DRP is transferred from a rollover trust to a settlor. Rollover relief applies under the section when the land is transferred to a settlor or group of settlors, provided all settlors receiving the land are principal settlors at both the time the land is acquired by the trustee and the time the trustee transfers the land to the settlor(s). Rollover relief does not apply to transfers to settlors who are not principal settlors of the trust either at the time the land was acquired by the trustee or the time the trustee transfers the land. This timing requirement ensures a beneficiary of the trust cannot become a principal settlor immediately before the transfer to them just so they receive the land without bright-line test tax implications. It also ensures that rollover relief does not apply to a transfer to someone who is no longer a principal settlor of the trust. Rollover relief also does not apply under this provision if the transferees had previously transferred the land to the trustee. This is because section CB 6AB(2)(a) and (b) already provides for transferees who had previously owned the land before transferring it to the trustee. Paragraph (c) is relatively limited provision, as it only applies in the specific scenario where the transferee had not originally owned the land. It should be noted the new section CB 6AB(2)(c) was inserted with effect on 1 April 2023, the day after the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 received the Royal assent. This means that, unlike the other amendments to sections CB 6AB and CB 6AC, it does not apply retrospectively to transfers occurring on or Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 14 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 after 1 April 2022. Instead, section CB 6AB(2)(c) only has effect for transfers occurring on or after 1 April 2023. Example 2: Transfer from family trust to principal settlor who made cash settlement on trust In August 2019, Melville decides to settle a family trust with himself, his father, Dean, and his sister, Rosie, as the beneficiaries of the trust. The only property settled on the trust at that time is $900,000 in cash contributed by Melville, making Melville the principal settlor of the trust (being the settlor whose settlements for the trust are greatest or greatest equal). Shortly afterward, in September 2019, the trustee purchases a residential property for $850,000. Rosie makes a cash settlement on the trust of $700,000 in December 2019. In May 2023, the trustee transfers the property to Melville for its cost of $850,000, even though at that time it is worth $1.2 million. At the time of the transfer, Melville is still a principal settlor of the trust. As the amount paid by Melville for the property is equal to the amount the trustee originally paid for the property, full rollover relief would apply to the transfer under the proposed amendments. This means the trust would not be subject to tax under the bright-line test on the transfer of the property to Melville in May 2023. This is because the trustee would be treated as disposing of the land at cost, meaning their net income arising under the bright-line test is zero. Melville would be deemed to have a bright-line start date of September 2019 for the land (being the trustee’s bright-line start date for the land) and a cost base of $850,000. If the property had instead been transferred by the trustee to Rosie, that transfer would not have qualified for rollover relief. This is because Rosie is not a principal settlor. Even if Rosie had become a principal settlor in December 2019 by making a larger settlement on the trust (equal or greater in value to Melville’s), a transfer of the property to her would still not qualify for rollover relief as she was not a principal settlor at the time the land was acquired by the trustee. Transfers to self but in a different capacity and transfers involving multiple legal structures (sections CB 6AB(3) and (4), CB 6AC(3) and (4)) Section CB 6AB provides rollover relief for transfers of residential land or DRP to trusts, partnerships and look- through companies (LTCs), as well as transfers out of these structures to the land’s original owner. For example, rollover relief is provided for the transfer of land held on a rollover trust to a person who is both a principal settlor and beneficiary of the trust. Rollover relief is also provided under section CB 6AB(4) if that person then decides to Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 15 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 transfer the land to an LTC of which they are the sole shareholder. For efficiency, it makes sense to provide rollover relief where the same result is achieved in one transaction, rather than two (for example, where land is transferred directly from a rollover trust to an LTC owned by the principal settlor of the trust). The former version of section CB 6AB(3) provided rollover relief for such composite transfers, as did former section CB 6AC(3) for composite transfers involving family trusts that were Māori authorities or were eligible to be Māori authorities. Rollover relief applied where the original owner received the land from the legal structure but in a different capacity to the one in which they became “original settlor”. The sections also contained the proportionality requirement 4 that applies when land is transferred from a rollover trust back to a settlor who had originally transferred the land to the trust (now contained in new sections CB 6AB(2)(b) and CB 6AC(2)(b)). Former section CB 6AB(4) provided rollover relief if a person transferred residential land or DRP to themselves in a different capacity (such as from their “personal” capacity to their capacity as a shareholder in an LTC or a partner in a partnership, or vice versa) and there was “no intervening transfer to a third party”. The following amendments have been made to clarify the effect and intention of these provisions:  Sections CB 6AB(2) and (3) and CB 6AC(2) and (3) have been redrafted so the proportionality and capacity rules are now in separate subsections, rather than being combined into a single subsection as they were previously. As mentioned above, the proportionality rule is now in sections CB 6AB(2)(b) and CB 6AC(2)(b), while the capacity rule remains in sections CB 6AB(3) and CB 6AC(3), albeit in a revised form. The references to a person having a capacity “other than settlor or original settlor” have been removed with an added clarification that, for the purposes of applying subsections (1)(a) and (2), the transferors or transferees (as applicable) may have different capacities in relation to the different criteria in those subsections. For example, a transferee may be a settlor of the trust in their personal capacity and be a beneficiary as an LTC owner, or they may have transferred the land to the trust in their personal capacity and acquire it back from the trust as a partner in a partnership. The changes to subsection (3) mean that, in such situations, the relevant criteria in subsection (1)(a) or (2) (whichever applies) are satisfied – therefore, rollover 4 Basically, the rule is that when land is transferred from a family trust back to a group of settlors who originally transferred the land to the trust, the settlors should acquire proportionally the same amount of land they each held before it was transferred to the trust. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 16 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 relief applies if all other relevant conditions set out in section CB 6AB or CB 6AC are also met.  The requirement in section CB 6AB(4) that the transfer “must not be to or from a person in their capacity of settlor, beneficiary or trustee” has been removed. This wording was originally inserted with the aim of making it clear that either section CB 6AB(3) or CB 6AC(3) is the relevant provision that applies when land is transferred from a trustee of a family trust to the principal settlor’s (or principal settlors’) LTC or partnership (or to the LTC owners or partners in the instance when it was the LTC or the partnership that originally transferred the land to the family trust), but the chosen wording could have been clearer. The reference to there being “no intervening transfer to a third party” has also been removed as it appears it was redundant. Resettlements of family trusts (sections CB 6AB(1)(b) and CB 6AC(1)(b)) New sections CB 6AB(1)(b) and CB 6AC(1)(b) provide rollover relief when residential land or DRP held on a rollover trust is resettled onto another, related, rollover trust. If certain conditions are met, new section CB 6AB(1)(b) provides that a person holding land as trustee of the resettled trust (trust A), where the land was transferred to them from another related rollover trust (trust B), has the same bright-line start date for the land that the trustee of trust B had. This treatment applies if:  trust A and trust B are both rollover trusts, and  for trust A: o all the beneficiaries are the same as for trust B, or o all the natural person beneficiaries are either the same as, or close family associates of a principal settlor of, trust B. In other words, rollover relief is only available if both trusts meet all the usual requirements for rollover relief in section CB 6AB(5). To qualify for rollover relief, each natural person beneficiary of trust A must be a close family beneficiary. In the case of multiple principal settlors, each principal settlor must be a close family associate of the other principal settlors. At a minimum, each natural person beneficiary of trust A must be either a principal settlor, or a close family associate of a principal settlor, of trust B. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 17 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 Trust A may not necessarily have the same beneficiaries as trust B. However, provided the above conditions are met, this would not preclude the resettlement from qualifying for rollover relief. For example, if an additional generation were added to trust A’s beneficiaries, rollover relief would still be available if the close family beneficiary requirements were satisfied. Rollover relief also applies even if the principal settlor of trust B is deceased. Example 3: Resettlement of family trust Wayne is the principal settlor and a beneficiary of his family trust, which meets the definition of a “rollover trust” in proposed new section CB 6AB(5). In April 2021, the trustee of the trust resettles the trust property, which includes residential land on a new family trust. The beneficiaries of the new family trust include Wayne’s relatives within four degrees of blood relationship and their spouses, as well as a couple of registered charities. Aside from Wayne, the new trust has one other principal settlor, Wayne’s wife, Karen, who is also a beneficiary of the trust. All principal settlors of the new trust (including Wayne) are close family associates, and all beneficiaries are close family beneficiaries, meaning the new trust is a rollover trust. As the transfer to the new trust at nil consideration is for less than the cost of the land to the trustee of the first trust, rollover relief applies to the transfer of the residential land from the first trust to the new trust. This means the trustee of the first trust is treated as disposing of the land at cost so their net income arising under the bright-line test is zero. The trustees of the new trust are deemed to have the same bright-line start date and cost base for the land as the trustee of the first trust. New section CB 6AC(1)(b) similarly provides rollover relief for resettlements of Māori rollover trusts. The definition of “Māori rollover trust” in section CB 6AC(4) has been amended so that it means, at the time of a relevant transfer:  all beneficiaries of the trust are either members of the same iwi or hapū, or descendants of the same tīpuna (living or dead), and  the land is subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993. Provided the first trust (trust B) and resettled trust (trust A) have the same beneficiaries and are both Māori rollover trusts, rollover relief applies under section CB 6AC(1)(b) if, for each of the trusts, the trustee is a Māori authority or is eligible to be one (see the definition of “Māori Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 18 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 trustee” in section CB 6AC(5)). As with the rule for general family trusts above, this includes the situation where one of the settlors of the first trust is deceased. Definition of “close family beneficiary” (section CB 6AB(6)) Amendments have been made to the definition of “close family beneficiary” in section CB 6AB(6) as follows:  A new paragraph (ab) has been added to include a trustee of another trust if at least one beneficiary of the other trust is a close family associate of a beneficiary of the relevant trust. The words “or trustees of another trust and at least one beneficiary of the other trust is a close family beneficiary of the relevant trust” that were in paragraph (d) of the definition of “close family associate” in section CB 6AB(5) have been deleted.  A new paragraph (ac) has also been added so the definition of “close family beneficiary” includes any association, club, institution, society, organisation or trust not carried on for the private profit of any person whose funds are applied wholly or principally to any civic, community, charitable, philanthropic, religious, benevolent, or cultural purpose, whether in New Zealand or elsewhere. This expands the scope of permissible beneficiaries to include charities beyond those registered under the Charities Act 2005, so that discretionary trusts that have in their trust deeds the standard clause defining a broad class of charitable/non- profit beneficiaries may qualify as rollover trusts. Equally, it also permits non- discretionary family trusts to include non-registered charities as beneficiaries and qualify as rollover trusts. However, there is an additional condition that applies if the trust (discretionary or otherwise) has just one principal settlor. In this case, a charitable or non-profit beneficiary of the type described in paragraph (ac) qualifies as a close family beneficiary only if the trust has at least one natural person beneficiary who is a close family associate of the principal settlor. This is intended to ensure the trust is a genuine family trust.  The scope of paragraph (c) has been expanded to include a company in which a 50 percent or more voting interest – or a 50 percent or more market value interest, if a market value circumstance exists – is owned by a beneficiary that is a principal settlor (see new subparagraph (i)). Previously, only a company in which a 50 percent or more voting interest (or market value interest) was owned by a beneficiary that was a close family associate of a principal settlor (now contained in subparagraph (ii)) was included in the definition. It should be noted the amendment to paragraph (c) came into force on 1 April 2023 (this contrasts with the other two Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 19 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 amendments to the “close family beneficiary definition” described above, which both took effect on 27 March 2021). Māori family trusts rollover relief (section CB 6AC(5)) Rollover relief is provided for transfers of residential land or DRP subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 in certain situations. Rollover relief applies under section CB 6AC when land is transferred to or from a trust that is either a Māori authority or eligible to be a Māori authority, and where all beneficiaries are members of the same iwi or hapū or are descendants of the same tīpuna (living or dead). This is intended to mirror the rollover relief rules for general family trusts while recognising that Māori family trusts may be structured differently. The policy intent is that rollover relief should be available regardless of the reason why the trustee is a Māori authority or eligible to be one. However, the provision was previously restricted to just those situations where the trustee was (or was eligible to be) a Māori authority because it received and managed assets on behalf of claimants where those assets were transferred by the Crown as part of the settlement of a claim under te Tiriti o Waitangi – the Treaty of Waitangi. This was because the definition of “Māori trustee” in section CB 6AC(5) formerly referred to a trustee of a trust that is either a Māori authority, or eligible to elect to be a Māori authority, under section HF 2(3)(e)(i). 5 However, this restriction was not necessary because another section already provided rollover relief for Treaty of Waitangi settlements. The erroneous cross-reference to section HF 2(3)(e)(i) in section CB 6AC(5) has been deleted so the Māori trustee definition includes any trust that is eligible to elect to be a Māori authority. Other bright-line remedial amendments Relevant bright-line period (sections CB 6A(1AB)(b) and CZ 39(1B)) When a transfer of residential land is eligible for rollover relief, the intent is the bright-line period does not reset. This includes both the start date of the bright-line period (that is, when the “clock” runs from) and which bright-line test applies (for example, the five-year or ten-year test). The start date of the bright-line period is generally determined by the date the legal title was transferred (referred to as the “bright-line acquisition date” in the legislation), 5 Section HF 2(3) sets out the circumstances in which the trustees of a trust are eligible to make an election to become a Māori authority. Paragraph (e)(i) of that section applies to the trustees of a trust who, on behalf of Māori claimants, receive and manage assets that are transferred by the Crown as part of the settlement of a claim under te Tiriti o Waitangi. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 20 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 whereas which bright-line test applies is determined by the date of acquisition (generally when a person enters into the agreement to purchase a property). Previously, the legislation produced the unintended effect that, when rollover relief applied, the recipient only took on the original owner’s bright-line start date and not the underlying acquisition date. 6 This meant that, while the start date did not reset, the recipient became subject to a ten-year bright-line period if the transfer was made on or after 27 March 2021. For example, a property acquired in 2016 would have been subject to the two-year test and could have been disposed of without tax under the bright-line test from 2018 onwards. However, if a transfer eligible for rollover relief occurred in 2022, in the absence of a remedial amendment the recipient would have become subject to the ten-year bright-line test (with a 2016 start date) and would need to retain the property until 2026 to be able to dispose of the property without it being taxed under the bright-line test. This is not the policy intention, and so new sections CB 6A(1AB)(b) and CZ 39(1B) have been inserted to ensure a transferee in this situation also takes on the appropriate bright-line test length and other settings – including where no bright-line test applies because the land was originally acquired before 1 October 2015. New section CB 6A(1AB)(b) provides that the ten-year bright-line test (section CB 6A) does not apply to a person’s disposal of residential land if the land meets the requirements of one of sections CB 6AB, CB 6AC, CB 6AE or FB 3A and the transferor first acquired an estate or interest in the land before 27 March 2021. New section CZ 39(1B) similarly provides that the five-year bright-line test (preserved in section CZ 39 for land first acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and before 27 March 2021) does not apply to a person’s disposal of residential land if the land meets the requirements of sections CB 6AB, CB 6AC, CB 6AE or FB 3A and the transferor first acquired an estate or interest in the land before 29 March 2018. 6 See sections CB 6AB(1), (2), (4), CB 6AC(1), (2), CB 6AE(1) and FB 3A(3). Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 21 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 Example 4: Land purchased before 27 March 2021 and sold to owners’ LTC after 27 March 2021 Sanjay and his wife, Marie, purchase residential land in their own names for $670,000 on 6 May 2018, each of them holding a 50 percent share of the land. On 17 July 2023, they sell the land to a look-through company, A Co, that they jointly own 50:50, for $950,000. The market value of the land at that time is $1.12 million. Sanjay and Marie are subject to the five-year bright-line test for the land, but because they held the land for five years before selling it to A Co, there is no tax liability under the bright-line test. Partial relief applies to the sale to A Co, meaning A Co takes on Sanjay and Marie’s bright-line start date of 6 May 2018 but not their acquisition cost of $670,000. A Co’s cost base would instead be the amount of consideration it provided, being $950,000. A Co would also be subject to the five-year bright-line test for the land, being the bright-line test period Sanjay and Marie were subject to. Inherited property transferred to rollover person (section FC 9(4)) The rollover relief provisions previously did not work as intended when inherited residential land was transferred by the beneficiary of a deceased person’s estate to a person qualifying for rollover relief (referred to here as a “rollover person”). Examples of such transfers include when a beneficiary of an estate transfers inherited land to a rollover trust they are a principal settlor and beneficiary of, or to an LTC they own. An amendment has been made to ensure the exemption from the bright-line test that applies when a person disposes of land they inherited also applies to a receiving rollover person when they dispose of the land. Pre-existing sections CB 6A(2B) and CZ 39(7) provide that a disposal of inherited land by the beneficiary of a deceased person’s estate is not taxable under the bright-line test. Where the recipient of the disposal is a rollover person, rollover relief ensures that when the rollover person disposes of the land it has the same bright-line start date and cost base for the land as the beneficiary had (as given by section CB 6AB or CB 6AC, and section FC 9(3), respectively). The problem with how the law previously worked was that only the beneficiary’s bright-line start date and cost base were “rolled over” – the actual exemption from the bright-line test in CB 6A(2B) (or in CZ 39(7) for the five-year test) was not rolled over to the recipient. This result was at odds with the intention of rollover relief, which is to ensure a rollover person holds residential land subject to all the same bright-line tax settings as the previous owner of the land – including that a disposal by the rollover person should not be subject to the bright-line test in cases where the previous owner inherited the land. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 22 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 New section FC 9(4) provides that if residential land is transferred by a beneficiary of the deceased person on or after 1 April 2022 to a person who is a recipient as described in section FC 9B(a) to (e), and the person disposes of it, sections CB 6A and CZ 39 do not apply to the disposal. This ensures that when a beneficiary of an estate transfers inherited residential land to a rollover person, the beneficiary’s exemption from the bright-line test for the inherited land is rolled over. Example 5: Transfer of inherited property to rollover trust Jerry inherits a house from his father, Tom, after Tom dies in July 2021. In June 2023, Jerry transfers the property to his family trust, the Smith Family Trust, for nil consideration. The Smith Family Trust is a rollover trust and Jerry is both a beneficiary and principal settlor of the trust at the time of the transfer. As he inherited the property, Jerry will not pay tax under the bright-line test, as disposals of inherited property are exempt. Because the transfer was made after 1 April 2022, rollover relief applies to the transfer from Jerry to the Smith Family Trust, meaning Jerry’s exemption from the bright-line test is rolled over the to the trustees of the Smith Family Trust. This means if the trustees dispose of the property, they will have the same bright-line tax treatment that Jerry had on disposal – that is, the disposal is exempt from the bright-line test.

For a complete overview of rollover relief for interest limitation, Part One of this special report (where it describes the latest changes to sections CB 6AB and CB 6AC) should be read in conjunction with the guidance on transitional residential interest and rollover relief for interest limitation contained in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 5 (June 2022). This Part provides in depth guidance on the bright-line test rollover relief first introduced in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Act 2022 and recently amended by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023. The following guidance chiefly concerns rollover relief as it applies to transfers to or from family trusts and certain Māori trusts, as well as transfers to or from look-through companies and partnerships. This guidance incorporates all amendments made to these provisions as at the date of publication. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Note about interest limitation Section DH 5(5)(d) provides rollover relief for the purposes of subpart DH of the Act (the interest limitation rules), including for transfers to or from family trusts or transfers between different capacities. Section DH 5(5)(d) applies to every transfer of disallowed residential property (DRP) since the original owner acquired it that meets the requirements of any of paragraphs (a) to (e) in section FC 9B. Paragraphs (a) to (e) link to sections CB 6AB(1), (2) and (3), and CB 6AC(1) and (2), respectively, treating the relevant requirements of those sections as applying to a transfer of DRP on after 27 March 2021 (rather than a transfer of residential land on or after 1 April 2022). Because of the link to sections CB 6AB and CB 6AC, the changes to these sections introduced in the latest Act also have relevance for interest limitation rollover relief. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 25 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 Note about bright-line start date versus acquisition date When a transfer of residential land is eligible for rollover relief, the intent is that the bright- line period does not reset. This includes both the start date of the bright-line period (that is, when the “clock” runs from) and which bright-line test applies (for example, the five-year or ten-year test). The start date of the bright-line period is generally determined by the date on which legal title was transferred (referred to as the “bright-line acquisition date” in the legislation), whereas which bright-line test applies is determined by the date of acquisition (generally when a person enters into the agreement to purchase a property). From this point onwards, the term “bright-line start date” is used in this document when referring to the date the bright-line “clock” runs from for clarity purposes, in place of the term “bright-line acquisition date” used in the legislation. Family trusts Prior to the introduction of rollover relief for certain residential land transactions involving family trusts, the bright-line test generally taxed these transfers when the transfer occurred within the applicable bright-line period. Under the bright-line test, a transfer of residential land to a trust (whether by settlement or sale) constitutes a disposal by the transferor (the person transferring the land) and an acquisition by the transferee (the trustee(s) of the trust). Depending on the circumstances, this can create an income tax liability under the bright-line test or restart the bright-line clock even if the transferor originally acquired the land before 1 October 2015. 7 Section CB 6AB provides rollover relief when residential land is transferred to or from a family trust on or after 1 April 2022, provided certain conditions are met. Transfers to family trusts Section CB 6AB(1)(a) provides that if a trustee holds residential land on a “rollover trust”, the bright-line start date for the land, when the trustee disposes of it, is the bright-line start date the transferor (or transferors) had for the land. This applies if:  the transfer to the trustee (whether by settlement or sale) occurs on or after 1 April 2022, and 7 The original two-year bright-line test applied to residential land acquired on or after 1 October 2015. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 26 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023  at the time the transferors transfer the land to the trustee: o each transferor is both a settlor and a beneficiary of the trust, and o at least one transferor is a principal settlor of the trust. “Rollover trust” is defined in section CB 6AB(5) to mean, at the time of a relevant transfer:  all principal settlors are beneficiaries of the trust  all principal settlors are close family associates, and  all beneficiaries are close family beneficiaries. “Close family beneficiary” is defined in section CB 6AB(6) to mean, for the relevant trust, a beneficiary that is at least one of the following:  A principal settlor.  A close family associate of another beneficiary who is also a principal settlor.  A trustee of another trust, if at least one beneficiary of the other trust is a close family associate of a beneficiary of the relevant trust.  A company in which a 50 percent or more voting interest (or a market value interest of at least 50 percent, if a market value circumstance exists) is owned by a beneficiary that is a principal settlor or a close family associate of another beneficiary that is a principal settlor.  A charity registered under the Charities Act 2005.  Any association, club, institution, society, organisation, or trust not carried on for the private profit of any person whose funds are applied wholly or principally to any civic, community, charitable , philanthropic, religious, benevolent, or cultural purpose, whether in New Zealand or elsewhere, and, in the case of it having one principal settlor only, the trust has one or more beneficiaries who are close family associates of the principal settlor. Under section CB 6AB(7), two persons are “close family associates” if one or more of the following applies:  they are within four degrees of blood relationship (paragraph (a))  they are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship (paragraph (b)), or  one person is within four degrees of blood relationship to the other person’s spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner (paragraph (c)). Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 27 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 This definition includes relatives by adoption, as section 16(2) of the Adoption Act 1955 deems adopted children to be the natural children of their adoptive parent. Section CB 6A(7)(c) (the third bullet point above) also extends coverage of the association test to include stepchildren and in-laws. The rules mirror the existing associated person rules in section YB 4 but with an expansion from two degrees to four degrees of association. This is to account for the fact that many family trusts include a wider range of family members than simply those only two degrees removed. A non-exhaustive list of some common examples of familial relations that meet the “close family associates” test is as follows (references are to paragraphs in the section CB 6A(7) definition):  The principal settlor’s parents and children (one degree of blood relationship – paragraph (a)).  The principal settlor’s grandchildren, grandparents and siblings (two degrees of blood relationship – paragraph (a)).  The principal settlor’s aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, great-grandchildren, and great- grandparents (three degrees of blood relationship – paragraph (a)).  The principal settlor’s cousins, great-nieces, great-nephews, and great-great- grandchildren (four degrees of blood relationship – paragraph (a)).  The principal settlor’s spouse or de facto partner (paragraph (b)).  The principal settlor’s stepparents, stepchildren, step-siblings, parents-in-law, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, daughters-in-law or sons-in-law (within four degrees of blood relationship to the spouse or de facto partner – paragraph (c)). Further information on how degrees of association are determined in family situations can be found in IR620. 8 8 IR620 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes, available at www.ird.govt.nz Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 28 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 Example 6: Characteristics of a family trust qualifying as a rollover trust Joan has no children of her own, but she wants to set up a family trust for the benefit of her nephew, George, and his family. The trust’s assets include Joan’s house in Auckland, a holiday home in Waihi and some other financial assets. The beneficiaries of the trust are Joan, George, George’s de facto partner, Charlotte, their two children, Jack and May, along with George’s son, Eli, from a previous relationship. Joan loves animals and has been a long-time volunteer for the SPCA, so she also lists the SPCA as a beneficiary of the trust. The relationships of the beneficiaries are as follows: George: three degrees of blood relationship from Joan. George’s partner, Charlotte. George’s children, Jack, May and Eli: four degrees of blood relationship from Joan. SPCA: registered charity under the Charities Act 2005. All the beneficiaries are close family beneficiaries and Joan’s trust qualifies as a rollover trust. Transfers from family trusts Section CB 6AB(2) provides for rollover relief in certain circumstances when residential land is transferred by the trustee of a rollover trust to a settlor or a group of settlors (referred to as “the transferees”) on or after 1 April 2022. If rollover relief applies, the transferees’ bright-line start date for the land when they dispose of it is the bright-line start date the trustee had. Two separate tests determine whether rollover relief applies. The first test, contained in paragraphs (a) and (b), applies if the transferees had originally transferred the land to the trustee. Rollover relief applies under this test if the transferees acquire proportionally the same amount of land they had originally transferred to the trustee and, at the time the trustee transfers the land to the transferees:  all transferees are beneficiaries of the trust  at least one transferee is a principal settlor, and  the trust is a rollover trust. Where land is transferred to a rollover trust on or after 1 April 2022 and subsequently transferred back to the original transferors, the combination of sections CB 6AB(1) and (2)(a) and (b) mean that a person (being both a settlor and a beneficiary) who receives land back from the trust will have the same bright-line start date they had for the land before it was Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 29 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 transferred to the trust. This is because the trustee of the rollover trust will have the bright- line start date the person had before the land was transferred to the trust. The second test, contained in paragraph (c), applies in the opposite situation where the transferees had not previously transferred the land to the trustee. In this instance, rollover relief applies if:  all transferees are principal settlors at the time the trustee transfers the land to the transferees and also at the time the trustee acquired the land, and  the trust is a rollover trust. The timing requirement above is to ensure a beneficiary of the trust cannot become a principal settlor immediately before the transfer to them just so they receive the land without bright-line test tax implications. It also ensures rollover relief does not apply to a transfer to someone who is no longer a principal settlor of the trust. It should be noted paragraph (c) was inserted with effect on 1 April 2023. This means that, unlike the other provisions of section CB 6AB, it does not apply to all relevant transfers occurring on or after 1 April 2022. Instead, the second test (in paragraph (c)) only has effect for relevant transfers occurring on or after 1 April 2023. Rollover relief is not available under either test where residential land held on a family trust is subsequently transferred or distributed to a different beneficiary (for example, a child who is not a settlor and/or did not previously transfer the land to the trust, or in the case of the second test, is not a principal settlor). Such transfers or distributions of trust property remain subject to the bright-line test, as would be the case if a person transferred residential land directly to their child. Resettlements of family trusts Section CB 6AB(1)( b) provides rollover relief for trust resettlements. Under the section, the bright-line start date of a trustee of a resettled trust is the bright-line start date the trustee of the first trust had, if the trustee of the first trust transfers residential land to the resettled trust on or after 1 April 2022. This applies if both trusts are rollover trusts and either:  all the beneficiaries of the resettled trust are the same as for the first trust, or  all the natural person beneficiaries of the resettled trust are either the same as for the first trust or are close family associates of a principal settlor of the first trust. In other words, rollover relief is only available if both trusts meet all the usual requirements of a “rollover trust” in section CB 6AB(5) and are sufficiently closely related. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 30 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 To qualify for rollover relief, each natural person beneficiary of the resettled trust must be a close family beneficiary. In the case of multiple principal settlors, each principal settlor must be a close family associate of the other principal settlors. At a minimum, each natural person beneficiary of the resettled trust must be either a principal settlor, or a close family associate of a principal settlor, of the first trust. The resettled trust may not necessarily have the same beneficiaries as the first trust. However, provided the above conditions are met, this would not preclude the resettlement from qualifying for rollover relief. For example, if an additional generation were added to the resettled trust’s beneficiaries, rollover relief would still be available if the close family beneficiary requirements were satisfied. Rollover relief also applies even if the principal settlor of the first trust is deceased. Transfers to or from different capacity (look-through companies, partnerships) Relief may also apply in certain cases under section CB 6AB when:  residential land is transferred from a look-through company (LTC) or partnership to a family trust, or vice versa (where a person may be a settlor of the trust in a different capacity to the capacity in which they are a beneficiary), or  a person receives land back from a trust they originally transferred it to, but in a different capacity to the capacity in which they previously held it. Section CB 6AB(3) provides that, for the purposes of applying subsection (1)(a) (where a person transfers residential land to a trust) or subsection (2) (where a person receives residential land back from a trust), the transferors and transferees may have different capacities in relation to the different criteria in those provisions. For example, a transferee may be a settlor of the trust in their personal capacity and be a beneficiary as an LTC owner, or they may have transferred the land to the trust in their personal capacity and acquire it back from the trust as a partner in a partnership. Transfers of shares in LTCs Section CB 6AB(8) provides that relief does not apply when shares in an LTC are transferred to a rollover trust, nor when these shares are transferred from a rollover trust to a settlor or group of settlors. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 31 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 Determining which bright-line test applies Section CB 6A(1AB)(b) provides that the ten-year bright-line test (and the five-year bright- line test for new build land) in section CB 6A does not apply to a person’s disposal of residential land if the land meets the requirements of section CB 6AB, and the transferor first acquired an estate or interest in the land before 27 March 2021. Section CZ 39(1B) similarly provides that the five-year bright-line test (preserved in section CZ 39 for land first acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and before 27 March 2021) does not apply to a person’s disposal of residential land if the land meets the requirements of section CB 6AB, and the transferor first acquired an estate or interest in the land before 29 March 2018. These provisions ensure that if rollover relief applies to a transfer under section CB 6AB, the receiving trustee (if the transfer is from a settlor to a rollover trust, or a rollover trust resettlement) or receiving settlor (if the transfer is from a rollover trust to a settlor) has the same bright-line test length as the transferor. 9 The relevant start date the bright-line “clock” runs from is the bright-line start date the transferor had, as per section CB 6AB(1) or (2) (whichever applies). In other words, if the transferor first acquired the land:  on or after 27 March 2021 – a disposal of the land by the transferee within ten years of their bright-line start date is taxable under section CB 6A, or within five years if it satisfies the definition of “new build land”  on or after 29 March 2018 but before 27 March 2021 – a disposal of the land by the transferee within five years of their bright-line start date is taxable under section CZ 39  before 29 March 2018 – a disposal of the land by the transferee is not subject to any bright-line test. This includes if the transferor first acquired the land on or after 1 October 2015, meaning the transferor’s bright-line period was the original two-year bright-line test. 9 Unless the original two-year bright-line period applied to the transferor because they first acquired the land on or after 1 October 2015 but before 29 March 2018, in which case the transferee will not be subject to any bright-line test at all. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 32 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 Determination of transferor’s net income and transferee’s cost base If the above requirements are met for either a transfer to or from a rollover trust, new sections FC 9B and FC 9C provide that the transfer is treated as being for the greater of:  the total cost of the residential land to the transferor, or  the amount of any consideration provided by the transferee. This applies for calculating both the transferor’s net income arising from the disposal under the bright-line test (see section FC 9B(a) and (b)) and the transferee’s cost base and thus their net income arising under the bright-line test from a future disposal of the land (see section FC 9C). This means if the amount of consideration for the transfer is less than or equal to the cost of the land to the transferor (in other words, the original owner has not realised a gain), the transfer is deemed to be for the transferor’s cost – thus, full rollover relief applies. If the amount of consideration exceeds the cost of the land to the transferor (in other words, the original owner has realised a gain even if it is not a full market value profit), then only partial relief applies. In this case, the transfer is treated as being for the amount of consideration provided. This overrides existing section GC 1 so that the transfer is not deemed to be for the market value of the land at the time of the transfer. In other words, the transferor is only taxed on the actual profit realised on the sale of the land, and the transferee’s cost base is what they paid for the land. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 33 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 Example 7: Settlement on family trust – full rollover relief applies Married couple Sunita and Ronald purchase residential land in their own names for $1 million on 9 November 2021. On 20 July 2023 Sunita and Ronald decide to settle the land on a trust with Sunita’s sister and her sister’s spouse as the trustees. Sunita, Ronald and their children are beneficiaries of the trust. The only property settled on the trust is the residential land and the trustees provide consideration of $1 million (even though, in that intervening period, the market value of the property has increased to $1.2 million). The trustees then sell the residential land for $1.7 million on 31 January 2027. Sunita and Ronald are both beneficiaries of the trust. Sunita and Ronald are also both principal settlors, given the trust has no other property and Sunita and Ronald have each made the greatest equal settlements. Sunita and Ronald are associated through marriage, and both non- settlor beneficiaries (their two children) are associated with a principal settlor (in this case, both Sunita and Ronald) within the required four degrees of blood relationship (being within one degree of blood relationship). This means they satisfy the requirements of new section CB 6AB. Full rollover relief applies, as the consideration paid by the trustees to Ronald and Sunita is equal to the price they originally paid for the property. Sunita and Ronald are not subject to tax under the bright-line test on the disposal of their residential land to the trustees of their family trust on 20 July 2023. This is because they are treated as disposing of the land at cost, which means their net income arising under the bright-line test is zero. The trustees are deemed to have a bright-line start date of 9 November 2021 for the residential land (being Sunita and Ronald’s bright-line start date for the land) and a cost base of $1 million. The trustees’ bright-line period ends on 31 January 2027 when the land is sold for $1.7 million. As this is within the 10-year period for the bright-line test (9 November 2021 to 8 November 2031), the sale is subject to income tax under the bright-line test. Ignoring other income tax deductions, the trustees have net bright-line income of $700,000. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 34 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 Example 8: Sale from settlor to trust – partial relief applies Neo acquired residential land on 3 March 2017 for $500,000. On 29 October 2022, Neo sells the residential land to his family trust. Neo is the principal settlor of the trust, and he and his son, Archie, are the beneficiaries. Neo’s outstanding mortgage is $400,000. The trustee provides consideration of $600,000 which is less than the market value of the land, being around $800,000 at that time. Neo is subject to the two-year bright-line test for the land. 10 The sale to the trust is a disposal under the bright-line test, but there is no tax liability under the bright-line test because Neo held the land for more than two years. Partial relief applies to ensure the bright-line clock is not restarted, meaning the trustee takes on Neo’s bright-line start date of 3 March 2017 but not Neo’s acquisition cost of $500,000. The trustee’s cost base is instead the amount of consideration it provided, being $600,000. Example 9: Transfer from family trust to LTC – partial relief applies Melissa owns 100 percent of the shares in Mel Co, a look-through company. Melissa is also the principal settlor and a beneficiary of the Melissa Family Trust. All the other beneficiaries of the Melissa Family Trust, aside from her husband, Dan, are associated with Melissa within four degrees of blood relationship, being her parents and her and Dan’s children. Melissa purchased an investment property in 2012 for $250,000 and sold it to Mel Co the following year on 6 April 2013 for $275,000. In October 2022, Mel Co sells the property to the Melissa Family Trust for $700,000. Melissa does not pay tax under the bright-line test in her capacity as shareholder of Mel Co, as the land was acquired by the company before the introduction of the original two-year bright-line test. Partial relief applies to the transfer of the property from Mel Co to the Melissa Family Trust. This means the transfer does not reset the start of the bright-line period for the Melissa Family Trust. Application of land-rich trust anti-avoidance rule After a transfer of residential land that qualifies for relief is made to a trust, if new beneficiaries are added with the purpose of defeating the bright-line test, the land-rich trust 10 The two-year bright-line test applied to residential land acquired between 1 October 2015 and 28 March 2018. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 35 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 anti-avoidance rule in existing section GB 53 applies to reverse the relief by deeming the transferee to have disposed of the land at market value. Disposals from trusts to beneficiaries The relief provided by new section CB 6AB does not cover disposals from trustees to beneficiaries that are not also settlors. Disposals of residential land from the trustee to a beneficiary within the relevant bright-line period for the trustee may still be subject to the bright-line test and may produce income for the trustee. Māori family trust rule Rollover relief is provided for transfers of residential land on or after 1 April 2022 that is subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 in certain situations. This recognises that land subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 has alienation restrictions that lead to interests in land being passed from generation to generation. These interests are often fragmented and can result in a large number of owners all belonging to the same iwi or hapū or who are all descendants of the same tīpuna. Transfers to Māori family trusts Section CB 6AC(1)(a) provides that if a Māori trustee holds residential land subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 on a Māori rollover trust, the bright-line start date for the land, when the trustee disposes of it, is the bright-line start date the transferor (or transferors) had for the land. This applies if:  the transferors are settlors of the trust, and  at the time they transfer the land to the trustee, they are also beneficiaries of the trust. “Māori rollover trust” is defined in section CB 6AC(4) to mean, at the time of a relevant transfer to or from a relevant trust:  all beneficiaries of the trust are either members of the same iwi or hapū or descendants of the same tīpuna (living or dead), and  the land being transferred is subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993. Section CB 6AC(5) defines “Māori trustee” as a trustee of a trust that is either a Māori authority or eligible to elect to be a Māori authority. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 36 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 Transfers from Māori family trusts Section CB 6AB(2) provides for rollover relief in certain circumstances when residential land is transferred by the Māori trustee of a Māori rollover trust back to the settlors who originally transferred the land to the trust (referred to as “the transferees”). If rollover relief applies, the transferees’ bright-line start date for the land when they dispose of it is the bright-line start date the Māori trustee had. Rollover relief applies if the Māori trustee transfers the land to the transferees on or after 1 April 2022 and:  the transferees are settlors of the trust, and  the transferees acquire proportionally the same amount of land they had transferred to the Māori trustee and, at the time the Māori trustee transfers the land to the transferees: o the transferees are beneficiaries of the trust o the trust is a Māori rollover trust, and o the transferees are settlors of the trust. Example 10: Transfer from trustee of Māori family trust back to the settlors of the trust Before August 2010, John and several members of his extended whānau, who are all members of the same iwi, held interests in a parcel of residential land subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993. In August 2010, John and members of his whānau sold their interests in the land to a trust that was settled by John and his sister, Mere, for $5 million. John, Mere and the rest of the whānau that held interests in the land were at this time beneficiaries of the trust (and still are). On 28 May 2022, the trustees of the trust sell the interests in the land back to members of the whānau for the $5 million the trustees originally paid for the land. The market value of the land at this time is $10 million. In the absence of relief, John, Mere and the rest of the whānau who purchased their interests in the land back from the trust would have a bright-line start date of 28 May 2022. However, because the transfer was made at cost, rollover relief applies. This means the whānau who purchased their interests back have a deemed bright-line start date of August 2010, being the transferors’ bright-line start date (that is, when the land was transferred to the trustees of the trust), with a total cost base in the land of $5 million (being the total cost of the interests in the land to the trustees). In other words, the bright-line clock is not reset for John and Mere and their fellow interest holders who repurchased their interests in May 2022. As their bright-line start date is August 2010, a future disposal by the interest holders will not be subject to the bright-line test. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 37 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 Transfers to or from different capacity (LTCs, partnerships) Relief may also apply in certain cases under section CB 6AC when:  residential land is transferred from an LTC or partnership to a Māori rollover trust or vice versa, where a person may be a settlor of the trust in a different capacity to the capacity in which they are a beneficiary, or  a person receives land back from a Māori rollover trust they originally transferred the land to, but in a different capacity to the capacity in which they previously held it. Section CB 6AC(3) provides that, for the purposes of applying subsection (1)(a) (where a person transfers residential land to a Māori rollover trust) or subsection (2) (where a person receives residential land back from a Māori rollover trust), the transferors and transferees may have different capacities in relation to the different criteria in those provisions. For example, a transferee may be a settlor of the trust in their personal capacity and be a beneficiary as an LTC owner, or they may have transferred the land to the trust in their personal capacity and acquire it back from the trust as a partner in a partnership. Resettlements of Māori family trusts Section CB 6AC(1)(b) provides rollover relief when residential land that is subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 and which is held on a Māori rollover trust is resettled on another Māori rollover trust. Under this section, the bright-line start date of the Māori trustee of the resettled trust is the bright-line start date the Māori trustee of the first trust had, if the Māori trustee of the first trust transfers residential land to the resettled trust on or after 1 April 2022. This applies if all the beneficiaries of the resettled trust are the same as for the first trust. As with the rule for general family trusts, this includes the situation where one of the settlors of the first trust is deceased. Disposals from trusts to beneficiaries Similar to section CB 6AB for general family trusts, the relief provided by new section CB 6AC for transfers to or from certain Māori trusts does not cover disposals from trustees to beneficiaries that are not also settlors. Disposals of residential land from the trustee to a beneficiary within the relevant bright-line period for the trustee may still be subject to the bright-line test and may produce income to the trustee. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 38 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 Determining which bright-line test applies Section CB 6A(1AB)(b) provides that the ten-year bright-line test (and the five-year bright- line test for new build land) in section CB 6A does not apply to a person’s disposal of residential land if the land meets the requirements of section CB 6AC, and the transferor first acquired an estate or interest in the land before 27 March 2021. Section CZ 39(1B) similarly provides that the five-year bright-line test in section CZ 39 does not apply to a person’s disposal of residential land if the land meets the requirements of section CB 6AC, and the transferor first acquired an estate or interest in the land before 29 March 2018. These provisions ensure that if rollover relief applies to a transfer under section CB 6AC, the receiving Māori trustee (if the transfer is from a settlor to a Māori rollover trust, or a resettlement of a Māori rollover trust) or receiving settlor (if the transfer is from a Māori rollover trust to a settlor) has the same bright-line test length as the transferor. 11 The start date the bright-line “clock” runs from is the bright-line start date the transferor had, as per section CB 6AC(1) or (2) (whichever applies). In other words, if the transferor first acquired the land:  on or after 27 March 2021 – a disposal of the land by the transferee within ten years of their bright-line start date is taxable under section CB 6A, or within five years if it satisfies the definition of “new build land”  on or after 29 March 2018 but before 27 March 2021 – a disposal of the land by the transferee within five years of their bright-line start date is taxable under section CZ 39  before 29 March 2018 – a disposal of the land by the transferee is not subject to any bright-line test. This includes if the transferor first acquired the land on or after 1 October 2015, meaning the transferor’s bright-line period was the original two-year bright-line test. 11 Unless the original two-year bright-line period applied to the transferor because they first acquired the land on or after 1 October 2015 but before 29 March 2018, in which case the transferee will not be subject to any bright-line test at all. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 39 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 Determination of transferor’s net income and transferee’s cost base If the above requirements are met for either a transfer to or from a Māori rollover trust, new sections FC 9B and FC 9C provide that the transfer is treated as being for the greater of:  the total cost of the residential land to the transferor, and  the amount of any consideration provided by the transferee. This applies for calculating both the transferor’s net income arising from the disposal under the bright-line test (see section FC 9B(d) and (e)) and the transferee’s cost base and thus their net income arising under the bright-line test from a future disposal of the land (see section FC 9C). This means if the amount of consideration is less than or equal to what the transferor originally paid (in other words, the original owner has not realised a gain), the transfer is deemed to be for the transferor’s cost – thus, full rollover relief applies. If the amount of consideration exceeds the cost of the land to the transferor (that is, the transferor has realised a gain, even if it is not a full market value profit), then only partial relief applies. In this case, the transfer is treated as being for the amount of consideration provided. In other words, the transferor is only taxed on the actual profit realised on the sale of the land to the transferee, and the transferee’s cost base is what they paid for the land. Transfers of residential land as part of a settlement under te Tiriti o Waitangi Settlements of claims under te Tiriti o Waitangi – The Treaty of Waitangi (te Tiriti) can be a multi-stage process. The Crown will transfer Tiriti settlement property to a single governance entity (post-settlement governance entity or PSGE) that may act on behalf of several groups, for example, different hapū, or as a collective for a number of iwi groups. The PSGE will then transfer settlement assets to different members of the claimant group as required under the deed of settlement or settlement legislation. This transfer from the PSGE to a member of the claimant group could be subject to income tax under the bright-line test for the PSGE. It could also start the bright-line clock for the member to whom the residential land has been transferred. The transfer of residential land from the PSGE to a claimant group member was less likely to trigger the bright-line test under the previous two-year and five-year tests. However, with the extension of the test to ten years, this could become an impediment for iwi to transact efficiently with settlement assets involving residential land. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 40 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 Section CB 6AE applies when residential land that is subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 and is part of the settlement of a claim under te Tiriti is transferred to a trustee of a trust who:  is a Māori authority, or is eligible to be a Māori authority, and  on behalf of Māori claimants, receives and manages assets that are transferred by the Crown as part of the settlement of a claim under te Tiriti, in accordance with the requirements of existing section HF 2(3)(e)(i). This is to provide rollover relief for the transfer of Tiriti settlement residential land from the PSGE to a member of the claimant group, for example, hapū. New section CB 6AE(2) provides that the recipient trustee has the transferor’s bright-line start date. Determining which bright-line test applies Section CB 6A(1AB)(b) provides that the ten-year bright-line test in section CB 6A (and the five-year bright-line test for new build land) does not apply to a person’s disposal of residential land if the land meets the requirements of section CB 6AE, and the transferor first acquired an estate or interest in the land before 27 March 2021. Section CZ 39(1B) similarly provides that the five-year bright-line test in section CZ 39 does not apply to a person’s disposal of residential land if the land meets the requirements of section CB 6AE, and the transferor first acquired an estate or interest in the land before 29 March 2018. These provisions ensure that if rollover relief applies to a transfer under section CB 6AE, the recipient trustee has the same bright-line test length as the PSGE. 12 As outlined above, the relevant start date the bright-line “clock” runs from is the bright-line start date the PSGE had, as per section CB 6AE(2 ). In other words, if the PSGE first acquired the land:  on or after 27 March 2021 – a disposal of the land by the trustee within ten years of their bright-line start date is taxable under section CB 6A, or within five years if it satisfies the definition of “new build land”  on or after 29 March 2018 but before 27 March 2021 – a disposal of the land by the trustee within five years of their bright-line start date is taxable under section CZ 39 12 Unless the original two-year bright-line period applied to the transferor because they first acquired the land on or after 1 October 2015 but before 29 March 2018, in which case the transferee will not be subject to any bright-line test at all. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 41 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023  before 29 March 2018 – a disposal of the land by the trustee is not subject to any bright-line test. This includes if the PSGE first acquired the land on or after 1 October 2015, meaning the PSGE’s bright-line period was the original two-year bright-line test. Determination of transferor’s net income and transferee’s cost base If the above requirements are met for the transfer of Tiriti settlement residential land, new section FC 9D sets out that the recipient trustee is deemed for the purposes of the bright- line test to have acquired the land for its market value at the time the land was transferred by the Crown. It may not be feasible to determine the market value at the exact time of the settlement – a reasonable estimate shortly thereafter (for example, determined for insurance purposes) would be acceptable. Section FC 9B(f) provides that the transferor (the PSGE) is treated as disposing of the land for the greater of its cost to the PSGE or the amount of consideration received (if any) from the member of the claimant group to whom they transfer the land. Transfers by or to persons in their capacity as LTC owners or partners in a partnership Shareholders in LTCs are treated as directly holding the LTCs’ assets, deriving income, and incurring expenses in accordance with their shareholding percentage. In effect, LTCs are transparent for tax purposes, which means the income tax consequences for someone who holds residential land through an LTC are generally the same as for someone who holds residential land directly. Nonetheless, the process of transferring residential land from an individual shareholder into the LTC (or vice versa) currently constitutes a bright-line disposal and acquisition. Partnerships are also transparent for tax purposes. Equally, the process of transferring residential land from an individual partner to the partnership (or vice versa) constitutes a bright-line disposal and acquisition. Relief applies under new section CB 6AB(4) if a person, in one capacity (such as their personal individual capacity), transfers residential land to themselves in a different capacity (such as a shareholder in an LTC or a partner in a partnership). The section provides that the person’s bright-line start date for the land when they ultimately dispose of it to a third party is the bright-line start date they first had for the land. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 42 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 This applies to the extent a person transferring the land to themselves in another capacity has the same ownership interest in the land before and after the transfer. It is also intended to apply when residential land is transferred from an LTC to another LTC with identical shareholding (meaning the two LTCs have the exact same owners who each hold the exact same proportion of shares in the second LTC as they hold in the first LTC). Determining which bright-line test applies Section CB 6A(1AB)(b) provides that the ten-year bright-line test in section CB 6A (and the five-year bright-line test for new build land) does not apply to a person’s disposal of residential land if the land meets the requirements of section CB 6AB, and the transferor first acquired an estate or interest in the land before 27 March 2021. Section CZ 39(1B) similarly provides that the five-year bright-line test in section CZ 39 does not apply to a person’s disposal of residential land if the land meets the requirements of section CB 6AB, and the transferor first acquired an estate or interest in the land before 29 March 2018. These provisions ensure that if rollover relief applies to a transfer under section CB 6AB(4), the transferee (being a person receiving a land transfer in one capacity that they made, in a different capacity, to themselves) has the same bright-line test length as the transferor. 13 The relevant start date the bright-line “clock” runs from is the bright-line start date the person first had for the land (in the capacity in which they originally held it) as per section CB 6AB(4). In other words, if the person first acquired the land:  on or after 27 March 2021 – a subsequent disposal of the land (that is, after the transfer of the land to themselves in a different capacity) within ten years of their bright-line start date is taxable under section CB 6A, or within five years if it satisfies the definition of “new build land”  on or after 29 March 2018 but before 27 March 2021 – a subsequent disposal of the land (after the transfer of the land to themselves in a different capacity) within five years of their bright-line start date is taxable under section CZ 39  before 29 March 2018 – a subsequent disposal of the land (after the transfer of the land to themselves in a different capacity) is not subject to any bright-line test. This includes if the person first acquired the land on or after 1 October 2015, meaning 13 Unless the original two-year bright-line period applied to the transferor because they first acquired the land on or after 1 October 2015 but before 29 March 2018, in which case the transferee will not be subject to any bright-line test at all. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 43 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 their original bright-line period (before transferring the land to themselves in a different capacity) was the original two-year bright-line test. Determination of transferor’s net income and transferee’s cost base If the above requirements are met for a person’s transfer of residential land to themselves in a different capacity, new sections FC 9B and FC 9C provide that the transfer is treated as being for the greater of:  the total cost of the residential land to the transferor, and  the amount of any consideration provided by the transferee. This applies for calculating both the transferor’s net income arising from the disposal under the bright-line test (see section FC 9B(c)) and the transferee’s cost base and thus their net income arising under the bright-line test from a future disposal of the land (see section FC 9C). This means if the amount of consideration is less than or equal to the cost of the land to the transferor (or in other words, the original owner has not realised a gain), the transfer is deemed to be for the transferor’s cost – thus, full rollover relief applies. If the amount of consideration exceeds the cost of the land to the transferor (that is, a partial gain has been realised, even if it is not a full market value profit), then only partial relief applies. In this case, the transfer is treated as being for the amount of consideration provided. In other words, the transferor is only taxed on the actual profit realised on the sale of the land, and the transferee’s cost base is what they paid for the land. Inherited property transferred to rollover person A beneficiary of a deceased person’s estate may transfer inherited residential land to a person qualifying for rollover relief (referred to here as a “rollover person”), such as an LTC owned by the beneficiary or a rollover trust. A special rule in section FC 9(4) applies in this circumstance to ensure the exemption from the bright-line test for inherited property applies to the rollover person if it disposes of the land. Pre-existing rules (which in their earliest form date back to when the original two-year bright-line test was introduced in October 2015) provide that the disposal of inherited residential land is not taxable under the bright-line test. Under section FC 9, the transfer of such land on the death of a person to an executor or administrator of the deceased’s estate, as well as the transfer of the land to a beneficiary of the estate, is exempt from the bright- Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 44 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 line test. Sections CB 6A(2B) and CZ 39(7) provide that a subsequent disposal of the property by the beneficiary is also not taxable under either the ten-year or five-year bright-line test. Section FC 9(4) provides that if residential land is transferred by a beneficiary of the deceased person on or after 1 April 2022 to a person who is a recipient as described in section FC 9B(a) to (e), and the person disposes of it, sections CB 6A and CZ 39 do not apply to the disposal. This ensures when a beneficiary of an estate transfers inherited residential land to a rollover person (such as a rollover trust the estate beneficiary is a settlor and beneficiary of), the beneficiary’s exemption from the bright-line test for the inherited land is “rolled over”. Transfers between companies within a wholly-owned tax consolidated group Rollover relief also applies to transfers of residential land within a wholly-owned group of companies that is a consolidated group under subpart FM. Section FM 15(2B) provides that the recipient company (company B) is treated as having the same bright-lin e start date for that transferred land as the transferor company (company A). This ensures the transfer to company B does not reset the bright-line clock. The restriction of relief to tax-consolidated groups effectively limits the rollover relief to New Zealand resident companies, as non-residents cannot be part of a consolidated group. Similar to the pre-existing rollover rule for company amalgamations in section FO 17(3), this ensures relief is only available on the condition the property remains within the New Zealand tax base. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 45 of 45 Special report - Public Act 2023 No 5 | 22 May 2023 Example 11: Transfer within consolidated group First Co and Second Co are companies that are both members of the same wholly-owned group of companies, of which all the members are New Zealand resident companies. The group is a consolidated group under subpart FM of the Income Tax Act 2007. First Co acquired residential rental property in the form of an apartment complex in central Hamilton on 12 January 2019 for $15 million. On 23 May 2022, First Co transfers the property to Second Co for $20 million. Under the consolidation rules, income does not arise to First Co under the bright-line test. However, in the absence of relief, the bright-line clock would reset on the transfer of the property to Second Co. Relief applies to the transfer, meaning Second Co. is treated as having a bright-line start date for the property of 12 January 2019.

These are published in advance of an article in the Tax Information Bulletin.
\[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee ORDER IN COUNCIL: TAX ADMINISTRATION (REPORTABLE JURISDICTIONS FOR APPLICATION OF CRS STANDARD) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2023 Proposal 1This paper seeks approval to submit an Order in Council, amending the Tax Administration (Reportable Jurisdictions for Application of CRS Standard) Regulations 2017, to the Executive Council. 2The Order, to be made under section 226D of the Tax Administration Act 1994, will add Jamaica to the existing list of 97 ‘reportable jurisdictions’ that New Zealand maintains for the purpose of the Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters (the Common Reporting Standard, or AEOI) rules. 3Reportable jurisdictions are those that Inland Revenue is authorised to share financial information with under the AEOI rules. Policy 4The making of the proposed Order is a routine matter and has not required any new policy decisions. 5AEOI is an international initiative, led by the G20 and OECD, for cooperation between jurisdictions in the detection and prevention of ‘offshore tax evasion’. Offshore tax evasion occurs when people hide their wealth from tax authorities by locating it in offshore accounts. To counter this, AEOI rules require financial institutions worldwide to (i) identify accounts held or controlled by non-residents and (ii) annually report information on those non-residents and accounts to local tax authorities. The tax authorities then may exchange the information under tax treaties, to ensure that each country receives the relevant information needed to be able to verify that its residents are correctly reporting all offshore wealth and income for tax purposes. 6New Zealand incorporated the AEOI rules into the Tax Administration Act 1994 in 2017 and Inland Revenue has been conducting annual exchanges of AEOI information since then. The original list of reportable jurisdictions established in 2017 for the initial exchanges has grown each year as additional jurisdictions joined the initiative. For this year’s update of the list, the only country to be added is Jamaica. 1 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:04:19 Doc 1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7The AEOI rules, as enacted, authorise Inland Revenue to provide AEOI information to jurisdictions approved by Order in Council as ‘reportable jurisdictions’. The Order in Council mechanism was included because AEOI involves automated exchange of a considerable amount of highly sensitive personal and financial information. Government oversight and the ability to refuse exchange with particular jurisdictions is a safeguard. It is, however, a safeguard of last resort as it co-exists with many other international and domestic safeguards that are designed to ensure information is only exchanged, held and used as intended. 8By joining the AEOI initiative, Jamaica has also become a Participating jurisdiction that shares tax information with New Zealand. Timing and 28-Day Rule 9I propose that the Order come into force on 31 March 2023, to coincide with the beginning of the next AEOI reporting/exchange cycle on 1 April 2023. This timing can be met without any need for a waiver of the 28-day rule. Compliance 10The proposed Order complies with: 10.1the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 10.2the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 10.3the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 2020; 10.4relevant international standards and obligations; and 10.5the Legislation Guidelines, which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Regulations Review Committee 11I am not aware of any grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House of Representatives under Standing Order 319. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 12The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the Order is ready to be submitted to Cabinet. 2 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:04:19 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Impact Analysis 13The Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that the Tax Administration (Reportable Jurisdictions for Application of CRS Standard) Amendment Regulations 2023 is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement. This is granted on the grounds that the Government has limited statutory decision-making discretion or responsibility for the content of proposed delegated legislation. 14The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as the threshold for significance is not met. Communications 15As for previous updates, Inland Revenue will advise all financial institutions and others registered as an AEOI stakeholder of the change to the reportable jurisdictions list by email. Inland Revenue will also publish an article about the change in its monthly Tax Information Bulletin publication. Proactive Release 16I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers (except for officials’ names) within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 17Public and Agency consultation on the reportable jurisdictions list was undertaken during the development of the initial list of reportable jurisdictions in 2017. When the list was first amended, financial institutions and AEOI stakeholders were asked to provide feedback on whether adding additional reportable jurisdictions would create any difficulties or concerns. No issues were raised during either of these consultation rounds. For most New Zealand financial institutions, this change will have no implications as they have taken a wider approach and provide AEOI information of tax-residents for all jurisdictions 18Given the lack of any concern during these prior rounds, no additional public consultation was undertaken on this occasion. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade was consulted on whether the addition of Jamaica to the list raises any concerns and did not identify any. The Treasury were informed. 3 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:04:19 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 1note that the Tax Administration (Reportable Jurisdictions for Application of CRS Standard) Amendment Regulations 2023 is a routine annual update made under section 226D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and that no new policy decisions were required; 2agree to add Jamaica to the existing list of 97 reportable jurisdictions that Inland Revenue is authorised to provide financial account information to under the OECD Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters initiative; 3authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (Reportable Jurisdictions for Application of CRS Standard) Amendment Regulations 2023; 4note that the Tax Administration (Reportable Jurisdictions for Application of CRS Standard) Amendment Regulations 2023 come into force on 31 March 2023.

You referred to tables produced for an earlier OIA response in 2020, and requested an update in a similar format to cover the 2018-19 to 2021-22 income years as follows: The first request is for the following information: taxable income of superannuitants by income band. \[...\] Two tables, one showing income bands for superannuitants, and another showing the number of superannuitants with incomes above each threshold. Relevant years: 2018/19 to 2021/22 Income bands: - Up to 30,000 - Between 30,001 and 50,000 - Between 50,001 and 100,000 - Between 100,001 and 150,000 - Between 150,001 and 200,000 - Between 200,001 and 300,000 - Over 300,001 Using the same income bands, y ou additionally requested the following for the same income tax years 2018-19 to 2021-22 inclusive: Taxable income of superannuitants by age. The output I am looking for is a table that shows the number of superannuitants in each age band with taxable income in each income band. Relevant years: 2018/19 to 2021/22 Age bands: - Aged between 65 and 69 - Aged between 70 and 74 - Aged between 75 and 79 - Aged between 80 and 84 - Aged 85 and over Income bands: - Up to 30,000 - Between 30,001 and 50,000 \[24OIA1693\] Page 2 of 4 - Between 50,001 and 100,000 - Between 100,001 and 150,000 - Between 150,001 and 200,000 - Between 200,001 and 300,000 - Over 300,001 Tables 1 and 2 below respond to your first request and show the number of New Zealand superannuation recipients broken down by income band for the income years 2018-1 9 to 2021- 22 inclusive, with 2021-22 being the most recent complete year. The first table provides the number of people with taxable income within income ranges, and the second table presents the same data as reverse-cumulative sums, thereby displaying the number of people with incomes above each threshold. The income bands are based on taxable income, which includes New Zealand superannuation itself (as this is a taxable transfer). It also includes other income declared on personal tax returns or used in the annual tax square-up such as PAYE-related earnings, rent, dividends, interest, overseas income and self-employment. Taxable income does not include portfolio-investment entity income (for example, income earned in KiwiSaver schemes), or tax-paid income received via other entitles, for example distributions of tax-paid trustee income. The data was extracted from Inland Revenue’s systems on 23 January 2024.

\[24OIA1516\] Page 1 of 12 1 February 2024 Dear Than k you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 5 December 2023. You requested the following: 1. IRD’s debt collection guidelines and/or policies, including policies that establish the Department’s position as to call frequency, call times, contacting of next of kind, calling people at their employers and when debt is referred to third-party debt collection agencies. 2. All information pertaining to IRD’s debt collection arrangements with third-party debt collection agencies, including what types and sizes of debt are referred to agency and the applicable commission / pricing arrangements. I would also like to better understand the current state and of IRD debt. Could you please also provide: 3. The total number of people with IRD debt and total aggregate debt for the financial years ending 30 Jun 2021, 2022 and 2023. If possible, please break these amounts down into debtor age groups, gender and ethnicity as well as age of debt. 4. The average repayment amount of IRD debt made by voluntary payments, and made under an attachment order for the financial years ending 30 Jun 2021, 2022 and 2023. 5. The portion by number and dollar-amount of MOJ debt repayments made by attachment order vs voluntary repayments for the financial years ending 30 Jun 2021, 2022 and 2023. On 12 December 2023, you clarified your request to spe cify you are requesting debt for individuals only, in relation to just tax and child support debts managed by Inland Revenue, which you requested be separated. You also confirmed that for items 4 and 5 you are seeking amounts recovered by way of enforced deductions pursuant to the Inland Revenue Acts, from a source of income for a particular debtor, and that you would like student loan repayments excluded from these figures. Item 1: Inland Revenue’s primary objective, as contained in section 6A (3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA), is “to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law”. To do this, the Commissioner has been granted wide powers under the TAA. Full legislation can \[24OIA1516\] Page 2 of 12 be viewed at www.legislation.govt.nz. Our charter can be viewed on our website (www.ird.govt.nz) by searching for “Charter”. Our approach to compliance is multi-layered and based on our commitment to making it as easy as possible for customers to get it right from the start, and hard for them to get it wrong. We know most individuals and businesses want to do the right thing, and we want them to understand that if they get in touch with us when they are struggling, they will get the help they need. We also want the vast majority of New Zealanders who are making the effort to meet their tax obligations to know that we will identify the few who are not and take action. Inland Revenue works with customers who anticipate they will not be able to make their payments by the due date to understand their financial situation and to help them resolve their debt. This could be by setting up instalment arrangements or determining if they qualify for financial relief. Inland Revenue’s Standard Practice Statement 18/04 outlines Inland Revenue’s general approach to the collection of debts, including options for relief. You can find this on Inland Revenue’s tax technical website, www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz an d searching for “Standard practice statement 18/04”. A copy is attached for your convenience. Regarding call frequency, call times, contacting next of kin, calling people at their employers and re ferring debt to a third-party debt collection agency, Inland Revenue does not maintain strict guidelines or policies on these criteria and decisions around contacting individuals are made on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the officer. As such, this part of your request is refused under section 18(e), the documents alleged to contain the information requested do not exist. Item 2: Inland Revenue does not utilise third-party debt collection agencies for debtors located in New Zealand. If a debtor is located overseas, Inland Revenue will engage with other agencies, as detailed below: Child Support debt – liable parent is overseas Inland Revenue administers two of the agreements New Zealand has with other countries to aid in the collection of child support when a liable parent is overseas and is not voluntarily complying with their child support payments. Firstly, the Child Support ( Reciprocal Agreement with Australia) is administered by Inland Revenue for New Zealand and by Services Australia for Australia. Services Australia are responsible for child support assessments and enforcement in Australia. If we refer a case for collection under the Reciprocal Agreement, then Services Australia will apply their own collection methods in accordance with Australian laws. Secondly, the 2007 Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance (the 2007 Child Support Convention) is a multilateral treaty that provides for the collection of child support and other forms of maintenance (such as domestic maintenance) when the liable person resides in a different member country. \[24OIA1516\] Page 3 of 12 The 2007 Child Support Convention came into effect in New Zealand on 1 November 2021. Inland Revenue can apply to the Central Authority of another member country requesting assistance in collection of child support owed to Inland Revenue. If the application is accepted, then payments will be collected in accordance with the laws of that member country. This could involve various other agencies and enforcement measures such as judicial proceedings before a Court, collection by a child support agency, or by another debt collection agency. There are no guidelines around the types or size of the debt as long as they fall within the scope of the 2007 Child Support Convention. A list of the 2007 Child Support Convention Central Authorities, as well as information about enforcement procedures in each member country, is available on The Hague Conference website here: https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/conventions/specialised-sections/child-support The 2007 Child Support Convention stipulates that each Central Authority will bear its own costs in meeting their obligations under the Convention and in general cannot charge an applicant for provision of services (Article 8), however the Reciprocal Agreement with Australia does provide for reimbursement of costs for providing services under the Agreement (article 24). If Inland Revenue is asked to collect payments for another country, we will use the enforcement provisions of the Child Support Act 1991. Student loan debt – borrower is overseas When we have reason to believe that the borrower is in Australia or the United Kingdom, we can refer the case to have tracing attempted on our behalf. We use third party debt collection agencies in the country we believe the person is living, those being Baycorp Australia and CCI Legal UK. These agencies may, where appropriate, take collection on Inland Revenue’s behalf in the country the borrower resides. Tax debt – debtor is overseas New Zealand has agreements with the United Kingdom, Australia, Netherlands, Japan, Canada, Poland, and Turkey to aid in the collection of tax related debt when a person or entity, such as a company, is not voluntarily complying with their payments. New Zealand is also a signatory of the “Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters” (MAC) along with 144 other jurisdictions. This convention includes provisions on tax collection of which members can opt into. Members can then request help from other members to collect tax debt. Each country will use the powers granted to them within their own domestic laws to collect the debt, that can mean the way in which the debt is collected can vary from country to country. These agreements are reciprocal which typically means any country collecting debt on behalf of another will bear the cost and resourcing of that collection with the understanding that the same provisions would apply the other way if roles were reversed. However, if extraneous costs are incurred due to needing support outside of the tax agency, such as private legal support, then these costs would typically be passed back to the country requesting help in collection. \[24OIA1516\] Page 4 of 12 The size of any debt is only one factor considered when determining whether to request collection. Inland Revenue would also consider other factors, for example the level of engagement from the customer and the age of the debt. Your request for any applicable commission or pricing arrangements is refused under section 9(2)(b)(ii) of the OIA, to protect information where the making available of the information would be likely unreasonably to prejudice the commercial position of the person who is the subject of the information. Item 3: The attached tables labelled Appendix 1 display the requested information for individuals broken down into debtor age groups, gender, and age of debt for child support and tax debts separately. Tax debts includes income tax, PAYE, GST, Working for Families tax credits and all other tax debts. This data excludes Student Loans, Child Support, Cost of Living and other debt from COVID-19 relief initiatives (Small Business Cashflow loans, Resurgence Support Payments, and COVID Support Payments) Inland Revenue does not record ethnicity information. Inland Revenue also does not explicitly record information on our customer’s gender. Gender information is grouped based on the customer’s title. The Unknown / other gender category includes customers that have missing or gender-neutral titles (e.g. doctor, military or religious titles, or gender-neutral titles). Your request is therefore partially refused under section 18(g) of the OIA, the information requested is not held by Inland Revenue and I do not believe the information is held by another department. Items 4 and 5: The attached table labelled Appendix 2 provides the average repayment amounts made by voluntary payments and enforced deductions for the financial years requested. The information regarding the average payment amount for the 2021 financial year is contained within our previous computer system, to which we now have limited access. As a result, we are unable to collate the average value of payments for the period requested without significant manual review. Accordingly, this part of your request is refused under section 18(f) of the OIA, the information requested cannot be made available without substantial collation or research. Inland Revenue does not collate information related to debt payments that result from actions or orders undertaken by the Ministry of Justice under the Inland Revenue Acts. As such, this part of your request is refused in part under section 18(g) of the OIA, the information is not held by Inland Revenue, and there are no reasonable grounds to believe it is held by, or more closely connected with the functions of, another department. Additionally, Inland Revenue does not explicitly record details on whether the payments are voluntary or via enforced deductions. In order to record this information, we would be required to manually search through each individual account. Therefore, your request is also refused in part under section 18(f) of the OIA, the information requested cannot be made available without substantial collation or research. \[24OIA1516\] Page 5 of 12 For items 4 and 5, I considered whether consulting with you, extending your request, or charging you would help make this information available. However, I concluded the information would not be able to be made available with consultation, extension or charging. Right of review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz . Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman by email at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz. If you choose to have an internal review, you can still ask the Ombudsman for a review. Publishing of OIA response We intend to publish our response to your request on Inland Revenue’s website (www.ird.govt.nz ) as this information may be of interest to other members of the public. This letter, with your personal details removed, will be published in its entirety. Publishing responses increases the availability of information to the public and is consistent with the OIA's purpose of enabling more effective participation in the making and administration of laws and policies and promoting the accountability of officials. Thank you for your request.

24OIA1707 Page 1 of 14 21 February 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 23 January 2024. Your request is outlined in Appendix A. Information being released The information you have requested is outlined in Appendix B. Data provided in response to your first request is as at 15 February 2024. Data provided in response to your second request is as at 31 March of the years provided. Customer numbers, residual income tax (RIT) values and provisional tax obligations are based on filed returns and are subject to change as returns continue to be filed. Taxpayers liable to pay over $5,000 in residual income tax The customers included in this data are any entities (individuals, companies, trusts, etc.) who have a residual income tax of over $5,000 based on their income tax returns for 2022 and 2023, which would create a provisional tax obligation for them in the 2023 and 2024 tax years. Customers that paid provisional tax late The provisional tax information provided for those who made late payments or did not pay is based on all provisional tax assessments for the 2022 and 2023 tax years where there was any amount to pay. Customers included in this data had a provisional tax obligation in 2022 and 2023 because of their RIT value in the 2021 and 2022 tax years. Tax agent definition An active tax agent can be an individual or another kind of entity. To be considered an active tax agent, the individual or entity must have an active ‘tax agent’ indicator in Inland Revenue's system at that point in time. Counts have therefore been provided as at the end of each tax year (31 March). The filing of returns has not been used in determining tax agents because there are some filing methods where it is not possible to determine who has filed the return. The presence of the tax agent indicator is therefore more accurate, as tax agents must have at least 10 clients and meet filing requirements to retain their tax agent status. Where agency-to-agent links exist, Inland Revenue considers the overarching agency as the 'active tax agent', not the agents linked to it. Therefore, ‘Total active tax agents’ is the total agents with an active indicator minus the number of those agents who are linked to an overarching agency. 24OIA1707 Page 4 of 14 Appendix B Taxpayers

24OIA1841 Page 1 of 3 28 February 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 6 February 2024. You requested the following: 1. Could I get the full report written at David Parker’s request, which showed that the richest families paid only 9% tax? 2. The following information, which I assume would have formed part of the analysis done for the above report. • The percentage of income pad as Income Tax by decile. • Estimate of the percentage of income paid as GST by decile. • Estimate of the percentage of income paid – total direct and indirect taxes by decile. 3. Copy of report released to Thomas Coughlan of the New Zealand Herald on taxation fairness. 4. Has New Zealand signed up for the OECD BEPS Pillar One, which I understand would perhaps increase taxes paid by multinationals a little but involve giving up some rights? 5. If we have signed up for Pillar One, has this been ratified? Item 1 I have interpreted your request as referring to the High-Wealth Individuals Research Project Report (the Report) released in June 2023. Your request is refused under section 18(d) of the OIA, as the report is publicly available on Inland Revenue’s website (ird.govt.nz) or at High- Wealth Individuals Research Project Report - April 2023. Item 2 The information requested is publicly available on Inland Revenue’s website (ird.govt.nz) by searching for Tax on taxable income datasets and in chapter 14 and 4 of the Report respectively, consequently, your request is refused under section 18(d) of the OIA, as the report is publicly available. Most of the data gathered for the purposes of the Report has since been destroyed in line with t he Privacy Impact Statement issued for the project. All the information available has been 24OIA1841 Page 2 of 3 released and can be found on Inland Revenue’s website (ird.govt.nz) by searching for “High Wealth Individuals” and selecting the document library (data is provided in supplemental information). Item 3 I have interpreted your request as referring to the now repealed Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023’s draft report released on February 2024. Your request is refused under section 18(d) of the OIA, as the report is publicly available on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website (taxpolicy.govt.nz) or at Taxation Principles Reporting Act: Annual Report . Items 4 and 5 Pillar One consists of two components: Amount A, which reallocates a portion of the super-profits of the world’s largest companies to market countries (like New Zealand); and Amount B, which is a simplified method for transfer pricing a multinational’s distribution activities. Amount A has not yet been finalised. The OECD is hoping to agree a text in March this year, with a signing ceremony of the resulting treaty in June. However not all issues have yet been agreed, consequently, as Pillar One Amount A has not been finalised yet, no country has signed up to it. Amount B was finalised on 19 February 2024 by way of an update to the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines – for more information see the OECD press release which can be found on the OECD website (oecd.org ) by searching for “Release of Amount B report”. Amount B is optional for countries to apply. While Inland Revenue will respect another country’s choice to apply Amount B for its own distributors, Inland Revenue will not be applying Amount B to New Zealand resident distributors. This is because Amount B’s simplified pricing method does not produce an arm’s length outcome for the New Zealand market. Accordingly, there is no treaty to sign or ratify. New Zealand has agreed to the update but will not choose to adopt Amount B here for the reasons stated above. Right of review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: commissionerscorrespondence@ird.govt.nz . Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman by email at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz . If you choose to have an internal review, you can still ask the Ombudsman for a review. 24OIA1841 Page 3 of 3 Publishing of OIA response We intend to publish our response to your request on Inland Revenue’s website (www.ird.govt.nz) as this information may be of interest to other members of the public.

24OIA1785 Page 1 of 5 4 March 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 12 February 2024. You requested the following: I would like to request some data under OIA please on revenue collected by use of the tax code NSW, for 2021 to 2023 financial years: If it is possible please can i request for the: - Total amount of aggregate monthly earnings (wages), - total aggregate PAYE withheld, and - the total number of employees that used the NSW tax code for that employment. If possible please if the information can be separated between: 1) All employees using NSW tax code 2) Employees currently using NSW tax code and current or previous use of the RSE scheme indicated. 3) Employees using NSW tax code, and RSE scheme is indicated, and industry code of current employer is Agriculture (excluding fishing). Information being released The data in scope of your request is outlined in Appendix A. This information provides an update to the information previously released to you on 5 September 2022 (23OIA1170). Table 1 provides the total amount of aggregate monthly earnings (wages), total aggregate PAYE withheld, and the total number of employees that used the NSW tax code for that employment. PAYE amounts provided include the ACC earner premium. Further to the above, Table 2 shows employees where there is a Recognised Seasonal Employee (RSE) indicator for that employee held on Inland Revenue systems. Please note, this indicator may not necessarily reflect the employee’s current employment situation. Table 3 shows RSE employees where the employer has indicated “Agriculture” (excluding fishing) as their industry classification.

24OIA1835 Page 1 of 3 12 March 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 15 February 2024. You requested the following: 1. GST to Income by decile – Figure 14.4 (page 113) – A large difference between HES and Thomas for decile one. What could be the explanation for this? Which figures are likely to be more accurate? (is HES a self-estimate?)? Could I get the same graph with exact HES figures included (figures on the bar labels are only for Thomas)? 2. Effective Tax Rates for high-income families and median Income – Could I get figures including only realised Capital Gains, excluding unrealised gains? 3. Transfers are much higher for deciles one and two than for deciles three and four. What are the main reasons for this (EITC?)? Item 1 In the high-wealth individuals research project report, footnote 109 on page 108 denotes that decile 1 incomes may not be representative of the resources of individuals. Decile 1 incomes can be volatile between HES years, this is because decile 1 can be affected by things such as losses and part time work. The increased ratio calculated for HES 2018/19 is due to decile 1 having higher average expenditure in 2019 but lower income than in 2016. This is likely in part due to data volatility. Generally, we suggest looking at deciles 2-10 and ignoring decile 1 due to the stated data issues. Our estimates for deciles 2-10 are close to those of Thomas (whose analysis is based on HES 2015/16). These are the figures for the HES 2018/19 GST/income ratio, excluding housing and cars. The details of how HES data is constructed is available from Stats NZ. Decile 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 23.4% 12.5% 10.6% 8.6% 8.3% 7.2% 6.5% 6.2% 6.5% 6.1 % 24OIA1835 Page 2 of 3 Item 2 There are several difficulties in estimating an effective tax rate based on realised gains, in particular determining the cost base for valuation and how to attribute tax. Further realised capital gains were not calculated for all asset categories. For this reason, this analysis was not done. As such, this part of your request is refused under section 18(g) of the OIA – the information requested is not held by the department, nor do I have grounds for believing the information is held by another department. Realised capital gains are calculated where possible in the report (for example, pages 68 and 105). Item 3 This part of your request does not constitute a request for official information under the OIA, rather it is a request for advice. Official information is any information held by an agency subject to the OIA. This includes: • Documents, reports, memoranda, letters, emails and drafts • Non-written information, such as video or tape recordings • The reasons for any decisions that have been made about you • Manuals that set out internal rules, principles, policies or guidelines for decision-making • Agendas and minutes of meetings, including those not open to the public Responding to this part of your request would require Inland Revenue to engage in debate or t o create justifications or explanations. The OIA does not require agencies such as Inland Revenue to do that (see the Ombudsman’s website). 1 Right of review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz . Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision.

24OIA1836 Page 1 of 3 13 March 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 19 February 2024. You requested the following: 1) Tax Revenue by source (Income Tax, GST etc) for the past five years 2) Corporate Tax by Significant Enterprises for the past five years 3) Corporate Tax by Significant Enterprises – Foreign and Multinational totals for the past five years 4) Significant Enterprises, foreign and multinational – does this include the big four Australian-owned banks? 5) Has the government documented justification for voting against the UN Tax Framework Convention? Item 1 The information you have requested is publicly available and can be found on the Treasury website (treasury.govt.nz) by searching for “tax outturn data”, selecting the most recent publication and then selecting the “monthly history” document. As such, this part of your request is refused under section 18(d) of the OIA – the information requested is publicly available. Items 2, 3, and 4 For the purpose of responding to your questions on corporate tax by Significant Enterprises, I have defined ‘Significant Enterprises’ as any taxpayer that is managed by the Significant Enterprises (SE) segment in Inland Revenue’s Customer and Compliance Services – Business (CCS-B) group. The CCS-B group provides certainty and accuracy around complex and global tax compliance arrangements for a range of customers. T axpayers with a turnover over greater than $30 million or with 50 or more employees are managed by the SE segment within CCS-B . I have also included a small number of taxpayers who appear to have met the SE turnover or employee criteria in the 2021-22 income year but who are not currently included in the SE segment. I have assumed that by corporate tax you mean corporate income tax. I have limited the results to show the residual income tax (RIT) of SE taxpayers who have filed an IR4 (company), IR44 24OIA1836 Page 2 of 3 (superannuation fund), or IR8 (Māori Authority) income tax return. The five years shown in the following table reflects income tax returns filed by these taxpayers from 2017-18 to 2021-22. Taxpayers with an agent and extension of time are not required to file their tax returns for the 2022-23 income year until 31 March 2024 and information for this year is incomplete and may be misleading. This data was extracted from Inland Revenue systems on 7 March 2024. The table also reports the residual income tax for taxpayers within this population who are identified as foreign-owned multinationals. We have defined multinationals as being foreign owned corporates. This column is a subset of the total column (labelled “Residual Income Tax of corporate Significant Enterprises($m)”) and includes the big-four Australian-owned banks. This data was extracted from Inland Revenue systems on 7 March 2024. Year ending 31 March Residual income tax of corporate foreign-owned multinationals SE ($m) Residual Income Tax of corporate Significant Enterprises ($m) 2018 4,292.6 8,809.4 2019 4,304.2 9,328.4 2020 4,232.6 9,089.3 2021 4,422.1 12,376.5 2022 5,237.1 11,510.8 Table 1: Residual Income Tax of Companies, Superannuation Funds, and Māori Authorities managed within the SE segment of CCS-B. Item 5 On 23 November 2023, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Inland Revenue officials drafted the following material which explains New Zealand’s vote on the UN Tax Framework Convention: “New Zealand supports the need for international cooperation to ensure fair and effective taxation. We acknowledge the concerns that have been expressed in the UN process regarding existing tax cooperation mechanisms and support the goal of ensuring the effective participation of all countries in the development of international tax policy standards. However, we consider that the UN resolution to develop a framework tax convention is focused on developing a binding legal arrangement without first assessing the gaps in the current system. Much progress has been achieved in recent years in the initiatives led by the OECD. The successes of the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes and the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting represent the results of countries working together for mutual benefit. 24OIA1836 Page 3 of 3 We believe that any identified gaps should be addressed by building on and leveraging existing arrangements. We are concerned that the proposed UN resolution could undermine the effectiveness of existing arrangements by creating duplication, inconsistency and fragmentation, with an associated strain on limited resources. We encourage the UN and the OECD to better coordinate their efforts to make the best use of their respective expertise and maximize the impact of their actions.” Right of review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz .

24OIA1802 Page 1 of 2 14 March 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 16 February 2023. You requested: Can you please legally define personal income. Section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA), Definitions, defines a person’s income as: Income, for a person, means income of the person under section BD 1(1) (Income, exempt income, excluded income, non-residents’ foreign-sourced income, and assessable income). Section BD 1(1) of the ITA, Amounts of income, states: An amount is income of a person if it is their income under a provision in Part C (Income). Part CA 1 of the ITA, Amounts that are income, states: An amount is income of a person if it is their income under a provision in this Part. An amount is also income of a person if it is their income under ordinary concepts. In addition, the Courts have identified the characteristics of income: • Income is something that comes in, in money or in money’s worth. Income comes in as a return for something, whether it be services rendered, money advanced, premises rented out etc. • Another feature of income is that it often imports the notion of periodicity, recurrence or regularity. Having said that, the Courts have shown that it does not necessarily follow that all receipts of a regular nature constitute income, nor does it necessarily follow that a one-off receipt is excluded from being income. • A further characteristic of income is the quality of the particular receipt in the hands of the recipient. For example, if the recipient relies on the receipt for support and sustenance, it is likely to be income. 24OIA1802 Page 1 of 2 14 March 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 16 February 2023. You requested: 1) Can you please supply the legislation stating people must have a tax file number. 2) Can a natural person cancel or return their Tax number? Item 1 Tax file numbers (also called IRD numbers) are unique identifiers that allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to identify information about specific customers or customers generally efficiently and accurately. The Commissioner uses tax file / IRD numbers to help ensure that his obligations under sections 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) are carried out, which include the care and management of the Revenue Acts. Section 3 of the TAA defines a “tax file number” as : An identification number that the Commissioner allocates to a person. Tax file / IRD numbers are used to: • ensure that each person is assessed and pays the correct amount of tax • ensure confidentiality of information • complete certain forms required by Inland Revenue • efficiently handle phone calls and enable callers to use automated telephone systems, and • avoid a person being taxed at a higher, non-declaration rate. The Commissioner requires the use of IRD / tax file numbers to ensure that each person is assessed with and pays the correct amount of tax, as required by the law. All New Zealand residents who earn taxable income need an IRD number to complete an income tax return, or any other form required by the TAA. Schedule 3 of the TAA, Record-keeping requirements, sets out a list of information that employers and PAYE intermediaries are required to keep. The list includes the name and tax file number of every person who derives or receives PAYE income payments. Under section 80KB of the TAA, a person applying for Working for Families Tax Credits in respect of a child must provide the child’s IRD number. 24OIA1802 Page 1 of 2 14 March 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 16 February 2023. You requested: If we are required to file a tax return at all, it must be published in the Government Gazette. 1) Could you please supply the volume date and a page number that this public obligation exists in the public and that the public have been given notice in the Gazette. 2) Can you please legally define “person”. Item 1 A notice in the New Zealand Gazette is not required by legislation for obligations to have effect under tax law. Successive New Zealand Parliaments have been validly held and have passed valid legislation, including the various Inland Revenue Acts. Inland Revenue was originally established through the enactment of the Inland Revenue Department Act 1952 and is now constituted by section 5 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). The general legislative authority for imposing and collecting taxes lies in the various Inland Revenue Acts, which are listed in the Schedule to the TAA. More specifically, Part B of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides for the imposition of tax on income, and Part R provides for payment of tax by customers on their own behalf and by way of source deductions. Section 8 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 provides for the charging of GST on goods or services supplied in the course of carrying on a taxable activity. As tax obligations are imposed by statute, persons cannot opt out of them, and tax obligations remain obligations whether people comply with them voluntarily or not. This position is supported by the Court of Appeal decision in Shaw v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1999\] 3 NZLR 154. The appellant in the case argued that particular tax legislation was invalid. The Court dismissed the appeal.

24OIA1872 Page 1 of 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 19 March 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 27 February 2024. You requested the following: I'm doing some research on income distributions between New Zealand males and females, and I'm having some trouble finding the relevant data. The link below provides a dataset that shows the income distribution for all NZ'ers but I'm hoping you can provide a more detailed version showing the difference between males and females. https://www.ird.govt.nz/about-us/tax-statistics/revenue-refunds/income- distribution/tax-on-taxable-income-datasets Information being released The attached spreadsheet provides the information requested in the same format used for the data on the Inland Revenue website referenced in your request. The tables in the spreadsheet display the (rounded) number of people, total taxable income, and total tax on taxable income by income bands and split by inferred gender. As you have not specified which years you are requesting, data is provided for the latest available five years, i.e. years ended 31 March 2018 to 31 March 2022 inclusive. Income data for the year ended 31 March 2023 is not yet available, with income tax returns still arriving. The income bands displayed are consistent with the tables on the website, displayed in bands of taxable income up to $300,000. Taxpayers with nil taxable income generally have brought- forward, or current-year losses. The $0.01-$100 category from 2018-19 onwards helps with interpretation of a structural break in the data where a greater number of taxpayers received automatic square-ups for tax on small amounts of investment income. Gender is not specifically collected by Inland Revenue. For the purposes of this request, we have used titles to infer gender as follows: • Male – Mr, Master, Lord, Reverend Father and Sir. • Female – Miss, Mrs, Ms, Lady, Reverend Mother, Sister and Dame. • For all other titles (e.g. Captain, Colonel, Doctor, Hon, Judge, Major, Mx, Professor, Reverend), including where the title is not held, gender is classed as ‘unknown.’ Year ended 31 March 2018 Taxable Income bands to $300,000 nil 61,800 -

24OIA1840 Page 1 of 3 19 March 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 21 February 2024. The information you requested is outlined in Appendix A. Question one The decision document you requested relating to the Information & Intelligence Services change is enclosed as Appendix B. Question two Your request for the impact table before the October 2020 Corporate & Enabling Service restructure occurred is refused under section 18(e) of the OIA as the information does not exist. Inland Revenue did not compare old and new organisation charts to communicate changes. The structure chart documentation produced at the time of final decisions being made is the confirmed new structure information contained in Appendix C. Question three Inland Revenue’s employment construct for Deputy Commissioners provides for changes in portfolio without requiring a formal change process. The reference made to ‘disestablishment’ and ‘establishment’ of these roles in Inland Revenue’s 2022 Annual Report relates to the portfolio, rather than the role of Deputy Commissioner. Your request for the consultation and decision documents for this change is refused under section 18(e) of the OIA as the information does not exist. This change was managed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue directly with the relevant Deputy Commissioners. No consultation or decision documents were produced for this process. While four portfolios were disestablished, only two of these roles were held by permanent employees. The four portfolios disestablished were – Chief Technology Officer (permanently filled); Chief People Officer (temporarily filled); Chief Financial Officer (temporarily filled); Deputy Commissioner Corporate Integrity & Assurance (permanently filled). Question four The consultation and decision documents relating to changes to the Policy and Strategy business unit in 2019 is enclosed as Appendix D. Some information has been removed from this document, on the OIA grounds described in the document. This process replaced the Policy and Strategy function with Policy and Regulatory Stewardship and the Deputy Commissioner portfolio was replaced accordingly to lead this business unit. 1 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Corporate and Enabling Services structure charts These are the structure charts for the Corporate and Enabling Services change, in list format.

take pride in their work. It is regarded as a strong and well performing policy group and, like the policy profession more broadly, we need to maintain that reputation in a changing world, now and into the future. We need to develop and hone some important policy capabilities and different ways of working to ensure that Inland Revenue continues to be the Government’s trusted advisor and deliver high quality advice. We have talked about this work as the ‘future operating model’. We have already started the journey by beginning to implement some of the changes outlined in this document. We’ve identified key shifts that will make the difference we need and our progress in these areas is showing us we’re on the right track. The three key shifts we are driving are: 1. Outcomes focused policy development Our advice achieves the results intended because we have worked up solutions right from the start with those who need to implement them and who will be affected by them 2. Being responsive today and shaping tomorrow We take account of the future and ensure that the tax and social policy systems we advise on continue to be fit for purpose 3. More broadly influencing the social and economic agenda We improve the overall outcomes across government by supporting the Government’s broader economic and social objectives There is no single silver bullet to achieve these key shifts. In some cases, this is about how we work, the way we prioritise, engage, ensure consistent quality, grow and develop our skills, and even our broader culture and behaviours. In some cases, it’s about how our roles and structures are designed and how we’ve put together our teams and focus areas. In the main we will achieve these shifts through some key enablers which are to prioritise and manage our workflows well, engage effectively at the right stages with the right people, develop some core capabilities across all of our people, and to ensure that our behaviours (and therefore culture) support these shifts. It is proposed to move to capability-based role descriptions and design the group following the principles determined through the first stage of Inland Revenue’s organisational design. The alignment to the rest of IR is important so using the capability-based role description model to update the roles in Policy is the right move, as well as giving opportunities to leverage the development offerings on the organisation-wide capabilities we want to grow. There are some structural changes proposed, designed to ensure the policy shop operates efficiently and make best use of our strengths, talents and teams. These include: • Bigger and more flexible teams, that can adapt as demands change. • Some new roles created which recognise we need to be at the top of our game in terms of strategic technical and intellectual leadership. 4 IN CONFIDENCE • Some roles disestablished as we move to a model which is more integrated with the rest of the organisation and fit for purpose now and in the future. Our aim is to ensure that our policy capability is as strong, if not stronger, in 10 years’ time as it is today, which will be achieved by growing the talents of our people. We want to create opportunities for you to build your institutional knowledge, but also to grow your leadership and broader capabilities. It is great to see people being challenged with leadership opportunities when they arise on key projects or supporting teams and growing as a result. We will continue to build on this as we go forward. This shows we can grow our future leaders regardless of the structure we proceed with. Please give us all your feedback on what is proposed. We need it to make sure that our final decision is right – what will work, what won’t work and where could it be better. We will need time to consider your feedback and then to confirm a final approach with ELT and will share the decisions with you as soon as she can. A fundamental requirement to ensuring success with this process is that it has been led and developed by people in PAS. This is part of the 7 implementation principles developed following feedback on what we could improve on from Phase One. Leader-led, designed with people experience front of mind, implemented at the right pace for each group as determined by them, and multi-staged to achieve the right outcomes at the right times. They all have an influence on how each part of our organisation in the future operating model streams find the right way for their people to head towards the outcome we’re all aiming for – an organisation that is intelligence-led, customer-centric and agile. You’ll see differences to what has gone before in almost every aspect, from timing and phases through to some of the specific changes proposed, but we hope you’ll also see the key themes of our transformation and the design principles of our new organisation coming through loud and clear. We have appreciated the input many people have provided to date whether it was at open homes or in working on the contents of the change proposal. Again, thank you for taking the time to be part of this. Cath and Mark Cath Atkins, Deputy Commissioner Policy & Strategy, and Mark Daldorf, Deputy Commissioner People and Culture and Chair of the Organisation Development Committee (ODC). How we’ve structured this proposal We’ve split the proposal into 3 parts so that it’s easier to find the information you’re looking for. We recognise you may want to skip ahead to the impacts, proposed structure and specific roles so we’ve made these easy to locate. It’s important that you read carefully through Part A as well to understand the background, context and key shifts we are aiming to achieve with the changes we are proposing and consulting on. Please take the time to read, ask questions and consider the information in Part A before giving feedback as it may answer many of your questions or explain why we proposed going down a particular path. 5 IN CONFIDENCE The three parts in this consultation pack are: Part A – Background, context and the key shifts we are working towards. Overview of the enablers of change and work to date in these areas. Further detail on the way we’ll work in future and how this differs from today, as well as what carries on. Part B - Overview of the proposal for our future operating model, and detail on what this would mean for our structure, teams and roles. Part C - Impact of the proposed change and change process, including expressions of interest. Extra information on proposed new roles and the analysis for current jobs and proposed future roles is available on the Policy Future Operating Model intranet page. Understanding Consultation Why we are consulting We have shared our design thinking around how we will be organised in the future, and about the different ways we will need to work to support our future operating model. Many of our people have been involved in helping shape the work, particularly through the enabler workstreams. Everyone has contributed in some way to shaping our prioritisation and quality practices, provided feedback on engagement, or given their thoughts on role descriptions or capability development. While we have a proposed design and proposed transition process and our enabler workstreams are already underway and making great progress, we have not made any final decisions about our future operating model structure, roles and teams. Consultation provides an opportunity to contribute your ideas, views and perspectives enhancing our decision-making process. We will not make any final decisions until we have collected and considered your feedback. What we are consulting on We are seeking your feedback on: 1. The proposed design and structure of the Policy group. 2. The proposed capability-based roles that will exist in the future Policy team. 3. The proposed transition process that would be used to move from our current state to our proposed future state. Put simply, we are consulting on the proposals contained in Parts B, C and the associated details including new role descriptions. Part A provides the background, context and work to date on our enablers and ways of working which we are already underway and making progress with. You can share your thoughts on any aspect of the proposal including the enabler workstreams, ways of working, key shifts and opportunities for change as these have had influence on our proposed changes to structure and roles. We welcome any feedback you 7 IN CONFIDENCE Where can I get more information? Electronic copies of information that is related to the consultation process are also available here including this consultation document and the PowerPoint presentation from the proposal announcement. You can also: • Check the regularly updated questions and answers on the Policy FOM intranet page • Attend the drop-in discussions • Speak to your leader • Contact your union • Ask a question via the Policy Future Operating Model email address policyFOM@ird.govt.nz We will endeavour to respond to your question within 48 hours so you can participate fully in the consultation process. Supporting you through change As you read through this document and consider what the changes and the proposal might mean for you, remember there is support available. Change can sometimes be unsettling no matter who you are, and especially if you are directly impacted by change. It’s important to take care of yourself through the process. Talk to people, discuss what is being proposed, and get support that is right for you, whether that’s from your leader, work colleagues, family or friends. You can also access a range of free support such as: Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) provides a free, confidential and independent service.

It’s constantly updated and easy to use. Find it under “quick links” on the IR homepage. If you’re a union member, your union is also available to provide support and advice during the change process. 9 IN CONFIDENCE Policy is one of these streams The capabilities in the Policy stream enable IR to provide advice to government on the tax revenue and transfer systems and develop policy for how these can be used to support economic and social wellbeing for current and future generations. We have thought about what the future looks like for Policy and how it will feel different for us and those we work with. Some of this is enhancing what we already do well, some is about consistency, some a different approach or outcome focus, and all of it centres around our people. Scope The Policy stream is different to PAS. The Future Operating Model Policy stream solely focuses on the Policy part of PAS as the Strategy part is covered by another stream. While this means the consultation and information in this proposal is primarily for those within the scope of the stream, we also welcome feedback from those who work closely with our Policy people which includes the Strategy team. As you’ll see in the next section about our Key Shifts, the way we work together with others is a major focus of this work. The Key Shifts We engaged with a large range of stakeholders both internal and external to consider how we could improve our focus. While very positive about PAS they identified several ways we could make a bigger contribution. Many stakeholders talked about the pace of change and the increasingly complex world we are operating in due to advances in technology, the ways of doing business, and the way people live their lives. They talked about us needing to ensure that a wider range of voices were heard in the policy making process. They told us solutions that might have worked theoretically in the past may no longer be fit for purpose in a complex and fast changing world. They felt we need to engage more, and earlier in the policy process, with customers and users to ensure policy would work in the real world. They also felt that we could be clearer about why we pick the things we do to work on. Some of these concerns were echoed within PAS. It was felt that we can sometimes start developing solutions before being clear about the problem and that this can lead to a more complex solution than was necessary. Another concern is that often once consultation had begun it was very challenging and difficult to significantly revisit options and solutions already identified. Someone likened it to being on a waterfall and trying to swim back up. This can mean that sometimes our policy solutions may not accomplish the optimal balance between achieving what was intended and being practical to implement. They encouraged us to think beyond just the legislation as the lever to influence behaviour. The consequences of legislating for every possible behavioural response and circumstance has sometimes led to complexity and uncertainty in the legislation. 11 IN CONFIDENCE We lift our view up and out to focus on what matters for economic and social wellbeing We are focused on the sustainability of advice we provide for today’s issues, while maintaining awareness of future opportunities and challenges. This includes influencing across the economic and social agenda, recognising Inland Revenue’s role as part of the wider public service. We are key partners in supporting the government’s economic and social policy agenda. Prioritisation is undertaken with a focus on what matters most for the outcomes that we are trying to achieve, including consideration for future needs. Decisions and priorities are visible to Inland Revenue and our stakeholders and we regularly reassess to ensure the work remains appropriately prioritised. Being responsive today and shaping tomorrow We regularly review the parts of the tax and social policy system most in need to ensure that policy intent is achieved. Furthermore, we apply ourselves and prepare for the large strategic issues that either have not been solved before or that are expected to emerge in the future. Enabling the Key Shifts Enablers are key to facilitating and achieving the shifts Although an essential part of our future operating model, changes to roles and structure alone will not achieve the key shifts. The structural change only supports what we need to change in the way we work – our enabler streams. We have discussed, workshopped and tested with a wide range of people (policy, PAS, IR and stakeholders) what the key things are that we need to do differently. We are calling the areas we’ve identified that require change for us to achieve the key shifts our Enablers. The Enablers we have prioritised to support the three key shifts are: • Effective engagement • Clear prioritisation, assurance of quality and resource allocation • Capability uplift including leadership • An enabling culture These enablers are interdependent. It will be through these enablers working in alignment that we will drive changes to our processes, capability and behaviour that will become noticeable to policy staff, colleagues and stakeholders. The enablers have been led by the following teams: • Engagement – Mike Nutsford • Prioritisation and Quality – Carolyn Elliott and Maraina Hak • Capability uplift – Chris Gillion, Anna Pearson and Cory Smith • Culture – Eddie Edmonds and David Carrigan (with support from Nigel Mehta- Wilson and Anna Pearson) 12 IN CONFIDENCE This next section covers the work to date in each of these enabler streams, all of which have influenced, informed or supported the proposed changes to roles and structure and provide important context for the proposal overall. Effective engagement Effective engagement will require: • Greater integration and networking with other parts of IR, other agencies, stakeholders and customers • seeking stakeholder perspectives at all stages in the policy development process • greater diversity and inclusion in the policy process, through involvement of other areas and applying differing 'lenses' to a common problem/issue/opportunity • improved understanding of decision rights • new skills and capabilities It is essential that we consider, initiate and maintain relationships with key stakeholders and regularly engage with them alongside the policy development process. This is where we’ll have the most influence on achieving the key shifts of being responsive today and shaping tomorrow as well as more broadly influencing the social and economic agenda. To achieve outcomes focused policy development, all products developed from our policy advice should lead towards achieving the policy intent, including legislation, communications, IT system rules, operational processes and customer actions. Ways of working that will embed this shift include: • A networked approach: policy is developed with others from the outset, rather than in isolation – ensuring various perspectives inform and are given due consideration in development of the problem definition, advice, design and implementation, and legislative drafting. • Participation and co-design: engaging earlier and more often with different customers and stakeholders in different ways – a tailored approach rather than a standard approach which ensures involvement of diverse perspectives and opinions and testing of our assumptions at the right time. • A systemic, integrated, iterative change process: working with change teams and external providers (e.g. software providers) early and iteratively to access the benefits of technological change to deliver better solutions. This could include more experimental approaches, and trialling change with fast feedback loops to then develop wider solutions. • More evidence-based policy: use of more qualitative evidence from customer insights to help identify areas where more research/analytics are needed, undertake post-implementation review/evaluation, and more constant monitoring of products. We need to involve the right people at the right time in the right way with the right information – a tangible example of the benefits of being intelligence-led, customer-centric and agile! The appropriate extent and intensity of engagement will vary from project to project and it is unlikely this can be prescribed. For each project we undertake we need to think 16 IN CONFIDENCE Things we can improve: Data and information (intelligence-led) Policy will continuously improve our intelligence capability in the future operating model. Business Transformation provides an opportunity to enhance and obtain more useful information for the Commissioner’s assessment, assurance and stewardship functions. This is a key component of Inland Revenue’s intelligence strategy. Policy will work across Inland Revenue to improve the information collected for our stewardship role. Policy will also contribute to, and benefit from, wider intelligence initiatives, within Inland Revenue, across agencies and internationally. We will increasingly combine qualitative and quantitative information to: • Help with the early identification of areas for policy improvement; • Inform post-implementation evaluation of new legislation; • Prioritise items not yet on the tax policy work programme and • Contribute to our wider stewardship role across government. Legislative drafting We have received feedback that our legislative drafting may not always follow ‘re-write’ and/or plain language principles and can therefore sometimes be difficult to follow and suffer from an internal inconsistency of style. Feedback we received said that we are sometimes more prescriptive than necessary. Where this happens the reasons will vary, but can include: • insufficient drafting (and policy) time available to produce a quality product and complete all the necessary quality review processes (including, where appropriate, external consultation on draft wording for legislation); • inconsistent adherence to re-write principles; • inherent complexities in the policies being drafted; • lack of early and meaningful engagement in the policy process with those who need to apply the legislation (in order to ensure that the end output will achieve agreed and intended policy outcomes); • wanting to ensure every possible scenario is covered in the legislation and • not having drafters involved early enough in the policy development process, where it is appropriate to do so. In reaction to this we intend to apply the engagement guidelines for policy to the drafting process to ensure that stakeholder views are elicited early and can guide, where appropriate, the drafting of legislation. We are seeking a third-party assessment to confirm (or otherwise) the continued appropriateness of the drafting ‘re-write’ principles. Against an agreed framework, we then assess the appropriateness and effectiveness of our drafting by undertaking a quality review (similar to that which we currently undertake for policy projects). This review will help us to determine where we are achieving our drafting goals, and where we need to focus more in developing our policy and drafting processes and outputs. 17 IN CONFIDENCE We will continue to ensure that there is sufficient time and drafting capacity to both draft legislation and, crucially, undertake effective peer review. For larger policy changes, where appropriate, we will plan for a more structured iterative drafting process and look for more external opportunities to test the drafting output wherever time permits. Those accountable for developing the policy advice to the point of Ministerial endorsement will be responsible for ensuring that the legislative output delivers on the policy intent, although the accountability for the final form of the draft legislation will rest with the drafting team. Editing and communications It is proposed that: • A simple statement of editing, peer review, accountabilities and expectations be produced which should clarify who is to edit and what can be expected from that. This will not change the primary accountability of the proposed Policy Lead to ensure that the outputs from their team are fit for purpose. • Leaders need to find ways of providing feedback to editors to ensure continuous improvement of the quality of editing especially in terms of the uptake of technical knowledge that will improve the value from edits over time. • There is clearer demarcation of accountability for information that is released on the website. This would result in for example the support team, comms team and policy team accountabilities being clear about who is to do what and who can make decisions about when something is ready to upload or whether timelines can be extended. Guidance on the policy process • We need up to date reference material and guidance on the policy process including how to engage with Ministers or select committees. This will be enhanced by reintroducing the FEC Ministerial training course, and a lateral hire induction programme. Quality assurance To increase consistency across teams it is proposed that: • Clear accountabilities are established for roles at each stage of the policy process including peer review. • Peer review guidance sets expectations for what should be peer reviewed and what this entails. Capability uplift including leadership Supporting Policy Careers Our key shifts will establish and maintain our reputation as one of the best policy shops in New Zealand. One of the unique challenges of Policy at IR is that our people not only need to develop the policy craft, but also build up technical knowledge of the complex tax and social welfare systems and how they work. The way we look after and develop our people is critical to achieving the reputation of being one of the best policy shops in NZ and should benefit those who work with us now and in the future. 18 IN CONFIDENCE Our People’s Capabilities We will need new and improved capabilities across the group to engage effectively, prioritise well and influence broadly with a view to ensuring we develop policy that is fit for purpose in the future as well as now. We are building on IR’s people capabilities and have adopted the DPMC policy project’s skills framework to tailor our capability approach to the specialisation of the Policy Group. This melding of frameworks allows Policy to align how we grow and recognise capability within IR and draw on development offerings from across IR while remaining relevant to the wider public sector. This will ensure we build the capabilities we need to work in IR while also building policy skills more broadly. The emphasis for this enabler stream of work is to uplift capabilities at a team and group- wide basis, whereas the shift to capability-based role descriptions helps us to identify the areas where we may need to develop as individuals to achieve the outcomes we are aiming for. More information about the capability-based roles we are proposing can be found in Parts B, C & the supporting documents on the policy intranet page. The increasing recognition and use of the DPMC policy skills framework across the New Zealand public sector reflects the relevance of the capabilities and skills expressed by that work for policy practitioners and a modern policy group. Using the IR people capabilities, the DPMC policy skills framework and the DPMC policy capability maturity matrix, as well as drawing on the experience of our practitioners, the following capabilities were identified as priorities to address across the group: Leadership and Change Management Our leaders are role models and need to demonstrate the behaviours we expect of our people. Leaders need a strong focus on coaching and developing others to ensure our people are supported and empowered to do their best work and develop their careers. Effective leadership will be needed to: • Achieve and maintain a culture which encourages innovation, manages risk, and expects quality outputs • have quality coaching conversations with individuals which support and encourage our people to grow their capabilities and contributions • support and encourage our people to achieve quality outcomes and to innovate in their work • role model our desired culture and behaviours Some of the leadership development we will explore includes: • Diversity and Inclusion - how to be mindful allowing others to have their say and being open to differing perspectives • Leadership and development of people as well as leadership of strategic projects and thinking • Managing Change – how to participate in, shepherd, and embrace change with dignity and respect (Change Management) • Leading and coaching for success and for capability development 19 IN CONFIDENCE Policy Quality & Agility We need to learn and embed design thinking – the process of forming policy solutions with a system mindset that anticipates the future. Customer Advisory and Business Acumen This may include an uplift in: • Project Management – how to run a process to time • Political and Parliamentary Engagement – how to address and respond in FEC and with Ministers (engagement training) • How to write for the audience • Engagement and Consultation – how to facilitate and draw out perspectives and interests while negotiating and managing expectations (this should include establishing good working relationships and will naturally support ‘business acumen and partnering’) • Te Reo (language) and Tikanga Maori (protocols) – the essential skills to participate in engagement sensitively and appropriately Digital Literacy • Technology – making the most out of our infrastructure We will deliver enhanced capabilities through a prioritised learning and development programme based around these priority areas. Policy as part of an Inland Revenue Ecosystem The proposed changes we are consulting on reflect a decision to focus our policy expertise and capability uplift on policy specific areas rather than to duplicate capability that is strong in other parts of Inland Revenue. Policy capability is inherently dependent on outputs from other parts of our organisation such as strong and sustainable infrastructure and systems including information management, intelligence and website hosting. It is more efficient and effective to draw on the wider organisations’ expertise and capacity rather than replicating infrastructure and processes that require specialist but not policy expertise. This principle is also applied to the proposed policy operating model. For example, rather than having our own web hosting arrangements we will access the service provided by IT&C, or rather than initiating our own information collection we will draw on II&S to collect the information we need. This means our policy resources can be focused on the policy work for which we have the strongest capability. 20 IN CONFIDENCE An enabling culture Achieving the shifts will mean that we need to develop a culture which values: • Being open and responsive to the contributions of others through effective engagement and, • prioritising what we work on and the quality of our outputs To achieve our key shifts, we’ll need to make changes in behaviour, capability, and processes and the convergence of these is where we’ll see tangible improvements in our openness and quality, supporting the success of our other enablers and making the progress we need. To be open and curious to engage with others effectively we need to establish and reinforce a culture where we: • Are comfortable and secure in not having all the answers ourselves • See the value in ‘enabling’ the development of robust solutions, and believe that this is a valued behaviour • Appreciate the value of diverse ideas and thinking in producing a better outcome • Don’t equate engaging others in the process with a loss of ownership • Feel it is a valuable use of time to contribute to work led by others We also identified that any sustained change would only come by ensuring: • Leaders set expectations, and model actions • Acknowledgement and rewards for good engagement practices • Processes that are clear and documented such as the engagement ‘cook book’ and process guidelines • Building facilitation capabilities, and meeting protocols • Increased capability in Tikanga Maori (Protocols) and Te Reo. How it all comes together The enabler workstreams are well underway and are making progress towards our key shifts. We also need to consider how our structure, teams and roles support the future direction we are heading in, and what this means for our people. The next section (Part B) takes you through the detail of the proposed structure, teams and roles, then Part C provides more detail on the impacts. Individual role descriptions are available on the PAS intranet page. 21 IN CONFIDENCE PART B: Policy’s organising model and structure We developed a proposed organising model to deliver our key shifts and support us to realise the benefits from the Enabler workstreams. We are now proposing a structure that will give effect to that model. New larger flexible teams Our current structure is based around a team structure that was developed for historical reasons and has remained fairly constant over time. While there are advantages in the stability of teams and ensuring we maintain capability and expertise in key areas, fixed teams can make it more difficult to adjust resources to easily adapt to the priorities as they change. This is key to achieving Inland Revenue’s aim to become an agile organisation, working at pace, pulling together the right people to make good decisions quickly and focusing on the things that matter most. Our proposed model for Policy is based on Domain Teams. Domains are designed to align products and customer types where possible, and to achieve a roughly even distribution of people while recognising and responding to different demands. Greater team size will reduce silos and create opportunities for our senior advisors/analysts to grow their leadership skills, as they will be required to support leaders run the business in leading projects and policy work. Domains could be reallocated across teams (if required) to follow shifting emphasis over time. This would be considered following planning and prioritisation of the work programme. The table below shows you the five domains we are proposing to organise teams around in the first instance of the Future Operating Model, which could change over time. Alongside these domains are two functional teams – Economics & Stewardship, and Legislative drafting. The five domain teams and Legislative drafting will be led by a Policy Lead. The Economics & Stewardship team will be led by the Chief Economist. Two teams are in essence focused on ensuring the sustainability of the Income Tax Base – one with an international focus and the other addressing taxation issues concerning businesses and other entities key to the tax base. 24 IN CONFIDENCE Policy Director / Policy Lead Achieving the shifts necessary for Policy will require dedicated and skilled leadership in the form of proposed new Policy Director and Policy Lead roles, which alongside the Deputy Commissioner set the strategic vision while coaching and supporting the people they lead. The proposed new Policy Director roles have a broad leadership responsibility across the group as well as being responsible for the portfolios allocated to the teams they oversee, and any other strategic portfolios allocated by the Deputy Commissioner. These portfolios will change from time to time as priorities and work pressures change. The domain teams within each Policy Director’s portfolio will be determined by a combination of factors such as: • Aligning teams likely to have a lot of interdependency • Sharing the focus on high priority and strategic/conceptual and system maintenance • Balancing workload The proposed domain teams will be led by a Policy Lead. It is proposed there are 6 Policy Leads. One of those will lead the Legislative Drafting Team. We are proposing that each Policy team will have on average 10 people. This is an increase from the existing average of about 7 people and will necessitate a shift from the current Policy Manager towards greater emphasis on leading the team over leading policy development. Chief Economist and the Economics and Stewardship team The proposed Economics and Stewardship team would be led by a Chief Economist. It is proposed that this Leader will be appointed based on their economics specialisation. It is proposed that the Chief Economist will have a reporting line change from the Deputy Commissioner to a Policy Director, as this allows for greater alignment between the work of the Chief Economist and that led by the Policy Director. The Chief Economist role is included in the Policy Lead role description, due to the similarities in requirements of people, team and domain leadership, while still recognising the importance of the economics specialism. The team will build up the Policy group knowledge and understanding of the likely economic impacts and distributional effects of tax and social policy changes, work on policy issues with major economic impacts and be a resource to support the five domain teams. An additional focus for the team is on leadership of strategic policy/policy stewardship. This will include leading Inland Revenue’s regulatory stewardship and forming the strategic guidance for planning the tax policy work programme. A more system-based approach to identifying priorities and future stewardship focus will be developed. This team will also need to work closely with the strategy team. New networked ways of working in recent years has increased the flow of information on policy problems being identified and passed on to the right teams in Policy. Examples include the introduction of the Right from the Start Committee, Customer Centric Committee, the Technical Governance Committee, the customer segment strategies, and various other groups. Policy intelligence is becoming a critical part of every team’s role. 25 IN CONFIDENCE This has reduced the need for Policy to have a dedicated role to liaise with other parts of Inland Revenue to identify policy intelligence concerns. Strategic Policy Advisors The proposed new Strategic Policy Advisor positions provide a unique opportunity for highly capable leaders to influence in a specific domain or strategic area by applying a greater focus than is possible when leading a team. To achieve the key shifts we need to have the capacity to provide strong technical and intellectual leadership and retain our reputation domestically and internationally with key stakeholders. With bigger teams and more focus from Policy Leads on growing and developing their people, it is proposed that reporting to each Policy Director is a Strategic Policy Advisor. These Strategic Policy Advisors will provide additional intellectual leadership and build strategic policy capability in the group, and within IR. They will play a critical role in supporting our focus on the future of the tax system and our contribution to the Government’s economic and social agenda and joining the dots. They will be recognised both nationally and internationally for their technical expertise and strategic influence. These roles are essential for our increased stewardship capability and will provide capacity for new product innovation. This could include, for example, leading large cross-cutting projects, working closely with Directors on system level questions, or influencing external thinking on particular issues. A recent example would have been to lead our thinking across the group on the Tax Working Group. Strategic Policy Advisors will be key members of the broader leadership team. Policy Advisors We propose to have a Policy Advisor job family with three levels. The use of job families means that fewer separate role descriptions are needed. Job families make sense when a number of roles are working toward the same outcomes and the more complex roles subsume the capabilities of the less complex roles. The new levels in the Policy Advisor role description equate to existing roles as follows: • Level 1 is equivalent to the existing Policy Analyst • Level 2 is equivalent to the existing Senior Policy Analyst • Level 3 is equivalent to the existing Senior Policy Advisor. Inland Revenue is no longer including “seniority labels” in role descriptions. However, while it is proposed the new role descriptions will no longer formally refer to levels of ‘seniority’ we will continue to use titles that are recognisable for external stakeholders to identify expertise or authority, for example with Ministers/other agencies and for recruitment. The naming convention we propose to use for these roles is: • Policy Advisor (i.e. level 1) • Senior Policy Advisor (i.e. level 2) • Principal Policy Advisor (i.e. level 3) An advantage of the proposed policy advisor job family is that appointments can be made to the role and the level based on business need (affordability and capability requirement) 26 IN CONFIDENCE and candidate quality. For example, rather than a team having 2 Senior Policy Advisors, 4 Senior Policy Analysts and 2 Policy Analysts (as currently), the team might have 8 Policy Advisor roles, where the distribution of Levels 1, 2 and 3 can flex as required for budget and capability needs over time. We recognise we will need to do further work on identifying how this will happen in a more transparent way. The Policy Advisor – Level 2, currently ‘Senior Policy Analyst’ should be seen as a role from which one may develop their career in both the technical and people leadership aspects to varying degrees depending on where you would like to head. For example, aiming towards a Policy Lead role, or Policy Advisor – Level 3 role. The Policy Advisor – Level 3, currently ‘Senior Policy Advisor’ will continue to be a role to aspire to for those wishing to advance their career. Appointments to the Policy Advisor - Level 3 role will be made when exceptional skills and experience are needed to maintain or increase the capability of the Policy Group. Graduates (Assistant Policy Analysts) Graduates will be appointed to the Policy Advisor – Level 1 role and will be paid in a ‘graduate development remuneration range’ which would be an extension of the range for the Policy Advisor – Level 1. After eighteen months a graduate Policy Advisor paid in this ‘graduate development remuneration range’ and who has developed as expected will have their salary adjusted to the bottom of the Policy Advisor – Level 1 remuneration range. This is consistent with the process that we currently apply to graduates employed as assistant policy analysts. Legislative Counsel We propose to have a Legislative Counsel job family with three levels. The use of job families means that fewer separate role descriptions are needed. Job families make sense when a number of roles are working toward the same outcomes and the more complex roles subsume the capabilities of the less complex roles. The new levels in the Legislative Counsel role description equate to existing roles as follows: • Level 1 is equivalent to the existing Assistant Legislative Counsel • Level 2 has no current equivalent job expectation • Level 3 is equivalent to the existing Legislative Counsel. Inland Revenue is no longer including “seniority labels” in role descriptions. There is a question as to whether or not it would be beneficial for the Legislative Counsel job family to include seniority in the titles. One possibility could be to use the following titles with external stakeholders to identify expertise or authority, for example with Parliament/Ministers/other agencies and for recruitment: • Associate Legislative Counsel (i.e. level 1) • Legislative Counsel (i.e. level 2) • Senior Legislative Counsel (i.e. level 3) 27 IN CONFIDENCE Business Support Business support in policy requires different activities to be carried out from business support across the rest of the organisation. However, the capabilities we require for efficient and effective business support reflect the capability needs in other parts of Inland Revenue. On this basis it is proposed that business support roles within Policy use enterprise wide capability-based role descriptions. Traditionally PAS has set up its own support roles, despite these roles sometimes being duplicated elsewhere in the organisation. The new model ensures that where infrastructure or generic support services are provided across IR we will not duplicate these in our policy business support. Many of these functions are provided by, for example, Facilities Management, and will be superseded as people increasingly self-help through the Enterprise Support Service. We also expect that there will be a need to participate in any further thinking about the future of business support across IR given the pending introduction of Enterprise Support Services and our intention to align with the wider organisational direction. Key Partners Communications The work of the Communications team will be impacted by the changes in the way that we work in Policy in the future as this team is essential to supporting effective engagement and producing quality policy products. The Communications team is not included in the organisational changes proposed and an assumption is that the communications team capacity will continue to be available. Forecasting Forecasting is integral to the policy process. This team and their work has not been considered as part of this proposed future operating model. An assumption is that the forecasting team outputs will continue to be available. Strategy This proposal does not address the strategy future operating model. However, it is acknowledged that a strong link exists which is assumed will be maintained to strategic policy and fore-sighting and maintaining cross agency support. Policy design and implementation This proposal does not include changes to the policy design and implementation capability that the policy process is dependent on. It is assumed that this capability will continue to be available to the policy group. The Policy future operating model is intended to be flexible and able to accommodate alternate models for the delivery of the design and implementation functionality. 29 IN CONFIDENCE New enterprise role descriptions developed for this proposal We are consulting on the Role Description, as well as the proposal to implement it in Policy Programme Lead Existing enterprise role descriptions proposed in this proposal We are consulting on the proposal to implement the Role Description in Policy Team Lead – Level 1 Capability & Outcomes Specialist – Level 1 Analyst – Level 2 Business Support – Level 2 Should this proposal proceed it is expected that new Policy Advisors would be recruited into permanent roles. While it is expected that this could be two to three new Policy Advisors, the actual number and level sought for permanent roles may be influenced by appointments made through the transition process. Potential impact on positions within Policy & Strategy The tables below provide detailed information for each current position in the Policy & Strategy team, outlining potential impacts if the proposed changes go ahead. Positions out of scope The following positions are not included in this proposal. Role Title Number of positions Reason Deputy Commissioner 1 This role will be considered when similar roles in other parts of the organisation are designed Personal Assistant to Deputy Commissioner 1 This role will be considered when similar roles in other parts of the organisation are designed Senior Officer Legislative Drafting 1 The wording of this role description needs to be considered alongside other roles that support business delivery across the organisation Strategy Director and teams All The Strategy group function is not included in this proposal. These roles will be considered when other parts of the organisation are designed. Potential impact on positions As mentioned in Part A, we are proposing to move to capability-based role descriptions and align Policy with Inland Revenue’s organisational design. From a technical employment perspective this means that all ‘in scope’ roles are proposed to be disestablished. 30 IN CONFIDENCE Where the proposed role is determined as being the ‘same or similar’ as the current role and there is no change to the number of new roles, the proposed transition is for the person to be confirmed into the new role. Where this is not the case an alternative transition approach is proposed. The table below provides you with further information on the nature of proposed changes for the ‘in scope’ roles. Current Role Current Number of positions What is proposed to change? What would be different if the proposed changes are implemented? What is the proposed transition/selection process to implement the change? Policy Director 2 positions A new Policy Director capability-based role has been developed. Under the new organisational structure, it is proposed that these roles will also have a change in the teams that report to them. The new Policy Director capability-based role description will be implemented, along with a change in direct reports. The new Policy Director capability- based role is considered to be the same or similar as the current Policy Director role. The substantive Policy Directors will be confirmed into the new roles. Chief Economist 1 position A new Policy Lead – Chief Economist capability-based role has been developed. Under the new organisational structure, it is proposed that this role reports into a Policy Director. The new Policy Lead - Chief Economist capability-based role description will be implemented, along with a change in reporting line. There is no substantive position holder. Substantive Policy Managers will be eligible to express an interest in this role via an Expression of Interest process. If no suitable candidate is identified, we will advertise this role externally. Policy Manager 8 positions A new Policy Lead capability-based role has been developed. Introduction of 5 Domain teams, and 2 functional teams. This results in a reduction in the number of lead roles. 6 Policy Leads and 1 Policy Lead – Chief Economist. The new Policy Lead capability- based role description will be implemented. There will be a Policy Lead for each of the domain and functional teams. Substantive Policy Managers will be eligible to express an interest in the Policy Lead roles via an Expression of Interest process. Substantive Policy Managers will also have the opportunity to express interest in the new Strategic Policy Advisor roles. 31 IN CONFIDENCE PAS Programme Manager 1 position A new Programme Lead capability-based role has been developed. The new Programme Lead capability-based role description will be implemented. The new Programme Lead capability-based role is considered to be the same or similar as the current PAS Programme Manager. The substantive PAS Programme Manager will be confirmed into the new role. Team Leader – Business Support 1 position The existing enterprise Team Lead Level 1 capability-based role is considered appropriate for Policy. This role description includes an increased workforce management capability requirement, which is reflected in a change in remuneration. The enterprise Team Lead Level 1 capability-based role description will be implemented. This role currently has no substantive position holder. This new role will be filled via a recruitment process. Legislative Counsel 3 positions A new Legislative Counsel (Levels 1, 2, and 3) capability-based role has been developed. The new Legislative Counsel (Levels 1, 2, and 3) capability-based role description will be implemented. The new Legislative Counsel – Level 3 capability-based role is considered to be the same or similar as the current Legislative Counsel role. Substantive Legislative Counsel role holders will be confirmed into the new roles. Senior Policy Intelligence Advisor 1 position With policy intelligence required across all policy roles, there is no longer a requirement for a dedicated role, in Policy’s future operating model. There will no longer be a dedicated Senior Policy Intelligence Advisor role. The current Senior Policy Intelligence Advisor role holder will be supported to explore alternative pathways. Senior Policy Advisor 15 positions A new Policy Advisor (Levels 1, 2, and 3) capability-based role has been developed. The new Policy Advisor (Levels 1, 2, and 3) capability-based role description will be The new Policy Advisor – Level 3 capability-based role is considered to be the same or similar 32 IN CONFIDENCE Introduction of Domain/functional teams.

This role will have a short-term title change to reflect the enterprise wide role description. The fixed term arrangement for this role will continue to support the transition to the future operating model for Policy. Work Programme Coordinator 1 position The existing enterprise Capability & Outcomes Specialist Level 1 role is considered to align to the outcomes required for Policy. The Capability & Outcomes Specialist capability-based role description will be implemented. The Capability & Outcomes Specialist Level 1 role is not considered to be the same or similar as the Work Programme Coordinator. The substantive Work Programme Coordinator will be offered the role of Capability & Outcomes Specialist as a suitable alternative role.

The Business Support – Level 2 capability-based role description will be implemented. The Business Support – Level 2 role is considered to be the same, or similar as the current PA/Team Secretary role. 34 IN CONFIDENCE The substantive PA/Team Secretary role holders will be confirmed in the role. Support Officer Administration 1 position The Support Officer Administration role is no longer required in the future operating model for Policy. Some of the work this role currently completes is provided for by Facilities Management. There will no longer be a Support Officer Administration role. The current Support Officer Administration role holder will be supported to explore alternative pathways. Fixed term arrangements – what these changes mean Unless advised otherwise you will remain in your fixed term role. You may apply for any other roles that come available through the usual recruitment processes. Secondments – what these changes mean The proposed changes have implications for some people who are on secondment. Every secondment is different in terms of its length and history, and some people may have moved through multiple secondments. If you are currently on secondment into Policy from a different business group, and your secondment position is to be disestablished, you will return to your substantive position at that time, or when your secondment ends, whichever is sooner. If you are applying for one of the new positions, your skills and abilities will be considered during the selection process, whether these have been gained in your substantive position or on secondment. Proposed Transition Process If the proposed change goes ahead then there will be a transition process to implement the change. This section details how we are proposing to implement the changes. This process has been developed with the aim of providing clarity for people for whom there may be significant change. This process meets the requirements of our employment agreements. We encourage you to familiarise yourself with the Management of Change provisions of your Employment Agreement. 35 IN CONFIDENCE If your permanent substantive position has been disestablished and you have not been confirmed into a position, a transition approach will apply for you. This will include consideration of a role that may be a suitable alternative position and looking for alternative pathways where appropriate. We will work closely with you through this process to ensure that you have the right support. Proposed Selection Criteria for Policy Lead and Strategic Policy Advisor positions If the proposal goes ahead, and the proposed number of Policy Lead roles and Strategic Policy Advisor positions are established, we are proposing to use an Expression of Interest (EOI) process form Policy Managers for the appointment to these positions. Documented below is the proposed process. Substantive Policy Managers will be invited to indicate their interest in the Policy Lead, Policy Lead – Chief Economist, and Strategic Policy Advisor roles by order of preference. If they have no preference, they could indicate this. If you express an interest in one of the Policy Lead roles, we will ask you to indicate which Domain(s) or team you wish to express an interest in, including your order of preference, and provide us with a view of the skills and experience that would enable your success in the role, and an explanation of your reasons for your expression of interest. For the Policy Lead – Chief Economist, we will ask you to provide us with a view of the knowledge and capability that would enable your success in relation to the economics specialisation and discipline. For the Strategic Policy Advisor roles, we will ask you to provide us your view of the skills and experience that would enable your success in relation to the Policy Quality & Agility capability, at the Expert level. For all roles, we will ask you for your view of the skills and experience that enable your success in relation to the leadership capability, at the appropriate level. Wherever possible, we will consider placing people in their preferred role. However, indicating your preference doesn’t solely determine which role you are or aren’t offered. It’s one of a range of considerations Inland Revenue uses to ensure we have the right number of people with the right capabilities and knowledge in the right roles. As previously noted, in the future Policy operating model leadership matters, and we will require leaders to have a strong focus on coaching and developing others. There will be a greater emphasis on leaders to role model and demonstrate the behaviours expected of all Inland Revenue leaders. The leadership expected of Strategic Policy Advisors will emphasise the ability to resolve highly complex strategic policy issues and collaborate successfully to achieve policy outcomes on a cross agency, national or international level. During the Expression of Interest (EOI) process we will be asking you to demonstrate your knowledge, skills and capability in leadership, as well as other areas appropriate to the roles. As we have previously noted during this consultation and during briefings, this is a proposal. We want to hear and consider your views and ideas, before any decisions are made. We will confirm the selection criteria for these roles when we communicate final decisions. 36 IN CONFIDENCE Why are we proposing an Expression of Interest (EOI) Process for Policy Leads and Strategic Policy Advisors and how will the proposed process help inform selection outcomes? The total number of Policy Lead positions is proposed to be less than the number of Policy Manager positions we currently have and therefore all current Policy Managers will be impacted, and eligible to be considered for the new Policy Lead and the new Strategic Policy Advisor roles. The EOI process is designed to facilitate the placement of affected people by achieving an agreed match between impacted individual employee preferences for identified options, and Inland Revenue’s business needs. The process is designed to facilitate fairness and transparency for our people. How will I complete the Expression of Interest (EOI) process? If the proposal goes ahead, you will receive a link to the EOI form. The EOI form will ask you to indicate your role preferences and share with us any other information you wish to be taken into consideration, including personal circumstances. What will happen next? All EOIs will be considered by the Deputy Commissioner PAS, in conjunction with the Policy Director’s and the PAS Programme Manager. They will consider all the information provided, the requirements of the roles to deliver the future Policy model, and Inland Revenue’s business needs, to facilitate the placement of people into roles. There may not need to be any formal interview process as part of the decision-making, however a member of the panel considering the EOIs may have a conversation with you to explore or clarify the information you have provided further. What will happen once selection decisions are made? Once selection decisions have been made a member of the panel will contact you to discuss the proposed placement with you. You will have an opportunity to provide feedback on the proposed placement and this will be considered before the outcome is confirmed in writing. The provisions of your Employment Agreement in relation to a suitable alternative position will apply through this process. If there are any vacancies at the end of this process, they may be advertised internally and externally using Inland Revenue’s normal recruitment process. 37 IN CONFIDENCE Transition for people into Domain and functional teams. If the proposal goes ahead we will first appoint Policy Leads and Strategic Policy Advisors. People currently in the Drafting and Economics teams would stay in the new incarnation of those teams. Following the setting of the tax policy work programme we will confirm the domains each Policy Lead is responsible for. During this we will retain existing teams and reporting lines. We will then work through the reassignment of projects and people to Domain teams with a view to maintaining continuity in terms of what people are currently working on. When the proposed reassignments have been worked through this will be available to Policy Advisors for comment. Exactly how we facilitate these comments will be determined closer to the time and will depend in part on the Policy Lead appointments. For additional information on specific roles and other supporting documents please see the Policy Future Operating Model intranet page. 2 IN CONFIDENCE Table of Contents Final Decisions Overview

to engage with the proposal document, ask questions and give feedback. We received some really thoughtful and constructive input. Over the last few weeks the team have been considering this feedback, making some changes as a result, and focusing on where to from here. In this document you will find a summary of the key themes from your feedback, the changes we have made as a result, and some further information about some areas of the model people had questions about. With the incorporation of ideas received in consultation we are in an even stronger position to continue our journey to fully implement our three key shifts. We said in our proposal document, and many of you reflected in your feedback, that achieving our key shifts is driven by and dependant on the enablers we have identified: prioritisation, engagement, capability uplift, and culture and behaviour. These are at the core of our transition to the Future Operating Model. Following your feedback, we have made three key changes. They are: • the Chief Economist will report to the Deputy Commissioner rather than reporting to a Policy Director as originally proposed (the role is otherwise unchanged from the proposal) • the policy domain for the Legislative Drafting Team is planned to include the second Business tax domain – the nature of the policy work this team would work on was not stated in the original proposal • the graduate policy advisors will be referred to as Policy Advisors – there is no need to call out their former educationally-based status. Aside from these amendments, we will proceed with the changes as they were outlined in the proposal and confirmed in this document. A common theme from feedback was the need to lift our people leadership to achieve the changes. And this was a key enabler we had identified. However, some concerns were raised about the increased average size of policy teams and that the higher staff to Policy Lead reporting ratio may actually work against the key shifts. We have listened to and respect these concerns but in order to achieve the optimal balance between Policy Leads having an increased focus on people leadership, providing senior people with leadership opportunities and establishing the greater stewardship capability through the new Strategic Policy Advisor roles we have chosen to proceed with the proposed number of Policy Leads and resulting reporting ratios. We have also highlighted some things we will put in place to ensure we do not lose the focus on people leadership. Many of you sought clarity about how some aspects of the Future Operating Model would work. Where possible we have included some further information in this document to assist – for example regarding the role of Strategic Policy Advisor. In some cases, however, the areas identified will be part of an iterative process that we will develop as we transition to our new ways of working. An implementation plan will kick in immediately and those areas not already developed will be done at this time, in many cases in conjunction with the new Policy Leads and our people. 4 IN CONFIDENCE We have some immediate priorities in the next few weeks, including working closely with those affected by the decisions and conducting the Expression of Interest (EOI) process for the Policy Lead and Strategic Policy Advisor roles. We know that you want certainty as soon as possible so we can settle the new teams and people have clarity about who they are reporting to and working with. We plan to have the EOI process completed and roles confirmed by the end of July. Following confirmation of people into these roles, and alongside the ongoing development of our refreshed work programme, we will start to map people into teams. This may not happen immediately for everyone, but we are working to ensure people have certainty as soon as possible. We recognise that this can be an unsettling time for people and encourage you to continue to talk to your colleagues and seek support if you need it. We know you will also continue to support each other at this time. Thank you once again for your constructive and thoughtful feedback. Cath Cath Atkins, Deputy Commissioner Policy & Strategy.

There was concern that the Chief Economist role should be kept at Tier 3 (i.e. reporting to the Deputy Commissioner rather than a Policy Director as proposed). The key reasons for this concern were ensuring the role retained the appropriate level of influence and that it was able to attract the right calibre of candidates. We have considered this feedback and were persuaded that on balance there is a good rationale to have the reporting line direct to the Deputy Commissioner rather than through a Policy Director. This is reflected in the final model. The role is otherwise as proposed. We also received feedback on the role of the Economics and Stewardship team. As a result, we have included some further information in the section about the role of this team. Key theme – clarity on how operating model will work Feedback on this theme covered a range of issues relating in particular to team size and how the larger flexible teams were intended to work. This included how sign off and reporting lines would work, and what would be the respective responsibilities of Policy Leads, Strategic Advisors and Principal or Senior advisors leading projects. Some people were very supportive of the larger policy teams. However, some people expressed concern that the proposed team size was too large and if not managed properly could lead to less time being devoted to people management, increased silos, bottle-necks for sign-off and less technical oversight. Others noted these risks and either sought clarification or made suggestions about steps that could mitigate these risks. A key area of focus was the interaction and division of responsibility between Policy Leads and Principal or Senior Advisors who would be leading projects. We have considered the feedback on team size but have confirmed the proposed approach of moving to larger teams. We note that similar sized teams, if not larger, are very common in other policy shops around town. The intent of larger teams is to reduce silos and to have Policy Leads focus more of their time on the leadership and development of their people. This does not mean that our Leads will not be required to provide technical support, as rather than using organisation-wide leader roles, we have created a specialised Policy Lead role. We recognise to develop and grow our capability, Leads will continue to play a key role in supporting technical capability building. However, we expect the key focus of our Policy Leads is to lead and develop their people well. Some of the submissions discussed the placement of some Policy Advisors in the drafting team. There was concern this would not be an attractive option for advisors if the work didn’t provide the opportunity to undertake full policy projects or if it was not clear what domain or area that team would focus on. However, some submissions noted that it could potentially provide a development opportunity for those advisors interested in trying their hand at drafting. We now confirm that a number of Policy Advisors may be placed in a team with the Legislative Counsel as proposed. In the first instance we expect that these Policy Advisors 6 IN CONFIDENCE will be working in the Business and Entity Taxation domain. The final distribution of domains will need to be confirmed as we finalise the Tax Policy Work Programme but based on its development so far and feedback received it seems likely that the Business and Entity Taxation domain will need to cover more than one team. The addition of Policy Advisors in a second team will provide a better balance of people across teams, will help ensure the integration of that team with the wider group, and will create development opportunities for the Policy Lead in this area. Many submissions focused on key success factors for the larger teams and the operating model in general. These included accountability and expectations, workload management, capability, development opportunities and the way in which senior members of the team work with and support the Policy Leads. These factors all form a key part of the implementation approach. We have included some more detail on these topics in this document, however some aspects will continue to be worked through as we move into the new model and transition to our new teams and roles. It will be important for both our Policy Leads and our people to be involved in designing any new processes and expectations as part of the implementation plan to ensure they are fit for purpose. This may involve some refinement as we find the balance that works best. An initial step has been taken by introducing a RACI accountability matrix to ensure people are clear about their role in a project (RACI = Responsible / Accountable / Consult / Inform) to the projects being commissioned as part of the Tax Policy Work Programme refresh. Another key aspect of the transition will be updating “My Plans” for all people to ensure these are a clear and up-to-date record of workload and development needs and opportunities. Policy Leads will update these as a priority with their people. This will be an ongoing key focus as part of the Whanake approach. These plans will be particularly important in the transition to ensure workloads are managed and people settle into their new teams with a clear development and work plan. The role of the Strategic Policy Advisor was another area where many people sought greater detail. We have added some further information about this role later in this document. Key theme – capability uplift and developing leadership Submissions highlighted that capability uplift is a core success factor for embedding the Future Operating Model. Leadership was a particularly strong theme, as was ensuring that enough coaching, training, and support was given to both Policy Leads and to Principal and Senior Advisors leading projects. Capability uplift was highlighted in Part A of the proposal document as a key enabler of the change. As many people have identified, one of the key areas of focus needs to be on leadership – both for those in formal leadership roles and for those Senior and Principal Advisors potentially taking on greater leadership of projects. We were pleased to see managers raising this as an area where they would be looking for support. We are committed to an ongoing focus on leadership and this will form a key part of development and support for Policy Leads in particular. This will commence immediately upon confirming Policy Leads into their new roles. Development pathways for people was an area mentioned in submissions, in particular how leadership development would occur in the new model. We recognise that this was an area of concern for some. Informal (non-structural) leadership opportunities, project 7 IN CONFIDENCE leadership and acting roles will continue to be important ways for people to contribute and develop. The new model with larger more flexible teams provides more opportunity for senior and principal advisors to lead projects and work with Policy Leads to lead policy development and assist with the development of others in the team. It was also suggested that mentoring of people (outside of specific projects) could be another tool to both provide support and development opportunities. Another area identified in submissions was Māori capability. Again, this is an area already identified as needing investment in training to support engagement with Māori. We see this as a priority. We were also challenged to think further about how to grow our Māori capability over time, including by potentially identifying suitably qualified people across IR to move into Policy. This is something we intend to investigate further as part of our ongoing capability uplift work. Key theme – role titles and role descriptions In general, feedback on the new roles was positive, particularly regarding the Policy Advisor roles and the externally facing titles proposed for these roles. It was suggested that it might be preferable not to use “graduate” in the title of those advisors on the graduate programme, as this might hinder their ability to interact with other agencies or stakeholders. Rather than having a stand-alone role description, this role sits within the development range for Advisor Level 1, which equates to the Advisor title externally. We agree that it is appropriate for graduates to also use the Advisor title when communicating externally. Concern was raised that the Policy Lead role should retain the current Policy Manager designation because “Policy Lead” may not be clear for external stakeholders, was not consistent with wider public sector naming, and potentially signalled something less than the current “Policy Manager” title. Replacing Manager titles with Lead wherever possible is an organisation-wide decision as part of Inland Revenue’s principles of the new organisation. “Lead” titles are used to signify the importance of people leadership to the role. While “Policy Manager” is used in a number of other agencies, we do not consider the Policy Lead title will cause significant confusion for external stakeholders and it should be relatively simple for Policy Leads to explain their role by referencing the old title of “Policy Manager” if needed. Some specific questions and comments were received about the role descriptions, mostly relating to the identified capabilities for each. Setting the capabilities at the right level always requires some judgement. These have been reviewed and we have confirmed that the current role descriptions and capabilities are fit for purpose at this stage for the organisational design. 10 IN CONFIDENCE matrix) framework for projects in the planning phase – this process is being introduced as part of the Tax Policy Work Programme refresh. The expectation of the new Policy Lead role is that the focus is on leadership of the team and development of people. Leadership capability and support will be a key focus of the transition. We will be seeking feedback from people as the new model settles in, to ensure that these expectations are being met. As part of the transition process Policy Leads will be ensuring they have “My Plans” in place for all people reporting to them so there is a clear understanding of workload alongside development needs and opportunities. This is something Policy Leads will be expected to maintain a focus on over time and will require input from, and coordination with, those in the team leading projects and with other Policy Leads and Strategic Advisors where people are working across teams or projects. Chief Economist and the Economics and Stewardship team The Economics and Stewardship team will be led by a Chief Economist who will be appointed based on their economics specialisation. The Chief Economist will report to the Deputy Commissioner. This will preserve the influence of this role. The role size and role description is unchanged from that which was proposed. The Chief Economist role is included in the Policy Lead role description, due to the similarities in requirements of people, team and domain leadership, while still recognising the importance of the economics specialism. The team will build up the Policy group’s knowledge and understanding of the likely economic impacts and distributional effects of tax and social policy changes, work on policy issues with major economic impacts and be a resource to support the five domain teams. An additional focus for the team is on leadership of strategic policy/policy stewardship. This will include supporting Inland Revenue’s regulatory stewardship and forming the strategic guidance for planning the tax policy work programme. A more system-based approach to identifying priorities and future stewardship focus will be developed. This team will also need to work closely with the strategy team. The role of the economics team will primarily fall into the following key areas: • Guardian/steward – understanding how the whole system fits together, its strengths and weaknesses, how different systems might operate and why or how we might want to change over time. A core aspect of this role will be leading Policy input into processes such as the BIM that explain the frameworks underpinning our tax system. • Advisor – providing economic input into policy projects. This is a key role of the team and will occupy a significant amount of the day-to-day work. • Educative – involvement in policy roundtables, tax economics reading group and policy courses to help inform and kindle an interest in economics across Policy. • Engagement – including with external stakeholders, the Treasury tax strategy team, and other agencies. Internal engagement will also be a feature, with areas such as research, forecasting and strategy. • Regulatory stewardship – including the regular reporting obligations agencies have in place to report to central agencies on regulatory performance. This will include involvement in making more information available to the public to enable greater 11 IN CONFIDENCE visibility over aspects of the tax and social policy systems of which Inland Revenue is a part. New networked ways of working in recent years has increased the flow of information on policy problems being identified and passed on to the right teams in Policy. Examples include the introduction of the Right from the Start Committee, Customer Centric Committee, the Technical Governance Committee, the customer segment strategies, and various other groups. Policy intelligence is becoming a critical part of every team’s role. This has reduced the need for Policy to have a dedicated role to liaise with other parts of Inland Revenue to identify policy intelligence concerns. However, it is important to ensure that other areas within Inland Revenue can easily refer material or questions to the right teams. A process will be established for this. Strategic Policy Advisors A Strategic Policy Advisor will advise on a specific domain or strategic area. Being part of the Policy broader leadership team will mean that the Strategic Policy Advisor will achieve strong engagement with and influence the Policy Leads and Directors to ensure that the domain or strategic area gets the necessary leadership attention. A Domain or strategic area befitting allocation to a Strategic Policy Advisor could be one in which: • there is a need to develop and continue to maintain and enhance a relationship with an especially demanding stakeholder group • the reputation of the responsible advisor or key policy contact is critical to success • the complexity is such that continuity is necessary to build a deep understanding of a specialised body of knowledge • the stakes are high on the success of the project (reputation of the whole group may depend on it) Strategic Policy Advisors are expected to be our strongest policy practitioners with a deep and broad understanding of the tax and or social policy systems. They will be recognised both nationally and internationally for their technical expertise and strategic influence. They will be trusted to lead the most complex or the most sensitive of policy projects and have earned the reputation for delivery to exceedingly high standards in exceptionally demanding situations. They will be capable of leading IR’s engagement with senior Ministers and key stakeholders. To achieve the key shifts we need to have the capacity to provide strong technical and intellectual leadership and retain our reputation domestically and internationally with key stakeholders. Strategic Policy Advisors will provide this intellectual leadership and build strategic policy capability in the group, and within IR. These roles are essential for our increased stewardship capability and will provide capacity for new product innovation. Strategic Policy Advisors will be key members of the broader leadership team. Examples of the type of responsibilities a Strategic Policy Advisor may have are: • leading the development of a new tax regime (eg a corrective environmental tax regime) • leading a review of our tax system • representing New Zealand and leading the resolution of issues with international implications 12 IN CONFIDENCE • designing a capital gains tax • leading large cross-cutting projects, working closely with Directors on system level questions, or influencing external thinking on particular issues. Policy Advisors We will have a Policy Advisor job family with three levels. The use of job families means that fewer separate role descriptions are needed. Job families make sense when a number of roles are working toward the same outcomes and the more complex roles subsume the capabilities of the less complex roles. The new levels in the Policy Advisor role description equate to existing roles as follows: • Level 1 is equivalent to the existing Policy Analyst • Level 2 is equivalent to the existing Senior Policy Analyst • Level 3 is equivalent to the existing Senior Policy Advisor. Inland Revenue is no longer including “seniority labels” in role descriptions. However, while the new role descriptions will no longer formally refer to levels of ‘seniority’ we will continue to use titles that are recognisable for external stakeholders to identify expertise or authority, for example with Ministers/other agencies and for recruitment. The naming convention we will use for these roles is: • Policy Advisor (i.e. level 1) • Senior Policy Advisor (i.e. level 2) • Principal Policy Advisor (i.e. level 3) An advantage of the Policy Advisor job family is that appointments can be made to the role and the level based on business need (affordability and capability requirement) and candidate quality. For example, rather than a team having 2 Senior Policy Advisors, 4 Senior Policy Analysts and 2 Policy Analysts (as currently), the team might have 8 Policy Advisor roles, where the distribution of Levels 1, 2 and 3 can flex as required for budget and capability needs over time. We recognise we will need to do further work on identifying how this will happen in a more transparent way. The Policy Advisor – Level 1, equates to the current Policy Analyst position. Graduates will be appointed to the Policy Advisor – Level 1 role and will be paid in a ‘graduate development remuneration range’ which would be an extension of the range for the Policy Advisor – Level 1. From your feedback the reference to “Graduate” in the role title will not be used. The Policy Advisor – Level 2, currently ‘Senior Policy Analyst’ should be seen as a role from which one may develop their career in both the technical and people leadership aspects to varying degrees depending on where you would like to head. For example, aiming towards a Policy Lead role, or Policy Advisor – Level 3 role. The Policy Advisor – Level 3, currently ‘Senior Policy Advisor’ will continue to be a role to aspire to for those wishing to advance their career. Appointments to the Policy Advisor - Level 3 role will be made when exceptional skills and experience are needed to maintain or increase the capability of the Policy Group. Thus, the decision to recruit Policy Advisors at Level 3 will be made based on ‘business need’ assessed by the recruiting Policy Lead with the endorsement of a Policy Director. 13 IN CONFIDENCE Legislative Counsel We will have a Legislative Counsel job family with three levels. The new levels in the Legislative Counsel role description equate to existing roles as follows: • Level 1 is equivalent to the existing Assistant Legislative Counsel • Level 2 has no current equivalent job expectation • Level 3 is equivalent to the existing Legislative Counsel. The following titles will be used with external stakeholders to identify expertise or authority, for example with Parliament/Ministers/other agencies and for recruitment: • Associate Legislative Counsel (i.e. level 1) • Legislative Counsel (i.e. level 2) • Senior Legislative Counsel (i.e. level 3) Business Support Business support roles within Policy will use enterprise wide capability-based role descriptions. Business support will need to align with the Policy Future Operating Model and this will necessitate rethinking how teams are supported and how our business support capability is used most effectively and efficiently across the group. We expect that there will also be a need to participate in any further thinking about the future of business support across IR given the pending introduction of Enterprise Support Services and our intention to align with the wider organisational direction. 19 IN CONFIDENCE Leadership (Applied) Demonstrated experience of: - Role modelling IR’s values through your behaviours and decisions - Providing thought leadership within the policy function, identifying emerging trends and considering potential implications to support appropriate policy responses Customer Advisory (Expert) Demonstrated experience of: - Being a recognised subject matter expert to enhance the national and international tax policy social system What will happen once selection decisions are made Once selection decisions have been made a member of the panel will contact you to discuss the proposed outcome with you. You will have an opportunity to provide feedback on the proposed outcome and this will be considered before the outcome is confirmed in writing. The provisions of your Employment Agreement in relation to a suitable alternative position will apply through this process. If there are any vacancies at the end of this process, they may be advertised internally and externally using Inland Revenue’s normal recruitment process. Transition for people into Domain and functional teams We will first appoint Policy Leads and Strategic Policy Advisors. People currently in the Drafting and Economics teams will stay in the new form of those teams (Legislative Drafting and Economics and Stewardship respectively). Following the setting of the tax policy work programme we will confirm the domains each Policy Lead is responsible for. Until then we will retain existing teams and reporting lines. We will then work through the reassignment of projects and people to Domain teams with a view to maintaining continuity in terms of what people are currently working on. When the reassignments have been worked through this will be available to Policy Advisors for comment. Exactly how we facilitate these comments will be determined closer to the time and will depend in part on the Policy Lead appointments. 21 IN CONFIDENCE • Capability uplift has been identified as particularly important, especially in relation to leadership skills. A focus on leadership training and support will commence immediately. • Capability uplift for people other than our people leaders is also key. The proposal document included areas that we have identified as priorities to address across the group. As we have indicated, an assessment of development needs and work for each person will be undertaken by their Policy Lead. This will highlight areas where individual development needs or opportunities exist. The Inland Revenue capabilities and the DPMC Skills Framework also provide tools to assist with identifying development needs and ways to develop desired skills and capabilities. We expect that leadership opportunities and options to help people develop these skills would be identified as part of the development plans for senior and principal advisors. We will also continue to work through the options for development opportunities as we progress the capability uplift enabler stream. We recognise that there is still considerable work to do to successfully embed the Future Operating Model. While many aspects are well underway, this work needs to continue, and additional work needs to start. We also want to provide opportunities for people to be involved and take ownership in this transition, in particular as we continue the work on the enablers. Governance of the next stage of the Policy Future Operating Model ODC is the governance group overseeing the implementation of the Policy Future Operating model. At a (yet to be agreed) future date an external review will take place to test whether the implementation of the Future Operating Model is achieving what is intended. A sub-group of the PAS Governance Group (Deputy Commissioner PAS, Director Strategy, Policy Directors, Programme Lead) will co-opt Cath Atkins as the Deputy Commissioner CCS-B to review progress and achievements on the Policy Future Operating Model implementation plan on a monthly basis. The intention being that Cath will ensure from an ‘outside of PAS’ perspective that the changes continue as planned.

24OIA1853 Page 1 of 3 21 March 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 22 February 2024. You requested the following: The original question was whether you can advise if specific debts imposed through the courts had been paid. Thank you for clarifying that you cannot provide information on specific cases. I have a subsequent question, which is whether it is possible for you to provide a more generic response that would not identify a particular taxpayer? For example, could you provide an aggregate figure of how much of the top 10 or 20 debts (imposed through the courts as a result of criminal tax activity) had been paid. As a separate query, can you advise how many staff worked on tax crime investigations over the period from 2016/17 to 2022/23 please? I note that an OECD report has this separately identified from FTE staff numbers (page 52 of Fighting Tax Crime: The ten global principles) Inland Revenue c an provide generic data in response to requests under the OIA if the data cannot be used to identify an individual taxpayer. Each request must be individually considered to ensure the information provided is useful while remaining anonymous. The following table outlines the aggregate totals awarded and amounts paid for the current top 20 reparation orders recorded since October 2021, when Inland Revenue began tracking payments through our new computer system. Total reparation awarded Total payments received Top 20 cases $1,788,283.98 $512,318.62 In response to the second part of your request, it may help if I provide some background. Right from the start compliance approach Taking a ‘right from the start’ approach means supporting customers before issues arise. Due to Business Transformation, Inland Revenue gained new analytical tools and capabilities that enabled smarter decisions about where to focus resources and to take a more proactive approach to helping people get it right. Compliance activities are now better targeted through cost- effective early interventions such as advice and information, and by giving customers the 24OIA1853 Page 2 of 3 opportunity to review their tax affairs to either confirm they are in order or to submit a voluntary disclosure. Since 2018, Inland Revenue has progressively made changes to its operating model. These changes have included establishing new business groups, moving people to broad-based roles, and devolving decision-making to empower our front-line people to resolve issues for customers as quickly as possible. As a result of these changes, the people previously working in investigations or prosecution roles in the Service Delivery group have moved to broad-based capability roles in our Customer and Compliance Services (CCS) business groups. As such, Inland Revenue does not have a separate investigative team, or specific ‘investigator’ role descriptions. Investigation is one part of our compliance activity. Compliance activity can include contacting customers; seeking more information; supporting customers to do the right thing; talking to third parties; negotiating repayment options; audit activity; and legal action when necessary. Therefore, your request for the number of staff undertaking work related to tax crimes is refused under section 18(g) of the OIA – the information requested is not held by the department and I have no grounds for believing the information is held by or more closely connected with the functions of another department. In the spirit of the OIA, as the best approximation, Inland Revenue can provide, outlined in the table below, the a udit hours for the years requested. Financial Year 2016/17 2017/18 2018/19 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 Audit hours 543,870 586,571 401,869 231,427 201,924 67,095 112,795 Audit hours have fluctuated significantly as Inland Revenue has introduced new systems, managed COVID responses, and is returning to a more balanced compliance work-programme. The decrease in audit hours from the 2019/20 year is a result of Inland Revenue implementing the ‘get it right from the start’ compliance approach and short-term shift in priorities. Right of review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz . Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman by email at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz . If you choose to have an internal review, you can still ask the Ombudsman for a review. 24OIA1853 Page 3 of 3 Publishing of OIA response We intend to publish our response to your request on Inland Revenue’s website (www.ird.govt.nz) as this information may be of interest to other members of the public. This letter, with your personal details removed, will be published in its entirety. Publishing responses increases the availability of information to the public and is consistent with the OIA's purpose of enabling more effective participation in the making and administration of laws and policies and promoting the accountability of officials.

Attached as Appendix B is a transcript extract from the event of content relating to the Government announcements relating to Te Tiriti O Waitangi and the use of te reo Māori. 12 Pou Herenga Waka Leaders Hui 9 November 2023 The Executive Leadership team took part in a question and answer session with leaders from across IR, as part of an online full day hui. The following questions and answers relate to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the use of te reo Māori: Context: Peter Mersi, Commissioner was asked the following question: A question was asked from somebody to say that as an atheist, they've really struggled with the mandated Karakia that this person feels pressured to lead or partake in at Inland Revenue at every meeting. While they respect and appreciate individuals own beliefs and cultures to run these, their core ethics and values don't align with the act of Karakia. And they're worried that they're going to be limited in their career, and are starting to feel excluded or judged because of their unwillingness to partake or recite Karakia within IR. So any advice or thoughts you have for this person and people like them on how they should approach this issue so as to limit any negative impacts on their future leadership opportunities here or in the wider government sector while still maintaining their integrity? Response from Peter Mersi (transcript from a video recording): Yeah, look, thanks for that question. And I think it's a question that many people actually ask themselves. The way I think about this, and I'm not a particularly religious person, but the way I think about it is it's about honoring and respecting others and being inclusive. So for me, a Karakia, as I explained at the beginning, is not necessarily a prayer. It can be, but it's not necessarily. And it's much more in the context that it is often used within our organization, a way of just bringing people into a particular headspace. And I think for me, I'm comfortable and actually I like the idea, you know, before we used Karakia, often if I was having a senior leadership team meeting, the way to start the meeting would be to remind people to take their hats off and to put the collective organizational hat. This is another way of saying the same thing, but it's very respective of Tikanga. And I think the reality in New Zealand is that we have Te Tiriti, and there is a partnership construct or concept between Māori and non-Māori. And so for me, part of the question was about, you know, the risk or what happens in terms of your ability to grow and develop and take on alternative roles. I think again, to me, it's about being respectful of that culture. And the reality is that in particularly in senior roles, we are expected to be able to participate and promote and support the inclusion of that Tikanga in what we do. So personally, I don't find it, and I've had this internal debate with myself. Appendix A 13 It's not something that conflicts with my values because it's about the message that the Karakia is sending rather than the construct. I mean, just as an aside, you know, the concept of blessing food, again, not being particularly religious myself, you could say, well, how comfortable should I be saying a blessing? But actually, it's for others I'm doing it. And again, that point of inclusion. So I think it's just something we each have to work through. But I would encourage you to think about it from that concept of inclusion and being, you know, making it a comfortable environment for all. Context: Michelle Redington, Chief Tax Counsel, was asked this question: In the importance that we're placing on the use of te reo in our communications, both internally and externally, there's also a feeling that we're not giving the equivalent time to explaining "Well, what does that actually mean?" in English, so that other people can understand it, and understand the communication properly. What's your views on that? Response from Michelle Redington (transcript from a video recording) Yeah, I mean, firstly, I do think it's really important that we embrace the use of te reo and Tikanga. And Peter's already talked a little bit about that, both from our perspective as public servants and the part we play in that relationship between the Crown and Māori. And so we've got obligations there. But also I think it's the right thing to do in a diverse and inclusive workplace. And so, you know, I would hope that everyone would be fully embracing that. Now, you know, that can be a bit tricky. And, you know, some of us and I would put myself in this camp, you know, aren't quite at the level of capability that we would like to be. So that can be quite difficult. And so I hear what people are saying about when we're using te reo and we're not using the translation. That can be a little bit difficult. So, you know, I would just ask people to, you know, sort of think about the audience and who might be, you know, who they might be trying to communicate with and think about whether, you know, the translation is appropriate in certain circumstances. Context: Mary Craig, Deputy Commissioner Enterprise Design and Integrity was asked this question: There has been some concerns raised. I've heard them raised elsewhere as well with the incoming government might not be as focused on organizations like us becoming to Te Tiriti based. We've come a long way. Do you think that's going to change? And what does that mean for us with an incoming government? 14 Response from Mary Craig (transcript from a video recording) Yes, I think so, we have Te Tiriti, as Peter mentioned earlier, and te reo is an official language of New Zealand and just following on Michelle's commentary around, you know, the obligation we have. But also we want to do this. And I think I'd also mention that the approach we're taking in Inland Revenue is not a big bang approach. It's over several years to grow our capability to be able to participate better and be really good Treaty partners. However we can't get ahead of the government of the day. And we have to listen to that and have dialogue with them. And we will. But what I would say is that there is momentum here. I think we keep going. So there aren't any plans at this point in time for us to do anything other than we planned. But as I said, we cannot get ahead of the government of the day. 7 Conversation with the Commissioner - 12 December 2023 The following is the transcript extract from the event of content relating to the Government announcements relating to Te Tiriti o Waitangi the use of te Reo Māori The numbers below indicate the time stamps within the recording of the discussion that relate to Te Tiriti o Waitangi the use of te Reo Māori. Peter Mersi, Commissioner of Inland Revenue 2:07 There were over 20 of you that had a range of questions around either the approach to the use of te reo or the proposals around te Tiriti and proposals to revisit the principles of that. 2:24 So I'll answer, I'll talk to both of those. Peter Mersi, Commissioner of Inland Revenue 9:51 And a good example of that to my mind was a comment that the Minister of Finance made, I think it was last week, where she talked about wanting to stop the additional payments that were made to those who were fluent te reo speakers. 10:08 And over the course of that week, as I think she got a better understanding of the context, the legal frameworks and the rationale, you can see that she's backed away from that. 10:19 So I think I guess as a general comment, I would say it's really important not to always jump at what the first thing they've said, let them bed in. Peter Mersi, Commissioner of Inland Revenue 14:48 There's a second set of questions around te reo Māori. 14:52 And so I'm going to, I'm going to split the questions around te reo Maori and its use, from issues around te Tiriti. 15:03 Firstly, as an organisation ELT need to take decisions about the sort of capabilities we need to support the Government of the day and that means the Government today and Governments of the future. 15:20 Appendix B 8 And that is what's been behind the development of Te Mata o te Arero and Te Arapika. 15:29 So, our te reo Māori Language Plan and the Māori cultural plan and programme. Both of those as far as I can see will remain unchanged. 15:41 We still see an incredible importance from an organisational perspective in our ability to engage with the community and for us all to continue to upskill ourselves in te reo Māori and te ao Māori. 16:01 So I think, I'm hoping that gives you a sense that you know we will continue to support those things. We will continue to support our Māori Network and you know, as best we can provide all of us with confidence that we can be who we are at work every day. 16:22 When it comes to questions of tr Tiriti look I think it's important that we remember two things. 16:27 The first is that this is a democracy, right. 16:30 So we have a new Government that has been democratically elected and it is entirely within the purview of a Government to determine how it wants to approach the question of the Crown Māori relationship, as it relates to te Tiriti. That process will unfold. 16:53 And once the Government has formed a view, and to my mind, it's not actually clear where that will land yet. 17:00 They've certainly talked about sending a proposal to Select Committee for public consultation on to te Tiriti. 17:08 But my understanding is the Prime Minister has not indicated support to take it through to change in Parliament, but we'll just see how that plays out. 17:18 But the second part of that is once they have made a decision, as long as, it is our role as professional public servants to implement any lawful direction from the Government. 17:31 And so it's important that we are able to do that in a politically neutral way. 17:38 9 So what that means in practice, it does not mean that if you have a personal view that you are not, that you are somehow constrained in giving that personal view. 17:51 So, for example, there have been some lawful protests recently about aspects of this. 17:58 There is nothing stopping you from joining a lawful protest. 18:02 It's important though, in doing that, that you do it in a way which does not associate what you're doing in that role with your role as an employee of 18:10 Inland Revenue. 18:12 And it's important that as professional public servants, we uphold that political neutrality all the way. 18:18 It is the foundation of how our system works. 18:23 To the extent it gets undermined, it actually makes not just working for a current Government, but working for any future Government really hard. 18:33 So it's imperative that we all accept that as public servants, 18:38 if it is a lawful direction, we will apply that. Our role is not to defend Government policy. 18:45 Our role is to explain Government policy. 18:48 And to the extent, as I say, that you have views, you are free to express those views in your private role. 18:54 But just be careful to ensure that that doesn't get associated with your role as an employee. 19:02 If you have any questions, talk to your team leader. 19:05 And you know, I know that this can be a personally challenging time, but it does 10 call upon us and I guess some of those core foundations that we accepted when we took on the role as public servants. 19:21 I'm hoping that sort of helped to give you a bit of a picture about certainly how we're thinking about those issues. And if you have any further questions flick them through and if we have time toward the end we'll we'll pick them up. A question was asked in the room by Pip Knight, Service Leader, Marketing and Communications who was supporting the session. The question was sent through electronically on the meeting chat. 41:50 You have touched on this, but it's what is IR’s stand on outcomes for Māori? Peter Mersi, Commissioner of Inland Revenue On outcomes for Māori? 41:59 Look I think from our perspective what I can say is we want a tax system that is effective for all people. To do that, 42:08 to do that well, we need to be able to understand how tax impacts on those communities. 42:14 So, in the context of, David you mentioned that our minister is very keen for us to engage with the sector in the development of policy. 42:25 In our view that includes that Māori and we have a Māori Advisory Group or Reference Group. David Carrigan, Deputy Commissionner, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship 42:31 Yeah we've actually got it's had it for 18 months or so now. 42:34 It's a Māori Reference Group, and that's chaired by Selwyn Hayes, and we make them every quarter and they help us, one work through te ao Māori way of thinking about tax policy issues, right from the start, but also helps us with how we how we should engage with Māori on particular issues. Because it's not just them we should engage with, 42:57 obviously it's Māori right across the country and it's a particular way of doing it. 43:02 11 And what I'll be honest, we're at the very early stages where we're not yet good at this, but we are trying to get good at this. Peter Mersi, Commissioner of Inland Revenue 43:09 And the key that sits behind that from an outcomes perspective is we want to be designing policy which does not unintentionally, negatively impact Māori businesses or you know Māori communities. 43:24 So, that will be, you know, from our perspective it is about trying to remove any of those aspects of discrimination, unintentional discrimination that may have crept into policy. On broader Māori outcomes, 43:38 look again that's something where we are obliged to take the lead from Ministers more generally. 43:45 But to the extent that we're involved in some of those system-wide, cross agency groups, that'll be, there's certainly an opportunity there for us to help influence and provide our first best advice on the importance of focusing on that as a group, to for the benefit of Aotearoa New Zealand overall. 44:04 So thanks for that question.

This involves managing risks to health (physical and mental) and safety. WorkSafe also encourages employers to support their employees in improving their overall wellbeing and in reducing lifestyle-related health conditions. The Health, Safety & Wellbeing (HSW) Roadmap outlines IR’s approach to measure and understand these risks, our approach to identify and implement appropriate and effective controls for such risks, as well as describing our plan to support employees in health promotion and wellbeing. IR is also committed to ensuring that a more holistic lens is applied to the suite of HSW controls and interventions. 4 Our Vision •As an employer it is recommended that IR influences improvements to the HSW of its employees. WorkSafe clearly describes an organisation’s obligation to mandatory health and safety protection, as well as areas of voluntary health promotion and wellbeing of employees (Appendix A). •IR places its organisational values and a holistic Māori model of health at the centre of this plan. This is to recognise how our HSW roadmap aligns with the wider IR strategic direction, as well as a te ao Māori view of the interconnected aspects of wellbeing and our whole selves. 5 Whanaungatanga At IR we work together as a whānau. We take the time to make connections. We listen in a way that makes people feel heard. We value the experiences of others. Manaakitanga At IR we seek to lift the mana of others. We’re generous with our knowledge and how we support people. We see true value in diversity. We care for those around us. Mahi Tika At IR we always seek to do the right thing. We’re open about the decisions we make and the actions we take. We do what we say we’re going to do. We’re flexible and learn as we go. Te ao Māori lens Developed by Sir Mason Durie in 1984, Te Whare Tapa Whā is a Māori model of health and wellbeing and is widely recognised and regarded in New Zealand (see Appendix B). The model is a metaphor based on four pillars of a wharenui/meeting house, with the foundation of whenua (land, roots) and has been a key resource in the development of this Health, Safety, & Wellbeing Roadmap. Te Whare Tapa Whā is well acknowledged as a guiding framework, both in Kaupapa Māori and generic New Zealand services such as The Mental Health Foundation and Ministry for Social Development. When we look after all four aspects, we look after our hauora/wellbeing. Our workplace and home environments are important to create a space for us to thrive. We recognise that the home environment is not within the control of IR however can be influenced by the work environment. Employees who are supported at work to check in on the four pillars helps them to balance their hauora and support others to balance theirs too (Mental Health Foundation). The key differences between a European and Te Ao Māori approach to health, safety, & wellbeing are particularly noticeable regarding the wellbeing focus placed on spirituality, ancestry, and the land/whenua. When the psychosocial wellbeing of our employees is prioritised and cared for, they are more empowered to do good work, be motivated and engaged, which results in increased productivity, and increased employee retention. It also correlates with decreased harm indicators such as sick leave, workplace injuries, and reports of bullying. 6 Our Vision Our vision is to: Protect the health and safety of our employees •Create a safe and supportive environment that allows employees to flourish rather than languish, protecting against psychosocial and physical harm. •Support organisational success through encouraging individual improvements in mental and physical health as defined by WorkSafe. Promote health and wellbeing •Provide services and support that are proven to reduce the risk of lifestyle-related health conditions and improve wellbeing. •Educate and support employees to build and maintain the resilience to cope with challenges, both at work and beyond. •Promoting psychosocial wellbeing in the workplace. 7 8 Senior Leadership actively leads in health, safety and wellbeing Leaders at all levels, especially senior, regularly seek assurance that risks are managed, especially psychosocial risk, as well as actively expanding their relevant knowledge in order to role model what good looks like. Support the improvement of IR employee’s overall health, safety and wellbeing Implement initiatives that aim to prevent harm (illness and injury) and provide strategies to build resilience of our employees (considering all aspects of Te Whare Tapa Whā model), enabling people to feel like IR cares. Identify critical risk areas at IR Identify critical risks through reviewing incident data and put appropriate controls in place to reduce harm as is reasonably practicable. Monitor controls regularly. Ensure we listen, engage and consult Continuously encourage worker participation and engagement, to have wider organisation representation on health, safety, and wellbeing matters. Health and Safety Representatives have a high positive profile in IR and are actively involved in decision making. To move toward our vision, we have identified four key objectives: Why does IR need this roadmap? •Assist IR with meeting the legislative obligations as outlined in the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015, as well as will as assist IR to manage the Enterprise Risk 4 - Insufficient people capability and capacity to deliver outcomes. It will also allow us to support and align ourselves with other Government Strategies: •New Zealand Health Strategy 2016 (Ministry of Health) •Inland Revenue’s six Corporate Strategies 2016 •Strategic Plan for Work-Related Heal th 2016-2026 (WorkSafe) •Health and Safety at Work Strategy 2018-2028 (MBI E and WorkSafe) As well as meeting the standards set out by The Business Leaders’ Health and Safety Forum (BLHSF) and Government Health and Safety Lead (GHSL). 9 Why does IR need this roadmap? From an organisational value perspective, IR believes in doing the right thing for its employees, regardless of legal obligations. For IR to uphold its values with respect to internal colleagues, customers, and external stakeholders, our people must feel safe, respected, supported and well. Research shows that prioritising physical and mental health in the workplace leads to reduced levels of absenteeism and presenteeism which correlates to higher organisational productivity. WorkSafe highlight the wider social effect of one’s health to be “The impact of work-related ill-health includes not only the societal costs of caring for those with poor health caused by their work, but also the impact on families, whānau and communities”. Commitment to a job is derived from multiple sources. In order to encourage employees to thrive and flourish in the workplace, they must be supported by their organisation, in the four cornerstones of wellbeing: family and social health, mental health, physical health and spiritual health. WorkSafe have also defined their position on Mentally Healthy Work and set out expectations of PCBU’s in this space. Mentally healthy work is work where risks to people’s mental health are eliminated or minimised, and their mental well-being is prioritised. In contrast, mental health harm or mental ill-health is the significant cognitive, emotional, or behavioural impact arising from, or exacerbated by, work-related risk factors. Mental health harm may be immediate or long-term and can come from single or repeated exposure. 10 Outcomes We will know the objectives of the plan are being met when the people of IR feel they are in an environment where: 11 They have a sense of belonging and inclusion They feel resilient to the challenges of day-to-day life Leaders have the tools to support their teams in health, safety & wellbeing, including resilience They have options for support when their health, safety, & wellbeing are challenged They feel safe in the workplace and able to have open conversations about health, safety & wellbeing with their leaders and colleagues Health, safety & wellbeing environment at IR 12 Working environment Employees at IR mostly undertake sedentary work tasks and are predominantly office-based. Following the COVID-19 response and to align with the New Zealand Government’s ‘flexible by default’ approach, IR now has a significant amount of people working from home on a regular (two or three days per week) basis which presents the risks associated with remote working. Workload, work pace, organisational justice, working relationships, communication and the physical working environment are all areas where our people have the potential to be harmed (psychosocial harm). Some of our people drive for part of their role which introduces the risks associated with driving. IR must also consider the risks to the physical security of our buildings and employees. A large proportion (approximately 73%) of staff are in customer facing roles (Customer & Compliance Services, CCS) which involve a significant level of interaction with disgruntled or frustrated customers, or those with complex needs. Certain roles within CCS also require face to face interaction with customers, which may occur on an IR site or out in the community, introducing the risks associated with isolated working. Those in customer facing roles are also sometimes exposed to: •Distressing information or scenes •People with uncontrolled mental health issues or addictions •Harassment •Abusive or offensive comments •Physical violence, intimidation, or threatening behaviour. 13 14 Critical risks For IR's critical health and safety risks, 'deep dives’ are scheduled to understand the profile of the risk, using bowtie risk analysis. The aim is to review existing controls and if required, establish new controls, in order to provide the level of assurance to the business. Organisational Resilience are currently entering all critical risks into Jira wewill then utilise the new H&S reporting tool and build a risk and control library which will be linked to incidents allowing us to identify controls that are not effective.This will enable us to monitor and target programmes to ensure continuous improvement in mitigating the riskswhich could impact on the safety of our people.

IR regularly seeks feedback from its employees on inclusion, development and opportunities, wellbeing, and advocacy via the People Experience Pulse (PXP) survey (Appendix C). We also consult with our people and seek feedback on certain business decisions such as change processes and new and updated policies. Recent examples of these are the Vaccination Policy, Driving Policy and our Worker Engagement, Participation and Representation Policy. We will continue to seek feedback from HS representatives and the wider workforce to inform our thinking and decisions on new initiatives. 15 Data & insights •Due to known limitations with our previous health & safety reporting tool, our ability to accurately understand the prevalence of health, safety, and wellbeing incidents at IR is restricted (Appendix D). With the implementation of a new, fit- for-purpose reporting tool in November 2022, we expect to see an improvement in the quality and availability of incident and injury data moving forward, which will assist in our critical risk register review process. •The Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) provides IR with work-injury claims data including the number of claims, cost of claims and weekly compensation days (Appendix D), which assists us in understanding lost-time workplace injuries however does not provide the whole picture due to differences in reporting approaches and metrics used. We expect the recent introduction of our new health and safety reporting tool to give IR a greater understanding of workplace injuries and the financial and social cost of these. •We currently have the ability to report on customer interactions that have the potential to impact psychosocial wellbeing for our front-l ine staff (CCS). This is managed in two ways. These incidents are first reported against the customer in our Security Incident Database (SID/START), with a staff health and safety task being automatically generated to prompt a leader-staff member wellbeing conversation. Until recently, before the introduction of the new reporting tool, we only had the ability to measure leader compliance with the wellbeing follow up task, within START however this control is limited in understanding both the quality of the follow up, and the degree of psychosocial impact experienced by the staff member (Appendix D). With the introduction of our new health and safety reporting tool, we have the second way of reporting the impact on employee psychosocial wellbeing as staff have the ability to report a wellbeing impact against themselves, including the severity and impact level of the event. 16 Data & insights We do not collect specific health data of those working at IR, other than a pre-employment question pertaining to conditions and disabilities that would affect one’s ability to perform their role. As such we do not know the number of our employees who face issues highlighted nationally (for example through the New Zealand Census) such as obesity, depression, anxiety, smoking and harmful alcohol consumption. We do have data on gender and identified ethnicity which we can use, with limitations, to target initiatives if supported by wider national data. There are two broad circumstances where health data must be collected: •Employees have a responsibility to inform their employer of any health conditions or disabilities that would interfere with their ability to perform their specified job tasks, or if these health conditions could put them or others at risk. •Health monitoring must be undertaken in accordance with Health and Safety at Work Regulations 2016, for example audiometry to detect work related, noise induced hearing loss. This is only required in there is known or likely exposure due to work tasks. In all other circumstances, disclosure of health data is not required by an employee to their employer. Voluntary disclosures can always be made by an employee however information must be kept in accordance with The Privacy Act 2020. Health data disclosed at pre-employment stage is not currently analysed at an organisational level to understand the health challenges faced by our employees. 17 18 Current & planned initiatives Current initiatives To ensure this roadmap is focused appropriately, we first need to identify current actions taken as an organisation to then determine what additional actions we could look to take to fill the gaps. Currently IR provides a range of initiatives that correspond with both the mandatory and voluntary aspects of health and safety protection, health promotion, and general wellbeing support. Note: ‘health’ refers to mental and physical health 19 With the introduction of the new HSW reporting tool Te Aka Oranga, People Leaders and members of the Executive Team have access to a dashboard showing real-time information including analytics to provide assurance that risks to HSW are being managed. 20 Current initiatives Business group and regional initiatives are also carried out on a frequent but ad-hoc basis, such as external speaker seminars for staff and campaigns to support NZ-wide campaigns including Mental Health Awareness Week and Pink Shirt Day. Staff Networks and our Health, Safety and Wellbeing Committees also engage in activities that promote overall health and wellbeing. 21 This diagram shows how our initiatives are holistic (whole person focused) and align with Te Whare Tapa Whā. It also represents the interconnectedness of all aspects of our Hauora/wellbeing. Some things we promote or offer target the hauora holistically, touching on all aspects of our experience. Leadership Mental Health Training Open minds e-learning Inclusive Leadership Framework External speaker webinars Hauora Hub (wellness platform) Leave entitlements Wellness rooms onsite HSW reporting tool Wellbeing & Resilience coaching Bullying/harassment/discrimination policy Planned initiatives We have based our planned initiatives on a review of national and international best practices along with an assessment of what is fit for IR in our current state. Investment in health, safety, and wellbeing requires a long-term commitment from Senior Leadership and People Leaders in order to support and promote these actions. Our immediate priority is to focus initial efforts on mental health protection initiatives, including support options. 22 To meet the goals detailed in this plan we will: •Undertake assessment of critical health and safety risk levels to maintain updated critical risk register •Conduct an annual Psychosocial Safety Climate survey across the organisation •Manage health, safety wellbeing incidents using Te Aka Oranga (IR’s reporting tool) •Analyse data collected from various other sources such as the People Experience Pulse (PXP) and Psychosocial Safety Climate survey to obtain a baseline of the psychosocial safety culture of our organisation in quarter one 2023. •Design and implement an anonymous survey to all staff quarterly, to determine the high-level effectiveness of Whanake conversations and perception of psychosocial safety •Assess the feasibility and options available for more comprehensive employee data •Assess with the help of HR Advisory, the benefit of reviewing and streamlining our Return-to-Work process to achieve better measurable outcomes for our people •Work closely with People Operations and Policy, and People Strategy and Capability teams to enhance leadership knowledge and support •Increase promotion of EAP by Vitae, particularly early intervention •Be involved in All of Government Mental Health Awareness Week initiatives •Continue to review and develop additional mental health support options in the future Roadmap: 2023-2024 23 Leadership MH trainingTrial a new approach to leadership MH training starting in Quarter 1 2023, focusing on new starters in leadership roles who did not complete STRIDE training. Recordings and resources available for all. Promote Open Minds e-learning for leaders (Mental Health Foundation) as a refresher opportunity. Mental health network Support the creation of a Mental Health Network as part of the suite of employee-led networks at IR. Primary purpose is to raise awareness, sign post information and destigmatise mental illness at IR. Risk and reportingNew fit for purpose H&S reporting tool to allow better risk register creating, risk and control monitoring and review, and incident data reporting and trend analysis. Senior leadership competency and sponsorshipSenior leadership (ELT) members to complete the GHSL officer training to better understand HSW risks and mitigation. Officer Development Programme, designed for public service agency senior leaders with officer responsibilities under the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 (HSWA) Business Leaders HS Forum benchmarkingThe use of the Business Leaders HS Forum benchmarking survey and initiative as a way of comparing IR to other agencies. Return to WorkReview and streamline our process for Return to Work to achieve better, more measurable outcomes with the employee’s holistic wellbeing at the centre. EAP promotionEnhance promotion of EAP by Vitae through internal advertising. Encourage early, proactive (preventative) usage, identify any barriers to access and solutions to decrease stigma Exit surveyReview exit survey process and available data in relation to health, safety, and wellbeing. Review questions included, specifically health, safety, wellbeing, and inclusion questions. Pre-employment info, induction, and onboardingWork alongside Talent to: Analyse recruitment criteria in relation to assessment of psychological suitability to ensure good fit. Review suitability for resilience criteria to be applied in certain roles. Contribute to an organisation wide review and update of induction and onboarding to ensure new starters are made aware of HSW risks, what IR does to prevent harm and all available support. HS Representatives (HSRs) - worker engagement Promote role, function, and engagement of HSRs in relation to health and wellbeing, not just safety. Acknowledge significance of their role. Offer appropriate training for the IR environment, including wellbeing, fatigue, discomfort, injury. Improve resources available to reps included updating the SharePoint page to create a ‘Rep Hub’.

There is ‘good work’, which is well designed, organised, and managed and protective of mental wellbeing. On the other hand, there is work that is toxic, containing one or more factors that significantly harm wellbeing. Aspects of work that harm or impair mental wellbeing are commonly referred to as psychosocial risks. These risks can cause mental harm which is costly to both individuals and organisations. The harm can be acute or chronic, result from a single or repeated exposure to risk(s) factors and range from mild psychological difficulties to severe psychological disorders e.g., depression, anxiety. It is estimated that mental health problems cost New Zealand business at least $1.65bn per annum. The WorkSafe Segmentation and Insights Programme Research (2019) found that in the last 12 months, 20% of respondents experienced depression, 31% anxiety, and 60% stress. The New Zealand Workplace Barometer (2020) reported that 70% of respondents reported an absence from work during the last 12 months due to ‘physical or mental health’. Protecting Mental Wellbeing at Work. Leading Safety / The Business Leaders’ Health and Safety Forum. 2021 The Psychological Health and Safety at Work Managing Psychosocial Risk Guidelines. (ISO/DIS 45003):2020 There are four approaches organisations can take to address mental wellbeing at work Each of the four approaches serves an important purpose. Using all four approaches enables organisations to meet their legal obligations and also to harness opportunities to help people to thrive at work, not simply survive 26 Measuring our progress Current & proposed metrics The following table explains how we will use available data to measure how well we are achieving our strategic objectives and outcomes: Objective (related outcome)Proposed metricsCurrent dataWhat does good look like?

Org Resilience 33 Appendices 34 Appendix A Definitions This roadmap is aimed our employee’s whole selves and is not limited to work-related risks. We acknowledge the limited influence IR has over non-work activities however understand the effect these have on work activities. This roadmap supports the wider WorkSafe Strategy and IR’s Positive Workplace Cultures Programme. The figure on the right from WorkSafe shows both mandatory areas of compliance as well as voluntary opportunities to promote better health and wellbeing. Legislative Requirements The Health and Safety at Work Act (HSWA, 2015) requires IR as the Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBU) firstly to eliminate all risks to personal health and safety as far as is reasonably practicable and if elimination is not possible, to minimize the risks as much as possible. Health and safety ri sks not only include physical injuries, but also work-related illnesses including physical and mental wellbeing. IR has a “duty of care” towards its employees. This legislation also requires that workers are given not only the correct and adequate equipment required to correctly perform their duties, but also the training needed to operate such equipment (HSWA, 2015). WorkSafe expects IR to not only protect their employees’ worker health, but also to promote general health and wellbeing, including positive mental health (WorkSafe New Zealand, 2017). Health The Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 states that health refers to both physical and mental health. The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” (WHO, 2021) Health and Safety Protection Initiatives Initiatives relating to our mandatory duty as a PCBU to prevent work related harm to workers. Health Promotion and Wellbeing Initiatives Initiatives not related to mandatory duty and are targeted to lifestyle-related health conditions such as obesity, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, as well as general resilience and wellbeing. Psychosocial Hazards Refers to the aspects of the design and management of work and its social and organisational contexts that may have the potential for causing psychological or physical harm. Psychosocial work environment The content of work and work demands, the social relationships at work, the organisation of work and the work culture, which each can affect the mental and physical well-being of workers including management. Health-Related Safety Risks WorkSafe define health-related safety risks as “an impairment or health condition that may adversely affect the safety of a worker or other person in the workplace.” “Health-related safety risks have the potential to lead to safety incidents and acute harm. In general, they fall into one of four risk categories: •Sensory risks: for example, changes in a worker’s hearing or eyesight may prevent them from correctly or quickly identifying and reacting to a workplace risk •Impairment risks: for example, fatigue may lead to reduced concentration •Mobility risks: for example, physical frailty may prevent a worker from moving out of the way of an oncoming vehicle •Incapacity risks: for example, an unknown or poorly controlled heart condition may lead to a worker suddenly losing consciousness while involved in a safety-critical task.” Spiritual Health Spiritual health includes who you are, what you believe in and where you have come from. “Spirituality means different things to different people. Spirituality speaks of the feelings we carry, our belief in or connectedness we feel, to that which is beyond the seen or tangible world. It can describe the meaning we attach to social groups, places, our religion or faith.” 35 Appendix B Te Whare Tapa Whā Te Whare Tapa Whā was first presented at a Māori Women’s Welfare League hui in 1982. In 1985, Mason Durie published a paper called A Māori perspective of health, which outlined differences in perspectives towards health by Western society and Māori. Durie presented a ‘traditional perspective’ of Māori health as being a ‘four-sided concept representing four basic tenets of life’ (Durie, 1985, p. 483). The balance and symmetry with each of these tenets were essential for wellbeing. The four components of wellbeing (on a foundation of whenua – land/roots) are: •Te taha wairua (spiritual wellbeing) •Te taha hinengaro (mental wellbeing) •Te taha tinana (physical wellbeing) •Te taha whānau (family wellbeing) The essential feature of Te Whare Tapa Whā is that it takes a holistic perspective to wellbeing, and that to achieve wellbeing, or health, each component needs to be in balance. 37 Appendix C PXP data & insights (Nov 22) 79% have completed at least 1 out of the last 3 PX Pulses (including this PX Pulse). Of those invited,20.2% have completed 1 out of last 3, 25.4% have completed 2 out of last 3, and 33.0% have completedthe last three. 74% of participants chose to share their dashboard with their people leader in Nov 22, which is comparable to other survey waves. 41 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 JulAugSepOctNovDecJanFebMarAprMayJun EAP Work-Related Topics 2021-22 FY Restructure/changePerformanceBullying/stress/discriminationCovid19Environment/conditionsWork relationshipsCareer Appendix E EAP data Usage of the EAP at IR is comparable to other organisations for the 2021-22 FY. Achieving Mentally Healthy Work (MHW) Roadmap for managing risks associated with psychosocial hazards 2024-2025 Our Vision That work at Inland Revenue is mentally healthy for all. Our people are less likely to experience mental harm at work and are supported to be healthy, well, engaged, and productive, to help us achieve our organisational objectives. Our Objectives and Measures 1 1.Prevent harm: Eliminate or minimise work-related risks to the mental health of our people. Measures: •Incidence of mental harm: trend data on frequency and severity of harm. •Survey data on leader competency and comfortability to manage relevant psychosocial hazards and risks. •Participation rates and satisfaction for resilience training and/or other mental health training we offer. •Patterns of use of overtime and flexi time. •Trends in annual leave usage. •Trends in Integrity and HR cases related to work-related mental harm. 2.Promote positive health and wellbeing: Maximise the opportunities to enhance the wellbeing of our people. Measures: •Satisfaction with outcomes/experience following requests for reasonable accommodation. •Usage rates for MHW material – SharePoint and external platform (e.g. Hauora Hub). •Satisfaction with range of information and support for mental wellbeing: e.g. as rated by Health & Safety Reps. •Work and Wellbeing PXP results/insights. 3.Support recovery when needed: Provide effective mental health support when our people need it. Measures: •# of Return to Work (RTW) programmes/support provided for illness including stress and poor mental health. •Satisfaction of person with RTW programmes, integrity/HR cases. •EAP usage and impact level data. Key Enablers •Leadership: Risk management of psychosocial hazards will have executive level ownership and oversight •Resourcing: The teams, systems, and initiatives for mentally healthy work will be appropriately resourced •Engagement: Solutions will be codesigned with our people 1 Measures noted are in addition to People Experience Pulse (PXP) and Moments that Matter survey insights. Item 2 Our Focus Areas and Immediate Actions We will: 1. Prevent Harm: Eliminate or minimise psychosocial risks through the design of work by: • Mentally Healthy Work by Design process: focus groups of the people doing the work conducting hazard identification and exposure process, protective factors, suggested improvements or changes to work design. For example, we may trial professional supervision for some teams, if the focus groups identify there being a need. – IN PROGRESS Develop the capability of leaders to identify, assess, and manage psychosocial risks by: • Leader Mental Health training, mentally healthy work leadership capability video and links, SharePoint site for leaders. – IN PROGRESS • Develop an updated leader capability programme for managing psychosocial risk. – NOT STARTED Develop effective systems to monitor and measure exposure to psychosocial risks and the effectiveness of our controls through: • Maximising the functions within Te Aka Oranga (reporting tool) for both reporting of hazards and incidents, as well as to monitor our controls in place and identify new opportunities. – IN PROGRESS • Exploring other methods of data including START and PXP to provide more oversight around exposure to psychosocial hazards and the effectiveness of existing controls. – IN PROGRESS 2. Promote Positive Health & Wellbeing: Motivate, encourage, and provide opportunities for our people to take control of their own physical and mental wellbeing by: • Procuring/embedding and promoting a new wellbeing platform/portal/tool with a wide range of resources, learning, tools for improving employee health literacy and health outcomes. – RFP IN PROGRESS Invest in increasing our people's health and wellbeing literacy by: • Developing more guidance for employees on mental wellbeing and managing psychosocial hazards. – IN PROGRESS 3. Support Recovery When Needed Provide support for our people where they are experiencing reduced mental health and wellbeing and/or where they may have been exposed to potentially distressing events by: • Reviewing our approach and process to access EAP entitlements. - NOT STARTED • Reviewing our RTW processes and support offered. – NOT STARTED • Reviewing our approach and processes with HR in regard to work-related stress/mental ill health, as well as our communication between People & Workplace Services functions to ensure seamless delivery of support to leaders and staff for both work-related and non-work-related mental ill health. – IN PROGRESS • Reviewing and updating our Reasonable Accommodations policy and guidelines to reference support in relation to mental illness. – COMPLETED
24OIA2074 Page 1 of 3 3 May 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 5 April 2024. You requested the following: Can you please provide for the 2022/23 and 2023/24 financial years, the number of times that the $250 penalty has been imposed on employers for filing their Employee Information (EI) and/or Employee Details (ED) payroll information late (more than 2 days after wages/salaries have been paid). I would like this information broken down by the number of times the penalty has been imposed on individual employers for each of the financial years requested E.g.: 10 times – xxx number of employers 5 times – xxx number of employers 4 times – xxx number of employers, and so forth I would also like to know: \* the total sum of the penalties imposed (split between original penalty, and any subsequent default interest penalties) \* the amount still to be paid for each of the two financial years requested (ideally being split as above between original penalty and any subsequent default interest penalties) \* the total amount that has been written off, forgiven, or reversed (irrespective of the reason for such action – ideally split as noted above). The value of a late filing penalty for the late filing of an Employment Information (EI ) is the greater of $250, or $1 per employee employed at any time during that month. Late payment penalties are not applied specifically to an unpaid late filing penalty, but use of money interest is applied to unpaid amounts. The interest values provided are the use of money interest that was directly charged to the unpaid balance of the late filing penalty, excluding interest applied for other purposes, for example unpaid PAYE. Any penalties that have been reversed are not included in the information provided. It is important to note the distinction between a write off / remission and a reversal of a penalty. A write off / remission is applied to grant relief to correctly applied penalties, whereas a reversal is the removal of a penalty that has been incorrectly charged. The table below outlines the number of entities that have received late filing penalties (LFPs) due to filing their EI or Employee Details (ED) late, for both the 2023 and 2024 financial years. As the 2024 financial year is still in progress, the data provided for this year spans 1 July 2023 through 29 April 2024. 24OIA2074 Page 2 of 3 # of LFPs 2023 2024 1 7,735 7,768 2 2,993 3,053 3 1,367 1,394 4 782 826 5 507 507 6 339 330 7 249 287 8 197 214 9 161 194 10 134 129 11+ 214 187 Total: 14,678 14,889 The following table outlines for the 2023 and 2024 financial years, the total number of penalties applied, the sum of penalties imposed, and any subsequent interest applied to that penalty. Further to this, the dollar value of penalties written off, paid, and yet to be paid. As with the previous table, because the 2024 financial year is still in progress, the data reported spans 1 July 2023 through 29 April 2024. Values 2023 2024 Total penalties charged (count) 39,236 36,682 Total penalties charged ($) 9,242,012 9,430,840 Total interest charged ($) 329,325 208,572 Total value of write-offs/remissions ($) -1,514,071 -1,022,451 Total value of payments / credits ($) -5,438,843 -4,682,534 Current balance remaining to be paid ($) 2,618,422 3,934,428 Inland Revenue systems do not collate financial information in such a way that captures the proportion of unpaid amounts relating to assessments, penalties, and interest. As such, the part of your request seeking what comprises the total amount unpaid is refused under section 18(g) of the OIA, as the information you have requested is not held by Inland Revenue, nor do I have reason to believe it is held by another agency. 24OIA2074 Page 3 of 3 Right of review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz . Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman by email at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz. If you choose to have an internal review, you can still ask the Ombudsman for a review. Publishing of OIA response We intend to publish our response to your request on Inland Revenue’s website (www.ird.govt.nz ) as this information may be of interest to other members of the public. This letter, with your personal details removed, may be published in its entirety. Publishing responses increases the availability of information to the public and is consistent with the OIA's purpose of enabling more effective participation in the making and administration of laws and policies and promoting the accountability of officials.

24OIA2110 Page 1 of 3 7 May 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 12 April 2024. You requested the following (numbered for ease of response): 1.Please provide me with a copy of the documents that Inland Revenue provided to prospective submitted as part of the RFP process referred to on GETS as RFx ID 27630251. This RFP/tender closed on Tuesday, 1 August 2023 and the contact person was Michelle Knapton/TendersMGT@ird.govt.nz. 2.Please provide me with a copy of the winning proposal from each of the three selected providers (Haemata Tāpui Limited, Online Reo Agency Limited, TupuOra Education and Development limited). I understand that you may need to react commercially sensitive information. Item 1 Attached is a copy of the documents that were provided to prospective submitters as part of the RFP process. These documents were available with the GETS notice relevant to the Te Arapiki tenders. The attachment titled Request for Proposal – Te Arapiki is the main document. The attachments marked as appendices A-E are the relevant appendices that are discussed in the main attachment. Item 2 Consideration has been given on the release of the three winning submissions for Te Arapiki, however releasing the detailed information about the tenderer’s business (for example, detailed information about its internal organisation, plans, or products, or explanations as to how it proposes to meet Inland Revenue’s expectations and requirements) may confer a competitive advantage on the tenderer’s competitors, with a corresponding adverse effect on the tenderer. Competitors could copy or adopt the tenderer’s submission in future negotiations or tenders, which would unreasonably prejudice their commercial position. Releasing information that tenderers would regard as confidential, due to its commercial sensitivity or otherwise, could make tenderers cautious about sharing detailed information with Inland Revenue in the future, which would make it harder for Inland Revenue to make informed Inland Revenue RFP – Te Arapiki 28-06-2023 Request for Proposal Template version 20190630 Page 1 of 38 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Request for Proposal (RFP) The Design and Delivery of Learning Assets for Te Arapiki TEARA - 001 RFP Release Date: 28-06-23 Deadline for Questions: 11 07-23 Deadline for Proposals: 12PM 25-07-23 Inland Revenue RFP – Te Arapiki 28-06-2023 Request for Proposal Template version 20190630 Page 2 of 38 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Table of Contents SECTION 1: Purpose of this document .................................................................................... 5 What we need ................................................................................................................................ 5 What’s important to us .............................................................................................................. 5 Why should you bid ..................................................................................................................... 5 SECTION 2: Context ....................................................................................................................... 6 Who we are ..................................................................................................................................... 6 Our timeline .................................................................................................................................... 7 How to contact us ........................................................................................................................ 7 SECTION 3: The RFP Process ...................................................................................................... 8 Developing your proposal ......................................................................................................... 8 Deadline for questions ................................................................................................................ 8 Later changes to the RFP or RFP process ........................................................................... 9 Submitting your Proposal .......................................................................................................... 9 Address for submitting your proposal ................................................................................ 10 SECTION 4: Our Requirements ................................................................................................ 11 Background ................................................................................................................................... 11 Supplier Attributes ..................................................................................................................... 11 Scope .............................................................................................................................................. 11 Requirements ............................................................................................................................... 12 SECTION 5: Our Evaluation Approach ................................................................................... 13 Evaluation Model ........................................................................................................................ 13 Pre-Conditions ............................................................................................................................. 13 Modular Responses .................................................................................................................... 13 Evaluation Criteria ..................................................................................................................... 14 .............................................................................................................

Do not refer to an answer provided in another section, e.g. “see question 1.1 for response”. Where additional information is needed before an adequate response can be made to any question, please attempt to obtain that information from IR through the process outlined at Section 2 rather than including assumptions in your Proposal. Your Proposal must, however, identify where you have made assumptions, and the impact of those assumptions. A response which is too general, like “it depends upon IR” or “more information required”, will be considered inadequate. Deadline for questions Each Respondent should satisfy itself as to the interpretation of the RFP. If there is any perceived ambiguity or uncertainty in the RFP document/s Respondents should seek clarification before the Deadline for Questions. All requests for clarification must be made by email to our Point of Contact. We will endeavour to respond to requests in a timely manner, but not later than the deadline to answer Respondents’ questions in Section 2, if applicable.

Inland Revenue RFP – Te Arapiki 28-06-2023 Request for Proposal Template version 20190630 Page 11 of 38 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] SECTION 4: Our Requirements Background Te Arapiki is a capability development framework that all staff and leaders in IR and the organisation itself can use to plan, develop and monitor progress and development against Māori Crown capabilities. Te Arapiki means the stairway and is a levels-based training framework to support IR people to uplift their Maōri cultural capability. It aligns with Te Arawhiti guidance and Public Sector Act requirements. Supplier Attributes We are open to a single partner or a consortium arrangement to provide the development of learning assets and workshops across New Zealand. If we feel one provider may not be able to deliver specific assets within the full suite of learning, we may choose to procure multiple providers or work with selected providers to deliver a consortium approach. While this project is largely driven out of Wellington, wānanga will be delivered across New Zealand, so some travel within New Zealand or national reach will be required. IR is technology enabled and can also utilise tools like MS Teams to support delivery from anywhere in New Zealand. It is expected the delivery partner or partners will have subject matter expertise across a range of disciplines: • Tiriti of Waitangi and te reo me ōnā tikanga Māori knowledge, to develop accurate learning assets at a range of levels from foundation to capable, as described in Appendix E; • Project/programme management to support the IR Te Arapiki Delivery Lead in the successful delivery of learning assets against key milestones • Learning Design to ‘surround’ learners with different learning assets and to work with IR to align detailed learning design to IR’s ‘Learning Cluster’ approach to Learning & Development; • Workshop design and facilitation to develop and deliver learning for staff at Foundation level, and to coach IR staff to deliver these workshops on an ongoing basis; • Change management – to support the Change Lead and change management activities prior to launch of Te Arapiki; • Agile and co-design – to support the pull and iterative development (including pilot of learning assets prior to release) and to work with IR and potential multiple vendors. We expect the provider has immediate capacity to deliver the services sought in this RFP. Scope In scope is the delivery of a range of learning assets to uplift IR staff’s Te Ao Māori capability and understanding of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. Inland Revenue RFP – Te Arapiki 28-06-2023 Request for Proposal Template version 20190630 Page 12 of 38 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Requirements While all potential solutions will be considered, IR’s preference is for a solution which includes: • Learning assets to be developed in accordance with the high and mid-level learning design, in partnership with IR; • Learning asset deliverables that are custom made to be owned by IR and uploaded to existing learning platforms; • Pre-existing learning assets to be owned or licenced (e.g. te reo Māori) as identified by the provider in this RFP; • Costs calculated based on estimated time and hours to design and develop assets where possible, with any ongoing costs calculated separately. • Supporting wānanga and workshops to be developed and delivered in partnership with IR. The solution should provide learning assets against the subject matter and in the format provided at Appendix E. IR would prefer to see the first learning assets/opportunities made available to staff no later than Q1, 2024. Dependent of the approach of the successful Respondent(s) this might be either partial or full implementation of the Te Arapiki programme. Other information New Intellectual Property arising because of the Contract will be the property of Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue is looking to share the new Intellectual Property across some other Crown entities where appropriate.

Rather, we wish to obtain the best public value over the whole-of-life of the Contract. This means achieving the right combination of fit for purpose, quality, on time delivery, quantity, and overall affordability. If a Respondent offers a price that is substantially lower than other Proposals (an abnormally low bid), we may seek to verify with the Respondent that the Respondent is capable of fully delivering all Inlathe Requirements and meeting all of the conditions of the Proposed Contract for the price quoted. Required Pricing Information Respondents are to provide their price as part of their Proposal. In submitting the Price the Respondent must meet the following: ▪ Respondents are to use the pricing schedule template provided (Appendix C). ▪ The pricing schedule is to show a breakdown of all costs, fees, expenses and charges associated with the full delivery of the Requirements over the whole-of-life of the Contract. Include any ongoing licence fee. It must also clearly state the total Contract price exclusive of GST. ▪ Where the price, or part of the price, is based on fee rates, all rates are to be specified, either hourly or daily or both as required. ▪ in preparing their Proposal, Respondents are to consider all risks, contingencies and other circumstances relating to the delivery of the Requirements and include adequate provision in the Proposal and pricing information to manage such risks and contingencies. ▪ Respondents are to document in their Proposal all assumptions and qualifications made about the delivery of the Requirements, including in the financial pricing information. Any assumption that Inland Revenue or a third party will incur any cost related to the delivery of the Requirements is to be stated, and the cost estimated if possible. ▪ Prices should be tendered in NZ$. Unless otherwise agreed, Inland revenue will arrange contractual payments in NZ$. ▪ Where a Respondent has an alternative method of pricing (i.e., a pricing approach that is different to the pricing schedule) this can be submitted as an alternative pricing model. However, the Respondent must also submit a pricing schedule that conforms. ▪ Where two or more Respondents intend to lodge a joint or consortium Proposal the pricing schedule is to include all costs, fees, expenses and charges chargeable by all Respondents.

Organisations across public and private sectors are moving to adopt these solutions and identify the ways that these solutions can support them in achieving better outcomes, and also how these solutions pose risk. IR has developed an AI staff use policy which will be available soon which should be read first by all staff at IR to understand what is permitted, and what restrictions have been put in place. To provide additional guidance on how staff should use these tools the classification of the information or question space is important to understand. The tables below are designed to provide more clarity around specific use cases. It is impossible to represent all use cases within IR in a single view, however this table will be regularly updated with new use cases as IR evolves its understanding of this landscape.

Get in touch Artificial Intelligence AI 1 Ka whakamahi nga kaimahi AI i nga kaupapa here Artificial Intelligence (AI) staff use policy This policy sets out the requirements for using AI products and services for staff at Inland Revenue Note: a glossary of terms is available in this policy. Why we have this policy This policy sets out Inland Revenue’s approach to safely and securely look to use AI in the workplace, to help make good decisions and deliver services that are more effective and efficient. It is a priority for IR to ensure that AI is adopted in a way that considers not only our obligations under the Revenue Acts and Privacy Act but also under the Algorithm Charter for Aotearoa New Zealand and any other NZ Government authoritative guidance. This includes embedding a Te Ao Māori perspective in the development and use of algorithms consistent with the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. In addition to these absolute requirements, as a leading public agency, we must also robustly assess the security, privacy, operational and technical impacts that any new AI solution or use case brings, and then the associated transparency of this to the public. This is a rapidly evolving area, and this policy is subject to change. Who this policy applies to This policy applies to a user if you are using or considering the use of AI products and services for an Inland Revenue purpose and are: •An Inland Revenue employee •A contingent worker (consultant, contractor or otherwise) working for Inland Revenue with access to Inland Revenue systems and information Your responsibility As someone working for Inland Revenue, you are responsible for understanding and following this policy. This means: Compliance Measurement Inland Revenue may verify compliance to this policy through various methods, including, but not limited to, business tool reports, internal and external audits, and feedback to the policy owner. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Staff Use Policy Not in scope 2 Non-Compliance For IR employees, if any possible compliance issue is identified appropriate action will be taken, including referral to IR’s Integrity team for consideration under Inland Revenue’s Code of Conduct – Tikanga Whanonga. For non-employees (contingent workers/contractors/suppliers) any possible compliance issues would be escalated and managed consistent with written agreements/ contractual arrangements. Exemptions Any exemption to the policy must go through the required process. See the Exemptions Standard for more information. Our policy 1. Principles To help guide our thinking and behaviour, Inland Revenue has defined some key principles to apply to AI use cases. Where these principles are not able to be met, it may present additional risks to Inland Revenue that need to be considered and appropriate action taken. • Transparency - we will maintain transparency by clearly explaining how decisions are informed by algorithms. This applies both internally, promoting transparency within our working teams, and with our customers and partners around how we will utilize these tools. • Human oversight – we will retain human oversight to assess for unintended consequences and act on this information. This includes understanding limitations and identifying and managing bias. • Partnership – we will embed a Te Ao Māori perspective in the development and use of algorithms consistent with the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. • Ethics – public trust in how Inland Revenue manages data makes us all data stewards. Our AI systems should respect human rights, diversity and the autonomy of individuals and not result in unfair discrimination against individuals, communities or groups. • Integrity - unauthorised access, misuse or security incidents involving the use of AI tools/solutions will be reported to Information Security. • Robust testing – we will use a robust testing and review process to evaluate the use of new AI systems and tools, or updates to existing tools that have adopted increased functionality. 2. Adoption of AI solutions Any new proposed use case for an AI or Large Language Model (LLM) tool, AI integrated tool, or new use of an AI tool should be escalated through Inland Revenue’s AI Oversight Group and AI Working Group (contact InformationSecurity@ird.govt.nz). This ensures adequate testing, review and consideration is applied to all use cases, and prevents effort duplication and risk. Existing common workplace technologies that use AI do not require new consideration or exemption. Some examples are listed in the glossary. If you are unsure about the current approval status of a system for use with your business unit or information, please contact InformationSecurity@ird.govt.nz. Not in scope 3 3. Creation of content Users Must Not: • Use any AI/LLM or other intelligent tool that is not approved for use, or use an approved tool/solution for an unapproved use case. • Use any information classified as Sensitive or above with an AI/LLM solution. • Intentionally generate, or use AI/LLMs to create any misleading, illegal, discriminatory or offensive content. • Process or use in AI/LLM solutions, any information that is reasonably capable of being used to identify an Inland Revenue customer (or Inland Revenue staff) without express approval and consideration from the AI Oversight Group. • Process or use commercially In-Confidence information without express approval and consideration from the AI Oversight Group. • Provide automated financial, legal, tax advice, guidance, or AI/LLM information to another party (either internal or external) without human involvement. • Infringe upon copyright or other right of use in operation of AI/LLMs. Users Must: • Consistently review and confirm the accuracy of any generated AI/LLM output (including text, audio, visual or other) or intelligent system output. This includes specifically checking for code or technical information. Robust technical testing must be performed to ensure this type of content is free from security issues. • Review intelligent system output for potential bias, ethical concerns, and unintended messaging. • Make clear through visual, verbal or written indicators/mechanisms the use of AI/LLM and other intelligent solutions in content they produce or contribute to. • Consider IR’s Enterprise Risk policy and framework to ensure a wider risk consideration is given for the use. • Seek the approval of the AI Oversight Group for proposed use cases of unapproved AI/LLM use cases or solutions. • Acknowledge that any information produced in part or whole by an AI system will be attributable to the Inland Revenue staff working with that information, and ultimately Inland Revenue will be responsible for the quality and outcomes of that information. 4. Disposal of content The retention and disposal of any AI information or knowledge will be handled in conjunction with Inland Revenue current retention and disposal rules and processes. Not in scope 1 Kaupapahere Haumarutanga korero Information Security Policy This policy outlines the approach to information security for Inland Revenue. This policy is our overarching information security policy and is supported by our other specific information security policies and standards. Why we have this policy IR must be trusted by its customers and partners as an organisation for protecting the information they share with us or that is generated by us. This information security policy aims to provide the high-level direction for information security at IR. It provides the guidance for how information which IR collects, processes, shares or stores, in whatever form, is kept secure. This will assist us in complying with our obligations under the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). Below are two key extracts from the TAA which set out those obligations: “Every Minister and every officer of any government agency having responsibilities under this Act or any other Act in relation to the collection of taxes and other functions under the Inland Revenue Acts are at all times to use their best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system. – Section 6(1).” “A revenue officer must keep confidential all sensitive revenue information and must not disclose the information unless the disclosure is a permitted disclosure that meets the requirements of sections 18D to 18J – Section 18(1).” There are other Legislative, government requirements and industry standards may also govern and control the way we handle and protect information. These are listed in the ‘Finding out more’ section below. Who this policy applies to This policy applies to you if you are: •An IR employee •A contractor working for IR or with access to IR systems/information •A third-party with access to IR systems/information Third-party vendors and contractors are also responsible for any sub-contractors (or any sub-sub- contractors, etc) which have access to IR assets. Sub-contractors of third-party vendors must also meet all IR requirements and be approved by IR. It also applies to all information systems, networks and mobile devices that store, transfer, process, connect with or communicate to our applications and databases, along with internet-based services and services that may be located overseas (or in the cloud). Information Security Policy Not in scope 2 The requirements of this policy apply wherever you are, including whether you are working remotely, travelling overseas or in a business continuity crisis mode (for example, being away from your normal place of work due to a disaster). In this policy, “information” refers to information in any format that IR creates, receives, uses, holds or maintains. An “information system” includes the entire architecture of a service or any subcomponent that stores, processes or transfers information. Your responsibility As someone working for IR, you are responsible for understanding and following this policy. This means: Compliance Measurement The Assurance, Integrity or Cyber Security Operations teams may verify compliance to this policy and in conjunction with the IR Code of Conduct through various methods, including but not limited to, business tool reports, internal and external audits, and feedback to the policy owner. Exemptions Any exemption to the policy must go through the required process. See the information of security exemptions for more information. Non-Compliance If you have been found not to have complied with this policy, then the appropriate action will be taken. Our policy 1.Principles To help guide our Information Security thinking and behaviour IR has defined some key security principles. These principles will not only guide our thinking but help to embed our secure by design approach to our information security for both digital and non-digital pathways. Where these principles are not able to be met, it may present additional risks to IR that need to be considered and appropriate action taken. There are three main information security principles: •Confidentiality – information is accessed to those authorised to have access. •Integrity – Making sure that the information is not modified by unauthorised users, and changes by authorised users are tracked to ensure the integrity is maintained. •Availability – information/systems are accessible when authorised users need it. There are six supporting principles: •Authentication – we will verify a user's identity to ensure that the person requesting access is authorised. •Non-repudiation –the ability for a system to prove that a specific user sent a message and that it hasn't been modified. •Need to know – a person will be provided with only the information that they need to successfully fulfil their role. Not in scope 3 •Least privilege – we will only authorise users the privileges needed to undertake their duties. •Defence in-depth – we will use multiple and coordinated security countermeasures to protect the information assets in our organisation. •Segregation – we will ensure our user roles, systems architecture and design incorporate separation and segregation to establish trust zones, define security domains and enforce boundaries. 2.This Policy It is important that your actions foster a culture of security at IR. You, and any staff you are responsible for (including contractors/non-workers) must be adequately trained by completing the standard onboarding security training, the required annual refresher training and continue to regularly complete security training in our Learning Management Platform. IR has specific policies and standards which provide further guidance on different areas of Information Security. It is important that these other policies and standards are used as the foundation for anything we do at IR. Our corporate Information Security Intranet provides the collection of guidance documents, Policies and Standards to help you in your day-to-day IR life or help you to comply when undertaking projects. This Policy sets the overall direction of Information Security for IR and authorises Policies which need to be read in conjunction with this one. For example, our library of Policies and Standards cover, expectations such as: •Never giving out or share your usernames and passwords. •Using different passwords for different IR systems and personal accounts. •Taking care to use the correct address when sending emails. •Never using a generic account that doesn’t identify you or an account that doesn’t belong to you, to access IR information. •Classification of IR information to manage the security and privacy of internal and external customers. •Ensuring conversations of a sensitive nature are not overheard by others, either at your place of work or in public places. •Taking care to keep documents and information on portable devices protected using encryption and physical security measures if you take them out of the office. •Never representing IR using your private email address, or forward work emails or business information to your private email address. •Accessing and using IR information and systems only for authorised IR business purposes. •Never disabling, circumventing, or removing the security mechanisms on IR provided devices (i.e. laptops, mobile phones). •Never forwarding unknown or suspicious email attachments. •Never clicking on links or attachments in suspicious emails. •Conducting IR business securely always, even in a crisis. •Allowing access to all your equipment and files used in your work at IR if requested for security checks. •Immediately reporting any actual or suspected loss, theft, or improper use of or access to IR information by raising a request in ServiceNow •Following all documented procedures in response to any ICT security incident. Not in scope become. AI systems that use low quality data or small datasets will have less reliable and accurate results.  Types of Artificial Intelligence There are many ways to categorise or group different types of AI including by functionality and capability. The following is a traditional perspective on types of AI: All existing types of AI are known as Artificial Narrow Intelligence or Weak AI. They are built to perform a specific task autonomously and perfectly using human like capabilities.  There are two types of AI known as Artificial General Intelligence and Artificial Super Intelligence, these do not currently exist. Artificial General Intelligence are systems that can learn, perceive, understand and function completely like human beings whereas Artificial Super Intelligence, has similar processing capabilities that humans do, has a greater memory and is faster. For more information see our related resources above.  What are the opportunities? AI presents an opportunity for IR to deliver improved services across our organisation. As an organisation we need to be deliberate in our decision making to balance risk, opportunity and return on our investments.  Consider how these AI functions could help us in future:  Pulling together short summaries of information based on a text prompt such as a question or a meeting recording.  Identifying connections and patterns in data that humans cannot and adjusting actions it takes in real-time.  Acting as a chatbot that provides real time guidance while an individual completes a task.  Automating systems and processes for simple and some complex tasks while flagging more complex work for human review.  Recognising changing trends and behaviours in our society and within specific groups of people. There is significant opportunity to achieve better outcomes for IR and our customers, and significant and unique risks that AI poses or increases that we will need to mitigate. To understand how we do this, we need an understanding of how the technology behind AI works. IR already uses and has invested in AI in a number of areas (see AI application register for more information), your welcome to familiarise yourself with the capabilities we have available to us and understand when/how we should use them. This is something we can do now to deliver better outcomes for our customers.  To understand how we are currently using this technology see Using Artificial Intelligence at IR.  Concepts, categories and definitions within Artificial Intelligence There are key concepts that will be important in helping you navigate the world of AI.   Concepts Diagram: How algorithms function at a high level. An Algorithm is a set of steps or instructions for solving a problem or performing a task.  Categories Business rules are the simplest type of machine ‘intelligence’, they use simple logic and processing to reach an outcome. Examples of this include decision trees and if/else statements. These machines do not undergo a ‘training’ process.  START, Ātea and ServiceNow all utilise business rules to complete some tasks.  Machine learning (ML) is a branch of AI that enables machines to improve at tasks (e.g. decision making) with experience relying on the data, algorithms and training. Haukāinga and our external website searches using machine learning to provide the most relevant results to users, see How we use Artificial Intelligence for more information.  AI integrated tools refers to solutions that already exist in our work where a vendor has integrated an AI component into their tool.  In many cases we may not have an option to stop or control an AI component in a particular solution and over time, AI will increasingly be included in all software tools.  Deep learning (DL) is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks to learn in a way similar to how humans do. It requires massive amounts of data and can learn from its own environment and past mistakes .  Generative artificial intelligence commonly known as GenAI, is a type of AI that can create new content using deep learning.  Gen AI can create a wide range of content including text, audio, videos and computer code.  Definitions Artificial neural networks (ANN) are a branch of machine learning that enables machines to process data in a similar way to how the neurons in our brains do. Neurons send messages or signals to one another. Neural networks do the same using layers of nodes that send data amongst one- another.  Large language model (LLM) are systems that have processed large amounts of text (usually from the internet) using neural networks. It allows you to input a text prompt and will generate a text response by repeatedly predicting the next word in a sentence or paragraph. Natural language processing (NLP) aims to give systems the ability to understand and create human speech. It does this through analysing the relationship between words in sentences (syntactic) and the meaning of words together (semantic).  1 Status Report Weekly update for the Minister of Revenue Week commencing: Monday 20 July 2020 Date issued: Thursday 16 July 2020 Excerpt from Status Report: Weekly update for the Minister of Revenue Not in scope 2 New Topical Issues New items since the last Status Report (issued on 9 July 2020). Not in scope Not in scope 5 Signing of the Algorithm Charter As part of ensuring New Zealanders have trust and confidence in the ways agencies use and steward data and information, the Government Chief Data Steward, a function within Stats NZ, has led the development of an Algorithm Charter (in conjunction with agencies) for agency adoption. Algorithms are used to help make good decisions and deliver services that are more effective and efficient. Algorithms can also mitigate the risk that human biases will impact the administration of government services and result in real benefits for everyone. However, the decisions they make or inform can be impacted by bias in the data the algorithm is created from, what is taken into consideration when making a decision, and how well decisions are validated. The Algorithm Charter focuses on demonstrating agency commitment to the management of algorithms where there is a potentially high risk of these biases being included. It also ensures there is sufficient human oversight throughout the development of an algorithm and how it operates to limit biases and reflect what is intended as much as possible. Inland Revenue is already part way through implementing its formalised enterprise data and information governance approach in which the principles of the charter are already established. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be signing the Algorithm Charter for Inland Revenue on 17 July 2020. Not in scope Page 2 government uses algorithms, and the ways Government makes sure algorithms are being used responsibly and transparently. Between August 2019 and July 2020 the Government Chief Data Steward have iterated through several versions of an Algorithm Charter. These iterations have involved agency consultation in August and September 2019, public consultation between October and December 2019, and further agency consultation between January and July 2020. Thro ughout 2019 and 2020 many people across Inland Revenue engaged on the Charter development and provided feedback which was summarised and sent to Stats NZ. The level of support for an algorithm charter varied. Points raised were focused on these areas: •Almost all algorithms implemented at Inland Revenue are partial or full automations of business rules defined by legislation and these are already publicly disclosed on the web site. •Inland Revenue would want to keep some of its algorithms undisclosed to support the integrity of the tax system. •Determination of likelihood and impact as per the Charter risk matrix are largely subjective and will vary by practitioner and agency. •Inland Revenue already incorporates most of the Charter mitigations and controls. The Charter is intended to demonstrate a commitment by government agencies to carefully manage how algorithms will be used to strike the right balance between privacy and transparency, prevent unintended bias and reflect the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. Inland Revenue has provided comprehensive feedback on each iteration of the Charter. The Government Chief Data Steward have settled on a risk assessed approach to determining the degree of scrutiny and safeguards applied to each algorithm an agency operates. Risk is intended to be assessed before any controls and safeguards have been applied to an algorithm. The Charter commits adopting agencies to: •Making an assessment of the impac t of decisions informed by their algorithms. •Applying the Algorithm Charter commitments as guided by the identified risk rating. The Charter commitments are (abridged): •Maintain transparency by clearly explaining how decisions are informed by algorithms. •Deliver clear public benefit through Treaty commitments. resulting Algorithm Assessment Report was to let New Zealanders know how the Not in scope Page 3 The Charter will be reviewed annually.

Statistics NZ’s Algorithm Charter for Aotearoa New Zealand The Data Strategy and Governance Lead covered the intent, development, and adoption of the All of Government Algorithm Charter (the Charter). The intent of the Charter is to engender the public’s trust and confidence in how Government agencies steward and use data algorithms. The Charter takes a risk-based approach to minimising the potential negative impacts to New Zealanders from algorithms. Potential impacts on IR to implement the Charter highlighted by members were: o How agencies operationalise the Charter is central to its success. o It’s likely a change in the awareness of principles, processes, and practices will be required along with a strengthening of what is currently in place. o IR might need to increase its transparency about its diligence in its use of data and algorithms. Inland Revenue is incorporating the Charter into work underway within the wider Data and Intelligence work programme, and Data and Information Governance work programme, to operationalise the Charter commitments. Decisions: DIGA endorsed incorporation of the Charter into how Inland Revenue works with data and algorithms.

We have adopted the algorithm charter and mandated data standards, and have a very constructive working relationship with Stats NZ as the functional lead for data. Through this work, we are supporting and enabling the New Zealand economy and public service to become increasingly digital. 2.Ensuring that Inland Revenue has appropriate safeguards and protections in place is a critical component of the work we do. Customers entrust us with sensitive information about their financial and personal circumstances, and we take our obligation to protect their information and keep it confidential very seriously. Policies and procedures are in place to ensure that we meet our legislative obligations and retain our customers’ trust. 3.We share information with a wide range of other agencies, to help smooth customers’ experiences when dealing with government and deliver better outcomes for them.

It has been prepared in response to the questions asked when the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner, Transformation appeared before the Cabinet Government Administration and Expenditure Review Committee on 8 July 2021 to discuss the Cabinet paper Inland Revenue’s July 2021 Transformation Update. How Inland Revenue manages and uses data and information 6.Inland Revenue has significant data and information collection powers and many information sharing arrangements in place. To ensure we act with integrity and engender trust and confidence amongst New Zealanders, we have established a data and information governance programme. The programme is helping to ensure we have transparent and accountable governance arrangements that provide oversight of our management and use of data, so that we act knowingly, responsibly, and with integrity. 7.We have defined a set of capabilities and established a governance framework (as shown in the diagram below) to: •Support the delivery of our strategic objectives. •Ensure information and tools are in place for our people to access guidance and make the decisions they should. •Provide guidance and decisions where it is most appropriate for a governance group to do so. 8.The programme is not yet complete and continues to focus on incorporating increased due diligence, including ethical considerations, into our collection, use, and stewardship of data and information. The work we do with other agencies is a key input into the programme. Algorithm charter 9.Inland Revenue is a signatory to the algorithm charter for Aotearoa New Zealand, and contributed significantly to its development. The Government Chief Data Steward (GCDS), the functional lead role for data delegated to the Chief Executive Stats NZ, has acknowledged our commitment to ensuring the algorithm charter is of a high quality and Not in scope 4 IR2021/334: Inland Revenue’s contribution to advancing Government data outcomes readily implementable. Stats NZ has favourably recognised our plan for implementing the algorithm charter. 10.To ensure Inland Revenue meets the commitments in the charter, we have developed a plan setting out what we need to do to improve our governance and management of data. We have also incorporated the commitments of the algorithm charter into our data and information policy, which sets the foundations for our data governance. 11.We have already begun putting the foundations in place and have established a data governance framework as noted above, along with policies and standards for managing data ethically. These are consistent with the commitments in the algorithm charter. Our next area of focus will be working with functional areas, such as our analytical teams, to ensure that they understand and adopt the agreed frameworks, policies and standards. 12.It is important to note that the charter does not define what an algorithm is. Each agency is responsible for identifying the algorithms that will have the highest risk of unintended consequences and/or significant impacts if things do go wrong. We are currently refreshing our approach to cataloguing algorithms and analytical models as part of the data and information governance programme noted above. 13.We are sharing our experiences and what we are putting in place with others. We have discussed the work we are undertaking regarding data governance and management with many agencies including Stats NZ, the Treasury, the Social Wellbeing Agency, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment ( MBIE), ACC, and the Ministry of Social Development (MSD). Earlier in 2021, we met with the representatives from the Chilean Government regarding our implementation of the Charter, along with MSD and MBIE. Mandated data standards 14.Inland Revenue has committed to adopting the data standards mandated by the GCDS. The intent of the current standards is to ensure that agencies exchange key data in the same format, for example all agencies using the same format for dates. 15.We have contributed significantly to the development of the three currently mandated standards f or an individual’s date of birth, name and street address. These standards are being incorporated into the guidance we give to the agencies that provide us with data to analyse. 16.We are working closely with Stats NZ on the development of fu rther data standards, and have invited Stats NZ to be members of our data governance groups. Together, we are developing a plan to further improve the way our two agencies work together. 17.Importantly, the outcomes and lessons learned from this plan will be shared with other agencies, to contribute to the broader advancement of data management in the wider pub lic sector. Security and privacy 18.Everyone who works for Inland Revenue has a legislative obligation to protect the integrity of the revenue system and keep sensitive revenue information confidential. It is an obligation we take very seriously. 19.We have strict rules and restrictions on integrity matters such as staff accessing customer information. Routine monitoring is in place to check for potential wrong-doing and ensure that incidents are investigated properly and fairly. Not in scope 5 IR2021/334: Inland Revenue’s contribution to advancing Government data outcomes Privacy 20.We routinely conduct privacy impact assessments whenever we are considering the use of new data and information, and when we use existing data in new ways. The assessment sets out what data we are using and why, how we will store it, who will have access to it, and the controls we have in place. 21.Each year, we complete an assessment of privacy capability using the Government Chief Privacy Officer’s (GCPO) privacy assessment framework. For the year ending 30 June 2021, we met four of the five core expectations, and all but one of the other 11 elements. We were assessed as having strong maturity in culture, breach and incident management, and policies and process. 22.We report to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner each year on the information we share under information matching and approved information-sharing agreements (AISAs). We have AISAs with the Ministry of Social Development (MSD), the Police, the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA), and the NZ Gang Intelligence Centre. We also liaise with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner on any new policy or process that may impact on privacy. 23.All privacy breaches are reported. For the year ending 30 June 2021, 124 breaches were reported. The number of breaches has been stable. The majority of breaches are minimal or minor, using the GCPO breach-reporting matrix, as only a small number of people were impacted and there was little or no indication of systemic issues. Security 24.Threats are occurring more frequently and are increasingly sophisticated. Tax agencies are seen as an attractive target, given the data we ho ld and our large volumes and value of financial transactions. We have plans in place should a threat materialise, so we are well prepared. 25.Although we have very good systems and processes in place to prevent privacy and security breaches, it is not possible to fully mitigate against the possibility of human error. Assurance 26.Our internal assurance team have a risk-based assurance programme that includes assessing whether our cybersecurity practices and information matching agreements comply with the rules set by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. The plan is updated every year and endorsed by the Risk and Assurance Committee, which includes external members and provides independent advice to the Commissioner. This year our focus areas are the AISAs we have with MSD, Police and DIA and the information matching we undertake with Customs. 27.The audit by Archives New Zealand (Archives NZ) of public office record-keeping aims to provide a point-in-time view of core information management practices, identifying strengths, and where there might be opportunities for improvement. The audit is based on Archives NZ’s Information Management Maturity Assessment framework, which consists of eight categories including governance, s elf -monitoring, capability, creation, management, storage and access. 28.We are scheduled to be part of Archives NZ’s 2021–22 audit programme. We have yet to receive formal notification but, to prepare for the audit, we recently conducted our annual Archives NZ self-assessment survey. This will be used as input into the audit. 29.The audit process involves four stages: pre-audit, in-audit (onsite), post-audit and follow-up. Our people will be involved in the p re-audit for onsite activities. The onsite audit will include interviews and focus groups with a range of our people, including me as the Executive Sponsor, information management specialist staff and technology staff. Not in scope 6 IR2021/334: Inland Revenue’s contribution to advancing Government data outcomes Methods of sharing information Who we share information with 30.We exchange information with a wide range of agencies including MSD, MBIE, Stats NZ, Customs, DIA, the Police, and the Treasury. These arrangements are well documented and have a clearly defined purpose. How information is shared 31.Information is exchanged in a variety of ways, from storage devices, such as iron keys, to application programming interfaces (APIs). Given the number and diversity of agencies we share information with, we accommodate what others can work with. This means that we do use channels and technology that we would prefer to move on from; however, our approach is to minimise the burden on the agencies we exchange information with. 32.APIs, or gateway services, enable direct machine-to-machine interactions between systems. They are a fast, high-volume, secure channel we are increasingly making available to both public and private sector organisations. APIs enable us to define what data we will share and then make it available for others to access when they need to. For example, to support the administration of the w age subsidy, introduced in response to COVID-19, we enabled MSD staff to access the information they needed directly from our systems, with the appropriate security permissions to verify applications, rather than having to contact us. 33.The IRD number validation API is being used by banks, KiwiSaver providers, tax agents and payroll providers to ensure that their clients are correctly identified, thus improving data quality and reducing error rates. This API is also available to other agencies to use, such as MSD, when they are ready to adopt it. 34.Protecting information is complex, due to the possibility of human error and the many different mechanisms for sharing that are available. All information-sharing activities undergo formal review, testing and acceptance. Digital identity framework 35.Inland Revenue is actively engaged in advancing the development of the digital identity trust framework being led by DIA. We have considered what our participation could be in terms of digital identity, and have provided example cases to DIA. We are strong advocates for the digital economy, and of business and support initiatives that will advance the digital economy. Working with Stats NZ 36.Inland Revenue participates in many forums led by Stats NZ or the GCDS, including: •Digital Government Leadership Group (DGLG) •Information Group •Strategic Advice on Integrated Data (SAID), and •IDI Investment Advisory Group. Not in scope 7 IR2021/334: Inland Revenue’s contribution to advancing Government data outcomes 37.Inland Revenue has contributed to many initiatives led by Stats NZ or the GCDS, including: •Algorithm Charter for Aotearoa New Zealand •Data Investment Plan •Māori Data Governance •Statistics Bill, and •New Zealand Government Data Strategy and Roadmap. Continuing to develop our data management and use practices 38.We are continuing to implement our data and information governance programme. Two immediate areas of focus are improving how we record and report collection and sharing of data, and building the capabilities of our people. Recording and reporting 39.All the data and information we collect and share, both inside Inland Revenue and with third parties such as other agencies, will be subject to governance. •When we propose to collect and/or share data and information, we will notify all potentially involved parties. •A comprehensive due diligence checklist will guide the involved parties through the process. The checklist requires an ethics assessment to be conducted at the same time a privacy impact assessment is considered. •The information collected will be recorded in a data and information supply register. Our people will be able to access the register at any time to know what is being collected and shared, who to contact, with links to all relevant material (for example the privacy impact and ethics assessments). •All collection and sharing of information will require the endorsement of the Data and Information Supply Working Group. •The Data and Information Supply Working Group and involved parties will be notified of milestones and events such as proposal, implementation, and eventual decommissioning. •Information will be recorded and reported to support performance measurement, risk management, and assurance activities. Building the capabilities of our people 40.The data and information environment Inland Revenue operates within is complex, rapidly changing, and can be challenging for our people. Legislation is clear about our data and information collection and disclosure powers, and clear how data and information held by the Commissioner will be handled and safeguarded. However, legislation is not exhaustive and situations arise where interpretation of legislation and individual judgement will vary. In these situations our people, no matter their role, need understanding and guidance to decide what course of action is right. 41.Policies, strategies, principles, frameworks, and standards are necessary, but alone they are insufficient. We are developing straightforward guidance for our people, along with supporting tools to support our people to do what’s right with data and information. We are: •Producing practical guidance that brings together a range of material including our Code of Conduct and our data and information policy to make clear to our people what “doing the right thing” looks like when working with data and information. Not in scope 8 IR2021/334: Inland Revenue’s contribution to advancing Government data outcomes •Working with our people who manage and use data and information so they understand how to work with the governance groups. •Building self-service tools so our people know what data and information is available to them and for what purposes, and what decisions have been made about data and information by governance groups. •Simplifying engagement with governance groups so guidance and decisions can be more readily accessed. •Establishing working groups focused on developing areas of practice that span Inland Revenue, for example: the Analytics and Research Working Group, and the Digital Service Working Group. 42.We will continue to share our experiences and what we are putting in place with other agencies and will continue to work closely with Stats NZ to contribute to advancing wider da ta outcomes. Not in scope Update on the Government Data Strategy and Roadmap The purpose of this discussion •This discussion is about the whythere is a Government Data Strategy and Roadmap, whatthat Strategy and Roadmap is, howthat Roadmap is being delivered, and whois involved. •This discussion is a pre-cursor to Stats NZ representatives and the DIGA discussing the Government Data Strategy and Roadmap further at the next DIGA meeting Summary •The first Government Data Strategy was published more than three years ago. The Government Chief Data Steward (filled by theChief Executive of Stats NZ) system functional lead role had only recently been established. That strategy was aspirational and did not include a roadmap. •During 2021, Stats NZ facilitated a number of hui to crowd-source an updated strategy and a roadmap. The resultant Government Data Strategy Roadmapis ambitious and with significant dependency on Māori and iwi to collaborate in a co-design manner, and for Stats NZ to be supported by several agencies, including Inland Revenue. •Unfortunately, COVID impacted the availability of many people, including Māori and iwi representatives, and there have been resourcing challenges. •Toward the end of Year One of the Roadmap it is being assertively reviewed by the cross-agency Information Group to produce a more reliably deliverable tranche of change. Not in scope Background on Government data strategies to date The following is largely an excerpt from online material introducing the current Government Data Strategy and Roadmap: The first Data Strategy was published more than three years ago. The ambitions of that strategy were: •making the right data available •building capability and good practice •growing effective partnerships •implementing open and transparent practices. However, the data landscape rapidly changed. Since the first Data Strategy and Roadmap was published, agencies have been workingon a 10- year Data Investment Plan. Stats NZ and the Data Iwi Leaders Group have signed the Mana Ōrite Relationship Agreementto realise iwi data aspirations. A range of initiatives have been developed to increase trust in the data system, including the Data Protection and Use Policyand the Algorithm Charter for Aotearoa NZ. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has completely changed the context in which data is collected, managed, and used. Despite the progress made since 2018, there were some fundamental system issues yet to be resolved: •data about and for some important topics and communities does not exist •settings to realise the rights and interests of Māori and iwi do not exist •many agencies lack capability to take advantage of the power of data •it is difficult to retrieve and re-use data across the system. Throughout the process of refreshing the strategy, key stakeholders have participated in workshops and interviews. These stakeholders came from central government, local government, private businesses and non-government organisations (NGO's). They have tested the Government Strategy and Roadmap's direction to ensure it is future-focused, robust, practical, and able to be adapted to different data sources and uses. Not in scope The Strategy The Government Data Strategy and Roadmapwill be brought to life through principles adapted from the Data Protection and Use Policy, the Mana Ōrite relationship agreement between Stats NZ and the Data Iwi Leaders Group, and the Public Service Act. Manaakitanga: Respect and uphold the mana and dignity of the people, whānau, communities, and groups who share their data and information. Mana Whakahaere: Empower people by giving them a choice and enabling their access to, and the use of, their data and information. Kaitiakitanga: A shared culture of respect, guardianship, care, and protection for data as a strategic and valued resource, recognising that for some Māori, Māori data is a taonga and iwi-Māori are kaitiaki over their taonga. Rangatiratanga: Leadership that focuses on common purpose whilst also respecting the autonomy and independence of individuals, groups and agencies. Whanaungatanga: Strong transparent relationships through respect, integrity, empathy, and commitment to the kaupapa. Not in scope The Roadmap The Roadmap is ambitious and has significant dependency on collaboration with Māori and iwi. Risks have materialised as issues and toward the end of Year One the cross-agency Information Group is re-shaping the Roadmap. IR is contributing to the highlighted initiatives in varying degrees.

Kia ora koutou As I mentioned at the Analytics DCE/Dep Sec meeting on Wednesday, the independent review of the first year of operation of the Algorithm Charter for Aotearoa New Zealand, is being sent to the office of the Minister of Statistics this week. Following this, the review will be published on data.govt.nz next week. I have attached a copy of the review to this email, for easy reference. As discussed on Wednesday, I agree with the findings and recommendations in the review. It found that there is strong (‘almost universal’) support for the Charter across government agencies and subject matter experts. It also found that agencies require additional guidance and assistance if we are to realise the required shifts in the ethical use of algorithms necessary to fully and successfully implement the Charter. I look forward to developing, with you, actions in response to the recommendations. That includes working on building data ethics capability across the public sector and understanding any regulatory gaps that need to be filled in order to build a trustworthy data ecosystem. It also includes working across agencies to reduce any duplication and make best use of our collaborative resources, and an increased focus on the importance of Māori data governance and engagement with Treaty partners. Alongside this we have the potential to increase the visibility and public awareness of the use of algorithms and the steps we are taking to provide strong oversight and appropriate use, and to encourage public participation in the discussion. We’ll talk more at our regular meetings, and we’ll share our plans for the approach we hope to take. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. Thank you, and your teams for your support to this mahi – it really is appreciated.

Again controls, especially security controls, over AI will be key. The guideline doesn’t provide the next level of detail for capability identification and uplift. There is potential here to build upon or augment our capabilities through automation to help with our capacity efficiencies and in a reduction in human error. On Ethics concerning AI decisions, IR needs to evolve its operating environment in order to be better across and more cognisant of the biases that can occur with data analytics. The conversations that currently occur are in pockets, so we need to be broadening the spaces where this awareness of and conversations about data ethics and biases do occur in IR. While high level information will be published, a data ethics approach and a data and ethics standard, the really important controls that sit below the standard (i.e. high level controls) nothing has been developed for those layers yet. The Chair requested members to discuss the following points via email or Teams chat: •Should our AI policy fully focus on generative AI? •What level of involvement is needed with the contact points mentioned in the guidance? •With the document not having the detail we would be looking for to post on our channels, how closely should we follow this guidance in relation to the use of AI for people information? What further messaging should be there on classifications of sensitive and in confidence? The Oversight Group: •Discussed the applicability of the Generative Artificial Intelligence guidance in an Inland Revenue context. •To provide feedback to the questions above posed by the Chair. Not in scope Not in scope Using Artificial Intelligence at IR Makayla Stewart Change Analyst (L2) Using the definitions and concepts outlined in What is Artificial Intelligence, lets look at how we use AI, what the benefits are and what's coming up.  Its important that we, as an organisation be deliberate in the decisions about which systems and tools we use. Only approved business tools can and should be used for their intended purpose.  On 21 March 2023, our Deputy Commissioner of Enterprise Design & Integrity, Mary Craig, sent out an email to all of IR about Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) products at IR which outlined that tools such as Chat GPT have not been approved for use.  Since March we have continued to develop guidance for using Artificial Intelligence at IR and are now in a position to provide you with more information about how to treat this technology. It is important that we understand: Which tools have been approved for business use  What the purpose these tools have been approved for  When these tools should or shouldn't be used Using Artificial Intelligence at IR: authored by Makayla Stewart What data is appropriate for us to input into these tools. To ensure we approach the use of AI at IR both safely, securely and in line with the requirements of us under the Tax Administration Act 1994, use case guidelines and a staff use policy have been developed to support you.  Guidelines for using Artificial Intelligence  You can find the full version of the AI use case guidelines here AI use case guidelines Our use case guidelines have been developed using: IRs classification labels as the basis (see Information classification and handling for more on classification).  The definitions for: Business rules, Machine learning, AI integrated solutions and Generative AI / Large Language Model (see Concepts within AI here What is Artificial Intelligence for more information). Only business tools that have been approved can be used on work devices. Full details of approved applications that have an AI component can be found here Artificial Intelligence Application Register.  The use of Generative AI solutions such as Chat-GPT is still under assessment and IR staff are asked to continue to wait for additional guidance. Some pilot options  have been assessed and are progressing; we hope to share more on these in the near future.  If you are unsure whether the actions you are intending to take are within the guidelines, check with your leader or contact AI@ird.govt.nz.     Policy for using Artificial Intelligence You can find the full version of the AI staff use policy here Artificial Intelligence (AI) staff use policy This policy applies to all of IR and sets out our approach to safely and securely look at how we can use AI to deliver more effective and efficient services.

Page 1 of 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Kaupapa me te Tiaki i ngā Ture 55 Featherston Street PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 New Zealand T.04 890 1500 Briefing note Reference: BN2024/058 Date: 14 February 2024 To: Rev enue Advisor, Minister of Finance – Emma Grigg From: Chr is Gillion Subje ct : Additional options for interest limitation phasing 1.This briefing note provides you with further options and costings on phasing back in interest deductibility for residential investment property. 2.This follows up on an aide memoire sent to the Minister of Finance on 13 February 2024 outlining a range of possible options for phasing back in interest deductibility (T2024/322) on top of the option proposed in the draft Cabinet paper (IR2027/027 refers). 3.Further options for interest limitation phasing are presented on the following page. Page 2 of 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 2027/28 and outyears Total over forecast period Status quo 50% 25% 0% 0% 0% Cabinet paper 50% 80% 100% 100% 100% Fiscal cost ($m) -5-360-785-855-915-2,920 Option 1 50% 50% 75% 100% 100% Fiscal cost ($m) 0 -225-730-860-920-2,735 Option 2 50% 50% 80% 100% 100% Fiscal cost ($m) 0 -225-745-860-920-2,750 4.The se costings were modelled using the same assumptions and caveats as for those in the previous aide memoire, and are restated here: •The costs are expressed relative to the status quo and were produced using the same model as was used for the draft Cabinet paper. Figures are presented in June fiscal years and are rounded to the nearest $5 million. •The model uses macroeconomic data from the Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update 2023 and assumes the implementation of the changes to the personal income tax system from the National Party’s Back Pocket Boost document. •The phasing options here assume no changes to settings for the 2023–24 income year, and therefore zero fiscal cost in that year. This differs from previous advice (and the draft Cabinet paper) where there was a fiscal cost for the 2023–24 year because all taxpayers would be permitted to deduct 50% of interest incurred, including those with recently acquired rental properties. •Note the fiscal impacts differ slightly between the Cabinet paper and the new phasing options even for options that allow the same proportion of interest in a given year. This is owing to updated tax return data being used to model the new options, as well as the different treatment in 2023–24 as described in the above bullet-point. •Note that the relationship between the proportion of interest allowed and the fiscal cost is not linear. For example, decreasing the proportion of interest allowed in 2027/28 from 100% to 50% does not decrease the fiscal cost in that year by half. This is because the modelling takes account of loss-ringfencing rules. Interest expenses that are allowed by the interest denial rules, but not claimable in the same year because of loss-ringfencing are accumulated and claimed when the residential income allows for it. This means that in the options that allow a larger proportion of interest to be deducted, there is a larger stock of these unclaimed interest expenses that are carried forward into future years. 5.The Treasury was informed about this briefing note.

24OIA2144 Page 1 of 5 16 May 2024 Julie Moffett julie.moffett@theguardian.co.nz Dear Julie Moffett Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 18 April 2024. You requested the following (numbered for ease of response): 1. How much money has been withdrawn from Kiwisaver funds nationwide over the period 2019-2024? 2. How much money has been withdrawn from Kiwisaver funds in the Ashburton District/Mid Canterbury over the period 2019-2024? (If this cannot be broken down to the district please give a Canterbury breakdown of figures) 3. a) What is the average amount that is withdrawn if the request is allowed? b) What are the top five reasons given for withdrawal request? (if more specific than "financial hardship" ie: paying everyday bills, dentist bill, rates, rent, unexpected bills, etc) 4. What are the demographics of people making the withdrawal request: age group, marital/relationship status/with children/home owner/tenant? 5. a) How many withdrawal requests are made? i. (number nationwide and ii. for Ashburton District) b) How many requests are allowed? (number nationwide and for Ashburton District) c) How many are denied? (number nationwide and for Ashburton District) . 6. What are the top 5 main reasons for denial? 7. What are the concerns IRD has about Kiwisaver withdrawal - for individuals and for New Zealand? Questions 1, 3a and 5ai The table below details the amount and average amount withdrawn nationwide from KiwiSaver funds as well as the number of requests allowed (count of member column) from the 2019 financial year to 2 May 2024. The average amount withdrawn column represents the average amount that each KiwiSaver member has withdrawn during each financial year. 24OIA2144 Page 2 of 5 Please note these figures do not cover all types of withdrawals as KiwiSaver providers are not obliged to provide Inland Revenue with retirement withdrawal data. Column Count of members includes members who made one or more withdrawals. Financial Year Count of members Amount withdrawn Average amount withdrawn 2019 81,361 $1,582,669,336 $19,452 2020 89,004 $1,992,304,929 $22,384 2021 81,290 $1,953,858,153 $24,036 2022 56,186 $1,448,679,592 $25,784 2023 54,618 $1,274,996,679 $23,344 2024 61,597 $1,516,738,686 $24,624 Questions 2 and 5bii The table below shows the amount withdrawn in the Ashburton District from KiwiSaver funds from the 2019 financial year to 2 May 2024. As noted above, these figures do not cover all types of withdrawals as KiwiSaver providers are not obliged to provide Inland Revenue with retirement withdrawal data, and the data below may include data on members who made a withdrawal under more than one category within the same period. Financial Year Count of members Amount withdrawn Average amount withdrawn 2019 610 $11,699,511 $19,180 2020 606 $13,034,558 $21,509 2021 614 $15,022,478 $24,467 2022 394 $9,937,303 $25,222 2023 369 $8,364,923 $22,669 2024 407 $9,983,316 $24,529 Question 3b The table below shows the top reasons given when making a request for withdrawal and the number of applications Inland Revenue has processed and approved, including the number of approved applications received from KiwiSaver providers from the 2019 financial year to 2 May 2024. As noted above, these figures do not cover all types of withdrawals as KiwiSaver providers are not obliged to provide Inland Revenue with retirement withdrawal data. As noted above, the data below may include data on members who made a withdrawal under more than one category within the same period. 24OIA2144 Page 3 of 5 Reason for withdrawal Year withdrawal made 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Court ordered 198 175 273 446 260 364 First home 40,161 41,366 54,492 38,724 30,143 29,898 Permanent emigration 2,027 2,231 1,761 1,107 1,654 2,295 Serious illness 2,023 1,972 1,519 1,320 1,472 1,396 Significant financial hardship 16,728 18,217 19,936 14,469 20,601 26,603 Other 27,115 31,613 8,952 198 588 1,131 KiwiSaver providers are not obliged to provide Inland Revenue with retirement withdrawal data; however, providers will occasionally send Inland Revenue retirement withdrawal data under the “Other” category. A change to the way data was provided in April 2020 significantly reduced the receipt of data in the “Other” category. This category may contain retirement withdrawals; however, as this information is not required and is provided ad-hoc, it is not reliable when determining the number of retirement withdrawals. Inland Revenue is not provided further data to determine what KiwiSaver providers may categorise as “Other” and is thus unable to provide any additional information or explanation regarding that category. Question 4 The tables below show the age of the KiwiSaver members making a withdrawal request and the amount withdrawn from the 2019 financial year to 2 May 2024. The age of the members is recorded as at 30 June 2023. As noted above, these figures do not cover all types of withdrawals as KiwiSaver providers are not obliged to provide Inland Revenue with retirement withdrawal data, also the data below may include data on members who made a withdrawal under more than one category within the same period. The 65+ category includes data for customers for which Inland Revenue holds no age data.

Questions 5a, 5c and 6 When a KiwiSaver member applies to withdraw funds, these applications are received and processed by their KiwiSaver provider, except for applications from members under significant financial hardship or serious illness who are also within the initial two month holding period. (This period provides time for new members who have been automatically enrolled by their employers to decide to opt out or remain enrolled). As such Inland Revenue does not hold data on the number of withdrawals requests made, the number of applications denied or the top five reasons for denials, thus these parts of your request are refused under section 18(g) of the OIA as the information requested is not held by Inland Revenue and I do not have grounds to believe this information is held by or more closely connected with the functions of another department. Question 7 Inland Revenue has an administrative role in KiwiSaver, and primarily facilitates the timely transfer of KiwiSaver contributions from members to scheme providers. You may wish to reach out to the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment which has policy responsibility for the withdrawal settings under the KiwiSaver Act 2006, For an independent view on KiwiSaver, you may be interested in reading the three yearly review of retirement income policy produced by the Retirement Commission, which is available on its website (retirement.govt.nz). 24OIA2144 Page 5 of 5 Right of review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision.

24OIA2216 Page 1 of 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 28 May 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 30 April 2024. You requested the following: Kiwisaver withdrawal statistics by Region - that shows the number and dollar amount of Kiwisaver withdrawals by region (here) - and was hoping you could provide me with a timeseries version (monthly or annually) of this dataset going back as far as available. The information you have requested is enclosed as Appendix A. To protect the privacy of individual persons, this information cannot be broken down monthly as it increases the risk of being able to identify an individual, which is contrary to the confidentiality provisions set out in section 18 of the Tax Administration Act (TAA). As such, your request for regional data is refused under section 18(c)(i) of the OIA, as releasing this information would be contrary to section 18 of the TAA. Data back to the financial year 2020/21 is the most up-to-date information Inland Revenue ha s, as this is the year KiwiSaver data was transitioned into its new system. These figures can change over time as new information is sent through from providers. Inland Revenue intends to publish 2024 data at the end of September 2024. Right of review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz. Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman by email at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz. If you choose to have an internal review, you can still ask the Ombudsman for a review.

24OIA2307 & 24OIA2309 Page 1 of 5 5 July 2024 Dear Thank you for your requests made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 6 June 2024. You requested the following: We would like to know how much P3 income tax was paid by March balance date taxpayers on 7 May 2024, compared to the same time in 2023 and 2022. In the past when we have requested similar information, you have captured tax payments for a period (I think up to 2 weeks) either side of the provisional tax date, recognising that taxpayers make payments before and shortly after the due date. We also recognise that 7 May is P1 for November balance dates, and P2 for July balance dates. If it is possible to exclude those tax payments from the data across the three years, please do so. And: ...published on the Inland Revenue website is the response to 24OIA1094 (attached). Although the information is presented in a different format, the letter and the table at Appendix A both refer to the population group being taxpayers with RIT in excess of $5,000 for the 2022 tax year. However in this case, the number of taxpayers is shown as 400,177. Can you please advise why there is a large difference in the taxpayer count on request 24OIA1094, and 24OIA1707. The below table shows the number of customers, number of transactions, and total value of payments made between the dates of 23 April 2024 to 19 May 2024 for the tax years 2022, 2023, and 2024 for customers who had residual income tax of $5,000 or more for the previous tax year and a standard balance date of 31 March. Tax year # of customers # of transactions Total amount ($) 2022 223,959 238,182 -$3,619,312,236 2023 258,473 288,511 -$3,926,876,390 2024 270,287 329,185 -$2,891,262,754 Grand Total 752,719 855,878 -$10,437,451,382 24OIA2307 & 24OIA2309 Page 2 of 5 I have reviewed the data in the responses for 24OIA1094 and 24OIA1707 and determined that there was an error that caused approximately 84,000 provisional taxpayers to be excluded from the data in 24OIA1094 if they were not a provisional taxpayer in the preceding year. The enclosed tables below, labelled Appendix A, restate the figures from 24OIA1707 with this error corrected. This data was extracted from Inland Revenue systems on 30 June 2024. Restated figures relating to the tax pooling and terminal tax due dates tables will be made available on Inland Revenue’s website at Tax statistics (ird.govt.nz) l ater this calendar year. Publishing of OIA response We intend to publish our response to your request on Inland Revenue’s website (www.ird.govt.nz) as this information may be of interest to other members of the public. This letter, with your personal details removed, will be published in its entirety.

24OIA2228 Page 1 of 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 11 June 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 13 May 2024. You requested the following: Can I please get a copy of the following information in relation to the NZ Income Equalisation Scheme managed by Inland Revenue: For each income year from 2019 to 2024 and separated by industry categories of Farming, Fishing, Forestry and testing, construction and mining: a. The amount of deposits paid into the equalisation scheme; b. Balance of total funds held in the scheme at the end of each year; c. The amount of refunds withdrawn from the scheme; d. For funds refunded during the relevant income year, the duration (in years) that deposited funds remained in the scheme before being refunded; e. The total amount of interest paid by the Crown in relation to the scheme; f. Number registered participants in the scheme; g. Number of new registered participants in the scheme; h. If possible, please split out the above categories into their specific farming type / activity undertaken eg vegetable growing, dairy farming, fruit growing etc. If you have any queries, please contact me. Background The income equalisation schemes (Scheme) covers the farming, fishing, and forestry industries. Business types that qualify for this scheme include: • farming/agriculture/horticulture on land in New Zealand • fishing (including rock oyster farming, mussel farming and freshwater fish farming) • forestry in New Zealand (except for companies, public authorities, Māori authorities or unincorporated bodies). The environmental restoration scheme covers the testing, construction, and mining industries when their business relates to environmental restoration. However, no entities from these industries are registered under the Scheme; therefore, Inland Revenue holds no information for these industries in relation to the Scheme.

I would like this data to be provided by each individual financial year.” Question 1 Inland Revenue advertises directly through Meta (Facebook and Instagram), LinkedIn, Google, and YouTube. Inland Revenue also works with advertising agencies on certain campaigns which means its ads are placed through a range of advertising platforms. 24OIA2255 Page 2 of 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Question 2 In 2016, Inland Revenue conducted a privacy impact assessment before it began using the custom audience feature within Meta. This assessment is enclosed as Appendix A. The use of the custom audience feature was reviewed and approved by the relevant managers, privacy officer, information security, and the Tax Council office. Final approval was granted by the Marketing and Communications manager. Since then, Meta has made changes to its custom audience feature that allow Inland Revenue to upload customer lists and share a link to the hashed list with external marketing agencies. This approach mitigates the risk of directly sharing customer lists with the agencies. Question 3 Inland Revenue has used the ‘custom audience’ feature within Meta since 2016. Question 4 Advertisements that Inland Revenue generated on Facebook i n April 2024 using the custom audiences feature are enclosed in Appendix B. There are 53 documents that fall in scope of your request. Appendix C provides a description of the type of these 53 documents. Question 5 Customer groups that have been selected for direct marketing since 1 January 2024 until 1 June 2024 have been provided in Appendix D. Question 6 Inland Revenue’s total payments to Meta for advertising and marketing for the 2022/2023 financial year are publicly available on the Parliament website, in response to parliamentary written question 11154 (2023), at 11154 (2023) (parliament.nz). I have therefore decided to refuse this part of your request for this under section 18(d) of the OIA, as the information requested is publicly available. Question 7 A billing report from Meta from 1 April 2023 – 30 May 2024 is enclosed as Appendix E. Question 8 Inland Revenue’s total advertising costs for the 2022/2023 financial year are publicly available on the Parliament website, in the response to question 50 of Inland Revenue’s 2022/2023 Annual Review, at Inland Revenue - Annual Review Written Responses 2022-23 (parliament.nz). I have therefore decided to refuse this part of your request for this under section 18(d) of the OIA, as the information requested is publicly available. 24OIA2255 Page 3 of 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Question 9 In land Revenue’s total spend so far for the 2023/2024 financial year on advertising and marketing is $0.618m. This includes advertising and marketing costs from July 2023 to May 2024. Question 10 Inland Revenue’s total spend on external marketing agencies for the 2019/2020, 2020/2021, 2021/2022 and 2022/2023 years are provided in Table 1. Table 1 does not include data for the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 financial years. This information is stored in our historical database, which has restricted access. Retrieving these records would require extensive manual effort, necessitating significant time and resources, which would adversely impact Inland Revenue's other operations. T herefore, this part of your request is refused under section 18(f) of the OIA, as the information requested cannot be made available without substantial collation. In making my decision, I considered if narrowing the request or extending the timeframe would enable Inland Revenue to answer your request. However, in this case, neither of these options would enable Inland Revenue to grant you the information requested. Table 1 Year Total Spend ($m) 2019/2020 2.555 2020/2021 1.159 2021/2022 0.973 2022/2023 0.872 Right of review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: commissionerscorrespondence@ird.govt.nz . Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman by email at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz . If you choose to have an internal review, you can still ask the Ombudsman for a review. 24OIA2255 Page 4 of 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Publishing of OIA response We intend to p ublish our response to your request on Inland Revenue’s website (ird.govt.nz) as this information may be of interest to other members of the public.

Yours sincerely Kieran Burlace Domain Lead, Marketing and Communications - Marketing Classified in Confidence – IR Protected \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Use of Facebook’s Custom Audience for advertising campaigns Brief Privacy Analysis Prepared by: Date: About this Document The purpose of this document is to demonstrate that privacy has been considered in a project or process that involves personal information. The Analysis pulls together relevant information to determine whether a full Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) should be completed and records IRs decision of why a PIA has not been done. It will answer the following questions: 1.Does this proposal involve a new way of managing personal information? 2.Does the proposal raise a significant privacy risk for IR? 3.Is a full privacy impact assessment required? 1.Project summary: Data matching for advertising campaigns 1.1 Brief description of the project This project is initially for advertising activity directed at Student Loans customers but would be used more widely in marketing campaigns. For instance, using this service to display banners to social policy customers without a myIR account Currently we provide our advertising agency (FCB) with personal information in the form of a list of email addresses and mobile numbers. This data is then ‘hashed’ (a way of encrypting the data so it cannot be identified to anyone) and matched against Facebook profiles and to be used in targeted advertising campaigns. Facebook has increased the data matching capabilities to include more than just email and mobile numbers. The new data types available for matching include: •First Name •Last Name •Postal Code •City •Date of birth •Gender By providing this information we could greatly improve the results of the marketing activities and direct more relevant messages to customers. In the case of Student Loan overseas-based borrowers we currently have contact details (email and mobile numbers) Appendix A Classified in Confidence – IR Protected \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] of approximately 55% of the population. If we were to use the full list of data types FCB estimates we would be able to match 87% of the population. This would greatly improve Inland Revenues ability to meet its objectives of increasing repayments and increasing the contact details we have for overseas-based student loan borrowers. The main stakeholders or entities involved in this project will be: •Corporate Legal and Corporate Integrity & Assurance teams to advise any changes required from a legal perspective •Marketing – to implement any changes required •Intel delivery – To provide the data •FCB – Receive the password protected data files and load the data to Facebook’s system. Facebook provide FCB with a Custom Audience for advertising purposes How Custom Audience works Inland Revenue sends its advertising agency (FCB) a list of the people we wish to present adverts to. FCB can create a customer list custom audience as they’re the owner of an ad account connected to Meta Business Manager or the owner has provided admin or advertiser permissions. To make a custom audience from a customer list, Meta is provided with information about existing customers and this is matched to Meta profiles. The information on a customer list is known as an “identifier” (such as email, phone number, address) and is use it to help find the audiences you want your ads to reach. Your customer list can either be a CSV or TXT file that includes these identifiers. A custom audience is created by adding a customer list into Meta Ad Manager and selecting the identifiers to be used (name, email etc). Information in the customer list is hashed and will be unidentifiable at an individual level. Hashing is a type of cryptographic security method that turns identifiers into randomized code and cannot be reversed. For example, for example, John.doe@ird.govt.nz may come out hashed as wLKziR/6RoXDv1MDaXLH1UNUC9nIVr97jrTnL4TcxsM=. It’s important to note that hashing is one way; you can take an email address and hash it, however you can’t take hashed data and turn it back into an email address. After information in the customer list is hashed, it is sent to Facebook. Facebook uses this hashed information by comparing it to its own hashed information and builds a custom audience by finding the Facebook profiles that match. After the Custom Audience is created, the matched and unmatched hashed information is deleted. About custom audiences | Meta Business Help Center (facebook.com) 1.2 Personal information that the project will involve In the table below, describe: •the personal information that will be collected, used and/or disclosed •the source of the information •the purpose of the information for your project. Note: “Personal information” is any information about an identifiable living person. However, a person doesn’t have to be named in the information to be identifiable. Classified in Confidence – IR Protected \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Type of personal Information Source of Information Purpose of information for the project • First Name • Last Name • Postal Code • City • Date of birth • Gender Inland Revenues database To improve advertising effectiveness and deliver the right message to the right customers at the right time 2. Privacy assessment 2.1 Areas that are risky for privacy Some types of projects are commonly known to create privacy risks. If the project involves one or more of these risk areas, it’s likely that a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) will be valuable. Use this checklist to identify and record whether your proposal raises certain privacy risks. Delete any that do not apply. Does the project involve any of the following? Yes (tick) No (tick) If yes, explain your response Information management generally A substantial change to an existing policy, process or system that involves personal information Example: New legislation or policy that makes it compulsory to collect or disclose information ✓ No substantial change just another way for IR to advertise or market to taxpayers. Any practice or activity that is listed on a risk register kept by IR Note: Check your business unit’s risk register and with Risk Services ✓ Does the project involve any of the following? Yes (tick) No (tick) If yes, explain your response Collection Classified in Confidence – IR Protected \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Does the project involve any of the following? Yes (tick) No (tick) If yes, explain your response A new collection of personal information Example: Collecting information about individuals’ location ✓ Collecting information which is not necessary for IR to carry out its functions Example: Information is not relevant to tax administration ✓ A new way of collecting personal information Example: Collecting information online or via app rather than on paper forms ✓ Collecting information from someone other than the individual themselves Example: Contacting a person’s employer to obtain information ✓ Storage, security and retention A change in the way personal information is stored or secured Example: Storing information in the cloud ✓ A change to how sensitive information is managed Example: Moving financial records to a new database ✓ We would be sending more information to FCB which would be stored for a short time while they transfer it to Facebook. IR has a contact with FCB to provide services which includes confidentiality obligations. Transferring personal information offshore or using a third-party contractor Example: Outsourcing the payroll function or storing information in the cloud ✓ As above Classified in Confidence – IR Protected \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Does the project involve any of the following? Yes (tick) No (tick) If yes, explain your response A decision to keep personal information for longer than IR has previously Example: Changing IT backups to be kept for 10 years when previously only stored for 7 ✓ After a Custom Audience is created, the matched and unmatched hashed information is deleted. Does the project involve any of the following? Yes (tick) No (tick) If yes, explain your response Use or disclosure A new use or disclosure of personal information that is already held Example: Sharing information with other agencies in a new way ✓ IR uses customer information in marketing campaigns. For Custom Audience the information is added to a Meta Ad Account and then hashed before being sent to Facebook for matching. Sharing or matching personal information held by different organisations or currently held in different datasets Example: Combining information with other information held on public registers, or an information matching or sharing agreement ✓ Information will be matched by Facebook but the information is hashed before it is sent to Facebook. Facebook matches the hashed data against Facebook’s profiles to serve customers the correct advertisements. The hashed information cannot be reversed. Individuals’ access to their information A change in policy that affects how people can access information that IR holds about them Example: Archiving documents after 6 months into a facility from which they can’t be easily retrieved ✓ Does the project involve any of the following? Yes (tick) No (tick) If yes, explain your response Identifying individuals Classified in Confidence – IR Protected \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Does the project involve any of the following?

Does the project involve any of the following? Yes (tick) No (tick) If yes, explain your response New intrusions on individuals’ property, person or activities Introducing a new system for searching individuals’ property or premises ✓ Surveillance, tracking or monitoring of movements, behaviour or communications Example: Installing a new CCTV system or GPS in vehicles ✓ Changes to premises that will involve private spaces where clients or customers may disclose personal information Example: Co-location or changing the location of a reception desk, where people may discuss personal details ✓ List anything else that may impact on privacy, such as intrusions into physical space 2.2 Initial risk assessment If you answered “Yes” to any of the questions above, use the table below to give a rating – either Low (L), Medium (M), or High (H) – for each of the aspects of the project set out in the first column. Classified in Confidence – IR Protected \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] For risks that you’ve identified as Medium or High, indicate (in the right-hand column) how the project plans to lessen the risk (if this is known). If you answered “No” to all the questions in 2.1 above, move on to section 3 below. Aspect of the Project Rating (L, M or H) Describe any medium and high risks and how to mitigate them Level of information handling L – Minimal personal information will be handled M – A moderate amount of personal information (or information that could become personal information) will be handled H – A significant amount of personal information (or information that could become personal information) will be handled M The way we send the data to FCB and the way it is stored is very secure. Hashing the data means that it is un- identifiable when it gets to Facebook and the hashed data is unable to be reversed so the identities would be protected. Sensitivity of the information L – The information will not be sensitive (name, IRD number, or job title) M – The information may be considered to be sensitive (contact details, date of birth plus name plus IRD number, biometric data) H – The information will be highly sensitive (health or financial details, information about high profile individuals) M The details may be considered to be sensitive. We are using: •First Name •Last Name •Postal Code •City •Date of birth •Gender Significance of the changes L – Only minor change to existing functions/activities M – Substantial change to existing functions/activities; or a new initiative H – Major overhaul of existing functions/activities; or a new initiative that’s significantly different L Minor change to existing activities Classified in Confidence – IR Protected \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Interaction with others L – No interaction with other agencies M – Interaction with one or two other agencies H – Extensive cross-agency (that is, government) interaction or cross- sectional (non-government and government) interaction M Interaction with FCB. Public impact L – Minimal impact on the organisation and clients M – Some impact on clients is likely due to changes to the handling of personal information; or the changes may raise public concern or media attention H – High impact on clients and the wider public, and concerns over aspects of project; widespread media interest is likely M Potential for public concern or media attention, however it is predicted to be minimal. 3. Summary of privacy impact The privacy impact for this project has been assessed as: Tick Low – There is little or no personal information involved; or the use of personal information is uncontroversial; or the risk of harm eventuating is negligible; or the change is minor and something that the individuals concerned would expect; or risks are fully mitigated Medium – Some personal information is involved, but any risks can be mitigated satisfactorily ✓ High – Sensitive personal information is involved, and several medium to high risks have been identified Reduced risk – The project will lessen existing privacy risks Inadequate information – More information and analysis is needed to fully assess the privacy impact of the project. Classified in Confidence – IR Protected \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3.1 Reasons for the privacy impact rating There is sensitive personal information involved as well as several medium risks identified, however the risks can be adequately mitigated through the recommended systems/processes. 4.Recommendation Do a full privacy impact assessment Describe: •the likely timing of the PIA •who

25OIA1199 Page 1 of 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 22 August 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 19 August 2024. You requested the following: I note reference in a weekend Press article to IR’s release of a redacted report to the Minister on charities and tax, but it does not appear to be amongst IR’s published OIA request responses nor published anywhere else. Has the report been publicly released, or will we need to make an OIA request to obtain a copy? Please find attached a copy of the document referenced in the article you have linked. Some information has been withheld under the following sections of the OIA: - 9(2)(a) – to protect the privacy of natural persons, and - 9(2)(f)(iv) – to maintain the constitutional conventions for the time being which protect the confidentiality of advice tendered by Ministers of the Crown and officials. As required by section 9(1) of the OIA, I have considered whether the grounds for withholding the information requested is outweighed by the public interest. In this instance, I do not consider that to be the case. Right of Review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: commissionerscorrespondence@ird.govt.nz. Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman by email at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz. If you choose to have an internal review, you can still ask the Ombudsman for a review. Publishing of OIA response We intend to publish our response to your request on Inland Revenue’s website (www.ird.govt.nz) as this information may be of interest to other members of the public. This letter, with your personal details removed, may be published in its entirety. Publishing responses increases the availability of information to the public and is consistent with the OIA's purpose of 25OIA1199 Page 2 of 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] enabling more effective participation in the making and administration of laws and policies and promoting the accountability of officials. Thank you again for your request. Yours sincerely Peter Frawley Policy Lead – Legislative Drafting and Business \[IN CONFIDENCE\] POLICY AND REGULATORY STEWARDSHIP Tax policy report: Charities and not-for-profits overview Date: 20 March 2024 Priority: Low Security level: In Confidence Report number: IR2024/110 Action sought Action sought Deadline Minister of Revenue Note the contents of this report Refer a copy of this report 19 April 2024 Contact for telephone discussion (if required) Name Position Telephone Stewart Donaldson Principal Policy Advisor Samantha Putt Policy Advisor s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) IR2024/110: Charities and not-for-profits overview Page 1 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 20 March 2024 Minister of Revenue Charities and not-for-profits overview Purpose 1. This report provides you with an overview of the charities and not-for-profits (NFPs) sector and related tax policy matters. This context may be useful for future tax policy reports and for matters that may be raised with you by stakeholders and other Ministers. 2. This report does not purport to contain a detailed analysis and description of each matter. Rather, it seeks to inform you of the potential range of matters and makes some comment on their attributes so that you can discuss which matters you want to further consider. The appendix contains a summary of these items. 3. We recommend you note this report and invite you to meet with officials to discuss the contents. Background Charities and NFPs framework 4. Charities and NFPs make important contributions to the wellbeing of New Zealanders. The sector supports efforts to bolster our social, human, and natural capital. The economic activities of the sector also affect the accumulation of physical and financial capital in the New Zealand economy. These factors form the basis for the tax exemptions and deduction frameworks provided to charities and NFP organisations. 5. The broad policy setting for this sector is that the Government supports charities and NFPs by providing targeted tax concessions. Inland Revenue administers charitable tax exemptions from income tax, fringe benefit tax, goods and services tax and resident withholding tax. We also approve donee status, which gives tax benefits to people donating to these organisations. NFPs that benefit from the widest range of tax concessions will be registered charities that are well regulated, publicly transparent and provide public benefit. Donation tax incentives have the objective of reinforcing and encouraging giving to approved donee organisations. Income tax and donation benefits for charities with charitable purposes outside New Zealand are restricted. 6. Some of the policy options for this sector will need to be considered in the context of broader objectives the Government has for the sector. Charities and NFPs statistics on Inland Revenue systems 7. There are approximately 90,000 NFPs on Inland Revenue’s system. These include: 7.1 29,000 tax-exempt charities. Based on accounts filed on the public charities register for 2022–23, tax-exempt charities control $81 billion of assets, employ 138,000 people full time (5% of the New Zealand workforce), benefit from 170,000 volunteers each week and contribute about 5% of GDP. IR2024/110: Charities and not-for-profits overview Page 2 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7.2 20,000 tax-exempt amateur sports bodies. 7.3 1,000 tax-exempt local and regional promotion bodies (beautification societies). 7.4 28,000 NFPs that are not tax exempt. About 24,000 of these have net income below a $1,000 deduction threshold available for NFPs, so they do not file income tax returns or pay income tax. About 4,000 file income tax returns and report a taxable income, taxable loss or zero net income. Recent legislative and regulatory change for the sector 8. This sector has been subject to legislative and regulatory change over recent years. Significant changes include: 8.1 The Incorporated Societies Act 2022, which requires approximately 23,000 incorporated societies to re-register by April 2026 and annually report using the same accounting standards as registered charities. 8.2 The Charities Amendment Act 2023, which introduced a number of changes for 29,000 registered charities. The changes include a new requirement for large charities to report the reasons why they are accumulating funds. 8.3 The External Reporting Board (XRB) has introduced changes to the threshold size of some reporting tiers for registered charities, incorporated societies and other public benefit entities. The focus has been to make it easier for small charities to apply the standards and for larger charities to adopt new service performance reporting standards. Current policy work 9. There are three projects involving this sector that our policy staff are currently involved with. Disposals of trading stock at below market value 10. In January 2024, you agreed to progress work related to disposals of trading stock at below market value. Cabinet agreed to the changes on 26 February 2024. These changes will benefit donee organisations because businesses will be able to donate trading stock to them and claim tax deductions on an ongoing basis. These changes are being progressed in an Amendment Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023–24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill. Requests for overseas donee status 11. Every year there are requests from New Zealand charities with overseas purposes to be granted overseas donee status. Overseas donee status is an exception to the current law that restricts tax benefits for donations to charities with New Zealand purposes. Decisions to give overseas donee status that meet certain Cabinet criteria, such as the relief of poverty, sickness, or the ravages of war or natural disaster, or other overseas development aid objectives, require legislative change. 12. We plan to report to you in April 2024 about the next tranche of requests for overseas donee status for inclusion in the next taxation Bill, scheduled for introduction in August 2024. s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2024/110: Charities and not-for-profits overview Page 3 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Regulatory stewardship 13. Later this year Inland Revenue will complete a regulatory stewardship report on donation tax credits. While this report is not primarily policy-related, it may contain policy recommendations that you decide to include on a future Tax and Social Policy Work Programme. Future policy work 14. A range of potential tax policy matters affecting this sector are identified in the Appendix. Two of these matters will be reported to you shortly and are summarised below. s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2024/110: Charities and not-for-profits overview Page 4 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 22. 23. Next steps 24. 25. We would welcome the opportunity to discuss any other matters raised in this report with you. 26. We are aware that Minister Louise Upston may write to you on certain tax matters and both she and Minister Nicola Willis have an interest in this sector. We recommend you share this paper with them, so that they are kept informed of this context. Consultation with the Treasury 27. The Treasury was informed about this report. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2024/110: Charities and not-for-profits overview Page 5 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Recommended action We recommend that you: 28. note the contents of this report, and Noted 29. refer a copy of this report to the Minister of Finance for their information, and Referred/Not referred 30. refer a copy of this report to the Minister of Community and Voluntary Sector for their information.

2 Current services in Gateway for WFF Digital software providers When designing a service or API we avoid assuming that it is for the exclusive use of a specific type of consumer. We make the services as generic as possible and use the authorisation rules and on-boarding process to impose any limitations on their adoption. Whilst there are currently no specific customer facing services or APIs for WFF, the generic nature of what has been built includes WFF in the following areas: Income tax return service The Adjust your income – IR215 form can be completed and submitted with the Individual income tax return – IR3 for any WFF (or student loan) adjustments . Transaction Data Service (TDS) All WFF period transactions (e.g. payments, assessments, penalties, interest) can be retrieved for viewing. Intermediation service Tax agents, bookkeepers and other representatives can link and delink to the WFF account. Tax agents can also choose to redirect WFF letters to themselves or change redirected letters to go back to their client. Document service API Letters from IR for WFF can be downloaded for reading, storing, or on-sending (e.g. to a client of a tax agent). 3 Notifications API Events that occur within the WFF account will notify software when an end of year assessment has been created, when a new letter has been sent, when an intermediary is linked or delinked, when WFF is first registered and when WFF is ceased (end dated). These are informational and do not necessarily require an action. If a WFF refund is pending awaiting a refund bank account or WFF cannot be assessed as an income tax assessment needs to be filed, ‘action required’ notifications will be sent instead. The latter is triggered on the income tax account, not WFF. Account API The WFF account status (whether it is active or ceased), the account start date or cease date, the WFF refund bank account and name on the account, WFF account specific address or contact details, WFF payment frequency (e.g. weekly, fortnightly or backend) and whether IR or MSD is paying WFF can all be retrieved and viewed through the Account API. Period API The WFF period begin and period end date and whether a notice of assessment has been issued for the period for WFF can be retrieved and viewed through the Period API. Bank API The refund bank account for WFF can be viewed and amended. Address API The account level address for WFF can be viewed, amended, or deleted. Contact API Account specific contact details can be viewed, amended, or deleted. Info shares (cross-Government) IR currently interacts with both Ministry of Social Development (MSD) and Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) (SmartStart) in relation to the administration of WFF. The MSD information shares are all using Secure File Transfer Protocols (SFTP), so not technically using the START gateway service, as they’re not real time. However, the files are generated from START or received/updated in to START. The DIA newborns information share also uses SFTP to create IRD numbers at birth where parents request this during the birth registration process. In addition, parents have the option to register for Best Start as part of the same process myIR logon reservation DIA customers who apply for an IRD number for their child at birth can also elect to reserve their own myIR web logon as part of this process. The DIA newborn registration web application will call IR behind the scenes (using the START gateway) on behalf of the DIA customer to enable the customer to reserve a username or logon for myIR. 4 s 9(2)(g)(i) 5 s 9(2)(g)(i) 6 s 9(2)(g)(i) s 9(2)(g)(i) 7 Strategic alignment In December the Strategic Investment Board approved the Digital Ecosystem Strategy 1 for IR to achieve an aspiration of digital transformation outlined in Tax Administration 3.0. The purpose of the Digital Ecosystem Strategy is to recognise the shifts/future trends towards digitalising tax administration and make strategic choices on how IR will respond to these changes. This sets out some clear objectives and success measures that ties into the deliverables of Workstream 4. We also need to ensure the following Ecosystem principles are considered: Sustainability: We will create generic, reusable services – rather than specific point solutions for each requirement. During BT significant resourcing was put into building our existing gateway offerings. It is integral that re-use is prioritised over producing new solutions. Integrity by design: Our systems will be designed to prevent and identify compliance issues. Data will be shared and accessed based on a comprehensive customer identity and consent framework. Fair and transparent: We will remain impartial – pick no winners and create a level playing field. We will maximise the value of new and existing services by continuing to expand IR’s digital border where it makes sense, and the value of doing so is proportional to the onboarding effort. Digital inclusion: It is important to recognise that while a digital approach is best for many of our customers, there are exceptions. As part of our strategy, we recognise and accept this. We will create opportunities to improve things for customers, some of whom are our most vulnerable and most in need of IR’s products and services. Collaboration: We will rely on an extensive ecosystem with connected businesses and software companies to engage in real time with us. The ecosystem assures the accuracy of taxation, real time remission of tax payments and supports, where appropriate, automated refunds/ payments. Digital transformation: We move beyond digitising of form-based processes to digitalising the process and transformational change. We must keep the Tax Administration 3.0 vision for 1 See appendix two for copy of paper s 9(2)(g)(i) 8 building taxation processes into taxpayers’ natural systems as our goal. Efficient data handling (e.g. minimising data movement where practical), and reuse of data are also key considerations for digital transformation. Use of GWS will also align with the Channel Strategy as documented in the Channel Principles, endorsed by sub-ELT in December 2023 2 - specifically, enabling natural systems. Conclusion •The START gateway is the natural and preferred strategic choice for interactions between our backend system for WFF and a 3 rd party – regardless of whether this is a commercial consumer or another Government agency. •The existing gateway is robust, secure and successfully delivering benefits through over 65 million interactions per month. 2 See Appendix two for principles paper s 9(2)(g)(i) 10 Appendix three - Information sharing across NZ Government Information sharing of data between Government agencies does not follow the same access and permissions requirements. Data and information can be shared between IR and other agencies as set out specifically in the Tax Administration Act 1994 or by using authorised information sharing instruments. Approved Information Sharing Agreement (AISA): An AISA is managed under part 9A of the Privacy Act 2020 for government agencies to provide efficient and effective public services. https://www.ird.govt.nz/about-us/information-sharing/information-sharing Memoranda of Understanding (MOU’s): An MOU is an operational document that sits alongside an information sharing legislative provision, an AISA, or information matching agreement. It describes the legal basis for sharing and sets out how an agreement will work practically. https://www.ird.govt.nz/about-us/information-sharing/mous Interaction with WFF Review Sam Aldridge Keymaster kick-off workshop: 4 th July 2023 Item 2 2 WFF Review •The WFF Review is on Inland Revenue’s tax and social policy work programme, and is a key Ministerial priority for the Government.We will continue to advise the Government on how to meet their objectives through the Review, along with MSD, DPMC and Treasury. •In contrast, Project Keymaster is stewardship project aimed at improving Inland Revenue’s ability to advise Government in the longer term on WFF and other income support. •As Project Keymaster progresses, insights that IR gains from the project (from analysis of data and discussion) may inform our advice on the WFF Review. Work programme: Election outcome and engagement with MSD Sam Aldridge and Maraina Hak Keymaster kick-off workshop: 4 th July 2023 Add presentation title if required4 Election outcome •Project Keymaster will continue regardless of election outcome. •It is intended to develop Inland Revenue’s position on a long-term strategy for income support through the tax system, regardless of Government. •It reflects IR’s stewardship obligations under the Public Service Act. •This project is a priority for IR, although we will need to monitor resourcing post-election or if other events arise. Add presentation title if required5 Working with MSD •Because Project Keymaster will develop Inland Revenue’s position on a long-term strategy for income support through the tax system, it is not dependent on resourcing from other agencies. •However, we will keep MSD informed of our work and thinking as the Project progresses and will seek their comments or feedback. •In particular, to provide context for our project, we are keen to understand MSD’s thinking and progress on their business transformation programme Te Pae Tāwhiti. Budget sensitivity/information sensitivity Sam Aldridge Keymaster kick-off workshop: 4 th July 2023 Add presentation title if required7 Budget/information sensitivity •Budget sensitivity generally means that a proposal planned for a Budget bid should not be discussed beyond a specified group of people on a ‘need to know basis’. For example, the WFF Review project is currently Budget sensitive. •The Keymaster project itself is not Budget sensitive. You can talk to others in IR to explore insights and gather data •There could be specific proposals that come out of Project Keymaster as it progresses. If Ministers adopt a proposal for a future Budget the proposal may become Budget sensitive from that point in time Roundtables Eina Wong and Sam Aldridge Keymaster kick-off workshop: 4 th July 2023 Add presentation title if required9 Roundtables •We are holding roundtables over the next two months. •These will cover fundamental aspects for the Review – including unit of entitlement, periods of assessment. •Some will be full day and some half day,. •We are seeking a broad consensus from these roundtables on the fundamental issues, so we strongly encourage everyone to attend. •We encourage attendance in person, although there will be the opportunity to participate online and the roundtables will be recorded.

In May 2022, we discussed with the Enterprise Priorities and Performance Committee the strategic opportunities that are available to Inland Revenue to improve outcomes for New Zealanders in a social policy context. In response to the Committee’s request, a workshop was held with subject matter experts from across Inland Revenue business units in August 2022. Its purpose was to discuss as a group whether these opportunities and/or any others merit further investigation. The group agreed a work programme should be designed around the opportunities identified, and recommended that the work should be shared by business units represented at the workshop. In this paper, we discuss in more detail the strands of work that could be progressed, guided by discussions at the workshop. In our view, each of these would benefit from further scoping which would then inform how they could fit into a broad work programme. If the Board approves, we will report back in early 2023 on recommendations for progressing the work programme and resourcing requirements. Recommendations It is recommended that the Board/Committee: •Approves the scoping of a programme of work on the longer-term opportunities for administering income support through the tax system. Sponsors Sharon Thompson David Carrigan Deputy Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner, CCS-Individuals Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Item 6 \` 2 Proposal for Income Support Work Programme (Project Keymaster) 7 September 2022 Introduction and background 1.Inland Revenue is a key contributor to the Review of Working for Families (WFF) and Debt to Government workstreams. Both workstreams could result in changes to policy, administrative and legislative settings, ranging from substantive to remedial options. The timing of such changes could be as early as 2023 or spread to later years. It is unclear at this stage how Ministerial appetite or fiscal constraints will limit the extent of reform. 2.To support advice to Income Support Ministers 1 , a networked team of staff from Policy, Technical Standards, ED&I, II&S, and CCS has been meeting weekly during the past two years to discuss any concerns or design considerations \[PGC briefing 18 August 2022 refers\]. In addition, a regular fortnightly stand-up meeting with Tier 2 and 3 staff is convened and connects the work with other social policy initiatives (e.g., child support, income insurance) to provide a broader picture of the potential impacts on Inland Revenue. 3.Through this support framework, we have gained a collective understanding of how our social policy customers are or could be impacted by policies and administrative settings. This set up has also established a platform for Inland Revenue (IR) to consider options of longstanding interest from the perspective of our customers and staff to improve delivery of WFF. 4.In May 2022, the Enterprise Priorities and Performance Committee (EPPC) discussed those longer -term opportunities that are available to IR \[EPPC briefing 26 May 2022 refers\]. The Committee acknowledged that these opportunities are timely given the public interest in improving outcomes for New Zealanders, and our expectations that social policy will be a continued area of debate, particularly with the rise in costs of living and legislated requirements to reduce child poverty rates, for example. 5.The EPPC recommended a workshop with subject matter experts from across IR to be held to consider whether those opportunities merit further investigation, and whether there are any others. In this paper, we summarise the results of that workshop and discuss recommendations for next steps. WFF Strategic Intentions Workshop 6.In August, staff from Policy, CCS, ED&I, and II&S met to discuss the potential strategic opportunities for administering income support through the tax system. Its aim was for attendees to agree whether there is a case to develop a broad work programme to progress opportunities identified at the workshop. 1 Income Support Ministers are the Minister for Child Poverty Reduction/Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, Minister for Social Development and Employment, and Minister of Revenue. The Minister of Education and Minister for Children are provided the advice where it is relevant to their portfolios. 3 7.Workshop participants discuss ed the socioeconomic characteristics of our WFF customers (derived from our administrative data) and watched recordings of customers who talked to IR staff about their experiences with WFF and their life circumstances. The combination of that evidence was sobering, especially hearing first-hand the trials of our most vulnerable customers, and how IR can have a big role in their wellbeing. 8.There was a robust discussion about whether WFF tax credits as a whole continues to be fit for purpose. The conclusion was that WFF contributes to income support and financial incentives to work, and is a useful lever to reduce child poverty. However, it does not support the transition into and sustain work in an effective way. 9.There was unanimous agreement that the opportunities all merited further investigation, and that this would be an important opportunity for Inland Revenue as part of its stewardship function. There was also acknowledgement that such a programme of work would require significant resources (e.g., time and staff). Long term strategic opportunities 10.The opportunities agreed by the workshop participants are broadly the same as those presented to the EPPC. These have been expanded upon to incorporate feedback from the workshop. We have not included specifically the WFF Review and the Debt to Government workstream because those are already underway. However, the longer-term options under those workstreams could be incorporated in one of the work strands below. A.Start from a “blank slate” This strand of work would consider how we would re-imagine financial support if we could start afresh. The intention is to think creatively and relatively unconstrained about what an ideal set-up could look like, and how achievable that would be if approached over time. We would consider the first principles of providing income support through the tax system, how a universal basic income model could be designed, or whether WFF should be administered in a completely different manner (e.g., paid by employers, third parties, or another agency), for example. We anticipate that this strand of work to be substantive and would consider multiple perspectives to take a comprehensive approach. For example, we could think about how we would design support using a “lifecycle” lens in terms of when individuals/families would require more or less income support following major life events. The expected output: “an IR view of income support through the tax system”. This would serve as a benchmark for comparing other, more narrow options. B.Decouple WFF from Revenue Acts WFF legislation is embedded in the Tax Administration Act and Income Tax Act and has implications for the way we administer these tax credits. Concepts that are core to tax administration are used for WFF purposes, such as an income year as the period of assessment for calculating entitlements or how debt is written off. The relevant question is whether these tax concepts should apply in a social policy context, particularly as we learn more about WFF customers and their complex life circumstances. 4 This strand would start from the pe rspective of decoupling WFF legislation from the Revenue Acts. In doing so, we would consider both policy and administrative improvements. We anticipate that this would be substantive, but with a relatively more narrow scope than the “blank slate” strand. The expected output: “an IR view of Working for Families”. C.Improvements in information sharing IR has multiple information sharing agreements/memoranda of understanding with government agencies to enable effective administration of WFF. These are key to ensuring that entitlements are paid in a timely manner and as accurately as possible. Despite best endeavours, the complexity of our customers’ lives means that it is not possible to pay everyone an accurate amount, and this can result in debt for some families or under-support. For example, moving on and off benefit can result in gaps in support or doubling-up of support from IR and MSD if the information exchange is not timely or information is missing. This strand would consider how to improve existing information sharing processes, using insights gained from the Common Debtors Pilot and our administrative data on customers. A first step could be an in-depth exploration of the current information we have from our existing information shares and identifying what is missing and would be useful to acquire. We would also consider any dependencies with MSD’s Te Pae Tawhiti business transformation programme, and whether there are social policy opportunities in gateway services. The expected output: “A work programme to consider use of information for jointly administered products”. D.Development of an application to provide certainty to customers The complexity of customers’ lives is the primary reason for inaccurate WFF payments. Life events that are significant such as having a baby, death of a family member, changing jobs, partnering or splitting from a partner, can result in changes in people’s incomes and/or entitlement to support. This is an intended outcome because currently most income supports are means-tested. While these changes to entitlements are deliberate, they also create uncertainty of support for people. This uncertainty can compound the challenges of adapting to those life events. There is an opportunity to alleviate this uncertainty through a joined-up application of real-time information that could be provided to income support recipients. The benefits to customers include having financial certainty and increased autonomy over their life choices, and improve transparency of the tax and transfer system. We anticipate this would be a longer-term strand of work that would consider information sharing, technological, and legislative requirements for government agencies. Its intent would be reflect the policy settings of the day, rather than as a means to change existing policy or administrative decisions. The expected output: “A work programme to develop an application for social policy entitlements”. 11.The four work strands have been deliberately positioned to progress initially from the perspective of IR as the primary administrator of tax credits. We acknowledge that the long-term success of any of this work is contingent on the capacity of other agencies to work with IR and vice versa. However, to agree on a paradigm of 5 income support through the tax system requires inte rnal discussions foremost before consulting externally. Recommendations for Project Keymaster 12.We consider these four work strands are opportunities to consider meaningful changes over the longer term for our customers and more generally for anyone who finds themselves in a vulnerable financial position. If progressed, the work would be approached in a non-partisan manner, which could foster discussions with future governments on incremental changes to WFF over time. 13.We acknowledge that the resourcing requirements to sustain such a work programme could be high, as it would involve the networked group of staff across IR business units. Therefore, we recommend that further detailed scoping of a potential overarching work programme be undertaken to inform the trade-offs for IR. We would then report back to the Board on that work programme in early 2023, provide our recommendations, and seek approval to progress on any or all parts of it. 14.To scope the work programme, we suggest that a small team of Policy advisors and a CCS segment leader could lead the work and consult with relevant internal stakeholders. These staff are currently leading other work and anticipate that they will have available time in the coming months to begin the scoping exercise. The project would be co-sponsored by the Deputy Commissioners CCS-Individuals and Policy and Regulatory Stewardship. Māori perspectives 15.Our social policy customers are among the most vulnerable groups of individuals and families in the New Zealand population, many of whom are disproportionately represented by whānau Māori. In targeted engagement as part of the WFF Review, officials met with four stakeholders recently to discuss their experiences with WFF. In addition, the Customer Insights & Evaluation team have begun research to better understand te Ao Māori (Māori world view) and Māori outcomes particularly in the WFF context. The work from The Māori Customer Landscape and Tuitui te Hono: Māori Outcomes have been shared with the executive leadership team recently. 16.The external engagement and internal research have provided and will continue to provide valuable insights and a deeper understanding to better support whānau Māori. This approach to including Māori perspectives to date aligns with the principles of Māhutonga. Our intention is to continue to apply te Ao Māori and Te Tiriti lens to Project Keymaster. Next steps 17.If the Board approves, we propose to report back to the Board in early 2023 with a detailed overarching programme of work and the proposed resources needed. This timing would also coincide with any decisions taken by Income Support Ministers with regards to the WFF Review. The initiative concept template supports the first stage of the initiative lifecycle (Emerge) within the initiative management framework for new initiatives 1 . The purpose is to present information about this initiative to allow the following to be answered: •Is there a valid problem or opportunity, and the benefits are compelling enough, that justifies the initiative being considered? •Does the proposed initiative align with IR’s priorities described within Eke Tangaroa? •Should this initiative proceed into the discovery stage of IR’s lifecycle? The Portfolio and Prioritisation Group (PPG) provides stage gates for enterprise initiatives through the initiative lifecycle. PPG will recommend if an enterprise proposal should proceed or not. Typically, enterprise initiatives are considered and require approval from Strategic Investment Board (SIB) to proceed. Initiative Management Lifecycle Emerge is the first stage of the initiative lifecycle. It ensures early visibility of the initiatives coming down the pipeline as well as a process to enable ideas for discretionary initiatives to be considered before resources are committed to them.

Both workstreams could result in changes to policy, administrative and legislative settings, ranging from substantive to remedial options. The timing of such changes could be as early as 2023 or spread to later years. It is unclear at this stage how Ministerial appetite or fiscal constraints will limit the extent of reform. To support advice to Income Support Ministers 2 , a networked team of staff from Policy, Technical Standards, ED&I, II&S, and CCS has been meeting weekly during the past two years to discuss any concerns or design considerations \[PGC briefing 18 August 2022 refers\]. In addition, a regular fortnightly stand-up meeting with Tier 2 and 3 staff is convened and connects the work with other social policy initiatives (e.g., child support, income insurance) to provide a broader picture of the potential impacts on Inland Revenue. 2 Income Support Ministers are the Minister for Child Poverty Reduction/Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, Minister for Social Development and Employment, and Minister of Revenue. The Minister of Education and Minister for Children are provided the advice where it is relevant to their portfolios. Through this support framework, we have gained a collective understanding of how our social policy customers are or could be impacted by policies and administrative settings. This set up has also established a platform for Inland Revenue (IR) to consider options of longstanding interest from the perspective of our customers and staff to improve delivery of WFF, both in the immediate and longer term. It has proven to be a valuable resource for our staff generally. In May 2022, the Enterprise Priorities and Performance Committee (EPPC) discussed the longer-term opportunities that are available to IR \[EPPC briefing 26 May 2022 refers\]. The Committee acknowledged that these opportunities are timely given the public interest in improving outcomes for New Zealanders, and our expectations that social policy will be a continued area of debate, particularly with the rise in costs of living and legislated requirements to reduce child poverty rates, for example. The Committee recommended a workshop with subject matter experts to be held, after which we would provide an update on this initiative to the Strategic and Investment Board (SIB). In September 2022, SIB discussed the potential for a longer term work programme to be developed to scope these opportunities \[SIB briefing 7 September 2022 refers\], based on feedback from the workshop. The Board was generally supportive and asked that we go through the planning and prioritisation process to progress this initiative. There was also an action point for the CIR to discuss with MSD’s Chief Executive their preferred level of involvement in this project. 1.2 What problem or opportunity are you trying to address? The evidence and advice that has been developed over the past several years has identified that there are opportunities that can be progressed to improve outcomes for our WFF customers by reducing debt and providing certainty. These customers overlap with our other products, including Child Support, Paid Parental Leave, and Student Loans. They also represent some of New Zealand’s most vulnerable population groups, many of whom are also MSD clients. To illustrate, our WFF customers have varying levels of education and information that is available on WFF is inconsistent. As a result, customers don’t understand their entitlements, obligation and rights and don’t know what is going to happen to them next. This means that families miss out on receiving the right amount and are at risk of receiving an overpayment. Around 67% of WFF payments are within 20% of the right entitlement during the year, and our debt book has grown by $52m since June 2021 (noting that the Covid pandemic began February/March 2020). We have identified the following opportunities for the immediate and longer term. Immediate changes that are implementable include: •All communications and website content for WfF customers is to be reviewed and provided in a way that meets their needs and enables them to get it right •myIR has a full review to see if it is fit for purpose for these customers. •eNotifications are currently lacking information and unclear call to actions as shown in a CXD project completed in 2021. Changes need to be implemented and prioritised •Review the service offering for WfF customers both through phone and web m essage contact, using insights and evaluation to understand tolerance levels and building a channel strategy •Te Mātāwai pages are reviewed to ensure our people have the information they need to help our customers get it right •Customer education programme set up for WfF customers to build trust and confidence to access our products and services, setting them up right from the start and throughout their journey and life events •Web message content and templates for WfF is to be reviewed to ensure consistency of advice and a best practice service delivery. Longer term opportunities include: •Considering potentially significant reform of the underlying policy settings •Legislative implications of doing so, and particularly of separating WFF legislation from the existing Revenue Acts •Improvements to enable better information sharing •Considering methods of providing more certainty to our customers to reflect the complexity of their lives The intention of Project Keymaster is to think ambitiously, so that we are better prepared to respond to the government of the day when Ministers wish to consider social policy changes. Successive governments may have their specific social policy agendas but there are enduring objectives, including: •Providing adequate income support •Providing financial incentives to work •Reducing child poverty rates (which are now legislated) 1.3 Implications should the initiative not proceed Immediate changes: •Customers do not have the certainty they need around the amount they will receive weekly or fortnightly for their family leading to increased demand as they seek reassurance from us •Customers struggle to get the immediate certainty around their entitlement when they can’t get through to us by phone, can’t navigate myIR and our response time for web messages is up to 15 days. WFF customers are 22% of all our customers but they make up 38% of all the phone calls IR receives, the most of any segment. •The immediate changes identified above can create further overpayments and increase the accumulative adjustments resulting in payments reducing or stopping placing customers in further hardship and inability to meet their daily needs. •Customers are inundated with information that they struggle to understand. Longer term opportunities: If the initiative does not proceed, then changes to how we improve delivery of WFF will be limited to providing ad hoc advice in response to Ministers at the time of commissioning. Policy advisors will continue to explore opportunities in their stewardship role where time permits, and will consult with the existing WFF networked team on potential options. However, the options are unlikely to be more reformative or ambitious given the existing limited resources. In effect, this work as described will not be prioritised. 1.4 What is your initiative? Immediate changes: To provide tools, resources and services that enable our customers to access the right information around their entitlements, and ensure they know when they need to tell us about changes in their circumstances. The service we provide is conducive to reducing overpayments as we act quickly, proactively using the intelligence we hold, and provide assurance in the way we communicate. Our digital channels are fit for purpose, enabling those who have the ability to self-manage to do so, and allowing IR to focus our efforts on those who need more assistance directly from us. Longer term opportunities: The immediate stage of work is to scope the longer term work programme to anticipate the level of resources required and propose timeframes (i.e., to move into Discovery phase?). The work programme will include the opportunities bulleted in section 1.2. 1.5 Alternative approaches Immediate changes: Pieces of work have commenced in most areas, and these are at the scoping and discovery stage. We are working with Customer Insights and Evaluation to understand our customer segmentations and obtain behavioural insights to tailor our solutions to different groups. It is vital that these pieces of work get the priority they need across the enterprise to ensure the changes go through, and that we see the change that is needed for our most vulnerable customer group. We anticipate involvement required from CSI, IIS and PD&D. Longer term opportunities: In August, we held a workshop with subject matter experts from Policy, CCS, ED&I, and II&S to discuss these opportunities and whether there were others to consider. There was unanimous agreement that the opportunities all merited further investigation, and that this would be an important opportunity for Inland Revenue as part of its stewardship function. We discussed that such a programme of work would involve staff from multiple business units within IR. 1.6 Who primarily benefits from this initiative? In the long run, our WFF customers would benefit by experiencing less debt and more certainty about their support. Currently, WFF settings are complex and require timely information from the customer to accurately pay their entitlements. However, their life circumstances are also complex and may not align with the administrative settings. We will consider policy, legislative, and administrative options to improve the delivery of support. IR also benefits from improvements that reduce compliance costs for customers, so that our staff may focus on other priorities related to social policy and tax administration. In the interim, this initiative positions IR to discuss opportunities for future g overnments that wish to make social policy changes. 1.7 Logic of the initiative Immediate changes: At the end of this operational work programme, our WFF customers will have access to the right information and service regardless of which channel they choose to engage with. Through our proactive engagement our customers will have a higher level of understanding around what is required from them and what changes affect their entitlements, and how they need to update their details with IR. We will provide greater certainty of payments, and clearer information when a call to action is required. We will use the intelligence we hold to reduce effort for the customer, and ultimately reduce the risk of overpayments. Longer term opportunities: At the end of the work programme, we will deliver “Inland Revenue’s s trategy to improve the delivery of income support through the tax system”. The goal is to use this strategy as a benchmark against which we will measure incremental changes to social policy over time, so that we can clearly articulate our broader aims when Ministers commission advice. This strategy would be developed in a non-partisan manner, and we would consider objectives of a social policy or social insurance system that are enduring. The strategy would also need to be relatively flexible to adapt to policy, technology or other substantive civil or cultural changes over time. We estimate the strategy may take 12 to 18 months or more to materialise, but learnings along the way could be used to inform advice to Ministers. 2 Alignment 2.1 Eke Tangaroa and Business Priorities This initiative aligns very closely to Eke Tangaroa and IR’s priority to deliver and improve services for our customers and managing our performance. In particular, this initiative supports the Government in its priority work areas, which includes reforming the welfare system and addressing individual debt owed to Government. Not progressing this initiative increases IR’s enterprise risks: (1)Failure to deliver for customers or Government priorities, and (7) Failure to provide appropriate stewardship of the tax and social policy system 2.2 Business objectives – value framework This initiative fits most closely with the Integrity business objective: integrity and trust of the revenue system is maintained. The WFF system was introduced in 2004 and successive changes to the parameters have been made since then. Some changes have increased or further targeted support, and some changes have been made with the intent to improve or in some cases, ignore, the impacts on work incentives. The genesis of Keymaster was in asking the question of whether the WFF system is still fit for purpose. The short answer is that while it has met some of its original objectives, it does not deliver in others. While this initiative primarily meets the Integrity business objective, it will also help to meet the objective of Ease of complying and Customer certainty. A satisfactory outcome would be to improve the wellbeing of New Zealanders, and particularly of our WFF customers. If they feel better supported or empowered, and have less need to contact IR, then that would be a desirable outcome. This initiative would also help to increase customer confidence and awareness. 3 Value for money 3.1 Successful implementation of this initiative will create the following benefits Immediate changes: Non-financial - Customer satisfaction from our Families customers is low compared to the rest of the results across our organisation. Information from Ins ights and Evaluation show that Families customers have been unable to get through on our phone lines, struggle to self-serve, and need assurance around the amount they are receiving as in a lot of cases their WfF entitlement is used to feed their Family. Financial – Making it easy for WfF customers to self-service and share their change of circumstances will increase our ability to get correct entitlements out. Providing up-front education to our new WfF customers will also increase customers understanding of the product. Since Business Transformation we have seen the number of letters issued double from 1.1m letters in 2018, to 2.1m letters issued in 2021. We are doing a deep dive into our letters, the calls to action and duplication of effort which will likely result in a reduction of outputs, and a cost savings both to IR, but also for the customer in terms of time and stress. Economic - In the discovery stage of this work we are seeing that this customer group are regularly in My IR looking round but not taking any actions. Families' customers try to use IR digital channels but 85% end up phoning because they need assistance to complete, or assurance that they have got it right. Customer research has also shown that these customers are receiving many notifications from us throughout the year to reduce overpayments, but this is causing confusion for customers and them continually having to monitor their WfF account. 92% of Working for Families (WfF) customers are registered for myIR, yet during the 2020 rollover only 50% of customers accessed myIR within 8 days of receiving the notification. A significant number had a session duration of less than a minute and did not read the rollover letter. Longer term opportunities: During the development of the long term strategy we will endeavour to produce measurable estimates of non-financial, financial, and economic benefits of the options. M easurable outputs will depend on the appetite of the government and public sector in choosing to implement options consistent with the strategy. However, we anticipate that qualitative analysis of the options during the development of the strategy will show improvements over the status quo as the benefits should outweigh the costs for recommended options. 3.2 Indicative resource requirements/costs for implementation and ongoing To scope the work programme, a core team of IR staff will be required to work together between now and February 2023. The deliverable at that stage will be a 12 to 18-month work programme that will detail the resource requirements and stages of work. We propose that this core team be comprised of: •Sue Gillies •Eina Wong •Hilary Rodgers •James Grayson This team will work with others in ED&I, PaRS, CCS-I, I&IS, and PDD as required. We anticipate that this work could be done within people’s existing roles. 4 Delivery 4.1 Timing considerations Immediate changes: Many of these changes are at the scoping or discovery stage. We also want to customer test any changes that we are proposing to ensure we have got it right for this unique/complex customer group. Longer term opportunities: The Review of Working for Families is in progress, and we expect that decisions could be taken by Ministers in early 2023 calendar year. This timing would work well to simultaneously plan Keymaster to incorporate these decisions to form IR’s social policy strategy. Decisions taken by Ministers could potentially be implemented for the 2024-25 tax year and beyond. 4.2 Delivery challenges/risks Immediate changes: The challenge we see is that we will get the work to the stage where it needs system changes and it will not be high enough on the Enterprise priorities to deliver these changes. These changes will include: •Changes in My IR •Letters stopped/changed •Changes in Te Mātāwai •Changes to our website •New discoveries or work items Longer term opportunities: The key challenges are primarily in resourcing from IR and MSD (depending on their level of involvement), and MSD’s progress/capabilities on their Te Pae Tawhiti business transformation. We have identified the initial core team to develop the work programme, and the success of the initial stage of this initiative will depend on their availability over the coming months. 5 Recommendations Immediate changes: We c ontinue to work on the initiatives we have underway for WfF and that they become an Enterprise priority. Longer term opportunities: We recommend the Group approves to move Keymaster into the second stage of the initiative lifecycle (Discover).

Attendees: Kerryn McIntosh-Watt (chair), David Carrigan, James Grayson, Mary Craig, Sue Gillies, Maraina Hak, Samantha Aldridge, Eina Wong Apologies: none s 9(2)(g)(i) Purpose This paper presents a comprehensive view of the progress, options, challenges, and opportunities for Project Keymaster. We recommend that the Committee: •Discussesthe appetite for implementing “quick win” opportunities ahead of final recommendations via the local change initiative process. •Discussesthe potential risk that post-election policies may divert resources away from the project, which may delay timeframes for delivering recommendations to ELT. 2 3 Context and background •Project Keymaster was endorsed by SIB in June 2023 as an enterprise initiative. The project is focused on developing Inland Revenue's long-term strategy on income support payments delivered through the tax system. It will consider what an ideal tax and transfers structure could look like, what the implications might be, how the current WFF tax credits could be improved, and how support could be made more accessible and timely for customers. This work contributes to our stewardship obligations under the Public Service Act 2020. •The project will consider long-term aspirational goals, nearer-term options for implementation (along a continuum of improvements and larger reform options), and a roadmap to improve customer experiences. We will consider changes to policy, systems, operations/administration, and legislation. •This is an IR-led project that precedes any consultation or discussion with Ministers, partner agencies, or the public. The reason for this is to identify the problems and opportunities, and to take a first-principles approach. •We anticipate providing a package of recommendations to SIB in October 2024. 6 Progress to date •A valuable outcome of these all-of-project condensed workshops is the space to discuss ideas in an open group forum. They gave every team member present an opportunity to voice the thoughts and ideas bubbling away independently, share information and data, and arrive at a majority or consensus view on the state of play. •In other words, we are “getting on the same page”. The project team has highlighted this as a strong outcome to date, particularly as the team members represent different parts of Inland Revenue. For this reason, we plan to have regular quarterly roundtables. These will be in-person as that seems to have the greatest benefit for group discussion. 10 Engagement and customer testing With agencies (MSD, Treasury, MSD): •Initial discussions with agencies to introduce to them Keymaster as IR’s stewardship programme have been mostly positive. There has been interest from them to have influence over the work, and we have emphasized this is an IR-led initiative. We are thinking how best to engage with them as we work through substantive options to consider their perspectives. Customer research: •We are planning to conduct customer research as part of Keymaster. This will be used to test ideas and options, given we will not publicly consult during this project. The research will include qualitative and quantitative analysis. 11 Discussion: Quick win opportunities •In the course of the project, there could be “quick win” opportunities identified (policy or operational). If these opportunities are assessed to have merit to progress alongside Keymaster (i.e., before the October 2024 recommendations), they would follow the normal local change process. Discussion point: if there are multiple changes, how well placed would the department be to implement them, should they get approved to go ahead? 12 Thinking beyond 2024 recommendations •To prepare ahead, we are considering how extensive the recommendations to SIB will be in October 2024. It is likely that there will be options that are considerably complex and will require more time and consideration than is available. We anticipate that there could be further work undertaken after the report is delivered to SIB. For that reason, Keymaster in its current form could be a “version 1.0”, and further work could continue depending on SIB’s appetite to continue with the project. • s 9(2)(g)(i) 13 Discussion: Post-election work and resourcing •The current political manifestos in the social policy area include relatively straightforward changes to WFF, and some changes are common across major parties. We also have some BAU changes to implement per legislated settings. The following changes are likely to occur: •IWTC increase $25 pw (1 April 2024) •5% CPI and MFTC adjustments (1 April 2024) •IETC threshold increase (1 July 2024) •Personal tax threshold adjustments (1 July 2024) •WFF abatement threshold increase (1 April 2026) •If progressed, the Family Boost proposal (1 July 2024) is likely to require resources from the Keymaster project team. This could delay Keymaster timeframes, and we will assess the impacts when we have more information. Discussion point: given that Keymaster is a key stewardship and enterprise initiative, what resourcing plan does the Committee consider would mitigate the risk to the project’s timeframes? Add presentation title if required14 Next steps •The team is continuing to identify the problems and opportunities in the workstreams, building on the August 2-day roundtable. •The data required to progress the work are being identified, and the team is monitoring how best to respond to the requests given the volume of analysis needed. •Background notes are being drafted. These notes will form a library or repository of thinking on this project, not just for the project duration but also beyond it. •We are planning another roundtable for November. We will be seeking to identify remaining major concerns with the thinking. It will be challenging to manage any significant issues after that date, as the team will be focusing on narrowing down options. •We will update PGC in November. Project Keymaster Update Steering Group meeting, 19 October 2023 Executive summary This note is a progress update on Project Keymaster since the Group last met on 25 August. The key points to note are: 1.Overall progress is tracking well against the scoped timeframes for each workstream. Progress on an intermediaries strategy has slowed due to key absences, but we had anticipated that at the start of the project. Generally, there has been a high level of momentum and engagement across the project team in the past four months. This has meant regular information sharing across the project. The bulk of this paper is an update on the various pieces of work for your information. 2.There are two items we would like to discuss with you. The first is resourcing impacts following the general election. While the results will take some time to confirm, we will need to prepare some early advice for the proposed policies. We have identified key people risks for Keymaster particularly with regards to the social policy expertise required. The timeframes for turnaround of advice before Christmas are tight. 3.The second item to discuss is our proposal to include a p rinciples framework to use for the project. This framework goes beyond the typical tax and social policy framework which is relatively neutral on recommendations. Recommendations It is recommended that the Group: •Notes the progress of the project is generally tracking to plan; •Notes the background reading documents in the Appendix B as information only; •Discusses the resource risk and options for post-election work; and •Discusses the proposal for a principles framework to apply for this project. On behalf of the Keymaster core team, Eina Wong Samantha Aldridge Principal Policy Advisor Principal Policy Advisor Item 11 Keymaster 2-monthly update (Oct 2023) Purpose 1.This briefing provides a 2-monthly update on Project Keymaster for governance purposes. The update has two main parts: an update on project management, and an update on relevant analysis and research. We have called out areas for discussion and will note these in the agenda. 2.Other items are provided as informational only. If any members would like to discuss these in more detail, please let us know and we will invite the workstream lead to the meeting. Not in scope 3 Māori perspectives 10.The Māori perspectives team has introduced the He Ara Wai Ora framework to the Keymaster team and will be working through how to apply the framework with each workstream separately. We will need to be flexible about how the framework applies given that some of the workstreams have a more administrative focus rather than a policy focus, and because this is the first time that we have used He Ara Waiora in a stewardship setting. 11.We have brought Rahera Ohia onboard to challenge us on our thinking throughout the project, from a strategic and te ao Māori capability. She has attended our first workshop. In addition to providing input on the workstream papers, we will ask her to provide a strategic view on what might be possible in the Working for Families space. 12.We are aware of the work that is being done in IR on Māori Data Sovereignty and Māori Data Governance and will consider how this might apply to Keymaster as that mahi progresses. 13.At this stage we are not planning external engagement with Māori groups or iwi before recommendations are provided to ELT. We have had an initial discussion with the Mahutonga team, and will discuss any potential external engagement with groups with the team. 14.We are also considering how to include a te ao Māori perspective into the WFF customer research project. Not in scope 4 WFF customer research project 15.We have begun scoping a customer research project and survey to support Keymaster analysis. This will be a year-long project with qualitative and quantitative stages. The plan is the first stage of customer surveying will begin in November and conclude in early 2024. This will help to support the developing analysis in the workstreams. 16.In April 2024, the second stage of quantitative analysis will begin. We anticipate this will conclude in time for the project team to begin formulating their final recommendations to SIB. 17.The cost for this work is being funded by the Intelligence & Insight team. Depending on coalition negotiations, the timing of this work may be delayed. Data team updates 18.The Keymaster analysis will be based on as much data, evidence and insights as possible. We have a separate data team within Keymaster to respond to data requests. In the last update, we described a bespoke Jira process designed for Keymaster to enable transparency not only within the project, but also for the rest of the IR data community. It has proven useful, particularly with the high volume of data requests. As a general learning, we will consider whether a similar process could or should be set up for other policy projects. 19.Because of the high volume of requests, we have brought on board an additional data analyst from the Performance & Reporting team to support the team, for a total of four members. 20.The team has also created a tailored data module for the core team’s use. This data module contains sensitive revenue information and is located on a restricted page of our Sharepoint site. We have documented the expectations for using the module in accordance with the IR code of conduct and IKM guidelines. Analysis and research for discussion 22.Since the August roundtable, the project team has steadily progressed the scoped work programmes for each workstream. The team has started documenting these in background notes. For this update, we have included a brief synopsis of the draft findings and have included links to them if you wish to read more detail. s 18(c)(i) s 9(2)(g)(i) 5 Principles of Keymaster 23.In the course of group discussions to date, there was an increasingly clear need to develop a set of principles for the project. The main reasons were: a.The typical tax and social policy frameworks we use are relatively objective in addressing matters that require a more human-centred response or approach. This often leads to less clear recommendations. b.Our experience in supporting vulnerable customer groups first hand (i.e., front line staff interacting with customers) has highlighted the importance of situational contexts that are not always considered when designing policy. For example, if someone is not financially literate, is it appropriate that we have an expectation they self-serve WFF obligations on myIR? 24.The purpose of developing these principles is to provide a further framework to guide the project team in developing their recommendations, and to allow for debate. We propose this to be a living document as the project progresses. 25.We recommend the Steering Group to discuss the merits of such a document, and we welcome any comments. Other background documents 28.In Appendix B, links to other background documents are provided as optional reading. Next steps 29.Our intention is to hold our next roundtable on 1 December. This will be an opportunity for the project team to debate the analysis so far and discuss any reservations with the direction of travel. If post-election work displaces resources for the project, we will reconsider whether to continue with the roundtable for that date. 30.The next date for meeting with the Sub-ELT governance group is 31 October. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 18(c)(i) 6 Appendix A: Status of Workstreams \[Put any optional reading into an appendix.

It will consider: •The current WFF tax credits and how they could be improved to better fit their intended purposes from policy and administrative lenses, •What an ideal tax and transfers structure could be, •Implications of separating WFF from the Revenue Acts/income tax, and •Improving accessibility and timeliness of support for customers. This will be a first-principles review of Working for Families, the first to be done in the nearly 50 years since IR began administering these support payments. Though titled “Working for Families”, this project will also consider at high level the Independent Earner Tax Credit, Child Support, Paid Parental Leave, Student Loans, and other policies where relevant (and where we have policy responsibility). However, WFF will be the primary focus of this stewardship initiative. A summary of the tax credits is provided in the Appendix.

This project would be prioritised as an Enterprise Initiative. For our purposes, “income support” comprises support typically provided through tax credits and main benefits. “Tax system” refers to IR’s information and system capabilities. We will look at policy and operational changes to improve the customer experience through a stewardship lens. It will be undertaken from May 2022, for a period of 16 months. Key milestones for this project are: October 2023 contribute to the Briefing to the Income Minister (BIM) November 2023 contribute to advice on the WFF Review (for Budget 2024) October 2024 final recommendations for the strategy presented to ELT (for Budget 2025 if required) Because this work will contribute to the BIM, there is some urgency to getting it started. Staff resources required from PaRS, PD&D, ED&I, SPS, CCS-I, Tech Standards, CI&E. SOM E KEY FACTS The Crown currently invests $3 billion each year on WFF payments to around 350,000 families. These families make up around 56% of all NZ families with children. In contrast, just over twice that funding is spent on main benefits each year, to around 350,000 individuals and families 1 . If we include the Independent Earner Tax Credit (IETC) as part of those statistics, IR services an additional 500,000 individuals as part of income support, 13% of all NZ adults. 2 1 At a point in time, including families without children. 2 There are an estimated 4 million adult individuals in NZ and 620,000 families with children. 4 The welfare benefits and WFF tax credit system is complex. One significant consequence of this complexity is the potential for overpayments to customers. As of April 2023, 57,000 WFF customers had a combined debt balance of $247 million. 3 •Around half of this debt is over 2 years old. •IR actively collects repayment from 16,000 of these customers (28%), representing $38 million of the total debt (15%). In TY23 YTD, IR wrote off 91,000 debts for a total of $80 million. Most of these were due to “other” grounds. These figures are four times those for TY22, and we note this is likely due to the flooding from the cyclone event in early 2023. Adjusting for this, most of the write off amount is for hardship reasons. WFF customers in particular are among IR’s most vulnerable customer segments who have higher need for support. In TY23 YTD, IR had 102,000 customer contacts for WFF reasons (about 10% of all accepted calls), with another 306,000 web contacts for customer support. 3 Figures are from the April 2023 Business Performance Report. Filing for the 2023 tax year has not been completed. 5 CURRENT CUSTOM ER EXP ERIENCE IR has recently completed research on WFF customers’ experience and debt owed to government. There is an overarching positive confirmation that WFF payments are an important component of families’ weekly income. At the same time, aiming to administer the payments accurately can create pain points. Over 12% of WfF customers are overpaid by more than $1,000 each year, and over 20% are underpaid by the same amount. The following points encapsulate what we understand and hear the most often from our customers. •Many families rely on Working for Families payments to meet their week-to-week living costs, so support needs to be certain and timely. •WfF is complex, (4 different components with differing eligibility criteria and calculation bases), and the onus is on families to estimate their income •Estimation is hard for those with variable working hours, multiple jobs and/or unexpected lump sums (e.g., paid out leave, changing jobs/Child support arrears); families often deliberately overestimate their income (eroding in-year support) to ‘stay safe’, and/or are disincentivised to work more hours •This complexity coupled with reliance on payments and the lack of certainty, drives the need for reassurance and resultant high levels of customer contact, and makes it difficult for many families to confidently self-serve •Customers experience inconsistent outcomes when an overpayment occurs. During the year accumulative adjustments 4 reduce payments (sometimes to nil), whereas overpayments at square-up are billed to the customer and (often) written off •Although both parties in a couple are jointly and severally liable for WfF debt, the debt resides on the principal caregiver’s account, and collection activity primarily pursues the principal caregiver •There is a punitive aspect to WfF debt (it attracts late payment penalties); however, those with WfF debt often show evidence of financial hardship – a quarter have total debt more than 20% of their annual income. Despite a large volume of write-offs, WfF debt is slowly but surely trending upwards over time. People who are currently being overpaid are willing to risk penalties and interest because they need the support. This is true for MSD payments as well. •When moving from a benefit to full time work, support typically transitions from MSD to IR. Families are often confused about who to tell what, and experience gaps and/or double ups in support as the administering agency changes 4 To minimise the risk of debt, early interventions run periodically during the tax year to identify families with potential overpayments and take action. This includes automatically reducing payments for the remainder of the tax year, a process known as accumulative adjustments. 6 PROBL EM DEFINITION – WHY A STEWARD SHIP P ROGRAM M E AND NOW? WFF was implemented in 2004-07, and policy changes since then have been implemented based on the aims of the government of the day. Changes to WFF have predominantly tweaked the settings to increase and/or target the generosity of support. However, more recent changes to benefit settings, changes to the calculation of MFTC threshold, and the increased growth of the minimum wage has created misalignments in the overall support system. It has also meant that the administration of WFF has become increasingly complex, resulting in confusion, increased debt, and uncertainty of support for customers. It is no longer achieving its original purpose well. At the same time, how we work and how we define a family have evolved. Employment has become more fluid relative to days past when people worked 9 to 5 jobs. There is an increasingly greater proportion of single-parent families, extended-family households (particularly with the increased cost of living), and growing acknowledgement that relationships change more frequently than in the past. As a result of the continual and somewhat piecemeal policy changes and the evolution of modern life, there hasn’t been an opportunity to take stock of the existing WFF settings from a strategic perspective (hence the recommendations from the WEAG in 2019 and the Tax Working Groups 2010 and 2019 that the WFF system be reviewed). The accumulation of those impacts (as well as with changes to main benefits, rising inflation and income growth) raises questions from a stewardship lens on whether the original set up of WFF is still fit for purpose, given what we are seeing from our customers and in the data. M OTIVATION FOR T HIS INITI ATIVE/ OUTP UT Recent governments have had a strong interest in improving income support through the transfers system: •The Family Incomes Package (FIP) was enacted as part of Budget 2017. The goal of the package was to improve work incentives for low income individuals and to provide support through the transfers (WFF and benefit) system. The main changes included increases to the FTC and Accommodation Supplement and Accommodation Benefit. These were implemented alongside tax cuts via increased tax bracket thresholds that were scheduled for 1 April 2018, and repealing the IETC. ($2 billion package at the time) •After winning the general election in late 2017, the Labour-led coalition government implemented its flagship Families Package as part of its strategy to reduce child poverty numbers. The Families Package increased FTC rates even further than the FIP, introduced the Best Start tax credit (BSTC) and Winter Energy Payment, increased PPL to a maximum of 26 weeks, repealed the tax cuts from Budget 2017, and reinstated the IETC. ($5.5 billion package at the time) •In 2018, child poverty reduction targets were embedded in legislation, holding successive governments accountable for meeting those periodic targets and thereby prioritising this as a government objective for the near term. (10-year targets set for 27/28 fiscal year) •The Welfare Expert Advisory Group released its recommendations in early 2019 (with a $5 billion package), concluding that an “overhaul” of the benefit and the WFF system was 7 warranted. An officials-led Review of Working for Families commenced, and still continues today without having implemented any “reformative” options. In the same period, a global pandemic and the resulting economic consequences have impacted individuals and families, increasing demand for public policy advice. •As part of its response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Government explored ways to financially support businesses, individuals and families during the national lockdowns. Inland Revenue was and continues to be a key contributor in the policy development and administration. The policies ranged from income support for individuals and families (through Working for Families, Covid Income Relief Payment) to businesses (Wage Subsidy, Leave Subsidy, Small Business Cashflow Scheme, Resurgence Support Payment, etc). To be clear, these policies are not tax policies per se. They are forms of income support that were delivered (or in some cases, supported) by IR, largely because of IR’s established technological and information infrastructure and its expertise in policy and administration. •More recently, as a flow-on consequence of the Covid pandemic and compounded by environmental/weather factors, inflation has increased to record highs in a relatively short period. As a result, concerns over the costs of living are forefront. In Budget 2022, the Government introduced the Cost of Living Payment, a $350 lump sum non-taxable payment delivered by IR to a large number of individuals. The trend is likely to continue as economists are predicting a global recession in 2023 and interest rates continue to rise. The takeaway from this is that public interest and Ministerial demand for income support advice is highly likely to continue. In early 2023, the Prime Minister announced his intentions of focusing on improving costs of living as part of Budget 2023; however, no changes for WFF were included. Comments from political parties suggest this will be a focus for the upcoming 2023 general election. WHAT IS THE VAL UE OF THIS I NITI ATIVE? At the end of the day, we want to improve our customers’ service experience. WFF customers represent IR’s most vulnerable customer group. From customer interviews, we have heard the difficulties in accessing their entitlements and the real impacts this can have on their lives and well- being. They are sobering accounts. When we administer social policies, we are bound by legislation and operational guidelines. Within these bounds, there are improvements that we believe will help our customers. Work is underway to improve our customer service delivery via changes to communications and website content, guidance for customer service staff, and customer education (refer to Sue Gillies’s work). We’ve been asked, “Can we influence decision-makers?” In short, if we have a long-term plan, then it’s entirely possible. This is the purpose of the proposed stewardship initiative. IR officials’ view is that advice on WFF requested by ministers has been largely reactive since its introduction. At the same time, analysis is limited to a short period, either a year or two on either side of the proposed policy. This is also reinforced through the annual Budget process and the focus on only the forecast period (i.e., four years out). This means that longer-term impacts and implications are given a cursory look, if any. This can have unintended consequences on, for 8 example, effective administration, or child poverty rates on a more detrimental level socioeconomically. We are not looking to establish the next political campaign’s focus (whichever party we think about). Rather, we will focus on fundamental issues that are basic and agnostic to political aims, which will provide an element of endurance/longevity to the strategic plan. This has the benefit of fostering discussions with future governments on any proposed incremental changes to Working for Families they may wish to pursue. We also intend to approach this initiative using a systems thinking lens, to ensure we understand the forces at play and possible points of leverage, across the income support system. WHY AN I NL AND REVEN UE-L ED INITI ATIVE? There are multiple reasons for IR to consider a significant stewardship project on the future of income support via the tax system. IR is the administrator of tax policy and revenue collection. As tax and transfers should be considered part and parcel, we are uniquely positioned to comment on this area. Taxes and transfers together form effective marginal tax rates, which can influence individuals’ and families’ work incentives and adequacy of income. As the primary administrator and joint advisor on WFF, we see the difficulties our customers are experiencing. Customer service delivery provides the empirical evidence of the policies, and we have years of data to draw from 5 . We are building on the momentum gained from the Review of Working for Families. To support the Review, IR has: •built datasets and dashboards to enable policy analysis, with support from the internal data community (through the Data and Analytics Request delivery teams) •explored the policy, legislative, systems, and customer service impacts on many policies, both large and small. Let’s use this collective knowledge and expertise to put down what we know and what we would recommend to change. There is also a question about what IR’s role is with the completion of the Business Transformation (BT) programme. BT didn’t focus on substantive changes to social policy (e.g., the 2017 discussion document didn’t progress), and IR has recently had an increasing role in providing government supports. The Public Service Commissioner has proposed that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue be the lead of Service Transformation. What that role could entail is still to be decided; this project could contribute to that discussion. We note that a jointly-led project with our agency partners, primarily MSD, would be ideal to undertake such a project. However, we acknowledge that MSD is starting their own business 5 Though we will need to make concessions for the switch to START on the data analysis. 9 transformation, which will limit their technological capacity for change over the next 10+ years. They are also experiencing constraints on their resource capacity in their policy and operational arms. Given the timely opportunity this project brings, we are reluctant to delay it. Instead, we propose that some workstreams will require more MSD engagement, and we will make our best effort to engage with them on these in a timely and opportune way. Whether they have the capacity to engage is something we are unable to control. 10 WORKING FOR FAM IL IE S: STEWARD SHIP PROG RAM M E OF WORK DELIVERY LEAD: EINA WONG AND SAMANTHA ALDRIDGE, PARS Our goal: To develop an enduring social policy and tax credit system that will achieve better outcomes and experiences for New Zealanders. Main output from a 16-month work programme: A strategic plan whose focus is on how to improve the delivery of income support to individuals and families through the tax system. Interim outputs will include: 1.Advising Ministers in the Briefing to the Income Minister (October 2023) 2.Contributing to the WFF Review as part of Budget 2024 WORKING P RINCIP L ES A ND ASSUM P TIONS TO T HE WORK P ROGRAM M E AP P ROACH •The strategic plan will be non-partisan. •We will look for opportunities to be flexible so we can adapt to changing environments. •We will assume the status quo settings as a counterfactual for any recommended changes. This includes: oLegislation oSystems and people capability oProfiles of customers currently serviced oInformation collected •While one dimension of this project is about information collection and sharing, we will not cover IR’s strategic direction on data collection and usage. That will be addressed through a separate channel. •Because we are looking at policy, administrative, legislative, and systems changes, we would ideally have staff from all different parts of IR to represent those business areas. The analysis will adapt a basic framework used for tax and social policy purposes. This framework was used by the Tax Working Group 2010 which has been generally accepted as a default policy framework. It considers trade offs of equity and fairness, efficiency and growth, fiscal cost, revenue integrity and coherence, and compliance and administration costs. Because we are working specifically on social policy, we may enhance the framework by including income adequacy and child poverty objectives, for example. 11 RESOURCE REQUIREM E NTS (NO F UND ING REQ UIRED ) •Investment in IR’s resources and capabilities (i.e., people). Estimated FTEs are provided in the next section. •Time. 16 months may seem like a long period, but we want to give a considered view for an area that is complex both in terms of policy development and administration. Our current system of a broad base, low rate (BBLR) had a long development process, and started with initial thinking stages similar to what we are proposing with this initiative. This initiative may not end up with implementing something transformative, but it is an important step to guide our thinking as we advise Ministers. •There is no additional funding requested for this initiative. We are working on the presumption that FTEs will be able to provide their expertise as part of their usual roles. For completeness, we may require some minimal funding for research purposes, but we do not expect that to be required. We already have a stock of research available. If we require funding, we will return to PPG and SIB. 12 THE 5 M AIN P ARTS (WO RKSTREAMS) 1.Blank Slate 2.Decoupling WFF from the Revenue Acts 3.Information Access 4.An all-of-government access to support 5.The role of intermediaries Each workstream has (or will have soon) a RASCI framework with a work plan detailing the scope of work, objectives, and a description of the output to be produced. Brief summaries of each workstream are provided in the next section. A one-page overview of this work programme is attached. For each workstream, we have pencilled in the appropriate people from different parts of IR who have the subject matter expertise to contribute to the work, and estimated FTE required. The Delivery Lead will coordinate the pieces of work to ensure that the workstreams are working efficiently together, both to share information/thinking and to avoid duplication of effort. Regular meetings will be scheduled with the leads of each workstream. FTE estimates are provided based on each person’s expected average involvement over the 16- month programme. We anticipate there will be peak and trough periods. In particular, the initial few months after the kickoff will involve more participation from everyone as we establish the work programme and form a common understanding of the issues, what we are aiming to achieve, and how to do that. The FTE estimates are spread across a broad range of individuals. This is deliberate, as we are seeking for their input based on their unique experience and expertise. For those outside of PaRS, we anticipate this input to be primarily through group discussions. There may be instances where they will be asked to provide data or other information. We will be mindful about imposing on their other work, and in any case, we expect that participating in this project would complement their normal roles and development. WORKSTREAM 1: BL ANK SL ATE (RESP ONSI BL E – EM M A HAM IL TON, PARS) Output: An agreed ideal state of income support through the tax system, and how it could potentially be achieved in the long run. Purpose: To serve as a barometer against which we would measure or test policy options of the day. It is not intended to provide solely an “achievable” or “feasible” end state, as that would constrain our thinking, but rather it will provide something for IR to aspire to. Note that this work will focus on economic frameworks and tradeoffs, and will not have a specific or detailed option. For example, if a flat tax were to be recommended as a future ideal state, we would not suggest an “optimal tax rate of XX” as part of that. We would consider the high-level implications on IR in the long term for any recommended changes.

Purpose: This work underlays how we develop policies and how we operationalise them. Information and data is key to understanding the problems identified and whether proposed changes could have an effective outcome. As such, there are two focuses for this work. The first is exploring the information required to better serve the status quo, and the second is what would be required ideally. In this manner, all of the other workstreams of this work will feed into this work, and vice versa.

The following staff will work across workstreams 3, 4 and 5: Information security and privacy Kevin McArtney ED&I strategic architecture DATA RESOURCE The intent is to base the work on as much data and evidence as possible and where feasible. For this reason, we expect to use the internal data community to support this work. This primarily includes: •Sandra Watson’s forecasting and modelling team (Chris Fitzgerald, PaRS), and •A dedicated person from the data teams that service the “data and analytics request” or DAR process. We will follow the existing process for using both resources to request data. We expect that these two resources will be engaged with each other to check for consistency/sense of the data analytics produced. To establish a common understanding of the income support context, a paper will be prepared as a first step to describe basic statistics such as population and customer income distributions, family makeup and relationship changes, benefit and WFF receipt, and other relevant points. (June 2023) CUSTOM ER INS IGHTS A critical part of the thinking will be taking account of customer insights and feedback. We are not proposing to consult with the public at this stage. We will initially use the store of feedback we have and use tools that are currently available to us, such as customer surveys, interviews, and analysis. There may be a need to consult with our customers if there is an identified gap in our knowledge. The resource will be: s 9(2)(g)(i) 18 •Mark Sands, Customer Insight and Evaluation (II&S) HOW WE WIL L CONSID ER MĀORI PERSPECTIVES (HE ARA WA IORA) Our intent is to consider Māori perspectives, including through the application of the He Ara Waiora framework. Work is currently progressing within PaRS on how the framework can be applied to tax and social policy. We propose that a resource from the Māori Perspectives domain (PaRS) leads the work for this project, with support from a Families & Individuals advisor (PaRS). The expectation is that the resource will engage with their Māori Perspectives team and the Tax and Social Policy Māori Advisory Panel as needed, and provide input as this project develops. •Māori Perspectives lead, PaRS: TBC (L1/L2), 0.4 FTE •F&I support, PaRS: Andrew Paynter (L1), 0.1 FTE The graphic below illustrates that Data, Customer Insights, and He Ara Waiora will be considered throughout the project and across the 5 workstreams. Internal and external engagement will be discussed further below. This project involves individuals from multiple business groups within IR and covers a reasonably broad range of topics in a 16-month timeframe. To help coordinate this, we have requested a project manager from PaRS. This person will be dedicated to the work programme for 0.6 FTE. 19 Not in scope 20 TIM EL INE AND KEY M IL ESTONES The work programme will follow three main phases: PHASE 1: PREPARATION (MAY TO JUNE 2024) This phase will focus on establishing the main work areas within scope, responsibilities and how we work together. Detailed work programmes of each Workstream will be developed, along with deliverables and timelines. PHASE 2: THE CRUX (JULY 2023 TO JUNE 2024) This year-long phase will see the development and completion of the work areas in scope. Broadly, the work will include literature surveys, data analysis, policy analysis, and administrative implications where relevant. Advisors will draft background papers and hold discussions with internal staff (and external stakeholders where relevant). This phase will conclude with near-final Workstream recommendations. The early part of this phase will give consideration to what could be included in the Briefing to Incoming Ministers (BIM), due in October 2023. PHASE 3: FINALISATION (JULY TO OCTOBER 2024) This phase will focus on the final recommendations to be presented to SIB. Focus will be on using the near-final Workstream recommendations. The allotted time will allow us to circle back to the individual Workstreams if there are any follow up questions or analysis required. A particular focus will be on holding roundtables with those who have been involved with this project directly, and other stakeholders in the lead up to the final report. Having October 2024 as the projected completion date is challenging, though achievable. This timing also aligns with the enterprise planning cycle for the 25/26 financial year and any potential bids for Budget 25. HOW THIS F ITS WIT H THE WFF REV IEW The WFF Review work programme is expected to continue through 2023, with potential decisions in early 2024. IR may need to implement substantial changes effective 1 April 2025. Samantha Aldridge is leading this work. Further policy work and implementation advice will be required by end of 2023. As part of the advice, IR will need to consider how the options considered would fit with the strategy and whether we recommend them or something else. We will use the time pre- and post-election to do this, and to include in the BIM. We will have a keen interest in thinking about the longer term implications of the options, not only on our customers but also on IR as an administrator. The following tables present the key milestones for both the WFF Programme of Work and the WFF Review for calendar years 2023 and 2024: 22 INTERNAL GO VERNA NC E AND ENGAGEM ENT We will use the RASCI matrix to establish the roles and responsiblities for this project: Responsible Eina Wong and Samantha Aldridge (PaRS) Accountable Maraina Hak (PaRS) and TBC (CCS-I) Supporting workstream leads and their team members – Emma Hamilton (PaRS), Hilary Rodgers (ED&I), Carolyn Thomas (ED&I), Graham Tubb (PaRS) Consulted David Carrigan (DCE, PaRS) and James Grayson (DCE, CCS-I) Informed Remaining ELT members, PPG To ensure that the initiative is progressing in the desired direction, there will be a strict governance structure. This structure will be organised as follows: 1.A Steering Group will be created to oversee the initiative, to provide feedback on the work to date, and to provide guidance on strategic direction at a more granular level. The group will also be updated on any resourcing concerns. Steering Group Policy Director, PaRS (chair) Kerryn McIntosh-Watt CCS-I FAM Segment Lead Sue Gillies Chief Economist Phil Whittington Policy Lead-Māori Perspectives, PaRS Charles Ngaki Strategic Architecture Lead Cate Robertson Strategic Advisor, ED&I Ron Grindle Enterprise Leader, CCS Planning, Design & Delivery Joanne Taranaki The Delivery Lead (Eina and Samantha) will meet with the Steering Group 2-monthly. 2.We propose that an ELT sub-group be provided more frequent updates and have the opportunity to provide input in the progress. This sub-group would include the DCEs of PaRS, CCS-I, and ED&I. These would be 2-monthly. 3.We propose that SIB and PPG will be updated quarterly in terms of progress and resourcing. 4.For each of the workstreams, regular meetings will be organised to discuss with internal stakeholders. These will be organised by each Workstream Lead. 5.Regular weekly meetings will be organised by the Delivery Lead with their respective Workstream Leads. Meetings to discuss any cross-over work will be organised as needed by the Delivery Lead. 23 Responsibilities Delivery Lead •Ensuring the work is coordinated, both within and across workstreams •Monitoring progress and resources •Updating the Governance Group, PPG, and SIB Regularly Steering Group •Oversees the initiative’s progress and direction •Provides feedback on work to date •Discusses any resource concerns 2-monthly ELT sub-group •Oversees the initiative’s progress and direction •Provides feedback on work to date •Discusses any resource concerns 2-monthly PPG •Discusses any resource concerns from a Department demand perspective Quarterly SIB/PGC •Provides feedback on work to date and strategic direction, and any risks Quarterly Workstream Leads •Carries out the agreed work plan of their workstream •Escalates any resourcing concerns •Notes contingencies from either internal or external factors (e.g., need to discuss with another agency before progressing) As needed EXTERNAL ENGAGEM EN T WITH M SD AND OTHE R GOVERNM ENT AGE NC IES This project has the potential to: •influence thinking on social policies outside of IR, which are generally jointly-developed, and •require input from other agencies, particularly data supplies and information technology (such as MSD). We propose that engagement will be regularly undertaken with relevant Government agency stakeholders via the following channels: •Kerryn McIntosh-Watt and Maraina Hak via the WFF Review Governance Group. This group has oversight of the WFF Review’s progress and provides a natural venue to discuss WFF- related policies. The Review is expected to progress through 2024, and options currently presented will need to be considered from a stewardship perspective. •Eina Wong and Samantha Aldridge via the WFF Review Working Group. This group meets weekly to discuss details of the options being considered. 24 •Sue Gillies via the MSD/IR Relationship Oversight Group. This group meets every two months to discuss common areas of work that have priority. Some workstreams will require more engagement, as discussed above. HOW THIS F ITS WIT H EKE TANGAROA This initiative aligns very closely to Eke Tangaroa and IR’s priority to deliver and improve services for our customers and managing our performance. In particular, this initiative supports the current Government in its priority work areas, which includes reforming the welfare system and addressing individual debt owed to Government. Not progressing this initiative increases IR’s enterprise risks: (1)Failure to deliver for customers or Government priorities, and (7) Failure to provide appropriate stewardship of the tax and social policy system This initiative also fits with the refresh of IR’s economic wellbeing framework, covering the three core roles of effective and efficient administrator, steward of the tax and social policy system, and delivering value as a public sector agency. IR’S BUS INE SS OBJE CTI VES – VAL UE FR AM EWORK This initiative fits most closely with the integrity business objective: integrity and trust of the revenue system is maintained. The WFF system was introduced in 2004 and successive changes to the parameters have been made since then. Some changes have increased or further targeted support, and some changes have been made with the intent to improve or in some cases, ignore, the impacts on work incentives. While this initiative primarily meets the “integrity and trust” business objective, it will also help to meet the objective of "ease of complying” and “customer certainty”. A satisfactory outcome would be to improve the wellbeing of New Zealanders, and particularly of our WFF customers. If they feel better supported or empowered, and have less need to contact IR, then that would be a desirable outcome. This initiative would also help to increase customer confidence and awareness. 25 RISKS TO SUC CESS FUL D EL IVERY OF P ROJECT Potential Impacts Mitigation 1 Initiative start is delayed (also applies if initiative has already begun) Unlikely we would provide much substantive input into the Oct 23 BIM, and delays ability to advise Ministers on strategic opportunities for Budgets 24 and 25 Commit resourcing to the initiative as proposed 2 Insufficient people capacity to deliver (also applies if Government priorities change) Delay in delivering strategic plan, with flow-on implications for policy advice Seek enterprise commitment/prioritisation in IR’s work programme Will embed points where we can pause the work programme 3 Lack of cross-agency involvement/contribution Inability to provide fulsome analysis or to deliver some workstreams (information access in particular) External engagement (early and sustained). Whether they engage is largely out of our control. 4 Incomplete administrative data Administrative data for WfF customers is held across IR and MSD. Without all customer data, our analysis may not be reliable nor complete in some areas We will engage with MSD and our information sharing team about what may be possible in the interim. (E.g., one-off data requests) 5 Interdependencies across different workstreams The dependencies across the 5 different workstreams are complex. This could result in delays and/or re-work Delivery Leads will ensure dependencies are identified, communicated and tracked across workstreams. A project manager will be appointed. Where necessary, use working assumptions until clear decisions are reached. 6 Incomplete understanding of our customers Customer needs are diverse and will differ across different groups (e.g., longer term beneficiary families, families with higher earnings receiving lump sums) Embed customer insight capability in all workstreams. Where there are gaps, we will consider ways to gather information (e.g., customer surveys/interviews) 26 AP P END IX: BRIEF OVER VIEW OF WORKING FOR FAM IL IES Around 56% of all families in New Zealand receive WFF, at a cost of $2.7 billion for the 2022 income tax year. WFF is made up of the following tax credits: Family Tax Credit (257,450 families, $1.9b): the main payment received by both beneficiary and non-beneficiary families and is not dependent on work status. As of 1 April 2023, families receive $136 per week for the eldest child and $111 per week for each subsequent child. This payment begins to abate at $42,700 of annual family income at 27%. In-Work Tax Credit (163,406 families, $483m): the main in-work payment for families who do not receive a benefit. It pays $72.50 per week for families with 1 to 3 children, with an extra $15 per week for each subsequent child. After the Family Tax Credit is fully abated, it is abated at 27%. Best Start Tax Credit (129,681 families, $302m): this payment provides $69 per week to all families with a child under one year old, and for lower income families with a child under 3. For children aged 1 to 2 years, this payment begins to abate at $79,000 of annual family income at 21%. Minimum Family Tax Credit (3,149 families, $13m): this payment tops up incomes of working families and guarantees a minimum income level for low-income families working at least 20 hours per week who do not receive a benefit. The minimum income is currently set at $34,216 of annual family income after tax. While not part of the WFF suite, there is an additional tax credit provided to individuals that is also relevant in income support policies: Independent Earner Tax Credit (493,400 individuals, $212m): this payment is a work incentive for individuals who earn between $24,000 and $48,000 each year. Those who are eligible to receive WFF are not entitled to this. It is a weekly payment of $10 and begins to abate at $44,000 at 13%. Unlike WFF tax credits, it is a non-refundable tax credit. 10 In a perfect world, we would have perfect targeting, perfect uptake, nil compliance burden.

This exercise should take about an hour of reading, plus another hour of discussion with a wider group at IR. Context on Project Keymas ter Project Keymaster is Inland Revenue’s review of the Working for Families tax credits (WFF). It is an enterprise priority endorsed by SIB in June 2023. Keymaster is a first-principles review and the first since WFF was introduced in 2004. The project will focus on whether the current settings are fit for purpose, how they could be improved, and how they could fit in a longer-term tax and transfers system more ideally. Importantly, we are considering through this project how to improve accessibility and timeliness of support for our customers. As part of the project, we are also taking a people-centred approach and considering the perspectives of families, Māori and iwi, and Inland Revenue staff. We have begun engaging these groups on some proposed ideas. Their feedback will provide insights on how the “lived” community experiences income support delivered through Inland Revenue, and how Inland Revenue can contribute meaningfully to their lives over time. How the Principle s came about The project team has identified potential options for change which we are continuing to de velop. They range between small improvements to the status quo and significant reformative changes. While these options were developed, we had lively discussions and debate on wider questions. For example: Questions like these led us to developing the principles to help us design the options. As discussed in the main document, the principles can be subjective. This is why we are engaging with you on them. s 9(2)(f)(iv), s 9(2)(g)(i) Item 19 2 What do you think? The main questions we would like your feedback on are: 1.Are the principles reasonable, given the purpose we are using them for? 2.How could we improve on them? 3.Is there anything we have not considered or is missing from discussion? We have applied the principles to several options to show how well they work for our purposes. Next steps We will cons ider your feedback when we refine the Principles document. We will be meeting with the project’s governance group and ELT members to discuss in May 2024. Once finalised, we will assess any options in this project as part of the final report to ELT members in December 2024.

This note covers the Best Start Tax Credit (BSTC), including current settings, identification of issues and options to address, and recommendations. Introduction Best Start was introduced in July 2018 as part of the Families Package and replaced the more tightly targeted Parental Tax Credit (PTC). BSTC was intended to deliver more money to families with children and contribute to child poverty reduction. It is a per-child payment in the first three years of a child’s life, in line with evidence that this is the best time to invest in their wellbeing. The first year of Best Start is not income-contingent, however it abates at a rate of 21% for family income above $79,000 when a child is aged 1 to 2 years. This reflects the policy intent to be an almost universal entitlement in the first year of a child's life, but more targeted to lower income families in the second and third years. Like the Family Tax Credit, Best Start is apportioned for shared care, is available to both working and beneficiary families, and is protected from abatement for any months where the principal caregiver receives a main benefit and family income is below the monthly abatement threshold. Families cannot receive BSTC and Paid parental leave at the same time for the same child, and so BSTC payments typically start when PPL payments end. A decision was made to implement BSTC as part of the WFF scheme, in order to meet tight timeframes set by the Government. Data For the 2022 tax year, 138K families (38.6% of WFF customers) received $296M in Best Start payments. Most families received instalment payments during the year (88%) and most from Inland Revenue (65%). The mean value of Best Start per family was $2,142.

The average family scheme income for BSTC recipients in the 2022 tax year was $83.24K, compared to $65.56K for all WFF customers. A very small proportion of Best Start families had shared care (2,684 families or 1.94%). By comparison, a slightly larger proportion of FTC recipients had shared care (5.24%). Best Start recipients by family income and household type 4 , 2022 tax year Of the 95K Best Start recipients who received in year payments and were squared up by IR, 30% received their correct Working for Families entitlement (across all tax credits), 42% were underpaid by more than $50, and 27% were overpaid by more than $50. Families with higher levels of income and those receiving most of their income from a main benefit were more likely to receive accurate payments. Those with lower incomes who were also working were less likely to receive accurate payments and were more likely to have a large (>$1K) underpayment than a large overpayment. 2 This is the net amount and will comprise both under and overpayments. 3 Families who have received Best Start during the year for one or more children. 4 ‘Beneficiary’ - families who earn nearly all of their income from a main benefit. ‘MSD managed, in work’ – families paid by MSD who also earn some income from employment. 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 BeneficiaryMSD managed, in workSole parent Couple, single earnerCouple, both earners 3 Best Start recipients by square up outcome and family income, 2022 tax year Best Start and Paid parental leave Families cannot receive BSTC and PPL at the same time for the same child, and so Best start payments typically start once PPL has ended. However, PPL can be applied for retrospectively, and this can result in overpayments of Best Start. Approximately 800-1,000 families are overpaid BSTC while receiving PPL each year 5 .

Best Start-only families are more likely to: •have higher levels of family income, (the average family scheme income for BSTC-only families is $156K, compared with $65K for the WFF population) •be couples who are both in paid work, (87% of BSTC-only families, compared with 34% of the WFF population) •and receive correct entitlements during the year, (46% of BSTC-only families were within $50 of the correct entitlement at square up, compared with 16% of the general WFF population). Further data on this cohort is covered in the Appendices. 5 https://irnz.atlassian.net/browse/DKM-49 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000 >1K cr<1K cr+/- $50<$1K dr>$1K dr 4 Literature summary Welfare Expert Advisory Group report 6 (2019) The WEAG was established in 2018 to provide advice on the future of New Zealand’s social security system. Their report, released in February 2019, laid out 42 key recommendations on how the welfare system could be changed to better meet the needs of New Zealanders. The report included the following recommendations in relation to Best Start: •Make Best Start universal for all children aged under 3 years, to focus support on families with young children, simplify the system and avoid overlapping abatement and high effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) for some, (Recommendation 23). •Change the interaction between Best Start and Paid parental leave, so that unavoidable overpayments do not occur, and families are entitled to receive both at the same time. Best Start tax credit stocktake 7 (2021) As part of the Working for Families review, an internal briefing note was drafted on the Best Start tax credit. The note provides a comprehensive background of the history, payment rates, eligibility, and other settings for this tax credit. The following issues are noted: •Interaction with Paid parental leave creating overpayments and debt. •Unnecessary complexity introduced by a separate abatement regime. •Greater risk of debt due to not accumulatively adjusting payments during the year. Estimates of take-up of the Best Start tax credit (2022) 8 This study was part of MSD’s work to monitor and evaluate the Families package and subsequent income support changes and sought to estimate eligibility and take up rates for the Best Start tax credit for the first 15 months of Best Start (July 2018 – December 2019). The study was based on linked administrative data held in the Stats NZ Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI). Population characteristics Over half of children (54 percent) had a caregiver who received PPL and who were not on benefit. Just over one fifth (21.4 percent) had a parent in receipt of a main benefit in the first three months. Just under a quarter of recipients did not receive a main benefit or PPL. More children were born in high deprivation areas than in low deprivation areas (for example 15.2 percent of births in the lowest deprivation quintile compared with 27.0 in the highest deprivation quintile. Eligibility and take up estimates The study estimated that 96.5 percent of children born within the study window (July 2018 – December 2019) were eligible for Best Start. The data indicated a take up rate of 96.9 percent in the first 15 months (68,097 families). While there were some small differences in take up rates by population characteristics (for example families who did not receive either PPL or benefit), take up was assessed as high. The ethnicity findings are summarised below. Child ethnic group(s) Number of births Estimated BSTC eligibility Estimated BSTC take-up (of those who were eligible) 6 Welfare Expert Advisory Group Report | Welfare Expert Advisory Group - Kia Piki Ake (weag.govt.nz) 7 TC-2 2021-06-02 BSTC stocktake V1.0.docx 8 Estimating-take-up-of-the-best-start-tax-credit.pdf (msd.govt.nz) 5 Asian 15,216 87.9% 96.3% European 47,088 99.0% 97.1% Māori 20,892 100.0% 97.2% Pacific 11,154 98.8% 97.5% MELAA 9 1,755 88.2% 94.4% Other 294 98.0% 96.9% The authors also highlighted that in comparison to survey estimating take up of social support internationally (Ko and Moffitt (2022)), the take up for Best Start is high. They consider that this is likely related the almost universal nature of Best Start and the application through SmartStart (as part of the birth registration process). Noting results from other studies 10 , they also concluded that Best Start may have increased the take up of other WFF components by families with very young children. The authors suggest that: “...a portion of non-take-up of other WFF payments for families with older children can be addressed by system changes that more proactively invite and streamline initial applications and subsequent re-applications for those with potential eligibility”. Families package monitoring and evaluation 11 (2023) The Families Package, introduced in 2018, focussed on reducing child poverty and ensuring children get the best start in life. MSD led the work to monitor and evaluate the impact of these changes and final reports were published this year. Along with several changes in supports, the Families Package introduced Best Start and extended the period of Paid parental leave from 18 to 26 weeks. The monitoring and evaluation found that mothers in the first cohort to qualify for Best Start and extended paid parental leave gained an additional $55 p/w in the first six months after their baby was born. This is equivalent to an extra 10% increase in their income, on top of income gains from other parts of the Families Package. The report also found that uptake of Best Start was around 96.9%, for children in eligible families. Issues, options, and analysis Interaction between Best Start and Paid parental leave As per MC6 of the Income Tax Act 2007, a person does not qualify for a Best Start tax credit for a dependent child for any period where they receive a parental leave payment or preterm baby payment for the child. The maximum value of Paid parental leave ($712.17 a week before tax for the 23/24 financial year) is significantly higher than Best Start ($69 per week for the 2024 tax year), and so families typically start receiving Best Start payments once the Paid parental leave entitlement period has ended (generally 26 weeks from expected due date). Issues Creation of unavoidable overpayments Although most people apply for PPL prior to the birth of their child, applications can be made retrospectively (up to 1 year after the birth of a child or the date primary care of a child commenced). These settings promote accessibility and uptake of PPL. 9 MELAA represents Middle Eastern, Latin American and African ethnic groups. 10 McLeod, K., & Wilson, M. (2022).

MSD. 11 Families Package Monitoring and Evaluation - Ministry of Social Development (msd.govt.nz) 6 When a retrospective PPL registration is received for a family who has been receiving Best Start, BSTC stops, and PPL commences. There are no provisions that enable PPL entitlement (under the Parental Leave and Employment Protection Act 1987) to be used to satisfy Best Start overpayments. As such, any BSTC amounts paid to date become Working for Families debt. This situation occurs within the first year of a child’s life, when families are likely to have reduced financial resilience coupled with greater challenges and responsibilities. The risk of this situation occurring is exacerbated by the channels used. The majority of Best Start applications are made via the SmartStart platform when families register their child’s birth. Families register for PPL directly via IR channels (either myIR or over the phone). To address this risk, work has been undertaken to improve messaging on the SmartStart platform. Currently, around 800-1000 families are overpaid BSTC while receiving PPL each year, with an average overpayment of $380-$400. Best Start is universal and can be received concurrently with all other supports, apart from PPL The first year of Best Start is universal and reflects the intent that every New Zealander with a newborn should receive financial assistance, regardless of their level of family income. The objectives of Paid parental leave are different. The intent is to help parents reconcile their employment and family responsibilities by allowing workers to take leave for childbirth while maintaining their workforce attachment, and to compensate for the financial impacts of that leave. More broadly, the Parental Leave and Employment Protection Act 1987 (PLEPA) provides for job protection during pregnancy and parental leave, and for the employees return to work without disadvantage to position or pay rate. This contributes to gender equity in the labour market via increased female labour force retention. Although Best Start is available to families who are also receiving main benefits, student allowances, other Working for Families tax credit, NZ superannuation and accident compensation, the restriction is in place for Paid parental leave. When Best Start was originally implemented, IR recommended paying both PPL and BSTC at the same time (simpler to administer, easier for customers to understand) however this approach was not taken due to fiscal impacts, and because this broadly aligned with the settings for the Parental tax credit (PTC) where parents could choose to receive either PTC or PPL but could not claim both for the same child. s 9(2)(g)(i) 7 s 9(2)(g)(i) 8 s 9(2)(g)(i) 9 Registering for Best Start via SmartStart Most families register for Best Start at the time they register the birth of their child, via the SmartStart platform. In the 2022 tax year, 22,149 registrations were received via SmartStart (48% of all WFF registrations). This channel is a significant factor in the high levels of uptake for Best Start. SmartStart does not provide a full registration for Working for Families, but a simplified registration sufficient to cover the information needed for the first year of Best Start. Because the first year of Best Start is not income-tested, estimates of income are not required for either the principal caregiver or their partner. This approach reduces complexity and information requirements for families who are registering the birth of the child. However, there are consequences: •Some families are not aware that, in applying for Best Start, they have registered for Working for Families. This has implications for transitional residents and for higher income families who will only be eligible for the first year of BSTC. •For families who are eligible for tax credits other than Best Start, further information is needed (primarily income estimates) to complete onboarding. This may lead to delays in payments (or families receive additional tax credits at end-of-year square-up), or duplicate registrations (families registering via DIA and direct via IR channels at the same time) 12 . Issues Unnecessary delays to income tax refunds As per LA2 of the Income Tax Act 2007, a person must use their total tax credits for a tax year to satisfy their income tax liability for that tax year. WFF tax credits are applied at the time income tax is assessed, with any shortfall treated as tax to pay and any credit refunded. The value of WFF tax credits depends on income for both a principal caregiver and their partner, so the correct WFF entitlement cannot be calculated until income tax is assessed for both parties. 12 Around 5.6K duplicate registrations are received for WFF each year and require manual action – a proportion of these will be the result of duplicates from DIA registrations. s 9(2)(g)(i) 10 As such, finalising a principal caregiver’s income tax assessment is held until a partner’s assessment is finalised, and vice versa. For families who have received the first year of Best Start only, this delay is unnecessary because a partner’s return of income will not alter the value of the WFF entitlement. The delay causes frustration where income tax refunds are pending. There is also a question of whether the first year of Best Start should be used to offset income tax liability at square-up, given that it is intended to be a universal weekly payment and cannot be used to offset other WFF overpayments (via accumulative adjustments). However, this is likely a consequence of tight implementation timeframes and the decision to adopt as many of the existing WFF rules as possible. Onboarding families for other WFF tax credits Families registering via SmartStart have not provided information sufficient for IR to determine entitlement to WFF tax credits other than Best Start. To be onboarded for instalment payments for other tax credits, families need to provide additional information, primarily estimates of income. If this does not occur, the Family tax credit is calculated and paid to the customer at end of year square-up. This can result in duplicate registrations, delays in payments or missing entitlements 13 , and a timely IR onboarding process for all WFF tax credits becomes more important under a single payer administration model, as low-income beneficiary families register their newborns via SmartStart. 13 Analysis indicates approximately 11-14K families are eligible for IWTC but do not receive it each tax year. s 9(2)(g)(i) s 9(2)(g)(i) 11 s 9(2)(g)(i) 12 s 9(2)(g)(i) 13 s 9(2)(g)(i) 14 s 9(2)(g)(i) www.ird.govt.nz s 9(2)(g)(i) 18 s 9(2)(g)(i) www.ird.govt.nz Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Kaupapa me te Tiaki i ngā Ture Background note Date: July 2024 Author: Hilary Rodgers Subject: Policy design parameters for the In Work Tax Credit Version: v1.0 Final Purpose Inland Revenue is currently conducting a stewardship project on Working for Families tax credits and income support delivered through the tax system, (Project Keymaster). This note covers the In Work Tax Credit (IWTC), including current settings, identification of issues and options to address, and recommendations. Introduction The In-work tax credit (IWTC) was introduced in 2006 to replace the Child tax credit and is available to families who are in work and not receiving a main benefit or a student allowance. The IWTC was intended to ‘make work pay’ by supporting families with dependent children to take up and remain in employment and increase the income they receive from work. International evidence demonstrates that poverty, particularly child poverty, can be reduced if parents work 1 . Family incomes and wellbeing can increase over time as parents upskill and contribute to wider economic growth. IWTC has the same abatement settings as the Family tax credit FTC (a rate of 27% for incomes over $42,700) however it abates after FTC. Larger families (with more than three dependent children) receive a higher rate of payment. If a child is in shared care, both parents/carers can each receive the full value of IWTC, provided they meet the eligibility criteria. Definition of ‘earner’ To be eligible for the IWTC, either the principal caregiver or their spouse/partner must be an ‘earner’ and derive an income in the week they are an earner (i.e. be in paid work in a week). Usually, the ‘earner’ has to be receiving a payment that fits the definition of a PAYE income payment (e.g., salary and wages, shareholder salary). There are alternative forms of income listed under s MD 9 of the Act. Two-week grace period To avoid families losing their IWTC entitlements over small unpaid gaps in employment, a two- week grace period was introduced from April 2021. Families will be deemed to have derived income for two weeks after they stop earning. The effect of this change allows families to remain entitled to the IWTC for two weeks as they transition out of work, between jobs, or go unpaid for a short period. However, this grace period ceases if families go onto a main benefit or student allowance. 1 TC-3 2021-06-02 IWTC stocktake V1.0 Item 21 2 Hours-test The IWTC originally incorporated an ‘hours test’. This required a family to be normally working a minimum of 20 hours per week in the case of a sole parent or, for a couple, a minimum of 30 hours per week between them. This requirement was repealed from July 2020 but remains in place for the Minimum family tax credit (MFTC). It is worth noting that IR does not currently hold the data to administer an hours-test well. For those earning employment income, we receive hours paid data from employers, but provision of this information is not mandatory and can differ from actual hours worked. As such, our processes simply infer when someone is likely to not meet an hours-test by using the minimum wage as a proxy. This skews monitoring activity towards those with the lowest incomes. For those earning business income, we are reliant on customer declaration, and there is no independent mechanism to verify. An hours-test also increases the compliance burden on customers, especially for families that work variable or uncertain hours. Those who may or may not meet an hours-test on a week-to- week basis need to transition between agencies (IR and MSD) to access different supports. The consequence is those who are compliant have worse outcomes than those who do not keep their details up to date. Data For the 2022 tax year, 170K families (48% of WFF customers) received $503M in In Work Tax Credit payments. Most families received payments by instalment during the year, while 19% 2 chose lump sum payments from IR. The average value of IWTC entitlement was $2,946. Instalment payments Lump sum Paying agency IR MSD IR No. of families 137,142 (80%) 760 3 (<1%) 28,845 (19%) Amount paid in year $373.90M - - Amount paid at square up 4 $39.45M $0.87M $88.57M Total value of entitlement $413.35M $0.87M $88.57M In Work Tax Credit recipients and value of entitlement by paying agency, 2022 tax year The average annual family scheme income for IWTC recipients in 2022 was $63,332. This varied for sole parent families ($52,036), couples with a single earner ($61,941) and couples with two earners ($77,177). 2 Higher than FTC (11%), likely due to the order of abatement. 3 A small number of families were paid by MSD during the year but had an IWTC entitlement at square up. These are primarily families moving off benefit in mid-late March. 4 This is the net amount and will comprise both under and overpayments. 3 In Work Tax Credit recipients by family income and household type, 2022 tax year Of the 137K IWTC recipients who received in year payments, 8% received their correct WFF entitlement, across all tax credits, 58% were underpaid by more than $50, and 32% overpaid by more than $50. 2% of customers have not yet been squared up. In-work Tax Credit recipients by square up outcome and family income, 2022 tax year Literature summary Welfare Expert Advisory Group report 5 (2019) The WEAG was established in 2018 to provide advice on the future of New Zealand’s social security system. Their report, released in February 2019, laid out 42 key recommendations on how the welfare system could be changed to better meet the needs of New Zealanders. The report laid out 10 principles to redesign the income support system (Recommendation 19), including that: •Income support ensures people are always better off in paid work and high effective marginal tax rates are avoided as much as possible. And included the following recommendation in relation to the In Work Tax Credit: 5 Welfare Expert Advisory Group Report | Welfare Expert Advisory Group - Kia Piki Ake (weag.govt.nz) 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 16000 Sole parentCouple, single earnerCouple, both earners 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 >1K cr<1K cr+/- $50<$1K dr>$1K dr 4 • Replace the In-Work Tax Credit, Minimum Family Tax Credit and Independent Earner Tax Credit with a new Earned Income Tax Credit, available to people with and without children (Recommendation 23). In-work tax credit stocktake 6 (2021) As part of the Working for Families review, an internal briefing note was drafted on the In-work tax credit. The note provides a comprehensive background of the history, payment rates, eligibility, and other settings for this tax credit. The following issues are noted: • Difficulties for families who are moving on and off benefits. • Poor targeting, due to IWTC being skewed towards relatively higher income families. 7 Issues, options and analysis Current IWTC settings do not always incentivise work effectively A general principle of New Zealand’s income support system is that paid employment is often the best route out of poverty and for improving wellbeing outcomes at the individual level 8 . Poor financial work incentives are the result of families seeing little or no increase in their incomes as they work more. If people are unable to improve their financial situation through employment, it can create a sense of disengagement with the labour market. Issues Second earners are not directly incentivised to work The In-work tax credit is a per family payment available provided that either the principal caregiver or their partner is an earner. In practice, this means that there is no financial incentive payment available for a second earner to start work or increase their hours of work. Second earners are typically the principal caregivers of dependent children, and longer periods of time out of the workforce (due to birth of a child) correlate to a greater earnings disadvantage on re-entering the labour market regardless of prior employment, education and earnings. However, the greatest economic impact is to those on low incomes who are much less likely to return to work at all 9 . Depending on family circumstances and wage/salary rates, second earners can experience very high effective marginal tax rates. For example, a second earner on the minimum wage can face EMTRs at over 90%, where FTC, BSTC and Accommodation supplement abatement overlaps. If the second earner also has a student loan, EMTRs exceed 100%. An indicative example is included in the Appendices. For families who receive the IWTC, 37,263 (roughly 22%) are couples with a single earner, and 62,594 (37%) are couples with two earners. Interaction with main benefits The In-work tax credit is only available to families who are not receiving a main benefit. The current abatement rate of main benefits is at 70% for income earned over $160 p/week (for couples) or $250 p/week (for sole parents) 10 . 6 TC-3 2021-06-02 IWTC stocktake V1.0.docx 7 This is more a feature of abatement design (FTC abating prior to IWTC) rather than targeting. 8 In New Zealand, the proportion of non-working households in poverty is 66% compared to 7% of families where at least one parent has a job (IDI, 2019). 9 Parenthood and the labour market - MfW 2018 10 Sole parent support abates at 30% for income between $160-$250 per week, and then at 70% from $250 per week. 5 This creates high EMTRs, reducing the financial return from working more. For example, a sole parent working 10-20 hours per week on the minimum wage has an effective marginal tax rate of around 89%. Once a sole parent is working at least 20 hours per week, they will qualify to receive the MFTC which abates at a rate of 100%. This results in a long run of high EMTRs, making it very difficult for low-earning sole parents to effectively transition into full time work (a “poverty trap”). An indicative example is included in the Appendices. The binary nature of the on/off benefit test also creates problems in terms of continuity of support, and this is exacerbated by the current joint administration model. For low-income families who are moving off main benefit and into work, a lack of certainty or any delay in weekly support can have a significant impact. Often benefit status changes are back-dated, changed, or future-dated as MSD manage the uncertainty of new employment and timings of pays for clients fending off hardship through this period. In the 2022 tax year, 28,032 families who received IWTC also received a main benefit at some point during the tax year (roughly 20%). Entitled to IWTC but not receiving Analysis indicates that approximately 11-14K families are eligible for IWTC but do not receive it each tax year. For families who receive weekly or fortnightly payments during the year, early interventions run regularly to identify those who are newly eligible or no longer eligible for IWTC and correct their payments. However, these processes do not currently run for periods where a family is receiving Best Start only and all children are aged under 1 year. For families who receive payments as a lump sum, IWTC is not automatically included in the end-of-year square-up calculation. With the retirement of the minimum hours test in 2020, in many cases IR holds sufficient information to correctly determine entitlement without customers needing to provide further details. s 9(2)(g)(i) 6 s 9(2)(g)(i) 7 s 9(2)(g)(i) 8 s 9(2)(g)(i) 9 Appendices Effective marginal tax rates for second earners The following example illustrates effective marginal tax rates for second earners starting work/working more hours. This scenario assumes a couple with two children (aged 1 and 3 years), second earner on the minimum wage and partner working full time (40 hrs per week) on the median wage. The couple live in the Wellington region, with weekly rental costs of $550.00. All rates are effective for the 2024 tax year 12 . EMTRs for a second earner are up to 92% as FTC/IWTC, BSTC and the Accommodation supplement abate at the same time. Couple weekly income composition by second earner hours worked, minimum wage, 2024 tax year If the second earner also has a student loan, EMTRs will exceed 100%, from around 20 hours worked 13 . 12 FTC annual first child rate $7,121, FTC annual second child rate $5,802, IWTC annual rate $3,770, BSTC annual rate $3,632, Accommodation supplement Area 2 (rent) $220 per week, NZ minimum hourly wage $22.70, NZ median hourly wage $31.61. 13 The Student loan repayment rate is 12% and current threshold is $22,828, or around 20 hours on the minimum wage. 10 Effective marginal tax rates for sole parents moving off benefit The following example illustrates effective marginal tax rates for sole parent beneficiaries starting work/working more hours. This scenario assumes a sole parent with one child (aged 3 years) earning the minimum wage. All rates are effective for the 2024 tax year 14 . EMTRs for a sole parent are up to 89% as the main benefit abates, and then over 100% for the duration of MFTC. Sole parent weekly income composition by hours worked, minimum wage, 2024 tax year 14 FTC annual first child rate $7,121, IWTC annual rate $3,770, MFTC annual threshold $34,216 (net), Sole parent support weekly rate $472.79 (net), NZ minimum hourly wage $22.70.

Your full request is detailed in Appendix A, enclosed. On 3 September 2024, you clarified your request for ‘Tax paid by Industry and Significant Enterprises’ and asked for this information to be broken down by industry codes and for the data in scope of this part of your request on large companies who have non-resident ownership to be presented only in aggregate form. As data on large companies who have non-resident ownership is not held by Inland Revenue in aggregate form, and as per your instructions, this part of your request (item 2c of ‘Tax paid by Industry and Significant Enterprises’) is considered to have been withdrawn. You also clarified the timeframe for the ‘Extent of the use of new discretion for tax pooling’ part of your request to be for the periods from enactment to 30 June 2023 and 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024. As ‘the value of the tax they have applied for’ in items 1 and 2 of this part of your request cannot be provided without substantial collation, you agreed for this information to be provided in the same manner as it was provided in your previous request \[24OIA1133 refers\]. You also asked Inland Revenue to include a list of tax types where applications have been approved/declined. Information being released Information provided for the 2023/24 tax year are lower as not all returns have for this period have been filed/completed. Provisional and terminal tax paid by provisional tax method I have interpreted this part of your request to be for the number of taxpayers who used a provisional tax method for 2023 and 2024 (these customers would have had RIT >$5,000 for the 2022 and 2023 tax year respectively) and have RIT for 2023 and 2024 (once the return is filed) greater than $5,000.

Yours sincerely Teressa Dillon Domain Lead, Performance and Reporting 25OIA1184 Page 5 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Appendix A: Your OIA request With the 2022/23 income tax year now closed for tax pooling, we’re keen to obtain the latest information about provisional taxpayers to keep our presentations and material up to date. 1 Provisional and terminal tax paid by provisional tax method We are interested in trends in the number of provisional taxpayers, the provisional tax method they are using, and the value of tax they pay (both provisional and terminal). For the 2022/23 tax year please provide 1. The number of taxpayers who used: • The accounting income method • The standard option • The estimation option • The ratio option. 2. The total value of residual income tax (RIT) for taxpayers using each method listed above. For the 2023/24 tax year: 1. The number of taxpayers using each method: • The accounting income method • The standard option • The estimation option • The ratio option. 2. The value of the provisional tax obligations of taxpayers using each method listed above. Payment behaviour by safe harbour taxpayers vs non-safe harbour taxpayers We are interested in the impact of changes in interest rules on the payment behaviour of safe harbour taxpayers (provisional taxpayers with RIT<$60k), compared to non-safe harbour taxpayers. To help us understand this, we are requesting data for three income tax periods. For each of the 2020/21, 2021/22 and 2022/23 tax years, please provide the data points representing by \[x\] in the table below: Safe harbour taxpayers Non-safe harbour taxpayers # Taxpayers $ # Taxpayers $ Value of Residual income tax \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] Late payment penalties \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] Dr UOMI interest \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] Cr UOMI interest \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] # Payments $ # Payments $ 1 Please note when we refer to value in this request, we’re interested in the total amount of tax payable (provisional tax + terminal tax) – excluding any taxpayers who were in a loss or were not above the provisional tax threshold. We think this is usually best represented by total Residual Income Tax (RIT). 25OIA1184 Page 6 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Safe harbour taxpayers Non-safe harbour taxpayers On time payments \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] Payment not on time \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] Tax paid by Industry and Significant Enterprises We are interested what industries provisional taxpayers operate in and their relative tax contributions. Given there have been substantial economic and global events over the last 6 years, we’re interested in data over 6 income tax periods. 1. For the 2017/18, 2018/19, 2019/20, 2020/21, 2021/22, 2022/23 periods, can you please provide the following information by Industry, using the ANZSIC divisions: • Number of taxpayers • Total RIT paid • Late payment penalties • Dr use of money interest • Cr use of money interest 2. The same data above, for the same periods split by each category of “Significant Enterprises” and other taxpayers: a. Companies or groups of companies with annual turnover of more than $100 million b. Companies whose industry is governed by specialised taxation legislation c. Large companies who have non-resident ownership. Extent of the use of new discretion for tax pooling Last year we requested information on the Commissioner’s then new tax pooling discretion under the Income Tax Act 2007, s.RP17B (12)-(13). Another year on, we’re interested in the number and nature of applications for discretion, and whether there are any significant trends in the types of tax being applied for, and any common grounds for discretion not being granted. Please provide the following data split over the two periods from enactment to 30 June 2023 and from 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2024: 1. Can you please advise in aggregate and by tax type: • The number of taxpayers who have applied • The value of the tax they have applied for • In the number of taxpayers who have been approved • In the number of taxpayers who have been declined. 1. Where applications have been declined, please advise the main reasons for applications being denied, for example: • The voluntary disclosure was not made “within reasonable time” • Commissioner is not satisfied the taxpayer met the criteria under subsection 13 (e.g. failure to take reasonable steps to comply). If data that could be provided directly in an excel readable or otherwise structured format would be appreciated.
25OIA1195 Page 1 of 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 16 September 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 19 August 2024. You requested the following: On 1 July 2023: How many staff did the Ministry employ that were in a salary band of $150k+ What were the specific salary bands and job titles for these positions. On 1 July 2024: How many staff did the Ministry employ that were in a salary band of $150k+ What were the specific salary bands and job titles for these positions. Information being released The information you have requested is attached as Appendix A. T able 1 in Appendix A displays the number of staff employed within any roles where the pay band can reach or exceed $150,000, broken down into roles associated with each pay band. Tables 2 and 3 display the range for each pay band. Information relating to the remuneration of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is published on the Public Service Commission’s website, accordingly this part of your request is refused under section 18(d) of the OIA, as the information is publicly available. This information can be found here: Chief executive remuneration - Te Kawa Mataaho Public Service Commission. We have withheld some information under section 9(2)(a) of the OIA in order to protect the privacy of natural persons. That information is the total number of non-managerial staff: 1. That are in roles with less than 10 persons in the role; and 2. The role is not by its nature limited to one employee; and 3. The number is not otherwise public knowledge. Where applicable the actual number will be replaced and displayed as “<10”. As required by section 9(1) of the OIA, I have considered whether the grounds for withholding the information requested is outweighed by the public interest. In this instance, I do not consider that to be the case. 25OIA1195 Page 2 of 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Right of review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision.
