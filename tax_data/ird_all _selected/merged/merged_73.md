BEPS - Recommendations on addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements

Executive summary

This report seeks your:

*   agreement to detailed proposals for reforming the taxation of hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements, which implement in a New Zealand context Action 2 of the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) programme (“hybrid proposals”); and
*   approval to prepare a paper requesting Cabinet’s agreement to include the hybrid proposals in a BEPS tax bill.

**_Development of recommendations to date_**

On 6 September 2016, the Government released a discussion document seeking feedback on proposals to address hybrid mismatch arrangements (T2016/1319 IR2016/342 refers). Broadly speaking, these are cross-border arrangements where the application of different countries’ tax rules results in either temporary or permanent non-taxation of income. Action 2 of the OECD BEPS Action Plan consists of recommendations for countries to address these arrangements. The discussion document proposals are closely modelled on the OECD recommendations as set out in its Final Report “Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements”.

On 9 March we reported to you on submissions in response to this document, and sought your approval to undertake further consultation (T2017/406 IR2017/133 refers). We also sought your approval for that further consultation to include consultation on branch mismatches, which are closely related to hybrid mismatches and in relation to which the OECD has developed a report (the “Branch Report”) with recommendations closely based on the hybrid mismatch recommendations. The draft branch report was published in August 2016 and the final branch report is expected to be available shortly.

We have now completed the further consultation. We have engaged in approximately a dozen workshops (with Corporate Taxpayers Group and Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand) and attended various other meetings with private sector submitters (including the New Zealand Bankers’ Association). The consultation process was useful and we have made a number of changes to the proposals in the discussion document to take into account the concerns of submitters.

In particular, we have given careful consideration to the position of New Zealand businesses with foreign branches, to ensure that the proposed hybrid rules do not deny these businesses the ability to use any foreign branch losses in New Zealand except where there is a high likelihood of double non-taxation.

We have also consulted on the hybrid rules with counterparts in Australia and the United Kingdom, as well as the OECD secretariat, to ensure that the rules we propose work as intended, and do not give rise to inadvertent double taxation or non-taxation. Our proposals are very similar to Australia’s hybrid proposals. We note in this report any significant points on which we are aware of a difference.

**_Budget 2017 decision on foreign hybrid entity double deductions_**

As part of Budget 2017, the Government decided to proceed with tax law changes to implement one aspect of the hybrid rules. This change is to restrict the ability of New Zealand businesses to use double deductions of foreign hybrid entities to reduce their tax liabilities in New Zealand (CAB-17-MIN-0164 refers). This restriction is intended to apply to the most prevalent hybrid structure involving outbound investment by New Zealand based groups, which is the use of financing through Australian limited partnerships to achieve double deductions. It is intended to come into force as part of the general hybrid rules dealt with in this report. Nothing in this report is inconsistent with that decision.

**_Format of this report_**

This report first provides a summary of the hybrids issue, the OECD solution, and officials’ recommendation that New Zealand should implement that solution. The most significant issues arising from the recommendations of this report are separately commented on starting at paragraph 23.

The main body of the report goes through the OECD recommendations in numerical order. It discusses the general principles of each recommendation (or recommendations where they can logically be grouped) and then runs through a series of more detailed decisions that are consequential to the relevant principle. We consider these details will be important in creating a package that effectively counteracts the tax advantages of hybrid arrangements. There are some technical issues that we consider would still benefit from more consideration by officials before final decision are made. We have highlighted these areas both in the recommendations and in the body of the report.

We have included two appendices which are respectively a tabulated overview of the OECD recommendations and a glossary of some of the technical terms of this report.

Policy proposals

**_The issue: hybrid mismatches_**

The objective of the OECD hybrid rules is to prevent double non-taxation which arises because countries tax entities or arrangements in different ways. Broadly speaking, this double non-taxation can arise because:

*   A payment is deducible to the payer in one country but not taxable to the payee in another country, if the reason for the mismatch is a conflict in tax rules. For example:
    *   The tax rules applying to a corporate payee may treat the payment as a dividend on a share (which in many countries is exempt if the payer is a foreign company related to the payee), even though the tax rules applying to the payer in its home country treat it as interest on a loan. This is a hybrid financial instrument mismatch, and is dealt with in OECD recommendations 1 and 2;
    *   The tax rules applying to the payee may treat the payer and the payee as a single taxable entity. An example of this is where a New Zealand unlimited liability company makes a deductible payment to its 100% US parent company. Under US tax rules, the New Zealand company can be treated as a branch of the US company, and therefore payments by the New Zealand company are disregarded for US tax purposes and so are not taxable. In this case the New Zealand company is a hybrid entity and the mismatch is dealt with by OECD recommendation 3; or
*   A single payment is deducted against different income in two countries. An example is where a company with a tax loss is treated as tax resident both by New Zealand and another country. Suppose that the company has a profitable sister company resident in New Zealand, and another profitable sister company in the other country. If the loss can be grouped against the income of the sister company in both New Zealand and the other country, then the loss has been used twice, which means the group has been taxed on less than its full amount of net income. This is a dual resident company mismatch, and it would be dealt with by OECD recommendation 7.

Double non-taxation of this kind is difficult to deal with, because it arises even though both countries’ tax rules are being complied with. However, it clearly reduces fairness, causes harmful distortions in investment patterns, and results in an unintended reduction in aggregate tax revenues.

**_The OECD Action 2 response_**

It is not feasible for all countries to have identical tax rules. Accordingly the only way to avoid double non-taxation of the kind referred to above is for countries to take a “tax without borders” approach by adopting, for cross border arrangements, tax rules which take into account in some way the tax rules of the other country involved. The OECD recommends two kinds of rules. The first kind are rules to reduce the likelihood of such mismatches arising. The second are “linking rules”, which apply only to arrangements between related parties (25% or more commonly owned) or structured arrangements (generally, arrangements between non-associated parties which intentionally exploit such mismatches). These linking rules apply to situations when there is a mismatch which has not been prevented by any other domestic rules, and provide for a primary and defensive response to the mismatch. This is explained further below.

The OECD hybrid recommendations are as follows:

*   recommendation 1 deals with D/NI (deduction/no inclusion) payments under hybrid financial instruments which are either structured or between related parties;
*   recommendation 2 deals with deductible dividends, which can also produce a D/NI outcome;
*   recommendation 3 deals with D/NI payments by a branch or a hybrid payer entity to a person in the same control group (50% or commonly owned). A hybrid entity is treated as a separate person under its own tax rules, but disregarded/transparent under the rules of the payee country;
*   recommendation 4 deals with deductible payments to a reverse hybrid in an arrangement which is either structured or between members of a control group (a reverse hybrid is an entity which is transparent for tax purposes in its own country but treated by an owner as a separate entity);
*   recommendation 5 proposes modifications to the existing domestic law rules to prevent reverse hybrid mismatches being available;
*   recommendation 6 deals with payments by branches or hybrid entities which are deductible in two countries;
*   recommendation 7 deals with payments by dual resident companies which can be deductible in two countries;
*   recommendation 8 deals with imported mismatch payments, which are ordinary payments that can be regarded as funding hybrid mismatch payments in the same group that do not directly impact on New Zealand;
*   Recommendations 9-12 support the earlier recommendations, and relate to design and definitions.

An overview of the recommendations (with description and proposed counteraction) is in Appendix 1.

**_Submissions on the hybrids discussion document and our response_**

In our previous report, we noted that while most submitters accepted the need for some hybrid rules, they also advocated a targeted or phased approach to New Zealand’s implementation of the OECD hybrids package, focussing on countering arrangements of the most concern to New Zealand.

On balance, we are not convinced by these submissions, and recommend implementing the full suite of OECD rules, subject to modifications summarised below. We note that some of the rules only require minor legislative amendment, as they are already part of our law.

The reasons for making this recommendation are set out fully in our report on submissions. In summary, we believe that enacting the OECD rules will:

*   improve fairness;
*   reduce harmful distortions in investment patterns; and
*   have a negligible effect on the cost of capital in New Zealand, particularly given the adoption of the rules by the UK, Australia and the EU;
*   (as compared to a partial adoption)
    *   avoid the need for further piecemeal amendments
    *   avoid giving the appearance of blessing those mismatches not dealt with;
*   involve acceptable compliance costs, particularly given
    *   the expectation that the effect of the rules in most cases will be to drive taxpayers to simpler non-hybrid arrangements (an important exception is branch structures, which are discussed in detail in this report);
    *   the adoption of similar rules by other countries.

It is also important to appreciate that tax avoidance and tax planning using a range of hybrid structures is well known in New Zealand.

*   The bank conduit cases (_Westpac Banking Corporation v CIR_ (2009) 24 NZTC 23,834 and _BNZ Investments Ltd v CIR_ (2009) 24 NZTC 23,582), the optional convertible note structures (see _Alesco New Zealand Ltd v CIR_ (2013) 26 NZTC) and certain mandatory convertible note disputes are all examples of hybrid financial instruments, the subject of OECD recommendations 1 and 2. While they were all held to be ineffective under the general anti-avoidance provision, the process to get to that point was often protracted and economically inefficient. Hybrid rules would have made these transactions clearly tax-ineffective, and they would not have occurred if we had such rules;
*   Arrangements are currently in place which exploit hybrid mismatches but are not generally subject to the general anti-avoidance provision. Examples are:
    *   The deductible/frankable instruments issued by Australian owned banks out of New Zealand – again these are hybrid financial instruments subject to OECD recommendations 1 and 2;
    *   Financing through Australian limited partnerships, which generate double deductions – this is an example of a hybrid payer mismatch subject to OECD recommendation 6;
    *   Investment into New Zealand using New Zealand incorporated companies with unlimited liability. Unlimited liability companies can be treated as transparent for US tax purposes, leading to deduction/no inclusion mismatches dealt with under OECD recommendation 3;
*   Going further back, New Zealand has also experienced tax planning using dual resident company double deduction arrangements, subject to OECD recommendation 7. As a result we now have provisions which deal with most, but not all, of the hybrid mismatches which can arise from dual resident companies.

Mismatches that we are not aware of being used more than rarely are structures that use:

*   payments to reverse hybrids subject to OECD recommendation 4, although under current settings there is no particular reason for Inland Revenue to look for them;
*   reverse hybrid entity mismatches to achieve double non-taxation of outbound investment (which would be subject to OECD recommendation 5.1);
*   imported mismatches (subject to OECD recommendation 8), where funding is channelled into New Zealand using a structure where there is a hybrid mismatch occurs higher up the funding chain, in a transaction not directly involving a New Zealand taxpayer. We are aware of one such structure and there may be more since, under current settings, there is no particular reason for Inland Revenue to look for them;
*   branch mismatches other than those subject to recommendation 6.

Despite the fact that not all the types of mismatches dealt with in the OECD Report are currently seen in New Zealand, we consider that given the history touched on in paragraph 19, it is likely that some of the hybrid mismatches that are not addressed in New Zealand’s response will be exploited at some point in the future. Addressing everything comprehensively now means the process of amending the legislation will be a very large and complex project that will have to be undertaken alongside the other BEPS projects in a relatively short timeframe. However, as stated above, on balance officials recommend implementing a comprehensive set of hybrid rules.

As will be evident from this report, the hybrid rules are complex, and require amendment to many aspects of our tax law. It is important to emphasise that for the vast majority of businesses they should have no impact whatsoever. The hybrid rules will have no impact on purely domestic firms owned by New Zealand residents. Even of those firms that are international, most do not enter into hybrid arrangements directly with New Zealand. Those who do have mostly done so because of the existing tax benefits. Once those benefits are removed, they will likely revert to much simpler and less costly structures. Where application of the rules is unavoidable, for example in relation to New Zealand businesses with foreign branches, we have paid particular attention to simplicity and compliance costs.

Significant issues

In this section we have highlighted the recommendations which are likely to attract most comment from submitters, and are therefore significant for more than merely technical reasons.

**_Application of hybrid rules to foreign branches_**

Particularly in the course of our recent workshop consultations, submitters were very concerned about the fact that the hybrid rules can deny a New Zealand company the ability to reduce the tax on its New Zealand income by offsetting against that income the loss from a foreign branch.

We have made various modifications to the OECD proposals to address this issue, including ensuring there is clearly no loss denial for taxpayers who have not entered into more complex structures. However, these modifications may not be to the satisfaction of all in the business or advisory community. In particular, some submitters wanted a de minimis rule of some sort, but we consider our suggested modification to make it clear that simple structures are not impacted by the hybrid rules makes this unnecessary.

**_Application of hybrid rules to foreign trusts_**

We recommend that the hybrid rules should apply to income of a New Zealand trustee of a foreign trust. This may make it less attractive for New Zealand residents to act as trustees of trusts with non-resident settlors and non-resident assets.

As a result of the recommendations of the 2016 Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules (Shewan Report), foreign trusts with New Zealand trustees have recently been required to comply with new and more thorough registration and disclosure requirements. This is likely to lead to a significant diminution in the number of such trusts, but we expect there will still be a sizeable number in existence – the number will not be known until 30 June, which is the due date for the new registrations.

It is likely that the foreign trust service providers will object to foreign trusts being subject to the hybrid rules. This could be on:

*   a technical basis; and/or
*   the basis that they have now spent the time and effort to become fully compliant with internationally best-practice disclosure requirements. They may argue it would be unfair for the Government to then make a substantive tax change which for many would make their efforts redundant.

We have outlined two options to address the potential hybrid mismatches arising from foreign trusts in paragraphs 123 to 128 below.

**_Imported mismatches_**

The OECD recommends that countries include imported mismatch rules. These deny a deduction for a payment which is not directly a mismatch between the New Zealand payer and the payee, but which funds the payee (or a higher level “payee”) to make a payment in a hybrid mismatch to a person not directly transacting with the New Zealand taxpayer. Many submitters viewed this as over-reach, highly complex and impractical.

We have responded to these submissions by recommending that the imported mismatch rule be enacted in full, but that its implementation be partially deferred.

*   When the payment from New Zealand is part of a structured arrangement which includes a hybrid mismatch, applying the imported mismatch rule is both more straightforward and more important to the integrity of the rules. We recommend that this structured aspect of the rule be implemented along with the rest of the hybrid rules.
*   When the payment from New Zealand is not part of a structured arrangement, applying the rule is more difficult and less important to the integrity of the New Zealand rules. Delaying the implementation of this rule until there are more countries that have hybrid rules would be sensible. We suggest a delay until 1 January 2020, by which date the EU countries, the UK, and Australia should all have hybrid rules.

**_Over-taxation by reason of the imposition of NRWT_**

There is no doubt that if a deduction is permanently denied under the hybrid rules for a payment where New Zealand also imposes non-resident withholding tax, there is an element of over-taxation.

The OECD does not recommend any adjustment be made to prevent this over-taxation. The UK has followed this approach, though it does not apply withholding tax as widely as New Zealand. Australia has not shown any interest in departing from the OECD approach. Accordingly, there are strong precedents for not addressing this issue.

This approach can be justified on the basis that in the majority of cases there should be simpler alternatives to hybrid arrangements giving rise to NRWT. Furthermore, in the case of hybrid financial instruments, if the payee country adopts recommendation 2, there will be no denial under recommendation 1, and therefore no over-taxation. This is expected to resolve the issue in most cases where a New Zealand taxpayer makes a payment under a hybrid financial arrangement to an Australian payee.

Nevertheless, we recommend that in the case of a hybrid financial instrument denial, we consider whether taxpayers could be permitted to treat the payment as a dividend. This would allow them to eliminate NRWT by attaching imputation credits to the payment. We need to give further consideration to the flow on effects of this recommendation.

This recommendation is likely to go some way to addressing submitters’ concerns on hybrid financial instruments, if upon further consideration the measure proceeds. However, they may still be concerned about the treatment of other non-deductible amounts.

**_Grandparenting for certain instruments issued by banks to the public_**

Generally the hybrid rules will apply to income and deductions arising after the effective date (expected to be some time on or after 1 July 2018), without regard to when the arrangement giving rise to that amount was entered into. This is the OECD recommendation, which was followed by the UK, and is proposed in the EU and Australia.

We recommend an exception for certain hybrid instruments (“regulatory capital hybrids”) issued by banks and insurance companies either directly or indirectly to third party investors, mostly in Australia, in partial satisfaction of the capital requirements imposed on those companies by regulators. We recommend that instruments issued before the discussion document was released (6 September 2016) should not be subject to the hybrid rules until after the first date on which the issuer has an unconditional right to call or otherwise cancel the instruments without penalty.

No special treatment was proposed for such instruments in our discussion document. However, we received submissions that such instruments either should not be subject to the hybrid rules at all, or that if they were so subject, there should be some grandparenting relief. Generally the latter submission was based on the publicly issued nature of the instruments. Mostly, the hybrid rules only apply to arrangements between parties who are related or in the same group.

Australia announced that it would apply the hybrid rules to such instruments on its Budget day this year. For that reason, it has decided to grandparent regulatory capital instruments issued before 8 May 2017.

Withheld under section 9(2)(b)(ii) of the Official Information Act 1982  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

**_Opaque election for foreign hybrid entities_**

The private sector has proposed that New Zealand investors in foreign hybrids be entitled to elect to treat the entity as tax opaque (like a company) in New Zealand. This would mean the New Zealand tax treatment would match the company treatment overseas. This opaque election would take the entity outside the scope of the rules and achieve roughly the same tax effect with lower compliance costs.

This opaque election regime, if included in the rules, is most likely to be used by an Australian limited partnership, which is treated as flow-through by New Zealand such that its income and expenditure is attributed to its partners.

Administratively, this would likely require some sort of declaration made to the Commissioner. Our current thinking is this declaration would be irrevocable and would continue to apply in the event of a change of ownership. Officials are still working through the details of this idea and whether to recommend its inclusion in the rules. If it does not form part of the final package, this may be viewed unfavourably by the private sector.

**_Application of rules to branch mismatch arrangements_**

Taxpayers may be concerned to hear that “branch mismatches” are subject to the hybrid rules, since branches are relatively common for a business to have. Accordingly it may be important to be clear about the limits of branch mismatches.

Branch mismatches arising from foreign branch losses are a double non-taxation risk. The remainder of the branch mismatch concerns are very unlikely to arise in a New Zealand context. They will apply mostly to deny a deduction for a payment made by a New Zealand taxpayer to a foreign member of the same control group, if that payment is not taxed to the foreign member due to conflicts in branch tax rules between two countries other than New Zealand.

**_De minimis rule_**

Officials are not recommending a general de minimis for the hybrid rules. The reason for this is that we are comfortable that the proposals will ensure that simple offshore branch structures are not within the scope of the rules. In addition, a de minimis may cause additional complexity given that other countries are not proposing a de minimis in their hybrid mismatch rules.

However, officials have provided for a specific de minimis-type rule for reverse hybrid entities established in New Zealand (likely to be limited partnerships and foreign trusts).

Recommended action

We recommend that you:

1.  **Agree** that a Cabinet paper should be prepared recommending that the general principles of proposals to counteract hybrid mismatches in line with the recommendations in the OECD _Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements_ report are drafted into a bill, subject to the modifications and further detail contained in this paper.

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

*   1.  Expand the current rule which denies a dividend exemption to a deductible dividend paid by a foreign company to a New Zealand company so that it also applies if the foreign payer receives tax benefits similar in nature to a deduction (recommendation 2)

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

**_OECD recommendations 1 and 2: detailed design_**

1.  **Agree** to the following detailed rules to ensure that the general principles contained in recommendation (c) are effective:
    1.  A person who receives a payment which is deductible to the payer in another country should not be entitled to the benefit of any imputation credit attached to the payment.

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

*   1.  When the hybrid rules apply to a hybrid financial instrument issued by a New Zealand taxpayer and denominated in a foreign currency:

1.  the deduction denied should take into account any foreign currency fluctuations on the instrument which would otherwise be taken into account for tax purposes;
2.  any net income from the instrument including any foreign currency fluctuations should be non-taxable.

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

*   1.  When the hybrid rules apply to a hybrid financial instrument held by a New Zealand taxpayer and denominated in a foreign currency, the person should not take into account any foreign currency fluctuations on the instrument, unless the instrument is an interest in a FIF which is subject to the comparative value method.

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

*   1.  To the extent that a payment on a hybrid financial instrument can be proven to give rise to taxation of an investor in the payee country under another country’s controlled foreign company (CFC) regime, the payer should be allowed a deduction for the payment.

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

*   1.  If a New Zealand resident share lender lends shares in a transaction subject to the hybrid rules:

1.  Officials should give further consideration to whether the lender should be taxable on a dividend substitution payment (since such a payment will generally be deductible to the payer);
2.  The lender not be allowed an imputation credit on any replacement payment in respect of New Zealand shares, if the share borrower is entitled to a deduction for that payment.

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

*   1.  If a person holds, pursuant to a share repo arrangement:

1.  a FIF interest, that person should be required to use the comparative value or attributed foreign income method to determine their income from the FIF interest;
2.  New Zealand shares, where the borrower is a non-resident the person is not entitled to the benefit of an imputation credit attached to any replacement payment which is deductible to the borrower.

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

*   1.  OECD recommendation 1 should only apply to deny a deduction, or include amounts in income, as a result of a timing mismatch between resident and non-resident parties if:

1.  the mismatch arises on an instrument with a term of 3 years or more or which has been extended to beyond 3 years; and
2.  the mismatch is in relation to a payment which the lender is not accounting for, for tax purposes, on a reasonable accrual basis; and
3.  it is not reasonable, having regard to the terms of the instrument and the payments made to date, to believe that the expenditure will be included in income in the payee’s accounting period beginning within 24 months of the end of the period in which the expenditure is incurred.

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

*   1.  Officials give further consideration to the idea that, when a person makes a payment under a hybrid financial arrangement for which a deduction is denied under the hybrid rules, the person may choose at the time of making the payment to treat it as a dividend for purposes of both (but not one only) of the non-resident withholding tax and imputation credit rules.

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

*   1.  Amendments be made to the non-resident withholding tax rules so that in determining whether the rules require tax to be withheld on an accrual (rather than payments) basis, amounts for which a deduction is denied or deferred under OECD recommendation 1 are not taken into account unless and until they are deducted.

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

*   1.  Clarify, if necessary, that interest that is permanently denied a deduction under recommendation 1 and the debt under which that interest paid is disregarded for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules.

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

*   1.  There should be no exclusion for regulatory capital issued by banks and insurance companies except for some issues made before the release of the discussion document (6 September 2016).

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

**_OECD recommendation 3: general principles_**

1.  **Agree** that the Cabinet paper in recommendation (a) should recommend that New Zealand implement the following general principles, in accordance with OECD recommendation 3, in relation to payments made to a person in the same control group as the payee or pursuant to a structured transaction, where the payment is deductible to the payer but not recognized under the tax law in the payee country because the payment is disregarded under that law:
    1.  deny a deduction for the payment if made by a New Zealand payer (recommendation 3 primary rule);
    2.  if the payment is made by a non-resident, who is not denied a deduction under similar rules, to a New Zealand resident, include the payment in ordinary income of the New Zealand resident (recommendation 3 defensive rule);
    3.  allow any such deduction or income inclusion to be reversed to the extent that the deduction to the payer is set off against dual inclusion income.

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

**_OECD recommendation 3: detailed design_**

1.  **Agree** to the following detailed rules to ensure that the general principles contained in recommendation (e) are effective:
    1.  in applying the primary rule only, the amount for which a deduction is denied should take into account any foreign currency fluctuations recognized for tax purposes in relation to a financial arrangement denominated in a foreign currency

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

*   1.  dual inclusion income should be calculated in accordance with New Zealand tax principles on the income of the hybrid payer from activities that are taxed in New Zealand, except that it should not include income which is protected from New Zealand tax by a foreign tax credit

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

*   1.  for purposes of the primary rule, full taxation of income under a CFC regime should:

1.  prevent income being treated as not taxable to a payee, and
2.  qualify income as dual inclusion income where it is not otherwise taxed to the payee and is not sheltered from tax by a foreign tax credit.

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

*   1.  when an amount of deemed hybrid income is reversed in a later year because it is offset against dual inclusion income, that should be taken into account in determining the limit on the amount of foreign tax credit for which a New Zealand taxpayer applying the defensive rule is eligible

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

*   1.  the ability to claim a deduction in relation to a later year due to future dual inclusion income should be lost if there is a more than 51% change in a company’s ownership since the time the relevant deduction was incurred (primary rule) or deemed expenditure arose (defensive rule)

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

*   1.  amendments be made to the non-resident withholding tax rules so that in determining whether the rules require tax to be withheld on an accrual (rather than payments) basis, amounts for which a deduction is deferred under OECD recommendation 3 are not taken into account unless and until they are deducted

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

*   1.  denial of a deduction for interest under recommendation 3 will not affect the amount of recognised interest or amount of debt for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules;

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

**_OECD recommendation 4: general principle_**

1.  **Agree** that the Cabinet paper in recommendation (a) should recommend that New Zealand implement the following general principle, in accordance with recommendation 4, in relation to payments made to a reverse hybrid entity in the same control group as the payee or pursuant to a structured transaction, where the payment is deductible to the payer but not included as income under the tax law in the reverse hybrid establishment country or in the country of the entity or person investing in the reverse hybrid:
    1.  deny a deduction for the payment if made by a New Zealand payer (recommendation 4);

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

**_OECD recommendation 5.1_**

1.  **Agree** that Officials give further consideration to whether New Zealand should modify its controlled foreign company (CFC) rules to include as attributable foreign income all income of the reverse hybrid which would have been taxed to the New Zealand investor had it derived the income directly but which is not taxed by the country of the entity because the entity is fiscally transparent (recommendation 5.1).

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

**_OECD recommendation 5.2_**

1.  **Agree** that the Cabinet paper in recommendation (a) should recommend that New Zealand restrict the tax transparency of reverse hybrids established under New Zealand law (recommendation 5.2) by taxing the partnership income of a non-resident partner of a New Zealand limited partnership if:
    1.  the total foreign-sourced income of the limited partnership exceeds the greater of $10,000 or 20% of the total reverse hybrid income; and
    2.  the non-resident partner is in a control group with the partnership; and
    3.  the non-resident partner is not taxed on their share of the income of the partnership because their jurisdiction views the income as earned by the partnership and not the partner.
2.  **Agree** that:

_Inland Revenue recommendation_

The Cabinet paper in recommendation (a) should recommend that New Zealand restrict the tax transparency of reverse hybrids established under New Zealand law (recommendation 5.2) by taxing the foreign source beneficiary income of a non-resident beneficiary of a trust with a New Zealand trustee if:

*   1.  the total foreign-sourced income of the trust exceeds the greater of $10,000 or 20% of the total reverse hybrid income; and
    2.  the non-resident beneficiary is in a control group with the trust; and
    3.  the non-resident beneficiary is not taxed on their share of the foreign source income of the trust in their residence country because that country views the income as earned by the trustee and not the beneficiary.

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

Or

_Treasury recommendation_

New Zealand should tax the New Zealand and foreign sourced income of a trustee if either the settlor is resident in New Zealand or the trustee is resident in New Zealand, subject to transitional relief for a foreign trustee that migrates to New Zealand to give time to arrange a new trustee for the trust.

Detailed recommendations

We now set out our recommendations for implementing hybrid rules in New Zealand.

**_Hybrid financial instruments (OECD recommendations 1 and 2)_**

**_General_**

We recommend that New Zealand introduce rules, in line with OECD recommendations 1 and 2, to prevent double non-taxation arising from hybrid financial instruments. The following diagram illustrates a typical hybrid financial instrument.

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Double non-taxation arises because the payment on the hybrid financial instrument is deductible (as interest) in Country B but not taxable (because it is treated as dividend) in Country A.

The OECD recommends that in relation to payments made in connection with financial instruments, countries (in the following order):

*   tax dividend payments as ordinary income, if the payments are deductible to the foreign payer (recommendation 2);
*   deny a deduction for a payment which is not taxed as ordinary income to the foreign payee and therefore subject to no or a reduced amount of foreign tax (recommendation 1 primary rule); and
*   if a payment which is not taxed as ordinary income is deductible to the payer in another country (i.e. that country has not implemented the primary rule), impose tax on that payment as if it were ordinary income (recommendation 1 defensive rule)[\[1\]](#footnote-2)
    .

Recommendation 1 applies only to arrangements between related parties, or which are structured.

_Recommendations relating to OECD recommendation 2_

New Zealand already has a rule achieving most of the OECD recommendation 2. This rule denies the general exemption for dividends received by a New Zealand company from a foreign company, if the dividend is deductible to the payer. To ensure that this rule is fully effective, we recommend that it be expanded to:

*   tax a dividend if the payment of the dividend triggers a tax credit for the payer in its country of residence, giving the same effect as a deduction, This is proposed in the OECD Final Report[\[2\]](#footnote-3)
     and our discussion document; and
*   where a deductible dividend has an imputation credit attached, deny the payee the ability to use the imputation credit to reduce their tax liability. The Australian Government announced in its recent Budget that it would also be making this change.

**_Instruments denominated in a foreign currency_**

We recommend that when the instrument is denominated in a foreign currency (e.g. a loan in a foreign currency), the amount of the recommendation 1 primary rule denial includes the effect of foreign currency gain or loss. Under New Zealand’s comprehensive financial arrangements rules, foreign currency gain or loss on a financial arrangement is taxable and (subject to the usual restrictions) deductible, often on an accrual basis. If the arrangement is a hybrid financial instrument in respect of which a deduction for interest is denied under recommendation 1 primary rule, we recommend that this also apply to the foreign currency loss or gain. In the case of a gain, this means the gain is tax exempt. This approach will simplify compliance and is consistent with the conceptual basis for financial arrangement taxation and the hybrid rules. This approach was widely supported in our workshop consultation.

We do not recommend taking the same approach to income inclusion under recommendation 2 (except insofar as that will occur through application of the comparative value method under the FIF rules) or the recommendation 1 defensive rule. In those cases, only the actual amount of the deductible payment should be included in the payee’s income. Since the payee is not otherwise recognising income in these cases, there is no compliance saving from including foreign currency in the counteraction. Currently, when we apply our domestic rule that corresponds to recommendation 2, we do not include foreign currency, and this does not seem to have caused any difficulty. This approach was also widely supported in workshop consultation.

**_Whether CFC taxation in a third country is treated as income inclusion_**

We recommend that to the extent that a payment on a hybrid financial instrument can be shown to give rise to taxation of an investor in the payee under another country’s controlled foreign company (CFC) regime, the payer should be allowed a deduction for the payment. This was strongly supported in consultation. However, given the complexity involved in demonstrating that this is the case, we recommend that taxpayers who believe a deduction is justified on this basis be required to indicate that (including stating the amount of the deduction so justified) when filing their tax return, so the Commissioner is alerted and can audit this claim if she wishes to do so.

**_Hybrid transfers_**

OECD recommendation 1 is intended to apply to financial instrument lending and financial instrument repo arrangements. We recommend that New Zealand’s rules also apply to these transactions. This appears to require a number of technical amendments to the current rules.

In relation to share lending (see glossary at Appendix 2) by a New Zealand resident share lender who lends shares in a transaction subject to the hybrid rules (which means it must be with a related party or be a structured arrangement):

*   we are considering whether to require that the lender be taxable on a dividend substitution payment, since such a payment will generally be deductible to the payer. This will require over-riding their current ability to use the fair dividend rate method, as if they continued to own the shares;
*   we recommend that the lender not be allowed an imputation credit on any replacement payment in respect of New Zealand shares, if the share borrower is entitled to a deduction for that payment.

In relation to share repos (see glossary at Appendix 2) we recommend in particular that regardless of whether the transaction is structured or between related parties:

*   when the shares are subject to the FIF rules, the money lender (who acquires the shares under the repo, and must re-deliver them at the end of the arrangement) be required to use the comparative value method to determine its income from the shares. This is the same treatment as applies in other situations where shares produce a debt-like return; and
*   when the shares are New Zealand shares, the money lender not be entitled to an imputation credit with respect to the dividend. This is already the case as a practical matter, but it ensures that foreign borrowers are not subject to the hybrid rules with respect to any payment they are deemed to make to a New Zealand lender under a share repo.

We have consulted on these recommendations both generally and with the Crown entities engaged in share lending. The Crown entities do not see any difficulty with them.

**_Timing_**

A timing mismatch arises where payments under an instrument are taxable and deductible, but the payer is entitled to a deduction much earlier than the payee has to return income. The OECD recommendation is that timing mismatches should give rise to a hybrid counteraction under recommendation 1 only where the mismatch is not corrected within 12-24 months and there is no reasonable expectation that it will not be corrected within a reasonable period of time. Mismatches arising only from foreign currency movements will not bring an instrument into this rule.

We recommend a more clear-cut, less discretionary rule. Under this rule, a timing mismatch would be counteracted under the hybrid rules if it is:

*   on an instrument with a term of 3 years or more or which has been extended to beyond 3 years; and
*   in relation to a payment for which the lender is not accounting, for tax purposes, on a reasonable accrual basis; and
*   not reasonable, having regard to the terms of the instrument and the payments made to date, to believe that the expenditure will be included in income in the payee’s accounting period beginning within 24 months of the end of the period in which the expenditure is incurred.

If these criteria are met, any timing mismatch will be counteracted, but the counteraction will be reversed as the mismatch reverses. So, for example, a deduction denied under the primary rule will be allowed if and when the income is recognised in the payee country.

Our timing approach was widely supported in consultation, and is broadly in line with what we understand Australia is currently proposing.

**_Interaction with non-resident withholding tax_**

When non-resident withholding tax (“NRWT”) (generally at a rate of 10%) is imposed on an interest payment which is non-deductible as a result of the application of OECD recommendation 1, there is an element of double taxation. Taxpayers can avoid this by not issuing hybrid financial instruments. In consultation, this was not regarded as an adequate response to the issue. Accordingly, we recommend that we give further consideration to the idea of allowing taxpayers to choose to treat such a payment as a dividend for withholding tax purposes. The rate of NRWT on a dividend is generally 15%, but this can be reduced or eliminated by attaching imputation credits to the dividend. There are some cases where the rate is as low as 0%. This treatment will have to be elected before the payment is made.

We also recommend amending the rules, enacted this year, which prevent deferral of NRWT. These rules apply if a New Zealand borrower from a related party foreign lender calculates its interest expense on an accrual basis, but the relevant interest is not paid for some time, leading to a deferral of the corresponding NRWT. The most significant amendment we propose to this rule is that where interest expense is not deductible under recommendation 1, that interest should not be taken into account when deciding whether or not to apply the anti-deferral rule. This amendment was widely supported in consultation.

**_Interaction with thin capitalisation regime_**

The thin capitalisation regime denies deductions for a proportion of a group’s interest expenses if the group has debt-funded its New Zealand operations above a permissible level. Debt funding will only be taken into account to the extent it gives rise to a deduction. Accordingly, we recommend that where payments under a hybrid financial instrument are subject to permanent deduction denial under recommendation 1 primary rule, they will not be treated as debt for the purpose of this rule. Instruments where there is a timing mismatch would still be treated as debt, but the interest expense would only be subject to the thin capitalisation rules in the year it is deductible under the hybrid rules. This was supported in consultation, and our initial assessment is that it requires no amendment to the law.

**_Application to regulatory capital issued by banks and insurance companies_**

Some of the Australian owned banks with New Zealand branches have undertaken significant issues of hybrid financial instruments. These are generally treated as debt in New Zealand but equity in Australia. Although the dividend is taxable in Australia, that tax is generally eliminated because the dividend carries a franking credit which is generated by the payment of Australian tax on other income. These instruments have generally also counted towards the bank’s regulatory capital requirements for Australian or New Zealand purposes.

We recommend that the New Zealand hybrid rules not exclude regulatory capital (i.e. that required to be issued by banks and insurance companies). The OECD Final Report notes that countries may choose to have such an exclusion. The UK has chosen to do so, though it has other anti-tax arbitrage rules that have applied to bank regulatory capital for some time. Australia has decided not to exclude regulatory capital from its hybrid rules, in its recent Budget. The EU requires member states to include regulatory capital in their hybrid rules by 1 January 2022. Our discussion document also recommended no exclusion.

We received several submissions in favour of an exclusion. These submissions and our reasons for not accepting them are contained in Tax Policy Report: Consultation on Addressing Hybrid Mismatches (T2017/406 IR2017/133). Given Australia’s decision, New Zealand’s position is now largely moot in relation to the trans-Tasman hybrid issues referred to above (with the exception of transitional issues). Because Australia will tax the return on such instruments with no allowance for an imputation credit, New Zealand will continue to allow a deduction.

We recommend grandparenting from recommendation 1 for deductions claimed in New Zealand by banks and insurance companies in respect of certain capital issued before the release of the discussion document on 6 September 2016. This is discussed more fully under the heading _Effective Date and Implementation._

**_Hybrid entities – disregarded payments (OECD recommendation 3)_**

**_General_**

We recommend that New Zealand introduce rules in line with OECD recommendation 3 to prevent double non-taxation arising when a hybrid entity makes a payment which is deductible to the payer but disregarded by the payee. A hybrid entity is an entity which is transparent for tax purposes in the country of an investor but opaque for tax purposes in

another country, generally where it is established. A diagram follows, where A Co is the investor and B Co is the hybrid entity.

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

The interest payment by B Co is deductible in the hybrid entity country but disregarded in the investor country. In the New Zealand context, B Co could be a New Zealand company with unlimited shareholder liability, and A Co could be a US company which has chosen to treat B Co as fiscally transparent.

Because the interest payment by B Co is deductible in Country B, if B Co has no other income, the payment produces a tax loss, which can be grouped with the income of B Sub 1. The payment can therefore reduce taxable income in Country B without giving rise to any income in Country A, because of the different treatment of B Co in each country. This is a deductible/non-includible mismatch.

OECD recommendation 3 is that Country B should defer a deduction for such a payment until it is offset by dual inclusion income (discussed immediately below). This is the primary rule. If it does not defer the deduction, Country A should tax the payment, under the defensive rule. Neither rule applies unless the payer and payee are in the same control group (50% or more commonly owned) or the arrangement is structured.

Unlike recommendations 1 and 2, recommendation 3 can apply to any kind of deductible payment, e.g. rent, royalties, payments for services, etc.

Denial of a deduction under recommendation 3 should be reversed to the extent that the hybrid entity has dual inclusion income. Dual inclusion income is generally speaking income that is taxable in Country A and Country B. If B Co in the above diagram in the same year earns a separate stream of dual inclusion income equal to the amount of the interest payment, it would have:

*   no gain or loss in Country B (since the income and interest offset each other); and
*   income equal to the amount of the interest payment in Country A (since the income is taxable with no deduction for the disregarded payment).

The existence of taxable income in Country A would mean that the tax result is appropriate without the need to apply any hybrid counteraction.

The same outcome should apply if the dual inclusion income is earned in a later year. Accordingly the OECD recommends that deductions denied under recommendation 3 be able to be deducted in a later year if there is dual inclusion income. Accordingly, denial under recommendation 3 is in fact only deferral, though the deferral may be permanent if no dual inclusion income ever arises.

**_Application to deemed payments by branches_**

In line with the OECD branch mismatch report, we recommend that recommendation 3 also apply where a branch is treated in the branch country as making a deductible payment to its head office which is not a simple allocation of third party costs. So far as policy officials are aware, New Zealand allows a deduction for a deemed payment only in relation to interest on deemed loans by non-resident banks and insurance companies to their New Zealand branches. Where the taxpayer is resident in Australia, our understanding is that the deemed payment is recognised for Australian tax purposes. From a practical perspective, the application of the primary rule of recommendation 3 in a branch context is therefore unlikely.

**_Carry forward of recommendation 3 defensive counteraction_**

The OECD Final Report does not discuss the possibility of allowing a reversal of amounts of income deemed to arise under the defensive rule in recommendation 3. However, for reasons of principal and consistency, we proposed in our discussion document that where a New Zealand taxpayer has recognised income as a result of receiving a disregarded payment from a foreign hybrid entity, that income should be reversed in a later year when there is dual inclusion income earned through the hybrid entity. We recommend that this reversal be part of the New Zealand hybrids legislation. This is a taxpayer friendly measure, though we do not anticipate the defensive rule often applying in New Zealand.

**_Foreign currency loans_**

We recommend a similar approach to foreign currency loans subject to recommendation 3 primary rule as the approach set out above in relation to recommendation 1. If the loan is to a New Zealand hybrid, the amount of the deduction subject to denial should take into account foreign currency fluctuations. In this case though, any net income to the NZ hybrid borrower due to foreign currency gain will be taxed as dual inclusion income, rather than exempt.

We recommend a different approach to foreign currency loans subject to the recommendation 3 defensive rule to the approach set out above in relation to recommendations 1 and 2. Consistent with the primary rule recommendations, we recommend that foreign currency fluctuations should be taken into account in determining the amount of additional income arising under the defensive rule counteraction. That is because they will also be recognised in determining dual inclusion income, as discussed further below.

**_Simple implementation solution_**

Foreign currency loans are one aspect of a larger issue in implementing OECD recommendation 3, which arises from the fact that different countries have different rules for calculating income and expense. This poses a challenge for recommendation 3, in particular in relation to the measurement of dual inclusion income.

We recommend that dual inclusion income be determined in such a way as to simplify the application of recommendation 3 as far as possible. This means that when applying the primary rule in recommendation 3, dual inclusion income would include all income earned by the hybrid entity from activities the income of which is taxable in the investor country. This income would be calculated in NZ$ and using New Zealand tax principles, without regard to the amount of income actually returned in the investor country from those same activities.

Similarly, when applying the defensive rule, New Zealand would treat as dual inclusion income all income from the hybrid as calculated for New Zealand tax purposes, except where that income is protected from New Zealand tax by a foreign tax credit.

This simplifying approach was widely supported in consultation.

**_Whether CFC taxation in a third country is treated as income inclusion_**

As for the OECD recommendation 1, we recommend that to the extent that a payment by a hybrid entity which is disregarded by the payee can be proven to give rise to taxation of an investor in the payee under another country’s CFC regime, the payer should be allowed a deduction for the payment. Similarly, amounts which are included in income under another country’s CFC regime can qualify as dual inclusion income. However, because of the complexity of CFC taxation, in these cases, we propose that the taxpayer would have to demonstrate that the amounts are fully taxable for CFC purposes in the relevant period.

We do not propose that CFC taxation be taken into account when New Zealand is applying the defensive rule in recommendation 3. That is because in that case any taxation imposed in New Zealand under the hybrid rules should be available as a credit against CFC taxation.

**_Effect of deferred deductions on foreign tax credit limitation_**

A person’s ability to claim a credit against New Zealand income tax for foreign income tax imposed on foreign source income is limited to the amount of New Zealand income tax imposed on the net foreign income, i.e. taking into account deductions claimed in New Zealand in relation to that income.

This will naturally mean that when a deduction which has been deferred under recommendation 3 primary rule is later allowed, it will lower the foreign tax credit limitation. We recommend that the same outcome should apply when a New Zealand taxpayer has income under the defensive rule in recommendation 3, and that income is reversed in a later year by virtue of dual inclusion income arising in the hybrid entity.

The effect of reversing the recommendation 3 counteraction on the foreign tax credit limitation was discussed in consultation, and generally accepted. Submitters did comment that there are already similar existing anomalies in the calculation of foreign tax credits, some of which give results which are unfavourable to taxpayers, and suggested that a more general policy review of the foreign tax credit rules would be appropriate. However, this would have to be undertaken as a separate policy proposal.

**_Effect of loss of ownership continuity on carry forwards_**

As set out above, deductions deferred under the recommendation 3 primary rule should be carried forward and allowed when and if there is dual inclusion income in a future year. However, we recommend that if the taxpayer is a company, and there is a 51% or greater change in the taxpayer’s ownership after the time when the deduction would ordinarily be claimed, the deductions would not be able to be claimed in the future. The same rule would apply to income deemed to arise under the recommendation 3 defensive rule.

This is the same rule as applies to deductions for carried forward losses. It ensures that it is not possible for owners of a company to profit from the sale of the company as a tax shelter. That rationale applies in the case of deductions denied under the hybrid rules in just the same way as it applies to deductions which are unusable in the year incurred because they exceed current income. While such deductions are able to be carried forward and used in future years for the benefit of the shareholders who owned the company when the expenses were incurred, they should not be able to be used for the benefit of other shareholders.

One of the reasons for making this recommendation is that in some cases, deductions denied under the recommendation 3 primary rule would, if allowed, have formed part of a net loss to carry forward in any event, and thus been subject to elimination on an ownership change in the ordinary way. It would be anomalous in that case for the hybrid rules to have the effect of protecting the carry forward of those expenses from elimination.

While officials’ position was understood in consultation, it was not entirely accepted by all parties, and may be subject to a degree of criticism. Submitters felt the deferral of a deduction was more like a timing rule (e.g. cash deduction for an accrued expense) which is not subject to carry forward elimination if there is an ownership change between accrual and deduction.

**_Interaction with NRWT_**

When a payment for which a deduction is deferred under recommendation 3 is subject to New Zealand NRWT, we do not propose that any adjustment be made for that. Recommendation 3 does not permanently deny the deduction – it defers it until there is income in the hybrid. So it would not be appropriate to adopt the same solution being considered for a payment in a recommendation 1 hybrid financial arrangement mismatch and allow the payer to eliminate the NRWT permanently by treating the payment as a dividend. An alternative would be to reflect the imposition of NRWT by allowing a portion of the payment to be deducted. But this would create further complexity, particularly if the payee country has hybrid rules.

Accordingly we do not recommend any amendment to the NRWT rules or the hybrid rules to adjust for the imposition of NRWT on a payment for which a deduction is denied under OECD recommendation 3. This may be a point which parts of the private sector will be unhappy with. However, we believe it will generally be possible for businesses to plan around the issue.

As for the new rules imposing NRWT on an accrual basis, we propose a similar modification to that proposed as a consequence of enacting OECD hybrid recommendation 1. That is, expenditure for which a deduction is deferred under recommendation 3 would not trigger application of NRWT on an accrual basis.

**_Interaction with thin capitalisation_**

We recommend that denial of a deduction under recommendation 3 should have no effect on the thin capitalisation regime. Because interest deductions are only deferred under recommendation 3 rather than denied, there is less reason to amend the application of the thin capitalisation regime than there is in recommendation 1. In addition:

*   when a hybrid entity has both interest and non-interest disregarded expenses, only some of which are deferred, an apportionment rule would be necessary to determine the amount of the deferred interest;
*   taxpayers will generally manage their thin capitalisation position to avoid any interest denial under the regime.

**_Deductible payment to a reverse hybrid (OECD recommendations 4)_**

**_General_**

We recommend that New Zealand introduce rules, in line with OECD recommendation 4, to prevent double non-taxation arising from a payment to a reverse hybrid where payer, payee and the relevant investor are in a control group. The following diagram illustrates a typical example of the situation proposed to be addressed.

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>). .

If B Co (the payee) is a reverse hybrid, double non-taxation arises because the interest payment is deductible to C Co (the payer) and not taxable to either B Co or A Co (the investor). Even on distribution by B Co to A Co it may not be taxable, if protected by an exemption for cross border intra-group dividends. The double non-taxation is due to a hybrid mismatch if the payment would have been taxable had it been made directly from C Co to A Co. In this diagram, New Zealand is Country C, and would apply the recommendation 4 counteraction to deny a deduction for the interest payment.

OECD recommendation 4 is that countries deny a deduction for a payment to a reverse hybrid if:

*   the payment would have been taxed if made directly to the investor (A Co in the case above); and
*   the payer, payee and investor are all in a control group or the payment is pursuant to a structured arrangement.

**_Application to payments to branches_**

In line with the recommendations in the OECD branch mismatch report, we recommend that recommendation 4 also apply to a payment to a control group member which is not taxed to the payee because:

*   the payment is a “diverted branch payment”. As defined in the OECD branch report, this is a payment which is treated:
    *   in the payee country as attributable to a branch in another country and therefore not taxed
    *   in the branch country as not attributable to the branch; and
*   the payment is to a “disregarded branch”. As defined in the OECD branch report, a disregarded branch arises when a payment is treated in the payee country as attributable to a branch in another country, but the branch country does not treat the payee as having a branch which would give the branch country a right to tax.

We are not aware of such structures being used in New Zealand. However, UK and OECD officials advised us that structures making use of these types of branch mismatches were widely used in Europe, and that the effectiveness of a country’s hybrid measures would be significantly compromised if they were not addressed.

Applying the recommendation 4 counteraction to these branch mismatches was accepted in consultation.

**_Instruments denominated in a foreign currency_**

As for recommendation 1 we recommend that when the payment is on a loan denominated in a foreign currency, the amount of the recommendation 4 denial includes the effect of foreign currency gain or loss.

**_CFC inclusion_**

As for recommendations 1 and 3 primary rule, we recommend that to the extent that a payment to a reverse hybrid can be proven to give rise to taxation under the owner country’s CFC regime, or the CFC regime of a higher tier owner, a deduction should be allowed.

**_Interaction with non-resident withholding tax_**

As noted in relation to recommendation 1, denial of a deduction under recommendation 4 is permanent, and accordingly the imposition of non-resident withholding tax on the payment will involve a degree of over-taxation. However, because the mismatch does not necessarily arise in relation to hybrid financial instrument (indeed, it may arise on a royalty payment, which is not in relation to a financial instrument at all), there is no basis for recharacterising the payment as a dividend for withholding tax purposes. Accordingly, we do not recommend any adjustment to the imposition of NRWT. This is the approach taken by other jurisdictions. In general the outcome can be avoided by not using reverse hybrid entities.

**_Interaction with thin capitalisation regime_**

To the extent that a deduction is denied for a payment of interest under recommendation 4, we recommend that the debt corresponding to that deduction, and the payment itself, be treated in the same way as if the deduction were denied under recommendation 1, i.e. it will not be treated as debt for purposes of the rules. .

**_Reverse hybrids – recommendation 5_**

OECD recommendation 5 is in three parts.

*   Recommendation 5.1 suggests countries consider changes to their domestic law so that they tax residents on income which is not taxed in another country due to its being earned by a reverse hybrid;
*   Recommendation 5.2 suggests countries consider changes to their domestic law so they tax income which is earned by a reverse hybrid entity established in their country; and
*   Recommendation 5.3 suggests countries consider improvements to record keeping and disclosure rules for tax transparent entities established in their country.

We propose making changes consistent with recommendation 5.2 and considering further recommendation 5.1. In respect of recommendation 5.3, we believe that New Zealand’s record keeping and disclosure rules meet current international standards noting that our rules for foreign trust disclosure have recently been strengthened following the recommendations of the Shewan Report in 2016.

However, we note that Australia has indicated that it is unlikely to implement recommendations 5.1 and 5.2 at this point. In respect of recommendation 5.1 this is largely because they see their existing rules as adequate. For recommendation 5.2, we understand that Australia does not see a significant domestic problem that needs to be addressed. By contrast, we consider that the existence of New Zealand limited partnerships and foreign trusts (discussed below) means it is preferable for New Zealand to follow the OECD recommendations.

**_Reverse hybrids with a New Zealand investor – recommendation 5.1_**

New Zealand already has a CFC regime which applies to a New Zealand resident holding 10% or more of a foreign company which is controlled by New Zealand residents. Under the CFC regime, such a shareholder is taxed on its share of the foreign company’s income of certain kinds, referred to as attributed income. Attributed income includes interest income and certain other passive income, but excludes active income. Accordingly, where a New Zealand resident is an investor in a reverse hybrid, non-taxation by reason of reverse hybridity would only arise in relation to such active income.

In consultation, submitters observed that in most cases, active income would already be taxed by the source/establishment country. They therefore questioned the need for any change. However, they accepted that adding to the definition of income subject to attribution under the CFC regime income which is not taxable to the CFC because it is treated by the CFC country of establishment as earned by the New Zealand investor could be the outcome of this project.

We note also that there is a de minimis rule in the CFC regime (generally, there is no attribution of income unless potentially attributable income is more than 5% of total income), so attribution will not in most cases be triggered by a relatively small amount of untaxed reverse hybrid income.

A rule which taxed CFC income in these circumstances would also apply to a New Zealand resident who uses the attributable FIF income method to calculate FIF income. This method uses the same mechanics as the CFC regime.

Although recommendation 5.1 is recommended by the OECD, it is not expected to be adopted by Australia, and it raises some conceptual and practical issues. We would like to consider this matter further and report back.

**_Reverse hybrids established in New Zealand – recommendation 5.2_**

There are two entities in New Zealand which present a real risk of giving rise to non-taxation as a result of reverse hybridity. They are:

*   New Zealand limited partnerships; and
*   Trusts with a New Zealand trustee and a foreign settlor or beneficiary.

Although a look through company (LTC) may also be a reverse hybrid, the risk of non-taxation is already addressed. A company cannot be an LTC if its foreign income exceeds the greater of $10,000 or 20% of the company’s gross income, if more that 50% of the LTC’s shares are held by non-residents.

In relation to limited partnerships, we recommend that income which is earned by a limited partnership and attributed to a partner who is not taxable on that income and who is in the same control group as the partnership, should be taxable in New Zealand , on the same basis as if the non-resident partners were resident in New Zealand. This liability should be on both the limited partner and the general partner (who will have a right of indemnity against the limited partner). We recommend a de minimis at the same level as the LTC de minimis referred to above.

**_Foreign trusts_**

Foreign trusts have been controversial recently because New Zealand’s regime for taxing them is unusual internationally and they have been used as a vehicle for investing offshore by some non-resident settlors and the income was not taxed (nor disclosed) anywhere. This was the topic of the Shewan Inquiry which made recommendations (adopted by the Government) to greatly strengthen disclosure requirements. This addressed the use of foreign trusts to disguise illegal activity, but tax advantages through their hybrid nature remain.

We describe below two options for addressing the hybrid mismatch. However, given that the Shewan Inquiry found no conceptual basis to disagree with the fundamental tax treatment of foreign trusts, Ministers could want to retain the current treatment. That said, the frame of reference for the Shewan Inquiry was New Zealand tax principles and international disclosure principles, while the reference for the hybrids mismatch proposals is closing arbitrage options between tax treatments of different countries without inquiring whether any country’s treatment is correct from its own domestic perspective.

**_Hybrid mismatch for beneficiary and trustee income (Inland Revenue recommendation)_**

In relation to foreign trusts a reverse hybrid mismatch can arise in relation to beneficiary income in the same way as it can arise for a limited partnership, if income which is treated for New Zealand tax purposes, and on which the beneficiary would be taxed in its country of residence if it derived the income directly, is not taxed because the residence country regards the income as derived by the trustee. Accordingly, if the beneficiary who is not taxable on beneficiary income due to a reverse hybrid mismatch is in the same control group as the trust, and the trust derives more than the greater of $10,000 or 20% of its income from foreign sources, we recommend that the beneficiary income be subject to New Zealand taxation, in accordance with recommendation 5.2.

A reverse hybrid mismatch can arguably also arise in relation to trustee income New Zealand does not impose tax on the income of a New Zealand trustee of a foreign trust because of what is often referred to as a settlor approach to trust taxation. We tax foreign source income earned by the foreign trustee of a trust with a New Zealand settlor, on the basis that the income is more appropriately treated as belonging to the settlor (who is a New Zealand resident taxable on worldwide income) than the trustee (who is ordinarily not subject to New Zealand tax on foreign source income). Similarly we do not tax the foreign source income earned by the New Zealand trustee of a trust with a foreign settlor, on the basis that the income is more appropriately treated as earned by the foreign settlor, who is not subject to New Zealand tax on non-New Zealand source income.

Since the trustee income of a New Zealand trustee of a foreign trust is taxed as if it were derived by the foreign settlor, there is arguably a hybrid mismatch if the income is not taxed to the foreign settlor in its residence jurisdiction, and the reason for that non-taxation is that the income has been derived by the New Zealand trustee rather than the settlor directly. Accordingly, if the settlor who is not taxable on trustee income due to a hybrid mismatch is in the same control group as the trust, and the trust derives more than the greater of $10,000 or 20% of its income from foreign sources, we recommend that the trustee be subject to New Zealand taxation in accordance with recommendation 5.2.

**_Hybrid mismatch comprehensive foreign trust proposal (Treasury recommendation)_**

New Zealand is relatively unusual in having a settlor regime for trust taxation. As far as we know from research undertaken during the Shewan Inquiry, the settlor basis for trust taxation applies only for settlors resident in New Zealand, Japan, and the United States (for some trusts only) (there could be some other jurisdictions that we are not aware of). This means that there may be many cases where recommendation 5.2 applies.

A simpler option would be for New Zealand to tax the New Zealand trustee of all trusts with a New Zealand resident trustee, as well as retaining the settlor regime. This would apply a taxing nexus for trustee income that almost all other countries that recognise trusts apply. It would be a simpler test than having to inquire what the settlor and beneficiary tax regimes are for all trusts with a resident trustee, and would largely pick up the same income.

Some form of transitional rules may be required in relation to these rules, to deal with events such as trustees who migrate to New Zealand or who become trustees of testamentary trusts. For example, the rules may allow a foreign trustee who migrates and becomes resident in New Zealand up to two years to find a substitute foreign trustee to keep the trust out of the New Zealand tax base. This situation is common internationally for trustees who migrate to another country.

In relation to these rules implementing OECD recommendation 5.2, both Inland Revenue and the Treasury recommend that the implementation date be later that for the other measures. Submitters suggested that the private sector may not fully appreciate that trust and partnership structures are within the terms of the hybrid rules. In order to ensure that those affected have adequate time to deal with the proposals, we suggest an implementation date of income years beginning on or after 1 April 2019.

**_Hybrid entities – double deductions (OECD recommendation 6)_**

**_General_**

We recommend that New Zealand introduce rules, in line with OECD recommendation 6, to prevent double non-taxation arising when a hybrid entity makes a payment that is deductible in two countries against non-dual inclusion income. (As discussed elsewhere in this report, this kind of mismatch is currently being used to reduce New Zealand tax, in the Australian limited partnership structures which the Government has already decided to address). A diagram illustrating this possibility follows, where B Co is the hybrid entity.

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Because A Co treats B Co as fiscally transparent, in Country A the interest paid by B Co is deductible against A Co’s other income. In Country B the interest payment is treated as made by a separate company, which is in a tax consolidated group with B Sub 1. Accordingly the interest payment can offset income earned by B Sub 1. This means that each $1 of interest payment can offset $2 of income. The outcome is similar to the outcome of a deductible/non-includible mismatch countered by recommendation 3, but in this case it is caused by a payment being deductible in two countries, rather than deductible and disregarded.

OECD recommendation 6 is that:

*   The investor country (Country A in the diagram) should deny a deduction for the interest payment (the primary rule); and
*   If Country A does not do so, then Country B should deny the deduction (the defensive rule).

As noted above, Cabinet has already agreed to implement the primary rule (CAB-17-MIN-0164 refers).

Recommendation 6 applies to any kind of expenditure, including allowances such as depreciation.

As with recommendation 3, denial of a deduction under recommendation 6 should be reversed to the extent that the hybrid entity has dual inclusion income, either in the same period or a later one.

**_Application to branches_**

The OECD Hybrids Report was explicit that recommendation 6 applies to expenses incurred by a branch if those expenses are deductible in both the branch and parent countries. For many branches, that is not the case, because the legal entity is established in a country (such as Australia) which exempts active branch income. However, expenses incurred by foreign branches of New Zealand companies will be deductible in two countries. Accordingly, this recommendation is particularly relevant to New Zealand companies.

The OECD proposes that recommendation 6 apply if there is any potential for expenditure to be offset against non-dual inclusion income, whether or not it is so offset. This could have made foreign branch losses unavailable to be used against New Zealand source income. A blanket denial of deductions for foreign branch losses would not be a comfortable fit with our current policy settings for taxing branch income, and officials have put considerable effort into consultation designed to ensure that recommendation 6 can be implemented in a way that ensures it does not affect the vast majority of New Zealand companies which have foreign branches that are in loss, but are not using the deduction in the branch country against non-dual inclusion income.

**_Recommendation for scope of recommendation 6 primary rule_**

Officials accordingly recommend that the primary rule in recommendation 6 apply to expenditure of a foreign branch/hybrid entity with a New Zealand parent/investor only where there is another entity with income that is not taxable in New Zealand but able to be offset in any way by any branch/hybrid entity loss (including where such offset requires an election or other similar step having tax significance only).

This restriction means that a New Zealand company with a foreign branch would in most circumstances not be denied a deduction in New Zealand for any branch/hybrid loss under recommendation 6. There would be no denial, for instance, in the case of a New Zealand company with one or more Australian branches if:

*   the New Zealand group does not own any other Australian entities; or
*   if it does own other Australian entities, those entities’ income cannot be offset by any branch loss. We understand that in Australia a loss incurred by an Australian branch of a non-resident company cannot offset income earned by a resident company. On that basis, ownership of an Australian company by the New Zealand group also would be consistent with the non-application of recommendation 6 primary rule.

The restriction explained above was generally accepted in consultation, and officials believe that it produces a sensible policy outcome. It does not go so far as denying the branch/hybrid loss only to the extent it is used against non-dual inclusion income. Consultation established that such a rule, though also potentially producing an appropriate outcome, would be much more complex to design and administer.

**_Recommendation for transitional situations_**

This recommendation means that a rule is required to deal with the situation where a New Zealand resident with a loss-making foreign branch or hybrid at some point becomes subject to recommendation 6 primary rule by virtue of acquiring an interest in an entity in the branch country whose income is not taxable in New Zealand but can be offset by the branch losses. Officials recommend that:

*   if the branch loss arising before the acquisition of the interest in the second entity cannot be offset against the new entity’s income (as will often be the case, including we understand in Australia), then the only consequence is that subsequent branch losses are subject to the recommendation 6 primary rule; and
*   otherwise, all losses of the branch which have been used against New Zealand income should be recaptured, since they are now available to be used against non-dual inclusion income.

Officials do not believe this rule will often apply, but it is important for the integrity of the hybrids package.

We also recommend a similar rule to operate in favour of a New Zealand resident with a hybrid entity or branch which has been subject to loss denial under recommendation 6. If it becomes impossible for the loss to be used in the branch/hybrid jurisdiction, then it should be allowed in New Zealand. This could occur if, for example, the hybrid is wound up in the foreign country, or if the entity with non-dual inclusion income is sold. In that case the suspended losses would be deductible in New Zealand to the extent of the carried forward loss, as calculated under the rules of the hybrid or branch country, that has become unusable in that country.

**_Simple implementation solution_**

As with recommendation 3, in order to simplify compliance, we recommend that the amount of double deductible expenditure and dual inclusion income be the amount calculated under New Zealand tax principles, without close regard to whether such amounts match the amounts which are deducible or taxable in the other country. This possibility is referred to in the OECD final report and was strongly supported in consultation.

As with recommendation 3 defensive rule, we recommend that when New Zealand is applying the primary rule, income protected from tax by a foreign tax credit would not be dual inclusion income.

**_CFC taxation in investor country can give rise to dual inclusion income_**

We recommend that income which can be shown to be taxable both in the branch/hybrid country and under CFC rules in the investor country should be able to be treated as dual inclusion income. Again this would not be the case if the CFC taxation is reduced by a credit for tax paid in the branch/hybrid country.

**_Effect of deferred deduction on foreign tax credit limitation_**

Deductions deferred under recommendation 6 will under existing law reduce the foreign tax credit limitation in the year the deductions are allowed. No change is required.

**_Effect of loss of ownership continuity on carry forwards_**

As for OECD recommendation 3, we recommend that if a taxpayer subject to recommendation 6 denial is a company and there is a 51% or greater change in its ownership after the time when the deduction would ordinarily be claimed, the deductions would not be able to be claimed in the future.

**_Interaction with NRWT_**

In relation to the new rules imposing NRWT on an accrual basis, we recommend a similar modification to that recommended for OECD recommendation 3.

**_Interaction with thin capitalisation_**

We make the same recommendation as for OECD recommendation 3.

**_Opaque election_**

In consultation, there has been a strong submission that a New Zealand owner of a foreign hybrid entity should be permitted to treat the hybrid as a company, in line with its foreign treatment. Recommendation 6 would then no longer apply to it. This submission was based on a desire for simplicity.

Officials understand the reasons for the submission. However we are concerned that it might lead to significant administrative and legislative complexity, for what might be a small handful of taxpayers. Accordingly, we recommend that we consider further whether it is possible to design a tightly targeted and simple opaque election, with a view to reporting back on our recommendations before the proposed bill is finalised.

**_Dual resident entities (OECD recommendation 7)_**

**_General_**

OECD recommendation 7 is that countries should deny a deduction to dual resident companies except to the extent of dual inclusion income. We recommend that New Zealand amend its existing rules relating to losses incurred by dual resident companies, to ensure they are fully effective to prevent deductions being taken against non-dual inclusion income.

Dual resident companies give rise to the same double deduction possibilities as hybrid entities. Expenditure incurred by such a company may be able to be used in each residence country to offset non-dual inclusion income, i.e. income taxed only in that country.

New Zealand’s rules already prevent dual resident companies from grouping their losses or forming part of a tax consolidated group. However, it does not prevent them offsetting expenditure against non-dual inclusion income earned through a reverse hybrid, such as (in many instances) a New Zealand limited liability partnership.

Submitters made the point that dual residence can arise inadvertently. For example, a corporate group in New Zealand may incorporate a subsidiary in Australia (which would therefore be an Australian tax resident company) but exercise sufficient director control in New Zealand that the company is arguably also New Zealand tax resident. Officials observe that if this is indeed a problem, it is a problem under the existing rules denying dual resident companies the ability to group losses, be part of a tax consolidated group, or even maintain an imputation credit account.

**_Similar rules to that applying to changes implementing OECD recommendation 6_**

The following recommendations made in relation to OECD recommendation 6 also apply in relation to recommendation 7:

*   simple implementation solution;
*   the effect of deferred deductions on the foreign tax credit limitation;
*   the effect of loss of ownership continuity on carry forwards; and
*   interact with thin capitalisation.

**_Imported mismatches (OECD recommendation 8)_**

**_General_**

We recommend that New Zealand introduce rules in line with OECD recommendation 8 to deny a deduction for a payment between members of a control group that funds a payment under a hybrid mismatch, including a branch mismatch. This is referred to as an imported mismatch rule. An example follows.

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

The interest payment by Borrower Co to B Co does not in isolation give rise to a hybrid mismatch. The loan is treated the same way in both Country B and Country C (which could be New Zealand). However, B Co makes payments to A Co under a hybrid financial instrument. The tax mismatch is not counteracted, because neither country has hybrid rules. If Country C makes no hybrid counteraction in such a case, the hybrid rules are ineffective to deal with arrangements between Country A and Country C. Businesses can avoid the rules simply by going from A to C via B.

In order to prevent its hybrid rules being circumvented, Country C can treat the loan from B Co to Borrower Co as an imported mismatch arrangement, and deny a deduction for the interest payments by Borrower Co to the extent that they do not exceed the payments under the hybrid financial instrument between B Co and A Co.

The OECD imported hybrid mismatch rule applies to both structured and unstructured imported mismatches.

*   A structured imported mismatch arises when a deductible payment is part of a structured arrangement involving a hybrid mismatch – for example if the funding chain the above diagram was entered into deliberately, in order to move money from A Co to Borrower Co. A structured imported mismatch rule prevents a country’s hybrid mismatch rules being deliberately circumvented.
*   An unstructured imported mismatch arises when there is no such intention. There is simply a deductible payment by a person resident in a country with hybrid rules, where the payee in turn makes a deductible payment under a hybrid mismatch arrangement (which may itself be an imported mismatch arrangement). The unstructured imported mismatch rule is intended to extend the reach of the hybrid rules, rather than to prevent their deliberate circumvention.

The OECD proposes complex apportionment rules which may need to be applied to determine the amount of denial in an unstructured hybrid mismatch.

The imported mismatch rule will not need to be applied in respect of payments to a person in a country with the hybrid rules. The payee’s country can be relied on to address any hybrid mismatches in that case. Furthermore, as more countries adopt hybrid rules, there should be fewer hybrids and hybrid mismatches in existence, and so less need for the imported hybrid rule to apply.

Those we consulted were not generally in favour of countering imported mismatches, on the basis that the hybrid mismatch was not directly with New Zealand. That said, they generally understood the need for a structured imported mismatch rule, but were concerned about the complexity and uncertainty around the unstructured rule. We recommend that this concern be addressed by deferring the application date for the unstructured imported mismatch rule. This recommendation is discussed in more detail under the heading _Effective date_.

**_Foreign currency instruments_**

When an imported mismatch payment is a return on a foreign currency loan, the issue of how to deal with foreign currency fluctuations arises as it does for the other recommendations. In this case we recommend that the foreign currency is not taken into account. The basis for the counteraction is that the New Zealand payment is funding in some way a hybrid mismatch payment by another entity. The extent of this funding may differ from year to year. Thus it is best measured by reference to the amount of the coupon payment alone, rather than including as well any foreign currency movements, which will generally have no cash flow impact in the relevant year..

**_Interaction with non-resident withholding tax_**

We do not recommend adjusting any non-resident withholding tax on a payment for which a deduction is denied under the imported mismatch rule. Because the payment will be treated as ordinary income in the payee country, any withholding tax will generally give rise to a tax credit in the payee country.

As with the other mismatch denial rules, we recommend that deductions disallowed under the imported mismatch rule not be taken into account when deciding whether or not to apply the anti-NRWT-deferral rule.

**_Interaction with thin capitalisation regime_**

As with a recommendation 1 (non-timing) and recommendation 4 denial, to the extent that interest on a financial arrangement is subject to denial under the imported mismatch rule we recommend that it not be treated for purposes of the thin capitalisation regime as debt.

**_Co-ordination rule_**

We recommend that the hybrid legislation includes a rule to deal with the situation where a hybrid mismatch arrangement which is subject to counteraction in one country (say New Zealand) ceases to be so subject, for example because the other country introduces hybrid rules, and is responsible applying taking the primary response. We recommend that this rule be consistent with the approach taken to this issue in the OECD Final Report. We did not receive any submissions against this approach.

**_Definitions_**

The hybrid rules may require some new definitions to be added to the Income Tax Act, and the amendment of some existing definitions. In particular, a definition will be required of a structured arrangement, and the importance of this was stressed in submissions. We did not receive any submissions against the definitional approach proposed in the discussion document, and recommend that we approach the tax of drafting supporting definitions in line with what was proposed there.

**_Specific anti-avoidance rule_**

We recommend that the hybrid rules include a specific anti-avoidance rule, allowing the Commissioner to counteract arrangements having a purpose or effect of defeating the intent or application of the hybrid rules.

**_Effective date, transitional and grandparenting_**

Cabinet has already agreed that OECD recommendation 6 primary rule should apply to New Zealand residents for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018 (CAB-17-MIN-0164 refers). This is on the basis that a bill is introduced to Parliament before the end of 2017, and in force before 1 July 2018. We recommend the same start date for all of the hybrid recommendations in this report other than that relating to unstructured imported mismatches and reverse hybrids, discussed below.

This may be:

*   a similar timetable to that in the UK (where the effective date was 8 months after introduction of the legislation into Parliament); and
*   shorter than that proposed in Australia, which has announced that its effective date will be at least six months after its legislation is enacted.

In general, we do not see any need for a longer lead time than that we propose. The target and effect of the hybrid rules is has been identified with some specificity, and has not changed in any significant way (other, perhaps, than the addition of branch mismatches beyond those in recommendation 6). Parties should be able to plan their affairs already with a high degree of confidence as to what the effect of the rules will be.

In relation to unstructured imported mismatches:

*   there is still considerable uncertainty as to how this rule should apply, given that it requires a co-ordinated counteraction of mismatches that may themselves be difficult to find and to quantify;
*   there will be less need to apply the rule as the hybrid rules are enacted in more countries. The unstructured imported mismatch rule does not apply to payments to a country with hybrid rules, and the adoption of the rule by more countries will reduce the number of hybrids in any event;
*   the adoption of the rules by more countries may assist in developing an understanding of how the unstructured imported mismatch rule should apply; and
*   the rule is more about extending the reach of the hybrid rules than ensuring their integrity.

The UK has introduced hybrid rules including an unstructured imported mismatch rule effective 1 January 2017. Australia has not made any announcement. The EU directive includes an unstructured imported mismatch rule which must be effective from 1 January 2020.

We recommend that the effective date of the unstructured imported mismatch rule be delayed until 1 January 2020. By that time, all of the EU member states are expected to have hybrid rules, and so the application of the unstructured imported rule will be both less frequent and, we expect, better developed. We do not make the same recommendation for the structured imported mismatch rule, as that would create an integrity issue for the rules.

We also recommend a delayed implementation date for the recommendations relating to limited partnerships and foreign trusts which are reverse hybrids. As discussed above, the private sector may not fully appreciate that trust and partnership structures are within the terms of the hybrid rules. In order to ensure that those affected have adequate time to deal with the proposals, we suggest an implementation date of income years beginning on or after 1 April 2019.

**_Transitional and grandparenting_**

All of the OECD Final Report, the Australian Board of Taxation report, and our discussion document, do not recommend any general transitional relief for existing arrangements. The hybrid rules generally apply to transactions between parties at least 25% commonly owned, or deliberately structured arrangements. They produce tax benefits that generally were not intended, but flow from the unintended interaction of different countries’ rules. The effect of the rules will be to remove inappropriate benefits. They will not have a punitive effect (except in relation to the imposition of NRWT), and except to the extent that they do, no exception can reasonably be taken to their application to existing transactions.

The absence of transitional relief is the same approach as was taken, without adverse reaction, to certain related party NRWT minimisation structures in the recently enacted Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Act

We recommend no transitional relief from the hybrid rules, subject to an exception for certain capital issued by banks (and insurance companies – for purposes of discussion we refer only to banks, but similar rules apply to both), as discussed further below.

A number of banks operating in New Zealand have issued debt instruments which are both:

*   hybrid mismatch arrangements (or imported hybrid mismatch arrangements), in the sense that the return on the instruments is deductible in New Zealand but treated as a dividend in Australia or elsewhere; and
*   regulatory capital for capital adequacy purposes, either in New Zealand or Australia.

Many of these issues have been made directly to the public in Australia. In some cases the instruments have been issued to a foreign branch of the New Zealand bank’s foreign parent Most of them are able to be repaid by the issuer after 5 years.

The fact that these instruments raise regulatory capital does not in our view justify any grandfathering. In discussions with the Reserve Bank, they have told us that there is no particular benefit in these instruments from a regulatory perspective, and that they would be comfortable with the banks replacing these instruments with ordinary shares to the extent that the capital they raise is required for regulatory purposes. Accordingly, in our discussion document we did not recommend any special treatment for these instruments.

However, these instruments do differ from most hybrids insofar as they are held by third party investors, often retail rather than wholesale (the hybrid rules apply to them because they are structured, rather than related party). This in turn means that if the hybrid rules were to apply to them so as to:

*   impose additional tax on the investors, the investors may have a right to be indemnified by the bank (this would be the case if recommendation 2, or recommendation 1 defensive rule applied to the investors); or
*   increase the after-tax cost of the funding to the issuer (which might be the result if any of the rules applied), the issuer may have a right to terminate the investment early.

The banks have submitted that subjecting regulatory capital to the hybrid regime with no grandparenting would be inappropriate because:

*   restructuring such capital would require regulatory approval, possibly from more than one regulator; and
*   such restructuring might be disruptive to the financial markets in which bank capital is raised, especially if all the banks were looking to replace their existing issuances at the same time.

Different banks made different submissions on the date from which grandparenting should cease to apply, ranging from the date of release of the OECD Final Report (October 2015), through the date of release of the Government discussion document (6 September 2016) to the date of enactment of New Zealand’s hybrid legislation. Co-ordination with Australia was also encouraged. In this respect we note that Australia announced in its 2017 Budget that it will:

*   apply recommendation 2 to dividends on hybrid regulatory capital, thus denying the payee the benefit of an imputation (or franking) credit; and
*   grandparent instruments issued before 8 May 2017.

There are some grounds for treating the publicly issued instruments differently from most hybrid instruments. Australia’s decision to grandparent also puts a heavy burden of proof on New Zealand to justify a decision to do otherwise. Accordingly we recommend providing some grandparenting. The issues then are:

*   which transactions should be grandparented; and
*   from what date.

As to the first of these, we recommend that only transactions which are directly to the public, or which are traceable to an issue to the public, should be grandparented. However, we have not yet had the opportunity to discuss this in detail with the banks, and may refine or expand this core recommendation as we do so.

As to the date, we recommend that grandparenting apply only to transactions entered into before the release of our discussion document on 6 September 2016. That document announced the Government’s intention to enact hybrid rules with no regulatory capital exception. It was also a date that was indicated as acceptable in some written submissions, and in consultation.

Appendix 2: Glossary
====================

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| CFC rules | New Zealand has a controlled foreign companies (CFC) regime that attributes the passive income of CFCs to New Zealand owners. New Zealand’s CFC rules are an important part of our international tax rules and are generally considered to be robust. |
| Deduction/ no inclusion (D/NI) | A hybrid result where a member of a group can claim a deduction for an intra-group payment and that deduction is not balanced by income inclusion for the recipient. |
| Double deductions (DD) | A hybrid result where a group can claim tax deductions against two different amounts of income for one item of expenditure. |
| FIF rules<br><br>*   fair dividend rate<br>*   cost<br>*   deemed rate of return<br>*   comparative value method<br>*   attributed FIF income method | New Zealand has a foreign investment fund (FIF) regime which seeks to tax New Zealand residents on their portfolio income from foreign share investment in a practical way. There are a number of methods to calculate FIF income, including:<br><br>*   The fair dividend rate (FDR) and cost methods which approximates total annual return as 5% of an investor’s holding and taxes on that basis;<br>*   The deemed rate of return (DRR) method which approximates total annual return as a rate set by Order in Council each year; and<br>*   The comparative value (CV) method which measures change in value across the relevant year plus any other gain such as a dividend and taxes that amount.<br>*   The attributed FIF income method, which taxes the resident on a share of the underlying income of the |
| Foreign branch | A New Zealand company that operates in a foreign country through a permanent establishment in that country. Because New Zealand taxes the worldwide income of its residents, a New Zealand company with a foreign branch operation that is in loss has the potential to create a hybrid outcome as the loss can be used against New Zealand as well as (potentially) offshore income which New Zealand does not tax. |
| Foreign tax credit | New Zealand’s tax law allows its residents to claim a foreign tax credit for tax paid overseas on a segment of foreign-sourced income. If that income is taxable in New Zealand, residents can claim the foreign tax credit against New Zealand tax to prevent double taxation. |
| Hybrid entities | An entity that is treated for tax purposes as transparent or disregarded (its income and expenditure is attributed to its owners or (in the case of payments to an owner) ignored) in the jurisdiction of its parent/investor and opaque (it is taxed as a separate entity on its income and expenditure) in the jurisdiction it is established in. This type of entity can produce double deductions and deduction/no inclusion outcomes. |
| Hybrid financial instrument (permanent) | A financial arrangement between two parties (e.g. a convertible note) that is regarded as debt in one country and equity in another. The effect of this misalignment in characterisation is that payments under the arrangement are treated as tax deductible interest to the payer and (generally) tax exempt dividends for the recipient. |
| Reverse hybrid entity | The reverse of a hybrid entity; an entity that is treated for tax purposes as transparent in its establishment jurisdiction and as opaque in the jurisdiction of its parent/investor. This type of entity has the potential to create a double non-taxation result. |
| Share lending | A transaction where the owner of a share lends that share to another person. Typically the share borrower will transfer collateral to the lender and will pay the share lender a replacement or substitute payment for any dividends rpaid on the shares during the term of the share lending arrangement (which is often very short) if applicable. Share lending has the potential to fall within the hybrid mismatch rules if the arrangement is between related parties or is a structured arrangement, is cross-border, and the two jurisdictions involved take inconsistent views of the substitute payment.<br><br>Share repos are similar transactions and can produce similar results. |
| Share repo | Similar to share lending, but this time the shares are provided as collateral for a loan from the share borrower to the share lender. A share repo differs from secured lending because the money lender can sell the shares during the term of the loan, remaining subject of course to an obligation to redeliver them. |
| Tax consolidation / loss grouping | Tax consolidation refers to the ability of related party entities to consolidate their tax returns. This can have the effect of enabling hybrid outcomes, as hybrid losses (double deductions and unbalanced deductions) can be consolidated with the ordinary income of a related entity.<br><br>Similarly, loss grouping rules allow a hybrid loss to be transferred into a related party entity that is in profit, thus reducing their taxable income. |

1.  If a country has enacted recommendation 2, the defensive response under recommendation 1 would only apply in relation to mismatches where the payee is not treated as receiving a dividend. An example is a sale of property with deferred payment, where the buyer is entitled to a deduction for deemed interest, but the seller is not taxable on that amount as ordinary income.

2.  We understand this is based on a tax treatment that applies in Malta. [↑](#footnote-ref-3)

Tax policy report: Cabinet paper - tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting

This report recommends that you authorise the attached Cabinet paper for lodgement with the Cabinet Office by 10am Thursday 20 July 2017 for the Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee to consider at its meeting on 26 July 2017. This report also recommends you agree to a change to our previously recommended hybrids measures in respect of foreign trusts.

The attached Cabinet paper provides an overview of three other Cabinet papers which seek approval for a package of measures to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) in New Zealand. The Cabinet paper also summarises the background to the other papers, highlights the most important aspects of the proposals, and discusses matters common to all three papers (including application dates, publicity, and financial implications). The other papers are:

*   BEPS – interest limitation submissions and policy decisions;
*   BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance submissions and policy decisions; and
*   BEPS – recommendations on addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements.

At the request of your office we have prepared the attached Cabinet paper in advance of the other three.  We are currently working on the other papers and will provide those to you next week.

We reported to you on the package of BEPS measures to which all four Cabinet Papers relate on 22 June 2017 (T2017/1576, IR2017/325; T2017/1577, IR 2017/330; T2017/1578, IR2017/329; T2017/1604, IR2017/353).

If you agree with the drafting of the attached Cabinet paper, we recommend you authorise it for lodgement with the Cabinet Office (together with the other 3 Cabinet papers) by 10am Thursday 20 July 2017 for consideration at the Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee meeting of 26 July 2017.

Foreign Trusts
--------------

In regards to foreign trusts, the Cabinet paper is consistent with our recent hybrids policy report (T2017/1604 / IR2017/353), but it also reflects some further policy development as well as filling in a gap in the recommendations contained in the policy report. As set out in that report, in principle we believe that New Zealand foreign trusts can result in double non-taxation due to a hybrid mismatch, where:

*   New Zealand does not tax the New Zealand trustee because the beneficiary or settlor is non-resident; and
*   the beneficiary’s or settlor’s residence country does not tax that person because the trustee is non-resident.

We now recommend amending that proposal slightly, to clarify that the New Zealand trustee should not be taxable on income so long as someone is required to include that income in their taxable income. So, for example, New Zealand should not tax an amount allocated to a beneficiary if the settlor is required to include that amount in its tax return in its own jurisdiction in that year. Similarly, we should not impose tax on unallocated income retained by the trustee if a beneficiary is required to include the amount in their tax calculation for that year. This clarification is important to avoid our proposed rules imposing two layers of tax on the trust income.

Accordingly, we recommend taxing a New Zealand trustee on foreign-sourced beneficiary income allocated to a non-resident beneficiary as if the trustee were a New Zealand resident individual taxpayer to the extent that:

*   the beneficiary is in the same control group as the trustee (many family trusts would meet this requirement);
*   the beneficiary would be taxed on the trust income if it held the trust assets directly; and
*   the income is not subject to tax as the income of any person other than the trustee (such as the beneficiary or settlor).

We also recommend taxing the New Zealand trustee of a foreign trust on foreign-sourced trustee income to the extent that:

*   the settlor is in the same control group as the trustee (again this would often be the case);
*   the settlor would be taxed on the trustee income if it held the trust assets directly; and
*   the income is not subject to tax as the income of any person other than the trustee.

In error, our policy report did not include any recommendations on trustee income (see recommendation (k)). We therefore take this opportunity to clarify that trustee income is within the scope of the proposed rules, subject to the modifications discussed above.

We recommend a de minimis, so that neither of these rules applies if the total foreign sourced income of the trustee does not exceed the greater of $10,000 and 20% of the total income of the trust.

Importantly, we do not consider any of the changes proposed here are inconsistent with the discussion between officials and Ministers at our meeting on 29 June. We are still only proposing to tax income of foreign trusts to the extent they are “reverse hybrids” and we are not proposing to impose tax on all income of trustees of foreign trusts.

Recommended action

We recommend that you:

(a) **Agree** that New Zealand should tax a New Zealand resident trustee on foreign-sourced beneficiary income allocated to a non-resident beneficiary as if the trustee were a New Zealand resident individual taxpayer to the extent that:

*   the beneficiary is in the same control group as the trustee; and
*   the beneficiary would be taxed on income from the assets giving rise to the beneficiary income if it held the assets directly; and
*   the income is not subject to tax as the income of any person other than the trustee (such as the beneficiary or settlor).

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

(b) **Agree** that New Zealand should tax a New Zealand trustee of a foreign trust on foreign-sourced trustee income to the extent that:

*   the settlor is in the same control group as the trustee;
*   the settlor would be taxed on the trustee income if it held the trust assets directly; and
*   the income is not subject to tax as the income of any person other than the trustee.

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

(c) **Agree** that a de minimis apply, so that neither of the rules in recommendation (a) and (b) applies if the total foreign sourced income of the trustee does not exceed the greater of $10,000 and 20% of the total income of the trust.

Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed

(d) **Authorise** the attached Cabinet paper for lodgement with the Cabinet Office by 10am Thursday 20 July 2017 for the Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee to consider at its meeting on 26 July 2017.

**TAX MEASURES TO PREVENT BASE EROSION AND PROFIT SHIFTING**

**Proposal**

1.  This paper provides an overview of three attached Cabinet papers seeking approval for measures to address base erosion and profit shifting in New Zealand. This paper also summarises the background to the attached papers, highlights the most important aspects of the proposals, and discusses matters common to all three papers (including application dates, publicity, and financial implications). The attached papers are:

*   BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules;
*   BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance; and
*   BEPS – addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements.

**Background**

1.  Since late 2012, there has been significant global media and political concern about evidence suggesting that some multinationals pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. Initially matters surfaced in the context of Parliamentary and Senate inquiries in the UK, US and elsewhere into the tax avoidance strategies used by multinationals. In 2013 the issue formed part of the G20 agenda who asked the OECD to report back to it on global strategies to address countries’ concerns.
2.  The OECD reported back to the G20 in July 2013 highlighting the aggressive tax practices used by multinationals to exploit gaps and mismatches in countries’ domestic tax rules to avoid tax, now known as “base erosion and profit shifting” (BEPS). They found that BEPS strategies distort investment decisions, allow multinationals to benefit from unintended competitive advantages over more compliant or domestic companies, and result in the loss of substantial corporate tax revenue. More fundamentally, the perceived unfairness resulting from BEPS jeopardises citizens’ trust in the integrity of the tax system as a whole.
3.  The end result was the adoption of a G20/OECD 15 point Action Plan recommending a combination of domestic reforms, tax treaty changes, and administrative measures that would allow countries to strengthen their laws in a consistent manner and work together in combatting BEPS. Recognising our own vulnerability to BEPS and the value of working cooperatively, New Zealand actively participated in the OECD/G20 project, which was finalised at the end of 2015.

**New Zealand’s response to BEPS**

1.  On the whole, New Zealand is fairly well placed when we assess our tax system against the OECD/G20 recommendations. However, while the majority of multinationals operating in New Zealand are compliant, there are some that adopt BEPS strategies to minimise or eliminate their New Zealand tax obligations. It is important to address these BEPS activities without reducing the general attractiveness of New Zealand as an investment destination.
2.  In June last year the Government released its own programme to address BEPS issues in New Zealand (CAB-16-MIN-0218 refers). This programme presented a measured approach that prioritises the problems observed in relation to New Zealand’s laws. At the same time, it is a coherent package of measures. Stripping the tax benefits from one type of arrangement is ineffective if multinationals can get the same benefit from switching to a different type of arrangement.
3.  In summary the Government’s package of New Zealand domestic law measures:

*   prevent multinationals from using artificially high interest rates on loans from related parties (interest limitation);
*   prevent multinationals from using artificial arrangements to avoid having a taxable presence (a permanent establishment) in New Zealand;
*   prevent multinationals from using transfer pricing payments to shift profits to their offshore group members in a manner that does not reflect the actual economic activities undertaken in New Zealand and offshore; and
*   remove the tax advantages of exploiting hybrid mismatches between different countries’ tax rules.

1.  New Zealand’s response to BEPS is generally aligned with Australia’s response. It is also broadly consistent with the OECD’s BEPS Action Plan, although the specific proposals are tailored for the New Zealand environment. Appendix One provides a table that compares New Zealand’s and Australia’s response to the OECD’s BEPS Action Plan.
2.  The detail of the BEPS proposals was subsequently set out in three Government discussion documents, which were released for public consultation in September 2016 and March 2017:

*   _BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules;_
*   _BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance;_ and
*   _Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements._

1.  Our officials have since received a significant amount of feedback on the discussion documents. Most of the submissions were from tax advisors to the affected businesses and raised concerns about uncertainty and compliance costs. We consider that these additional costs will mostly be borne by those who the measures are designed to address (taxpayers engaging in BEPS activities) and that the overall benefits to New Zealand of addressing BEPS outweigh these costs. We have used this feedback to refine the measures, so they are more certain for taxpayers and better targeted. These refinements should not reduce the overall effectiveness of the proposed measures. We consider the measures will address the BEPS issues we are concerned about.
2.  The following are what we consider to be the most important matters coming out of consultation. This is not an exhaustive list. The individual Cabinet papers accompanying this paper also discuss other significant issues raised by submitters.
3.  Finally we note the progress in relation to the OECD’s _Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS_ (also known as the multilateral instrument or MLI) signed by the Minister of Revenue on behalf of New Zealand in June. The MLI is intended to prevent our double tax agreements from being used to facilitate BEPS.

**_Main issues on BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules_**

1.  One of the easiest ways to shift profits out of New Zealand is for a foreign parent of a New Zealand subsidiary to fund the subsidiary with a loan rather than equity. This is because the interest paid to the parent is deductible to the subsidiary thereby reducing its taxable income. The specific problem we have identified is that transfer pricing rules are not effective in limiting the rate of interest that can be charged on that loan.

_Proposal on pricing related-party debt_

1.  The discussion document proposed a hard rule to limit the interest rate on related-party debt to an amount close to the parent’s cost of external borrowing - specifically an interest rate cap, based on the credit rating of the offshore parent plus a small margin. Submitters argued that this proposal could affect the interest rates of companies with only small amounts of debt (so not seen as a risk to the tax base) and could be difficult to apply if the parent has no credit rating. They were also concerned that it could produce results that were inconsistent with our tax treaties, leading to double taxation.
2.  In light of these concerns we recommend using what we have termed a “restricted transfer pricing approach” for debt. We expect that this approach will generally result in the interest rate on related-party debt being in line with that facing the foreign parent. This is because the debt would be priced under a transfer pricing methodology but (i) be carried out with a rebuttable presumption that the borrower could be expected to be supported by its foreign parent; and (ii) disregard any commercially unattractive terms used to justify an excessive interest rate.  We also intend that taxpayers be able to challenge the rate using the dispute resolution process in tax treaties. The Australian Taxation Office has recently released administrative guidelines which outline a similar approach for limiting related party interest rates (albeit Australia is implementing this approach as an operational policy, rather than a law change).

_Proposal on allowable debt levels_

1.  The second interest limitation issue relates to allowable debt levels under our thin capitalisation rules. These rules limit the quantity of debt a foreign-owned subsidiary can have (generally to 60 percent of the subsidiary’s assets). We propose to adjust what counts as “assets” by reducing them by “non-debt liabilities” (liabilities other than interest-bearing debt).
2.  While there was some support for the broad proposal, submitters were very concerned about one aspect: that the proposed change would include what are known as “deferred tax liabilities.” Accounting standards require deferred tax to be recognised in certain situations – broadly, where profits for tax and accounting purposes differ. This is a complicated issue, with some types of deferred tax liabilities having a stronger case for exclusion than others. We recommend that officials consider this matter further as part of future consultation on the detailed design of the interest limitation proposals, with Cabinet delegating us the power to make a decision.

**_Main issues on BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_**

1.  The _BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_ Cabinet paper contains measures to strengthen our transfer pricing rules, counter permanent establishment avoidance and help Inland Revenue deal with uncooperative multinationals.

_Proposal on Transfer Pricing Time Bar_

1.  The discussion document proposed extending Inland Revenue’s time bar for adjusting a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position from four to seven years. Submitters opposed this extension on the basis that it increased uncertainty and was out of step with the general time bar, which applies to other areas of tax. However, we are continuing to recommend the seven year rule. Having a longer time bar for transfer pricing cases is consistent with both Australia and Canada (who also have shorter time bars for other tax disputes) and reflects the information asymmetry that exists in transfer pricing cases (especially where taxpayers may hold relevant information offshore).

_Proposal on permanent establishment avoidance_

1.  This proposal is aimed at preventing taxpayers from structuring their affairs to avoid a taxable presence in New Zealand where one exists in substance. The OECD has updated their model tax treaty to address this issue and New Zealand is adopting this into our tax treaties by signing the OECD’s multilateral instrument. In addition to this, like Australia and the UK, we are also introducing a permanent establishment avoidance rule into our domestic law. The domestic law change is necessary to cover cases where the relevant tax treaty does not yet include the OECD’s new recommendation. Submitters were of the view that the proposed rule was too broad and would catch ordinary commercial arrangements that were not its intended target. We agree that any rule should be more narrowly targeted at avoidance arrangements and therefore recommend that officials consult further with submitters to achieve this result.

**_Main Issues on BEPS – Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements_**

1.  The _BEPS – addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements_ Cabinet paper proposes measures to remove the tax advantages of hybrid mismatch arrangements. Hybrid mismatch arrangements arise when countries classify transactions and entities differently from each other under their domestic tax laws. For example, fixed rate shares may be treated as debt in one country and shares in another, thus allowing the payment of an amount that is deductible in the payer’s country but non-assessable in the payee’s. Australia, the UK and EU member countries are taking similar actions to address BEPS from hybrid mismatches.

_Scope of the rules_

1.  The hybrids proposals in the discussion document covered the full suite of OECD recommendations in this area, even though there is limited evidence of some of the structures being used in New Zealand. Submitters therefore suggested that our rules should concentrate on the known mischief. On balance, we recommend a comprehensive adoption of the OECD recommendations on hybrid mismatch arrangements with suitable modifications for the New Zealand context. Tackling only the known structures might leave a loophole to use those that are not covered, encouraging taxpayers to move into different tax-efficient hybrids rather than converting to more conventional funding structures. A partial response also ignores the fact that some of the other structures might actually be in use, but have not been picked up by Inland Revenue audit.

_Foreign Trusts_

1.  Foreign trusts are, simply put, trusts that have a New Zealand trustee, but are set up by a non-resident (the settlor) and generally derive only foreign-sourced income. Under current settings, foreign trusts are not taxed in New Zealand, except on any New Zealand sourced income. This was confirmed as appropriate by the 2016 Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules (the Shewan Inquiry). However, the Shewan Inquiry’s conclusion was based on the existing tax settings and the hybrids project has the potential to change these settings in certain circumstances.
2.  From a tax policy perspective, foreign trusts are treated as transparent in New Zealand. New Zealand takes the view that, to the extent the income is not paid to beneficiaries more or less as earned, it should be taxed to the settlor in their home jurisdiction. By contrast, the jurisdiction of the settlor may see the trust as a separate entity and not tax the income on the mistaken assumption that the trustee is being taxed in New Zealand. When the income of the trust is not taxed anywhere in the world because of the different tax treatment the relevant countries place on the trust structure, we recommend the New Zealand trustee be subject to tax. This measure would not result in double taxation of current year trust income.
3.  We anticipate this meaning that most foreign trusts will be taxed in New Zealand on their foreign sourced income. However, it is important to note that this does not mean that they all will be. The relevant enquiry is “would the income be included in the tax calculation of the settlor in their own country if they had earned that income directly?” If the answer is “no” (and there might be numerous reasons why this would be the case, such as if the settlor is tax exempt, or in a country that does not tax residents on their worldwide income) then no New Zealand tax would be imposed. If the answer is “yes” then New Zealand tax should be imposed unless the income is included in the tax calculation of any person in the same control group (for example, the settlor or a beneficiary) in their own country in the corresponding income year.
4.  Finally, we note that taxing foreign trusts in this way was signalled when the hybrids consultation paper was released in September 2016. However, because this rule has the potential to apply to both foreign trusts and limited partnerships, and because the foreign trust industry has very recently incurred significant compliance costs associated with the recommendations of the Shewan Inquiry, we are recommending a delayed effective date to give these structures time to assess their options.

**_Application dates and transitional measures_**

1.  The measures should generally apply from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Cabinet has already noted that the reforms are expected to apply from this date (CAB-17-MIN-0164 refers). This is based on the expectation that the legislation will be progressed to enactment before this date.
2.  The new administrative powers for Inland Revenue to deal with uncooperative multinationals should apply from the date the legislation is enacted. We also propose different application dates for two of the specific hybrid mismatch proposals. We recommend the unstructured imported mismatch rule (explained more fully in the attached BEPS – addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements Cabinet paper) apply from 1 January 2020 and the reverse hybrid measures (generally expected to apply to limited partnerships and foreign trusts) apply for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2019.
3.  We do not recommend any additional transitional relief from the measures, except:

*   relief from the hybrids measures for certain hybrid financial instruments issued to the public before 6 September 2016 (the date on which the hybrids discussion document was released); and
*   relief from the transfer pricing and interest limitation measures for arrangements subject to an advance pricing agreement entered into before 1 July 2018. (An advance pricing agreement is a binding ruling from Inland Revenue that confirms that the taxpayer’s planned transfer pricing positions are compliant with the transfer pricing rules for up to five years.)

**Consultation**

1.  Officials consulted widely on the measures in the attached papers. Discussion documents were released for public feedback on the relevant topics (referred to in paragraph 8 above). For the hybrids proposals, given the earlier release of that discussion document, officials have undertaken a further round of consultation on the details of the proposals with interested stakeholders. Inland Revenue and Treasury officials have also consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. In addition, officials have discussed some of the measures with their counterparts in the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Treasury and the OECD secretariat.

**_General feedback on measures_**

1.  Submitters generally acknowledged the importance of addressing BEPS risks facing New Zealand and agreed in principle that change is needed to strengthen the current rules. However, they did raise issues with certain features of the proposed measures and made suggestions to make them more workable and better targeted. We have incorporated many of these suggestions into the measures on which we now seek Cabinet approval.

**_Feedback on economic impact_**

1.  Some submitters argued that the proposals will have a detrimental effect on New Zealand being an attractive investment destination and should not be implemented. They also argued that the proposed measures were complex and onerous, and may induce foreign companies to remove their existing personnel from New Zealand.
2.  It is true that there will be additional tax and compliance costs for some investors but these are necessary to address the issues. We have used consultation to refine the proposals, minimise unintended impacts and better target the BEPS concerns. This should reduce the additional compliance costs, although it will not eliminate them. The higher tax payments resulting from these measures will inevitably make New Zealand a less attractive investment location for multinationals engaged in BEPS arrangements. At the same time, these multinationals should not be allowed to exploit weaknesses in our tax rules to achieve a competitive advantage over more compliant multinationals or domestic firms. Furthermore, arbitrary reductions in tax, depending upon the opportunism of taxpayers, are likely to distort the allocation of investment into New Zealand. New Zealand is also undertaking these BEPS measures in line with a number of like-minded partners throughout the OECD and the expected tax revenue increase is expected to be relatively small. Given this, we believe any impacts on foreign direct investment into New Zealand will not be material and implementing these measures remains in New Zealand’s best economic interests.

**_Feedback on application date_**

1.  The discussion documents did not indicate a likely application date. However, some submitters expected the Government to seek an early application date and argued that it would be better to allow taxpayers time to consider the proposals and rearrange their affairs if necessary.
2.  We expect to receive more submissions on, and opposition to, the application date once affected parties become aware it is proposed to be 1 July 2018.

**_Further consultation_**

1.  Following Cabinet decisions on these papers, we recommend Inland Revenue and Treasury officials engage in further targeted consultation on outstanding policy issues and technical design details relating to the measures. Due the timing constraints necessary for a 1 July 2018 application date, we are not proposing that submitters be consulted on an exposure draft of the entire bill before the bill is introduced to Parliament. However, we recommend targeted consultation of specific sections where additional consultation will provide the most value ahead of the bill’s introduction.

**Financial implications**

1.  Some of the revenue for these proposals has already been included in Budget 2017 forecasts. These are:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | $m – increase/(decrease) |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| **Vote Revenue** | **2016/17** | **2017/18** | **2018/19** | **2019/20** | **2020/21** | **2021/22** | **2022/23 & Outyears** |
| Foreign hybrid entity double deductions | \-  | \-  | 25.000 | 50.000 | 50.000 | 50.000 | 50.000 |
| BEPS taxation bill | \-  | \-  | 25.000 | 50.000 | 50.000 | 50.000 | 50.000 |
| **Total Revenue effect** | \-  | \-  | 50.000 | 100.000 | 100.000 | 100.000 | 100.000 |

1.  If our recommendations in these Cabinet papers are agreed and adopted by the Government, then the forecasts would be adjusted upward by these additional amounts:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | $m – increase/(decrease) |     |     |     |     |     |
| **Vote Revenue**<br><br>**Minister of Revenue** | **2017/18** | **2018/19** | **2019/20** | **2020/21** | **2021/22** | **2022/23 & Outyears** |
| Grand-parenting of certain hybrids issued to the public | **\-** | 19.000 | 19.000 | 19.000 | 14.000 | **\-** |
| Other BEPS measures | \-  | 45.000 | 90.000 | 90.000 | 90.000 | 90.000 |
| **Total Revenue effect** | \-  | 64.000 | 109.000 | 109.000 | 104.000 | 90.000 |

1.  The additional revenue from the hybrids measures results from our proposed grand- parenting approach for hybrid financial instruments issued to the public before 6 September 2016. This revenue is contingent on taxpayer behaviour after the implementation of the hybrid rules.
2.  We are recommending that officials continue to consult on details of how deferred tax liabilities and assets should be dealt with under the interest limitation measures - specifically, the measure to eliminate assets funded by non-debt liabilities from a taxpayer’s total assets for thin capitalisation purposes. The above fiscal impact assumes deferred tax liabilities are included in the non-debt liabilities adjustments (as per the proposal in the discussion document). If these assets and liabilities were excluded from the adjustments the revenue forecast would be $10 million per year lower. In the attached paper on interest limitation we are asking Cabinet to delegate to us the authority to make a decision on this along with an authority to update the relevant revenue forecasts, if necessary.
3.  The revenue in paragraph 37 was treated as a saving in Budget 2017. We propose the additional revenue in paragraph 38 be treated as a saving in Budget 2018.

**Administrative impacts**

1.  The changes proposed in the BEPS discussion documents and recommended in these Cabinet papers are not expected to increase administrative costs or require any significant systems changes for Inland Revenue. This is because the reforms largely change the way some taxpayers self-assess the income and deductions that they report to Inland Revenue. Further, the administrative amendments we are recommending should make it easier for Inland Revenue to deal with uncooperative multinationals.
2.  We note, however, that a common theme in submissions on all three discussion documents was that administration of the proposals would place a higher demand on Inland Revenue’s audit and investigation functions. Our view is that any required increase in Inland Revenue’s resourcing as a result of the BEPS package will be accommodated within existing baselines.

**Human rights**

1.  There are no human rights implications arising from the measures.

**Legislative implications**

1.  Legislative changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 will be required to implement the proposed measures. To achieve this, we intend to include the measures in a BEPS taxation bill introduced after the General Election. The BEPS bill will need to be introduced and have its first reading by 14 December 2017 in order to be enacted in time for the planned 1 July 2018 application date.

**Impact Analysis Requirements**

1.  There are no regulatory implications arising directly from this Cabinet paper.
2.  The regulatory impact analysis for each set of measures is set out in the Cabinet paper for those measures.

**Publicity**

1.  We will arrange for an appropriate announcement of the policy decisions on these BEPS measures.
2.  We also recommend that the Government proactively release the BEPS Cabinet papers, policy reports and submissions on the BEPS discussion documents and the issues paper on the multilateral instrument (including the pre-Budget 2017 policy report and Cabinet paper (T2017/949, IR2017/237)). This could be done when we announce the package. Given their inevitable release under the Official Information Act in any event, releasing these documents proactively will promote transparency around the policy process to the public, rather than just individual requestors. It would also be consistent with the approach taken for previous BEPS Cabinet papers.

**Recommendations**

1.  We recommend that the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee:

1.  **Note** we have developed and consulted on a package of measures to counter certain base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) activities we are concerned about in New Zealand. In summary, the measures in the package:

*   prevent multinationals from using artificially high interest rates on loans from related parties (interest limitation);
*   prevent multinationals from using artificial arrangements to avoid having a taxable presence (a permanent establishment) in New Zealand;
*   prevent multinationals from using transfer pricing payments to shift profits to their offshore group members in a manner that does not reflect the actual economic activities undertaken in New Zealand and offshore; and
*   remove the tax advantages of exploiting hybrid mismatches between different country’s tax rules.

1.  **Note** the attached three Cabinet papers seek Cabinet approval to introduce these BEPS measures.
2.  **Agree** that work progresses along the indicative timeline, where we plan to introduce a BEPS taxation bill by the end of this year, and enact the bill by 1 July 2018.
3.  **Agree** that the measures should apply from income years starting on or after 1 July 2018, apart from:

*   The new administrative powers for Inland Revenue to deal with uncooperative multinationals should apply from the date the legislation is enacted;
*   the hybrids unstructured imported mismatch measure, which should apply from 1 January 2020; and
*   the reverse hybrid measures (generally expected to apply in relation to limited partnerships and foreign trusts), which should apply for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2019.

1.  **Agree** that there should be transitional relief from the measures:

*   in relation to the hybrid measures, relief for hybrid financial instruments issued to the public before 6 September 2016; and
*   in relation to the transfer pricing and interest limitation measures, relief for arrangements subject to an advance pricing agreement entered into before 1 July 2018.

1.  **Note** the original BEPS revenue that was forecast in April:  
    

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

1.  **Note** the following changes as a result of the decisions in recommendations 1 to 5 above, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

| **Total Revenue effect** | \-  | 64.000 | 109.000 | 109.000 | 104.000 | 90.000 |

1.  **Note** the attached paper on interest seeks delegated authority for the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue to make a decision on the treatment of deferred tax liabilities which includes authority to reduce the revenue forecast by $10 million per year.
2.  **Note** that forecast BEPS revenue in recommendation 6 above was treated as savings in Budget 2017.  
    
3.  **Agree** that the additional revenue in recommendation 7 be treated as savings in Budget 2018 (total to be confirmed after the decision on the treatment of deferred tax liabilities which could reduce the revenue forecast by $10 million per year).
4.  **Agree** that Inland Revenue and the Treasury undertake further targeted consultation on outstanding policy issues, technical design details and selected parts of an exposure draft of the planned BEPS bill in relation to the measures.
5.  **Agree** to proactively release the Cabinet papers, policy reports and submissions for the BEPS discussion documents and the issues paper for the multilateral instrument.

| **Action Report** | **OECD recommendation** | **Current law** | **NZ response to OECD recommendations** | **Australian response to OECD recommendations** |
| **12 – Require taxpayers to disclose their aggressive tax planning arrangements to revenue authorities** | Recommendations regarding the design of domestic disclosure rules. | For both NZ and Australia, no requirement under current law to disclose aggressive tax planning arrangements, however the combination of our strong anti-avoidance laws and the binding rulings and penalties regimes incentivise disclosure. | No law reform planned but existing law incentivises disclosure. Taxpayers will often apply for binding rulings on potentially aggressive transactions to obtain certainty as to the tax treatment – especially in light of our strong anti-avoidance law. Penalties on aggressive transactions are reduced for early disclosure of the arrangement. | **Different to New Zealand.** While Australia has a rulings regime and reductions in penalties for voluntary disclosure, the Australian Treasury is also consulting on whether to adopt the OECD proposals for mandatory disclosure of tax information. Submissions closed on 15 July 2016. Australia also recently implemented transparency measures allowing the ATO to publish the taxable income and income tax liabilities of large companies. |
| **13 – Re-examine transfer pricing documentation** | Changes to OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and recommendations regarding the design of domestic rules, including country-by-country (CbC) reporting. | NZ and Australia currently apply the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, but do not have a formal programme for automatic exchange of transfer pricing documentation. | Inland Revenue is implementing CbC reporting. NZ has signed the multilateral agreement on exchanging CbC reports with other tax authorities.

In Confidence Office of the Minister of Finance Office of the Minister of Revenue Eco nomic Growth and Infrastructure Committee TAX MEASURES TO PREVENT BASE EROSION AND PROFIT SHIFTING Proposal 1.This paper provides an overview of three attached C abinet papers seeking approval for measures to address base erosion and profit shifting in New Zealand. This paper also summarises the background to the attached papers, highlights the most important aspects of the proposals, and discusses matters common to all three papers ( including application dates, publicity, and financial implications). The attached papers are: •BE PS – strengthening our interest limitation rules; •BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance; and •BEPS – addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements. Bac kground 2.Si nce late 2012, there has been significant global media and political concern about evidence suggesting that some multinationals pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. Initially matters surfaced in the context of Parliamentary and Senate inquiries in the UK, US and elsewhere into the tax avoidance strategies used by multinationals. In 2013 the issue formed part of the G20 agenda who asked the OECD to report back to it on global strategies to address countries’ concerns. 3.The OECD reported back to the G20 in July 2013 highlighting the aggressive tax practices used by multinationals to exploit gaps and mismatches in countries’ domestic tax rules to avoid tax, now known as “b ase erosion and profit shifting” (BEPS). They found that BEPS strategies distort invest ment decisio ns, allo w mult inat ionals to benefit fro m unintended competitive advantages over more compliant or domestic companies, and result in the loss of substantial corporate tax revenue. More fundamentally, the perceived unfairness resulting from BEPS jeopardises citizens’ trust in the integrity of the tax system as a whole. 4.Th e end result was the adoption of a G20/OECD 15 point Action Plan recommending a combination of do mestic reforms, tax treaty changes, and administrative measures that would allow countries to strengthen their laws in a consistent manner and work together in combatting BEPS. Recognising our own vulnerability to BEPS and the value of working cooperatively, New Zealand actively participated in the OECD/G20 project, which was finalised at the end of 2015. BEPS documents release - August 2017: #13 2 New Zealand’s response to BEPS 5. On the whole, New Zealand is fairly well placed when we assess our tax system against the OECD/G20 recommendations. However, while the majority of multinationals operating in New Zealand are compliant, there are some that adopt BEPS strategies to minimise or eliminate their New Zealand tax obligations. It is important to address these BEPS activities without reducing the general attractiveness of New Zealand as an investment destination. 6. In June last year the Government released its own programme to address BEPS issues in New Zealand (CAB-16-MIN-0218 refers). This programme presented a measured approach that prioritises the problems observed in relation to New Zealand’s laws. At the same time, it is a coherent package of measures. Stripping the tax benefits from one type of arrangement is ineffective if multinationals can get the same benefit from switching to a different type of arrangement. 7. In summary the Government’s package of New Zealand domestic law measures: • prevent multinationals from using artificially high interest rates on loans fro m related parties (interest limitation); • prevent multinationals from using artificial arrangements to avoid having a taxable presence (a permanent establishment) in New Zealand; • prevent multinationals from using transfer pricing payments to shift profits to their offshore group members in a manner that does not reflect the actual economic activities undertaken in New Zealand and offshore; and • remove the tax advantages of exploiting hybrid mismatches between different countries’ tax rules. 8. New Zealand’s response to BEPS is generally aligned with Australia’s response. It is also broadly consistent with the OECD’s BEPS Act ion Plan, although the specific proposals are tailored for the New Zealand environment. Appendix One provides a table that compares New Zealand’s and Australia’s response to the OECD’s BEPS Action Plan. 9. The detail of the BEPS proposals was subsequently set out in three Government discussio n documents, which were released for public consultation in September 2016 and March 2017: • BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules; • BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance; and • Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements. 10. Our officials have since received a significant amount of feedback on the discussion documents. Most of the submissions were from tax advisors to the affected businesses and raised concerns about uncertainty and compliance costs. We consider that these additional costs will mostly be borne by those who the measures are designed to address (taxpayers engaging in BEPS activities) and that the overall benefits to New Zealand of addressing BEPS outweigh these costs. We have used this feedback to refine the measures, so they are more certain for taxpayers and better targeted. These refinements should not reduce the overall effectiveness of the proposed measures. We consider the measures will address the BEPS issues we are concerned about. 3 11. The following are what we consider to be the most important matters coming out of consultation. This is not an exhaustive list. The individual Cabinet papers accompanying this paper also discuss other significant issues raised by submitters. 12. Finally we note the progress in relation to the OECD’s Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS (also known as the multilateral instrument or MLI) signed by the Minister of Revenue on behalf of New Zealand in June. The MLI is intended to prevent our double tax agreements from being used to facilitate BEPS. Main issues on BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules 13. One of the easiest ways to shift profits out of New Zealand is for a foreign parent of a New Zealand subsidiary to fund the subsidiary with a loan rather than equity. This is because the interest paid to the parent is deductible to the subsidiary thereby reducing its taxable income. The specific problem we have identified is that transfer pricing rules are not effective in limiting the rate of interest that can be charged on that loan. Proposal on pricing related-party debt 14. The discussion document proposed a hard rule to limit the interest rate on related-party debt to an amount close to the parent’s cost of external borrowing - specifically an interest rate cap, based on the credit rating of the offshore parent plus a small margin. Submitters argued that this proposal could affect the interest rates of companies with only small amounts of debt (so not seen as a risk to the tax base) and could be difficult to apply if the parent has no credit rating. They were also concerned that it could produce results that were inconsistent with our tax treaties, leading to double taxation. 15. In light of these concerns we recommend using what we have termed a “restricted transfer pricing approach” for debt. We expect that this approach will generally result in the interest rate on related-party debt being in line with that facing the foreign parent. This is because the debt would be priced under a transfer pricing methodology but (i) be carried out with a rebuttable presumption that the borrower could be expected to be supported by its foreign parent; and (ii) disregard any commercially unattractive terms used to justify an excessive interest rate. We also intend that taxpayers be able to challenge the rate using the dispute resolution process in tax treaties. The Australian Taxation Office has recently released administrative guidelines which outline a similar approach for limiting related party interest rates (albeit Australia is implementing this approach as an operational policy, rather than a law change). Proposal on allowable debt levels 16. The second interest limitation issue relates to allowable debt levels under our thin capitalisat ion rules. These rules limit the quantity of debt a foreign-owned subsidiary can have (generally to 60 percent of the subsidiary’s assets). We propose to adjust what counts as “assets” by reducing them by “non-debt liabilities” (liabilities other than interest-bearing debt). 17. While there was so me support for the broad proposal, submitters were very concerned about one aspect: that the proposed change would include what are known as “deferred tax liabilities.” Accounting standards require deferred tax to be recognised in certain situations – broadly, where profits for tax and accounting purposes differ. This is a complicated issue, with some types of deferred tax liabilities having a stronger case for exclusion than others. 4 We recommend that officials consider this matter further as part of future consultation on the detailed design of the interest limitation proposals, with Cabinet delegating us the power to make a decision. Main issues on BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance 18. The BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance Cabinet paper contains measures to strengthen our transfer pricing rules, counter permanent establishment avoidance and help Inland Revenue deal with uncooperative multinationals. Proposal on Transfer Pricing Time Bar 19. The discussion document proposed extending Inland Revenue’s time bar for adjusting a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position from four to seven years. Submitters opposed this extension on the basis that it increased uncertainty and was out of step with the general time bar, which applies to other areas of tax. However, we are continuing to recommend the seven year rule. Having a longer time bar for transfer pricing cases is consistent with both Australia and Canada (who also have shorter time bars for other tax disputes) and reflects the information asymmetry that exists in transfer pricing cases (especially where taxpayers may hold relevant information offshore). Proposal on permanent establishment avoidance 20. This proposal is aimed at preventing taxpayers from structuring their affairs to avoid a taxable presence in New Zealand where one exists in substance. The OECD has updated their model tax treaty to address this issue and New Zealand is adopting this into our tax treaties by signing the OECD’s mult ilat eral instrument. In addition to this, like Australia and the UK, we are also introducing a permanent establishment avoidance rule into our domestic law. The domestic law change is necessary to cover cases where the relevant tax treaty does not yet include the OECD’s new recommendation. Submitters were of the view that the proposed rule was too broad and would catch ordinary commercial arrangements that were not its intended target. We agree that any rule should be more narrowly targeted at avoidance arrangements and therefore recommend that officials consult further with submitters to achieve this result. Main Issues on BEPS – Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements 21. The BEPS – addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements Cabinet paper proposes measures to remove the tax advantages of hybrid mismatch arrangements. Hybrid mismatch arrangements arise when countries classify transactions and entities differently from each other under their domest ic tax laws. For example, fixed rate shares may be treated as debt in one country and shares in another, thus allowing the payment of an amount that is deductible in the payer’s country but non-assessable in the payee’s. Australia, the UK and EU member countries are taking similar actions to address BEPS from hybrid mismatches. Scope of the rules 22. The hybrids proposals in the discussion document covered the full suite of OECD recommendations in this area, even though there is limited evidence of some of the structures being used in New Zealand. Submitters therefore suggested that our rules should concentrate on the known mischief. On balance, we recommend a comprehensive adoption of the OECD recommendations on hybrid mismatch arrangements with suitable modifications for the New 5 Zealand context. Tackling only the known structures might leave a loophole to use those that are not covered, encouraging taxpayers to move into different tax-efficient hybrids rather than converting to more conventional funding structures. A partial response also ignores the fact that some of the other structures might actually be in use, but have not been picked up by Inland Revenue audit. Foreign Trusts 23. Foreign trusts are, simply put, trusts that have a New Zealand trustee, but are set up by a non-resident (the settlor) and generally derive only foreign-sourced income. Under current settings, foreign trusts are not taxed in New Zealand, except on any New Zealand sourced inco me. This was confirmed as appropriate by the 2016 Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules (the Shewan Inquiry). However, the Shewan Inquiry’s conclusion was based on the existing tax settings and the hybrids project has the potential to change these settings in certain circumstances. 24. From a tax policy perspective, foreign trusts are treated as transparent in New Zealand. New Zealand takes the view that, to the extent the income is not paid to beneficiaries more or less as earned, it should be taxed to the settlor in their home jurisdiction. By contrast, the jurisdiction of the settlor may see the trust as a separate entity and not tax the income on the mistaken assumption that the trustee is being taxed in New Zealand. When the income of the trust is not taxed anywhere in the world because of the different tax treatment the relevant countries place on the trust structure, we recommend the New Zealand trustee be subject to tax. This measure would not result in double taxation of current year trust income. 25. We anticipate this meaning that most foreign trusts will be taxed in New Zealand on their foreign sourced inco me. However, it is important to note that this does not mean that they all will be. The relevant enquiry is “would the income be included in the tax calculation of the settlor in their own country if they had earned that income directly?” If the answer is “no” (and there might be numerous reasons why this would be the case, such as if the settlor is tax exempt, or in a country that does not tax residents on their worldwide income) then no New Zealand tax would be imposed. If the answer is “yes” then New Zealand tax should be imposed unless the income is included in the tax calculation of any person in the same control group (for example, the settlor or a beneficiary) in their own country in the corresponding income year. 26. Finally, we note that taxing foreign trusts in this way was signalled when the hybrids consultation paper was released in September 2016. However, because this rule has the potential to apply to both foreign trusts and limited partnerships, and because the foreign trust industry has very recently incurred significant compliance costs associated with the recommendations of the Shewan Inquiry, we are recommending a delayed effective date to give these structures time to assess their options. Application dates and transitional measures 27. The measures should generally apply from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Cabinet has already noted that the reforms are expected to apply fro m this date (CAB- 17-MIN-0164 refers). This is based on the expectation that the legislation will be progressed to enactment before this date. 28. The new administrative powers for Inland Revenue to deal with uncooperative mult inat ionals should apply fro m the date the legislation is enacted. We also propose different 6 application dates for two of the specific hybrid mismatch proposals. We recommend the unstructured imported mismatch rule (explained more fully in the attached BEPS – addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements Cabinet paper) apply fro m 1 January 2020 and the reverse hybrid measures (generally expected to apply to limited partnerships and foreign trusts) apply for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2019. 29. We do not recommend any addit io nal transitional relief from the measures, except: • relief from the hybrids measures for certain hybrid financial instruments issued to the public before 6 September 2016 (the date on which the hybrids discussion document was released); and • relief from the transfer pricing and interest limitation measures for arrangements subject to an advance pricing agreement entered into before 1 July 2018. (An advance pricing agreement is a binding ruling from Inland Revenue that confirms that the taxpayer’s planned transfer pricing positions are compliant with the transfer pricing rules for up to five years.) Consultation 30. Officials consulted widely on the measures in the attached papers. Discussion documents were released for public feedback on the relevant topics (referred to in paragraph 8 above). For the hybrids proposals, given the earlier release of that discussion document, officials have undertaken a further round of consultation on the details of the proposals with interested stakeholders. Inland Revenue and Treasury officials have also consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Emplo yment. In addition, officials have discussed some of the measures wit h their counterparts in the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Treasury and the OECD secretariat. General feedback on measures 31. Submitters generally acknowledged the importance of addressing BEPS risks facing New Zealand and agreed in principle that change is needed to strengthen the current rules. However, they did raise issues with certain features of the proposed measures and made suggestions to make them more workable and better targeted. We have incorporated many of these suggestions into the measures on which we now seek Cabinet approval. Feedback on economic impact 32. Some submitters argued that the proposals will have a detrimental effect on New Zealand being an attractive investment destination and should not be implemented. They also argued that the proposed measures were complex and onerous, and may induce foreig n companies to remove their existing personnel from New Zealand. 33. It is true that there will be additional tax and compliance costs for some investors but these are necessary to address the issues. We have used consultation to refine the proposals, minimise unintended impacts and better target the BEPS concerns. This should reduce the additional compliance costs, although it will not eliminate them. The higher tax payments resulting from these measures will inevitably make New Zealand a less attractive investment location for multinationals engaged in BEPS arrangements. At the same time, these 7 multinationals should not be allowed to exploit weaknesses in our tax rules to achieve a competitive advantage over more compliant multinationals or domestic firms. Furthermore, arbitrary reductions in tax, depending upon the opportunism of taxpayers, are likely to distort the allocation of investment into New Zealand. New Zealand is also undertaking these BEPS measures in line with a number of like-minded partners throughout the OECD and the expected tax revenue increase is expected to be relatively small. Given this, we believe any impacts on foreign direct investment into New Zealand will not be material and implementing these measures remains in New Zealand’s best economic interests. Feedback on application date 34. The discussion documents did not indicate a likely application date. However, some submitters expected the Government to seek an early application date and argued that it would be better to allow taxpayers time to consider the proposals and rearrange their affairs if necessary. 35. We expect to receive more submissions on, and opposition to, the application date once affected parties become aware it is proposed to be 1 July 2018. Further consultation 36. Following Cabinet decisions on these papers, we recommend Inland Revenue and Treasury officials engage in further targeted consultation on outstanding policy issues and technical design details relating to the measures. Due the timing constraints necessary for a 1 July 2018 application date, we are not proposing that submitters be consulted on an exposure draft of the entire bill before the bill is introduced to Parliament. However, we recommend targeted consultation of specific sections where addit ional consultation will provide the most value ahead of the bill’s introduction. Financial implications 37. Some of the revenue for these proposals has already been included in Budget 2017 forecasts. These are: $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue 2016/17 2017/18 2018/19 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 & Outyears Foreign hybrid entity double deductions - - 25.000 50.000 50.000 50.000 50.000 BEPS taxation bill - - 25.000 50.000 50.000 50.000 50.000 Total Revenue effect - - 50.000 100.000 100.000 100.000 100.000 38. If our recommendations in these Cabinet papers are agreed and adopted by the Government, then the forecasts would be adjusted upward by these addit ional amounts: 8 $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2017/18 2018/19 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 & Outyears Grand-parenting of certain hybrids issued to the public - 19.000 19.000 19.000 14.000 - Other BEPS measures - 45.000 90.000 90.000 90.000 90.000 Total Revenue effect - 64.000 109.000 109.000 104.000 90.000 39. The additional revenue from the hybrids measures results from our proposed grand- parenting approach for hybrid financial instruments issued to the public before 6 September 2016. This revenue is contingent on taxpayer behaviour after the implementation of the hybrid rules. 40. We are recommending that officials continue to consult on details of how deferred tax liabilities and assets should be dealt with under the interest limitation measures - specifically, the measure to eliminate assets funded by non-debt liabilities from a taxpayer’s total assets for thin capitalisation purposes. The above fiscal impact assumes deferred tax liabilities are included in the non-debt liabilities adjustments (as per the proposal in the discussion document). If these assets and liabilities were excluded from the adjustments the revenue forecast would be $10 million per year lower. In the attached paper on interest limitat ion we are asking Cabinet to delegate to us the authority to make a decision on this alo ng wit h an authority to update the relevant revenue forecasts, if necessary. 41. The revenue in paragraph 37 was treated as a saving in Budget 2017. We propose the additional revenue in paragraph 38 be treated as a saving in Budget 2018. Administrative impacts 42. The changes proposed in the BEPS discussion documents and recommended in these Cabinet papers are not expected to increase administrative costs or require any significant systems changes for Inland Revenue. This is because the reforms largely change the way some taxpayers self-assess the income and deductions that they report to Inland Revenue. Further, the administrative amendments we are recommending should make it easier for Inland Revenue to deal with uncooperative multinationals. 43. We note, however, that a common theme in submissions on all three discussion documents was that administration of the proposals would place a higher demand on Inland Revenue’s audit and investigation functions. Our view is that any required increase in Inland Revenue’s resourcing as a result of the BEPS package will be accommodated within existing baselines. Human rights 44. There are no human rights implications arising from the measures. 9 Legislative implications 45. Legislative changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 will be required to implement the proposed measures. To achieve this, we intend to include the measures in a BEPS taxation bill introduced after the General Election. The BEPS bill will need to be introduced and have its first reading by 14 December 2017 in order to be enacted in time for the planned 1 July 2018 application date. Impact Analysis Requirements 46. There are no regulatory implications arising direct ly fro m this Cabinet paper. 47. The regulatory impact analysis for each set of measures is set out in the Cabinet paper for those measures. Publicity 48. We will arrange for an appropriate announcement of the policy decisions on these BEPS measures. 49. We also recommend that the Government proactively release the BEPS Cabinet papers, policy reports and submissions on the BEPS discussion documents and the issues paper on the multilateral instrument (including the pre-Budget 2017 policy report and Cabinet paper (T2017/949, IR2017/237)). This could be done when we announce the package. Given their inevitable release under the Official Information Act in any event, releasing these documents proactively will promote transparency around the policy process to the public, rather than just individual requestors. It would also be consistent with the approach taken for previous BEPS Cabinet papers. Recommendations 50. We recommend that the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee: 1. Note we have developed and consulted on a package of measures to counter certain base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) activities we are concerned about in New Zealand. In summary, the measures in the package: • prevent multinationals from using artificially high interest rates on loans from related parties (interest limitation); • prevent multinationals from using artificial arrangements to avoid having a taxable presence (a permanent establishment) in New Zealand; • prevent multinationals from using transfer pricing payments to shift profits to their offshore group members in a manner that does not reflect the actual economic activities undertaken in New Zealand and offshore; and • remove the tax advantages of exploiting hybrid mismatches between different country’s tax rules. 10 2. Note the attached three Cabinet papers seek Cabinet approval to introduce these BEPS measures. 3. Agree that work progresses along the indicative timeline, where we plan to introduce a BEPS taxation bill by the end of this year, and enact the bill by 1 July 2018. 4. Agree that the measures should apply from income years starting on or after 1 July 2018, apart from: • The new administrative powers for Inland Revenue to deal with uncooperative multinationals should apply from the date the legislation is enacted; • the hybrids unstructured imported mismatch measure, which should apply fro m 1 January 2020; and • the reverse hybrid measures (generally expected to apply in relation to limited partnerships and foreign trusts), which should apply for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2019. 5. Agree that there should be transit ional relief fro m the measures: • in relation to the hybrid measures, relief for hybrid financial instruments issued to the public before 6 September 2016; and • in relation to the transfer pricing and interest limitation measures, relief for arrangements subject to an advance pricing agreement entered into before 1 July 2018. 6. Note the original BEPS revenue that was forecast in April: $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue 2016/17 2017/18 2018/19 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 & Outyears Foreign hybrid entity double deductions - - 25.000 50.000 50.000 50.000 50.000 BEPS taxation bill - - 25.000 50.000 50.000 50.000 50.000 Total Revenue effect - - 50.000 100.000 100.000 100.000 100.000 11 7. Note the following changes as a result of the decisions in recommendations 1 to 5 above, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance: $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2017/18 2018/19 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 & Outyears Tax Revenue: BEPS taxation bill - 64.000 109.000 109.000 104.000 90.000 Total Revenue effect - 64.000 109.000 109.000 104.000 90.000 8. Note the attached paper on interest seeks delegated authority for the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue to make a decision on the treatment of deferred tax liabilities which includes authority to reduce the revenue forecast by $10 million per year. 9. Note that forecast BEPS revenue in recommendation 6 above was treated as savings in Budget 2017. 10. Agree that the additional revenue in recommendation 7 be treated as savings in Budget 2018 (total to be confirmed after the decision on the treatment of deferred tax liabilities which could reduce the revenue forecast by $10 million per year). 11. Agree that Inland Revenue and the Treasury undertake further targeted consultation on outstanding policy issues, technical design details and selected parts of an exposure draft of the planned BEPS bill in relation to the measures. 12. Agree to proactively release the Cabinet papers, policy reports and submissions for the BEPS discussion documents and the issues paper for the multilateral instrument. Authorised for lodgement Hon Steven Joyce Minister of Finance Hon Judith Collins Minister of Revenue Appendix One: Comparison of Australia’s and New Zealand’s response to the OECD’s BEPS Action Plan Action Report OECD recommendation Current law NZ response to OECD recommendations Australian response to OECD recommendations 1 – Address the tax challenges of the digital economy Report identified issues raised by the digital economy and possible actions to address them. Did not generally recommend fundamental changes to international tax framework. Generally robust and consistent with current international tax norms. New Zealand imposed GST on online services. GST imposed on supplies occurring on or after 1 October 2016. Same response as New Zealand. Australia to impose GST on online services. GST imposed on supplies occurring on or after 1 July 2017. 2 – Neutralise the effects of hybrid mismatch arrangements Recommended domestic hybrid mismatch rules. Changes to the OECD Model Tax Convention and multilateral instrument (MLI) to address hybrid entities. Domestic law and Double Tax Agreements (DTAs) already contain some targeted anti-hybrid mismatch rules. New Zealand proposing comprehensive domestic hybrid mismatch rules based on OECD recommendations. Public consultation in 2016/17. Legislation for domestic rules to be introduced late 2017/early 2018. NZ has adopted MLI hybrid provisions to strengthen DTAs. Consulted on the MLI in March 2017. NZ signed the MLI on 7 June 2017. Ratification of the MLI will follow. Same response as New Zealand. Australia proposing comprehensive domestic hybrid mismatch rules based on OECD recommendations. However, we understand Australia is not adopting hybrids recommendation 5 (reverse hybrids) while we are proposing that New Zealand adopt this. Public consultation in 2015/16. Domestic law changes to take effect from 1 January 2018 or six months after legislation is enacted. Draft legislation expected to be consulted on shortly. Australia has also adopted MLI hybrid provisions to strengthen DTAs. Consulted on MLI in December 2016. Australia signed the MLI on 7 June 2017. Ratification of the MLI will follow. 13 Action Report OECD recommendation Current law NZ response to OECD recommendations Australian response to OECD recommendations 3 – Strengthen Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) rules Recommendations regarding the design of domestic rules NZ and Australian CFC rules are already consistent with OECD recommendations. No proposal to change CFC rules. Same response as New Zealand. No proposal to change CFC rules. 4 – Limit base erosion via interest deductions and other financial payments Recommended interest limitation using an EBITDA approach. New Zealand and Australia both have an asset-based thin capitalisation test to control quantity of debt, which the OECD also recommends. Transfer pricing has limited ability to control high-priced debt. New Zealand is improving its thin capitalisation rules by limiting interest rates on related party debt having particular regard to the interest rate of the foreign parent, and an adjustment for so-called “non-debt liabilities”. Consulted on interest limitation rules in March 2017. Legislation planned for 2017/18. Similar response to New Zealand. Australia has already tightened its transfer pricing rules. Since the New Zealand discussion document was published the ATO has released administrative guidelines (in draft) on what arrangements are considered low risk and close alignment with the interest rate of the foreign parent is an important factor. Both these changes will help it challenge high interest rates on related-party debt. New Zealand is proposing the same rules as Australia in relation to the adjustment for non-debt liabilities. Australia already requires an adjustment for non-debt liabilities. 5 – Counter harmful tax practices more effectively, taking into account transparency and substance Finalise review of member country regimes. Expand participation to non-OECD members and revision of existing criteria. NZ’s and Australia’s laws are already robust – no harmful tax practices identified. NZ complies with requirements to exchange binding rulings and advanced pricing agreements as recommended by OECD. Same response as New Zealand. Australia complies with requirements to exchange binding rulings and advanced pricing agreements as recommended by OECD. 14 Action Report OECD recommendation Current law NZ response to OECD recommendations Australian response to OECD recommendations 6 – Prevent treaty abuse Changes to the OECD Model Tax Convention and changes to DTAs through MLI to insert a general anti- avoidance provision called a “principal purpose test” (PPT). NZ’s and Australia’s anti- avoidance law is generally strong, but MLI presents opportunity to further strengthen. NZ to adopt PPT through signing the MLI. Consulted on MLI in March 2017. NZ signed the MLI on 7 June 2017. Ratification of the MLI will follow. Same response as New Zealand. Australia to adopt PPT through signing the MLI. Consulted on MLI in December 2016. Australia signed the MLI on 7 June 2017. Ratification of the MLI will follow. 7 – Prevent the artificial avoidance of Permanent Establishment (PE) status Changes to the OECD Model Tax Convention and changes to DTAs through MLI to prevent PE avoidance. NZ’s and Australia’s PE definition is generally based on the existing OECD and UN Models. NZ to implement OECD best practice standards for majority of DTAs b y signing the MLI. Consulted on MLI in March and signed MLI on 7 June 2017. Ratification of the MLI will follow. NZ also proposing a new anti- avoidance rule for large multinationals that structure to avoid having PE in NZ. Consultation on PE anti-avoidance rule in March 2017. Legislation planned for 2017/18. Similar response to New Zealand on some of the PE measures, but Australia has chosen not to implement changes to the DTA dependant agent PE provision through the MLI, but rather adopt them through bilateral negotiations. Consulted on MLI in December 2016. Australia signed the MLI on 7 June 2017. Ratification of the MLI will follow. Australia’s Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL) targets PE avoidance. Applies from 1 January 2016. 15 Action Report OECD recommendation Current law NZ response to OECD recommendations Australian response to OECD recommendations Actions 8-10 – relate to transfer pricing to ensure transfer pricing reflects economic substance Changes to the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. NZ and Australia currently apply the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. Recent Australian law changes are consistent with the new OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. New Zealand law requires updating to reflect new OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. New Zealand will follow the changes to the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. This involves making changes to domestic legislation. Consulted on transfer pricing in March 2017. Legislation planned for 2017/18. Similar response to New Zealand on transfer pricing, but generally goes further than New Zealand (and OECD recommendations), by applying a separate Diverted Profits Tax (DPT). Legislation for the separate DPT was introduced on 9 February 2017 and it will take effect in July 2017. 11 – Establish methodologies to collect and analyse data on BEPS and the actions to address it Recommendations regarding data to be collected and methodologies to analyse them. NZ and Australia collect and analyse certain data on BEPS as a matter of course. Since 2015 Inland Revenue has conducted an annual International Questionnaire that collects key data to assess BEPS risks. The most recent survey covered almost 600 foreign owned corporates. Additional data collection from significant enterprises is being considered as part of the BT programme of work. Similar response to New Zealand. ATO requires taxpayers to complete an international dealings schedule and has implemented an International Structuring and Profit Shifting (ISAPS) initiative. This initiative requested data from certain Australian companies at a level similar to the country-by-country (CbC) data requested under the OECD BEPS Action Plan. 16 Action Report OECD recommendation Current law NZ response to OECD recommendations Australian response to OECD recommendations 12 – Require taxpayers to disclose their aggressive tax planning arrangements to revenue authorities Recommendations regarding the design of domestic disclosure rules. For both NZ and Australia, no requirement under current law to disclose aggressive tax planning arrangements, however the combination of our strong anti- avoidance laws and the binding rulings and penalties regimes incentivise disclosure. No law reform planned but existing law incentivises disclosure. Taxpayers will often apply for binding rulings on potentially aggressive transactions to obtain certainty as to the tax treatment – especially in light of our strong anti- avoidance law. Penalties on aggressive transactions are reduced for early disclosure of the arrangement. Different to New Zealand. While Australia has a rulings regime and reductions in penalties for voluntary disclosure, the Australian Treasury is also consulting on whether to adopt the OECD proposals for mandatory disclosure of tax information. Submissions closed on 15 July 2016. Australia also recently implemented transparency measures allowing the ATO to publish the taxable income and income tax liabilities of large companies. 13 – Re-examine transfer pricing documentation Changes to OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and recommendations regarding the design of domestic rules, including country-by-country (CbC) reporting. NZ and Australia currently apply the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, but do not have a formal programme for automatic exchange of transfer pricing documentation. Inland Revenue is implementing CbC reporting. NZ has signed the multilateral agreement on exchanging CbC reports with other tax authorities. NZ also recently entered into a bilateral arrangement with the US Internal Revenue Service to share CbC reports. Where domestic legislation is required to support the changes to the Transfer Pricing Guidelines, this will be introduced in 2017/18. Similar response as New Zealand. Australia is implementing CbC reporting. It has enacted necessary domestic law and has signed the multilateral agreement on exchanging CbC reports with other tax authorities. In addition, Australia requires large multinationals to file their local and master file documentation with the ATO. Applies from 1 January 2016. 17 Action Report OECD recommendation Current law NZ response to OECD recommendations Australian response to OECD recommendations 14 – Make dispute resolution mechanisms more effective Recommendations on operational minimum standards and best practices for dispute resolution NZ and Australia have strong dispute resolution systems, but do not currently allow taxpayers to approach the competent authority (CA) 1 of either DTA partner for resolution of dispute (taxpayer must approach home country CA) and do not generally offer arbitration of CA disputes. NZ will implement OECD recommendations on dispute resolution by signing the MLI – in particular, NZ will allow taxpayers to approach the CA of either DTA partner in a treaty dispute and provide for arbitration of CA disputes. NZ also recently issued guidance on the mutual agreement procedure (MAP). Consulted on the MLI in March 2017 and signed the MLI on 7 June 2017. Ratification of the MLI will follow. Same response as New Zealand. Australia will implement OECD recommendations on dispute resolution by signing the MLI – in particular, it will allow taxpayers to approach the CA of either DTA partner in a treaty dispute and provide for arbitration of CA disputes. Consulted on the MLI in December and signed the MLI on 7 June 2017. Ratification of the MLI will follow. 15 – Develop the MLI to strengthen DTAs The MLI implements substantive recommendations made in OECD’s Action 2, 6, 7 and 14 reports. Report identified public international law and tax issues; and recommended an Ad-Hoc Group be set up to develop the MLI. NZ has a network of 40 DTAs. Some of the MLI provisions are already included in a few DTAs. NZ officials participated in the Ad Hoc Group to develop the MLI and New Zealand signed the MLI on 7 June 2017. NZ expects to ratify the MLI in 2018 and our DTAs are likely to begin to be modified in 2019. Consulted on the MLI in March 2017 and signed the MLI on 7 June 2017. Ratification of the MLI will follow. Same response as New Zealand. Australian officials participated in the Ad Hoc Group to develop the MLI and Australia signed the MLI on 7 June 2017. Australia consulted on the MLI in December and signed the MLI on 7 June 2017. Ratification of the MLI will follow. 1 CA is a person authorised by a DTA to administer tax treaty provisions and resolve disputes.

Tax policy report: BEPS Cabinet papers

This report recommends that you authorise the 3 attached Cabinet papers for lodgement with the Cabinet Office by 10am Thursday 20 July 2017 for the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee (EGI) to consider at its meeting on 26 July 2017.

The three attached papers are:

*   _BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules_. This paper contains measures to limit the ability of multinationals to use interest payments to shift their New Zealand profits offshore.
*   _BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_. This paper contains measures to strengthen our transfer pricing rules, counter permanent establishment avoidance and help Inland Revenue deal with uncooperative multinationals.
*   _BEPS – addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements_. This paper proposes measures to remove the tax advantages of hybrid mismatch arrangements.

These 3 papers form a comprehensive package of measures to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). We reported to you on these measures on 22 June 2017 (T2017/1576, IR2017/325; T2017/1577, IR 2017/330; T2017/1578, IR2017/329; T2017/1604, IR2017/353).

We also reported to you on another related Cabinet paper on Thursday 6 July 2017 (T2017/1847, IR2017/410) called _Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting_. This covering Cabinet paper summarises the background to the 3 attached papers, highlights the most important aspects of the proposed measures, and discusses matters common to all three papers (including application dates, publicity, and financial implications). We recommend that all four Cabinet papers be lodged together with the Cabinet Office.

BEPS documents release - August 2017: #14 Withheld under section 9(2)(a) of the Official Information Act 1982 Withheld under section 9(2)(a) of the Official Information Act 1982 In Confidence Office of the Minister of Finance Office of the Minister of Revenue Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules Proposal 1. This paper seeks Cabinet approval to strengthen New Zealand’s rules that prevent excess interest deductions being taken in New Zealand. This paper is part of a comprehensive package of measures to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). Executive summary 2. The use of debt is one of the simplest BEPS strategies. Multinationals with excessive levels of debt, or with related-party debt with high interest rates, have large interest deductions leaving little taxable profit in New Zealand. Robust rules limiting the use of debt (and the interest rates of that debt) are important base protection measures. 3. We recommend that Cabinet agree in principle to two major reforms to our interest limitation rules: • a restricted transfer pricing rule for setting the allowable interest rate on related- party loans from a non-resident to a New Zealand borrower; and • tightening the rules that set the debt levels allowed in New Zealand for taxpayers with international connections (the thin capitalisation rules) – in particular, setting the allowable debt level with reference to the taxpayer’s assets net of its non-debt liabilities. 4. We also recommend several minor improvements to the rules to ensure they are robust and fit for purpose. 5. These changes follow the Government discussio n document BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules (March 2017). In general, submitters on the discussion document acknowledged the need to respond to BEPS concerns but most did not agree with the specific proposals put forward. 6. Some of the proposals have been modified in response to these submissions. In particular, the approach for setting the allowable interest rate on related-party loans is different to that proposed in the discussion document. We anticipate that this new approach will address many, but not all, of submitters’ concerns. 7. There are some technical elements to these reforms that could benefit from further discussion with stakeholders. We therefore request that authority be delegated to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue to finalise the reforms. Treasury:3750405v1 2 8. The forecast revenue from implementing these changes is $45m in 2018/19 and $90m per annum from 2019/20. Note, however, that one technical detail to be canvassed in the further discussion with stakeholders could reduce the forecast revenue by up to $10m per annum. Background 9. The use of debt is one of the simplest BEPS strategies. Multinationals with excessive levels of debt, or with related-party debt with high interest rates, are able to take large interest deductions. This result s in litt le taxable profit being left in New Zealand. Robust rules limiting the use of debt (and the interest rates of that debt) are important base protection measures. 10. Accordingly, in March this year the Government released the discussion document BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules. There were two key proposals: one to strengthen how related-party debt is priced, and one tightening the rules governing allowable debt levels. 11. The discussion document also recommended several minor improvements to New Zealand’s interest limitation rules to ensure they are robust and fit for purpose. Comment 12. The majority of multinationals operating in New Zealand have relatively conservative debt positions, and the Government is committed to making sure New Zealand remains an attractive place for them to do business. 13. However, there are some multinationals that deliberately attempt to minimise their tax payments in New Zealand by engaging in BEPS strategies, such as by having related-party debt with excessive interest rates. These multinationals should not be allowed to exploit weaknesses in the current rules to achieve a competitive advantage over more compliant multinationals or domestic firms. 14. Accordingly, we recommend changes to New Zealand’s interest limitation rules, most significantly: • a restricted transfer pricing rule for setting the allowable interest rate on related- party loans from a non-resident to a New Zealand borrower; and • tightening the thin capitalisation rules, which set the debt levels allowed in New Zealand for taxpayers either with foreign parents (the inbound rules) or foreign subsidiaries (the outbound rules) – in particular, setting the allowable debt level with reference to the taxpayer’s assets net of its non-debt liabilities. Restricted transfer pricing 15. When borrowing from a third party (such as a bank), commercial pressure will drive the borrower to obtain a low interest rate. The same pressure does not necessarily exist in a related-party context, such as when a New Zealand subsidiary borrows from its foreig n parent. A rule to constrain the interest rate of such debt is necessary. Transfer pricing rules provide the current constraint on interest rates. 3 16. Broadly speaking, transfer pricing a loan agreement involves determining (hypothetically) the interest rate a third party lender would be willing to lend at, given the terms and conditions of the related-party loan. It is a fact specific and resource intensive exercise and can be manipulated (for example, by adding terms and conditions to the related- party loan that are not frequently seen between unrelated parties). We note that commentators such as Richard Vann, a professor of tax at the University of Sydney, have said that ordinary transfer pricing is unsuited to pricing related-party financing transactions. 17. For these reasons, the international consensus is moving away from using ordinary transfer pricing as the primary mechanism to limit the interest rates on related-party debt. The OECD, for example, has recommended that countries adopt a simple formulaic approach for limiting interest deductions, which would largely eliminate the advantage of using related- party debt with excessive interest rates (this approach was raised in consultation but was not supported by submitters as it would make a taxpayer’s allowable interest deductions volatile. Instead, as outlined below, we are recommending that the current rules for setting allowable debt levels be buttressed by rules that ensure related-party interest rates are appropriate). 18. Accordingly, we recommend that the allowable interest rate for inbound related-party loans be determined under a restricted transfer pricing methodology. Inbound related-party loans would be priced following the standard transfer pricing methodology. However, it would contain two additional elements to clarify that: • There is a rebuttable presumption that the New Zealand subsidiary would be supported by its foreign parent; and • All circumstances, terms, and conditions that could result in an excessive interest rate will be required to be ignored – unless the taxpayer can demonstrate that they have substantial third party debt featuring those terms and conditions. 19. The combined effect of these additional elements is that the interest rate on related-party debt will generally be in line with the interest rate facing the New Zealand borrower’s foreign parent. 20. This restricted transfer pricing rule would be coupled with a safe harbour, which would be based on the interest rate cap as initially proposed. This could be provided administratively. A related-party loan with an interest rate that is the same as the interest rate facing the borrower’s foreign parent would automatically be considered acceptable. This safe harbour would be attractive to many companies as it is both simple and provides certainty. 21. We note that the Australian Taxation Office has recently released administrative guidelines which outline a similar approach for limiting related-party interest rates (albeit Australia is implementing this approach as an operational policy, rather than a law change). Private sector consultation 22. This restricted transfer pricing rule is different to the proposal suggested in the March discussion document. The original proposal was a hard rule to cap the interest rate a foreign parent could charge its New Zealand subsidiary based on the foreign parent’s credit rating (an “interest rate cap”). 23. We consider that the restricted transfer pricing rule is a more workable way of achieving essentially the same objective – ensuring the interest rate on related-party debt is in line with what would actually be paid on third party debt. While the methods (restricted 4 transfer pricing and the interest rate cap) are different in approach, the outcome of both will generally be the same – with differences only at the margin. Accordingly, both approaches have the same revenue impact. 24. Submitters on the March discussion document did not support the original proposal. Many submitters argued that a new approach for pricing related-party debt is unnecessary, noting that the Government proposed to strengthen the transfer pricing rules generally (in the other March discussion document BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance). 25. Some submissions highlighted the consequences of adopting a blunt rule in the nature of the cap. These include concerns that: • the cap is not a good proxy for an arm’s length interest rate in some situations and so could result in double taxation; • the cap would deny deductions even when the amount of debt in the subsidiary was low; • the cap may increase compliance costs, for example, where a foreign parent has no credit rating (about half of New Zealand’s largest foreign-owned businesses are owned by companies with no credit rating); and • the proposal involves different rules for firms owned by a group of non-residents rather than a single foreign parent, which creates perceptions of unfairness. 26. It should be noted that the restricted transfer pricing rule we are recommending will address many, but not all, of submitters’ concerns because it is still a significant departure from using ordinary transfer pricing. Accordingly, we expect it will be more acceptable compared to the originally proposed interest rate cap because: • it allo ws for some limit ed flexibilit y – meaning the allowable interest rate can depart from the cost of funds facing the foreign parent if that is appropriate in the circumstances; and • it would be subject to the Mutual Agreement Procedure under New Zealand’s Double Tax Agreements, meaning taxpayers who consider that the new rule is inconsistent with the relevant treaty could seek resolution. This will address double taxation concerns. We do not, however, expect this will occur with any frequency because of the shift in the international consensus on what is acceptable in relation to the pricing of related-party debt. Allowable debt levels in the thin capitalisation rules 27. New Zealand has rules to prevent the excessive use of debt by foreign-owned ent it ies operating in New Zealand (inbound investment) and New Zealand-owned ent it ies wit h international operations (outbound investment). Interest deductions are denied to the extent that the entity’s debt level with reference to its assets is determined to be excessive. 28. The March discussion document proposed changing this, so that a taxpayer’s maximum debt level is set with reference to the taxpayer’s assets net of its non-debt liabilities (that is, its liabilities other than its interest bearing debts). Some common examples of non-debt liabilities are accounts payable, reserves and provisions, and deferred tax liabilities. 5 29. The core objectives of the thin capitalisation rules are better served with the non-debt liability adjustment. Under the current rules, where non-debt liabilities are ignored, companies are able to have high levels of debt (and therefore high interest deductions) relative to the capital invested in the company. The current treatment of non-debt liabilities also mean the rules apply unevenly across companies: companies with the same level of profit or loss can have very different thin capitalisation outcomes, depending on their non-debt liabilities. 30. In addition, one of the objectives of the thin capitalisation rules (ensuring that a taxpayer is limited to a commercial level of debt) is undermined by the current treatment of non-debt liabilities. A third party lender, when assessing the credit worthiness of a borrower, would take into account its non-debt liabilities. 31. Australia requires this same adjustment for non-debt liabilities. Private sector consultation 32. This proposal was accepted by some submitters but opposed by others who argued, for example, that the proposal amounts to a substantial reduction in the amount of deductible debt allowable under the thin capitalisation rules. Overall, this proposal was much less contentious than the interest rate cap. 33. None of the submissions against the core proposal convinced us that the analysis above, suggesting that the non-debt liability adjustment is appropriate, is incorrect. Accordingly, we recommend that the proposed adjustment to the allowable debt level under the thin capitalisation rule proceed. That is, a taxpayer’s allowable debt level under the rules should be set with reference to their assets net of their non-debt liabilities. 34. A near-universal comment from submitters was that certain non-debt liabilities – most significantly deferred tax liabilities – should be carved out from the proposed non-debt liability adjustment. Deferred tax is an accounting concept. Accounting standards require that companies recognise deferred tax on their balance sheets in certain situations. In principle, a deferred tax liability is supposed to represent future tax payments that a taxpayer will be required to make. Submitters argued that this is often not the case – deferred tax liabilities are frequently technical accounting entries and do not reflect future tax obligations. Submitters also pointed to the rules in Australia, which do include a carve-out for deferred tax liabilities and assets. 35. We recommend further consultation on whether deferred tax should be carved-out from this non-debt liability adjustment. Many, but not all, deferred tax liabilities represent a genuine requirement that tax on current accounting profits will be payable in the future. Given the concerns raised by submitters, further consultation on this technical detail would be beneficial. Other changes 36. We recommend five other changes to the thin capitalisation rules: • a special rule for infrastructure projects (such as public private partnerships) that are controlled by a single non-resident; • a de minimis for the inbound thin capitalisation rules; • reducing the ability for companies owned by a group of non-residents to use related-party debt; 6 • removing the ability to use asset valuations for the thin capitalisation rules that differ from those reported in a firm’s financial accounts; and • removing the ability to measure assets and debts on the final day of a firm’s income year. 37. These measures were all discussed in the March discussion document. Some were supported by submitters, while others were opposed. Where they were opposed, we are recommending changes to the proposals which will, in general, address submitters’ concerns. Rule for infrastructure projects 38. We recommend a special rule that allows all of a taxpayer’s third party debt to be deductible even if the debt levels exceed the normal thin capitalisation limits, provided the debt is non-recourse with interest funded so lely from pro ject inco me. 39. This will allow a wider group of investors to participate in public-private partnerships without interest expense denial than has been possible previously. 40. This rule was well received by submitters; however, some technical issues have been raised which we will consult further on. De minimis for the inbound rules 41. The thin capitalisation rules that apply to New Zealand-owned taxpayers with foreign operations (the outbound rules) has a de minimis (the rules do not apply if a taxpayer has interest deductions of less than $1 million). The thin capitalisation rules that apply to foreign- owned taxpayers (the inbound rules) do not have a similar de minimis. 42. We recommend the current de minimis in the outbound rules be extended to taxpayers subject to the inbound rules, provided the taxpayer has only third party debt. This proposal is to reduce compliance costs for small foreign-owned entities that have a low risk of BEPS. 43. This proposal was generally supported by submitters. Allowable debt levels for companies owned by a group of non-residents 44. At present, when an entity is controlled by a group of non-residents acting together, its allowable debt level is the greater of: • 60 percent; and • 110 percent of its third party debt. 45. However, this means that a taxpayer with high levels of third party debt can be funded with almo st no equit y. For example, a project funded 90 percent with third party debt could have 9 percent shareholder debt and only 1 percent equity. 46. To address this, we recommend changing this test so that, if an entity has a debt level in excess of 60 percent, the interest deductions on its related-party debt should be denied to the extent the entity’s debt level exceeded 60 percent. This proposal was generally accepted by submitters. 7 47. The March discussion document proposed that this change be grandparented, as the rules it relates to (for non-residents acting together) have only just taken effect. We recommend that the precise design of this grandparenting be subject to further consultation with stakeholders, with decisions on its final design being delegated to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue. Asset valuations 48. In general, the thin capitalisation rules are based on the value of a company’s assets as reported in its financial statements. However, a company may use the net current value of an asset as an alternative to its financial statement value, provided that would be allowable under generally accepted accounting principles. 49. While it is permissible to use an asset’s net current value, the thin capitalisation rules set out what is required if taxpayers utilise this option. Accordingly, we recommend that this new net current valuation option be available only if certain criteria are met – such as if the valuation is from an independent expert valuer. Agency consultation 50. Inland Revenue and Treasury officials have consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment on this Cabinet paper. Financial implications, human rights, administrative impacts, legislative implications, and publicity 51. These are set out in the accompanying covering Cabinet paper for the overall BEPS package (Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting). Impact Analysis Requirements 52. Cabinet's Impact Analysis Requirements apply to these proposals and a Regulatory Impact Assessment is required. This has been prepared by Inland Revenue and is attached. 53. The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Regulatory Impact Assessment and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria. 8 Recommendations 54. We recommend that the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee: 1. Note that in March this year the Government released a discussion document called BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules which proposed some detailed measures to improve our ability to tax multinationals that operate in New Zealand. 2. Note that in response to submissions we have made the proposed measures better targeted at the BEPS concerns without reducing their overall effectiveness. 3. Agree that the interest rate on inbound related-party loans should be set using a restricted transfer pricing rule, whereby the interest rate is set under transfer pricing but ignoring all surrounding circumstances, terms, and conditions that could result in an excessive interest rate unless similar terms apply to significant amounts of third party debt, and with the rebuttable presumption that the borrower would be supported by its foreign parent. 4. Agree that a taxpayer’s allowable debt level in the thin capitalisation rules should be set with reference to its assets less its non-debt liabilities. 5. Agree that the de minimis in the outbound thin capitalisation rules, which provides an exemption from the rules for groups with interest deductions of $1 million or less, be made available also to foreign-controlled taxpayers provided they have no owner-linked debt. 6. Agree that an exemption should be provided from the thin capitalisation rules for certain infrastructure projects funded entirely with third party limited recourse loans. 7. Agree that, when an entity is controlled by a group of non-residents acting together, interest deductions on any related-party debt should be denied to the extent the entity’s debt level exceeds 60 percent. 8. Agree that clear legislative requirements be developed for when taxpayers choose to value their assets for thin capitalisation purposes on a basis other than that used in their financial accounts. 9. Agree that an anti-avoidance rule should be inserted into the thin capitalisation rules, to apply when a taxpayer substantially repays a loan just before the end o f the year. 10. Note that the fiscal consequences of the above measures are set out in the covering Cabinet paper for the overall BEPS package (Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting). 11. Delegate authority to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue to make final decisions on the detailed design of the above measures. 12. Authorise the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue jointly to take final decisions on the extent to which deferred tax liabilities are included in non- debt liabilities, up to a limit of reducing the level of expected revenue increases 9 anticipated by the BEPS measures as set out in recommendation 7 in the accompanying Cabinet paper Tax Measures To Prevent Base Erosion And Profit Shifting by up to $10 million per annum 13. Agree that the results of the decisions in recommendations 3-12 be included in a BEPS taxation bill to be introduced to Parliament before the end of 2017. Authorised for lodgement Hon Steven Joyce Minister of Finance Hon Judith Collins Minister of Revenue In Confidence Office of the Minister of Finance Office of the Minister of Revenue Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance Proposal 1. This paper seeks Cabinet approval to introduce new tax rules to prevent permanent establishment avoidance, strengthen our transfer pricing rules, and help Inland Revenue investigate uncooperative multinationals. This paper is part of a comprehensive package of measures to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). Executive summary 2. Some large multinationals are currently using tax arrangements which allow them to report low taxable profits in New Zealand despite carrying on significant economic activity here. 3. In March this year, the Government released a discussion document called BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance to consult on proposals to combat these arrangements. Many of these proposals are similar to tax reforms that Australia has introduced in recent years. They are also broadly consistent with the OECD’s Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS Action Plan). 4. Submissions and workshops with the private sector were used to refine the proposals and better target them at the BEPS activities we are concerned about, whilst reducing the compliance costs and other unintended impacts on taxpayers engaging in ordinary, commercial dealings. 5. We recommend that nearly all of the proposals in the discussion document proceed, subject to some changes following consultation. The most significant changes made to the original proposals as a result of consultation were: • The proposed permanent establishment (PE) avoidance rule should be more narrowly targeted at avoidance arrangements. We would like to consult further as to how best to achieve this. • Clarificat ion of the circumstances in which Inland Revenue would be able to reconstruct a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position. We recommend clarifying that the test for reconstructing an arrangement would be based on the corresponding test in the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines. • The proposal to require disputed tax to be paid earlier should not proceed. This is because we consider it to be unnecessary in light of the current “use of money” interest rate regime. 6. These changes are likely to be welcomed by submitters and do not reduce the overall effectiveness of the proposed reforms. 2 7. We recommend Cabinet delegate authority to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue to make final decisio ns on the detailed design of the proposed rules. As we continue to design the detail of the proposals there will be further targeted consultation with interested parties. 8. The forecast tax revenue from implementing the transfer pricing and PE avoidance measures is $25m in 2018/19 and $50m per annum from 2019/20. Some o f this revenue has already been included in the Budget 2017 forecasts. Background 9. In February this year, Cabinet agreed to release the Government discussion document BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance (CAB-17-MIN-0041 refers). 10. The discussion document, which was released in March 2017, consulted on proposals to combat aggressive tax strategies which allow some mult inat ionals to report low taxable profits in New Zealand despite carrying on significant economic activity here. These strategies involve: • Tax structuring: In order for New Zealand to tax a non-resident on its sales here, the non-resident must have a taxable presence (a permanent establishment or “PE”) in New Zealand. However, non-residents can structure their affairs to avoid such a taxable presence, even when they are involved in significant economic activity here (PE avoidance). Non-residents can also enter into arrangements with related parties that reduce their taxable profits in New Zealand, but lack economic substance (transfer pricing avoidance). • Creating enforcement barriers: It is difficult and resource intensive to assess and engage in disputes with mult inat ionals in pract ice. This is due to the highly factual nature of the issues and the difficulties Inland Revenue faces in obtaining the relevant information. 11. The OECD and the G20 are also concerned about these kinds of BEPS strategies, and have recommended measures to address them in their 15 point BEPS Action Plan. These include: • a widened definit ion of “permanent establishment” for double tax agreements (DTAs), to counter PE avoidance (however this will only be included in a DTA if both countries agree); and • updated transfer pricing guidelines, to counter profit shifting. Comment 12. We have developed a package of proposed tax law changes to combat transfer pricing and PE avoidance. The main elements of the proposed reform package are: • The introduction of a new PE avoidance rule that will prevent multinationals from structuring their operations to avoid having a PE in New Zealand where one exists in substance. • Stronger “source rules” so New Zealand has a greater ability to tax New Zealand- sourced income. • Stronger transfer pricing rules which will adjust related party transactions if they do not align with the actual substance of the multinational’s economic activities. We also 3 propose shifting the burden of proof onto the taxpayer (rather than Inland Revenue) for proving that their related party dealings are consistent with those that would be agreed by third parties operating at arm’s length, and extending the time bar (the period of time which Inland Revenue has to reassess a taxpayer) from four years to seven years for transfer pricing. • A range of administrative measures that will strengthen Inland Revenue’s powers to investigate large mult inat ionals (with at least EUR €750m o f glo bal revenues). These are similar to some of the administrative powers provided under the UK and Australia’s Diverted Profit Taxes but New Zealand’s administrative measures are more targeted at the practical barriers faced by tax investigators as they will only apply when a mult inat ional does not cooperate with a tax investigation. 13. Many of these proposals are similar to tax reforms that Australia has introduced in recent years. They are also broadly consistent with the OECD’s BEPS Action Plan, although the specific proposals are tailored for the New Zealand environment to address issues that Inland Revenue has identified when investigating multinationals. Private sector consultation 14. 15 submitters provided written submissions on the discussion document. The Treasury and Inland Revenue also met with six of these submitters to discuss their submissions. General reaction 15. Overall, most submitters accepted in principle the need for measures to address the transfer pricing and PE avoidance issues identified in the discussion document. However, they did raise issues with certain features of the proposed measures and made suggestions to make them more certain and better targeted. 16. Two of the 15 submitters welcomed the proposals as a positive step by the Government to ensure that all large multinationals are paying their fair share of tax. 17. The other 13 submitters were tax advisors or represent mult inationals that could be negatively affected by the proposals. Their submissions were critical of some of the measures. 18. Some submitters argued that the proposals could have a detrimental effect on New Zealand being an attractive investment destination and should not be implemented. As noted in the accompanying covering Cabinet Paper (Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting), there will be additional tax and compliance costs for some investors but these additional costs will mostly be borne by taxpayers engaging in BEPS activities and the overall benefits to New Zealand of addressing BEPS outweigh these costs. 19. As expected, most of the submitters opposed the administrative proposals to increase Inland Revenue's powers to investigate multinationals. However, we consider these new powers are necessary to ensure Inland Revenue can effectively enforce the new rules. These new powers include: • Expanding Inland Revenue's ability to request information that is held by a related group member offshore. Submitters considered this proposal could unfairly penalise a New Zealand entity that may not be able to get the informat ion fro m their mult inat ional group members. However, we consider it is unacceptable for Inland Revenue’s investigations to be frustrated because a multinational group fails to provide information that is under its control. 4 • Shifting the burden of proof for transfer pricing onto the taxpayer (rather than Inland Revenue) for proving that their related party dealings are consistent with those that would be agreed by third parties operating at arm’s length. Submitters considered Inland Revenue had information regarding comparable transactions and should bear the burden of proof. However, shifting the burden of proof is consistent with the fact that the taxpayer holds the relevant information on their own transfer pricing practices. The burden of proof is already on the taxpayer for other tax matters and is also on the taxpayer for transfer pricing matters in most other OECD and G20 countries, including Australia. Because most multinationals already prepare transfer pricing documentation that satisfies the burden of proof for other countries, the additional compliance costs from this change are not expected to be substantial. • Extending the time bar (the period of time which Inland Revenue has to adjust a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position) from four years to seven years for transfer pricing. Submitters opposed this extension on the basis that it increased uncertainty and was out of step with the general time bar, which applies to other areas of tax. However, we are continuing to recommend the seven year rule. Having a longer time bar for transfer pricing cases is consistent with both Australia and Canada (who also have a special seven year time bar for transfer pricing) and reflects the information asymmetry that exists in transfer pricing cases (especially where taxpayers may hold relevant information offshore). Changes made as a result of consultation 20. In response to submissions, we have updated the proposals to address many of the submitters’ concerns while ensuring the measures are just as effective at combatting BEPS. 21. Many submissions focused on when the PE avoidance rule would apply. Submitters considered the proposal outlined in the discussion document applied too broadly and could have unintended impacts on compliant taxpayers engaging in ordinary, commercial dealings. 22. We consider the PE avoidance rule should be more narrowly targeted at avoidance arrangements. We would like to consult further as to how best to achieve this. 23. Submitters also pointed out that the OECD has updated their model DTA to address PE avoidance and New Zealand is currently in the process of adopting this into some of our tax treaties by signing the OECD’s Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and through negotiating new tax treaties. We agree that the domestic law PE avoidance rule will only be necessary when the relevant tax treaty does not yet include the OECD’s new recommendation and propose narrowing the application of rule accordingly. 24. The PE avoidance rule would apply notwithstanding the relevant DTAs (that don’t yet include the OECD’s new model PE rule). We consider that this is acceptable for two reasons: • The OECD’s commentary to their model DTA contemplates that countries can adopt anti-avoidance rules and states that, as a general rule, there will be no conflict between such anti-avoidance provisions and the provisions of a DTA. An existing example of this is New Zealand’s General Anti-Avoidance Rule which explicitly overrides our DTAs to allow New Zealand to combat tax avoidance arrangements. The PE avoidance rule would be a specific anti-avoidance rule, which would also be consistent with the principle in the OECD’s commentary. 5 • The UK and Australia have already implemented similar PE avoidance rules in their domestic laws which override their DTAs and their treaty partners have not challenged this. 25. Another major point raised by submitters was the need to clarify the circumstances in which Inland Revenue would be able to reconstruct a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position. We recommend clarifying that the test for reconstructing an arrangement would be based on the corresponding test in the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines. 26. Other significant changes made as a result of consultation were: • The anti-avoidance source rule will be more narrowly targeted at the existing issues Inland Revenue has identified with the source rules. • We have decided not to proceed with the proposal to require multinationals to pay disputed tax upfront as we agree with submitters that the existing “use of money” interest rates that Inland Revenue charges on unpaid tax provide a sufficient incentive to pay tax that is in dispute. 27. The above changes will make the rules more certain and better targeted and are likely to be welco med by submitters. 28. We also recommend widening the scope of the original proposal to deem an amount of income to have a New Zealand source under our domestic legislation if we have a right to tax the income under a DTA. The rule proposed in the discussion document was limited to income covered by the PE and royalty articles of our DTAs. We should extend the rule to all types of income that we can tax under a DTA – as Australia does. This ensures we can exercise a taxing right that we have negotiated under a DTA. We will consult further on this wider proposal in the next round of consultation. 29. These recommended changes will not affect the originally forecast revenue from implementing the transfer pricing and PE avoidance measures, which is $25m in 2018/19 and $50m per annum from 2019/20 (some of this revenue has already been included in the Budget 2017 forecasts). 30. We recommend Cabinet delegate authority to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue to make final decisions on the detailed design of the proposed rules. As we continue to design the detail of the proposals there will be further targeted consultation with interested parties. Agency consultation 31. Inland Revenue and Treasury officials have consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment on this Cabinet paper. Financial implications, human rights, administrative impacts, legislative implications, publicity 32. These are set out in the accompanying covering Cabinet paper for the overall BEPS package (Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting). 6 Impact Analysis Requirements 33. Cabinet's Impact Analysis Requirements apply to these proposals and a Regulatory Impact Assessment is required. This has been prepared by Inland Revenue and is attached. 34. The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Regulatory Impact Assessment and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria. Recommendations 35. We recommend that the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee: 1. Note that in March this year the Government released a discussion document called BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance which proposed some detailed measures to improve our ability to tax mult inationals that operate in New Zealand. 2. Note that in response to submissions we have made the proposed measures better targeted at the BEPS concerns without reducing the overall effectiveness of the proposed reforms. 3. Agree to introduce a new PE avoidance rule that will apply to large multinationals that structure their businesses to avoid having a PE (taxable presence) in New Zealand. 4. Agree to expand and strengthen the rules for taxing New Zealand-sourced income by: • deeming certain amounts of income to have a source in New Zealand if New Zealand has a right to tax that income under any applicable DTA; • introducing an anti-avoidance source rule which will broadly provide that, where another group member carries on a non-resident’s business in New Zealand, the non-resident will be deemed to carry on that business itself for the purpose of determining whether its income from New Zealand customers has a New Zealand source; and • addressing a potential weakness of the life insurance source rules by ensuring that no deductions are available for the reinsurance of life policies if the premium income on that policy is not taxable in New Zealand, including where the income is not subject to New Zealand tax by operation of a DTA. 5. Agree to strengthen the transfer pricing rules so they align with the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines and Australia’s transfer pricing rules. This involves amending New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules so that: • they disregard legal form if it does not align with the actual economic substance of the transaction; • they provide Inland Revenue with a power to reconstruct transfer pricing arrangements which are not commercially rational because they include unrealistic terms that third parties would not be willing to agree to; • the legislation specifically refers to arm’s length conditions; 7 • they refer to the latest OECD transfer pricing guidelines as guidance for how the rules are applied; • the new legislation codifies the requirement for large multinationals to provide Inland Revenue with the information required to comply with the OECD’s country-by-country reporting initiative; • the time bar that limits Inland Revenue’s ability to adjust a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position is increased to seven years (in line with Australia); • the burden of proof for demonstrating that a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position aligns with arm’s length conditions is shifted from Inland Revenue to the taxpayer (consistent with the burden of proof being on the taxpayer for other tax matters); and • in addition to applying to transactions between related parties, the transfer pricing rules will also apply when non-resident investors “act in concert” to effectively control a New Zealand entity, such as through a private equity manager. 6. Agree to strengthen Inland Revenue’s powers to investigate large mult inationals (with at least EUR €750m of global revenues) that do not cooperate with a tax investigation by amending the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow Inland Revenue to: • more readily assess the multinational’s tax position based on the information available to Inland Revenue at the time; • collect any tax owed by a member of a large multinational group from any wholly-owned group member, provided the non-resident fails to pay the tax itself; • use section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to request information that is held offshore by another group member of the large multinational group; • use section 21 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to deem an amount of income to be allocated to a New Zealand group member or PE of a large multinational group in cases where they have failed to adequately respond to an information request in relation to New Zealand sourced income (currently the existing power only applies in respect of deductible payments); and • impose a new civil penalty of up to $100,000 for large multinational groups which fail to provide requested information (which replaces the current $12,000 maximum criminal penalty). 7. Note that the fiscal consequences of the above measures are set out in the covering Cabinet paper for the overall BEPS package (Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting). 8. Delegate authority to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue to make final decisio ns on the detailed design of the above measures. 9. Agree that the results of the decisions in recommendations 3-6 and 8 be included in a BEPS taxation bill to be introduced to Parliament before the end of 2017. 8 Authorised for lodgement Hon Steven Joyce Minister of Finance Hon Judith Collins Minister of Revenue In confidence Office of the Minister of Finance Office of the Minister of Revenue Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee BEPS – addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements Proposal 1. This paper seeks Cabinet approval to introduce new tax rules to address the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements. This paper is part of a comprehensive package of measures to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). Executive summary 2. Hybrid mismatch arrangements are, broadly speaking, cross-border arrangements that exploit differences in the tax treatment of an entity or instrument under the laws of two or more countries. The result of hybrid mismatch arrangements is less aggregate tax revenue collected in the jurisdictions to which the arrangement relates. 3. The OECD, as part of its base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) Action Plan, published in late 2015 its final report on hybrid mismatch arrangements. This report recommended that countries enact a comprehensive set of rules to neutralise the benefit of hybrid mismatch arrangements affecting their tax base. 4. The UK has legislated the OECD recommendations into their domestic law and Australia is committed to do the same. The EU has also issued a directive requiring its 28 member states (including the UK) to introduce anti-hybrid rules. We are not aware of any other countries intending to adopt a comprehensive set of rules, although many countries have more targeted anti-hybrid rules. 5. The OECD recommendations will not apply to the vast majority of taxpayers. They will not apply to purely domestic firms. They apply mainly to related parties of multinational groups and planned arrangements. The expected outcome of the OECD recommendations is that the tax benefit of hybrid mismatch arrangements is eliminated, in most cases influencing taxpayers to switch to more straightforward cross-border financing instruments and structures. 6. The Government released a discussion document in September 2016 called Addressing Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements which proposed that the OECD recommendations be adopted in New Zealand and asked for feedback on how that should best be done. Since receiving submissions to this document, officials have engaged stakeholders in targeted consultation on specific design issues relating to the proposal. Consultation has resulted in some of the proposals being modified, such as a proposed exclusion from the rules for New Zealand businesses that operate offshore only through a simple branch structure. Nevertheless, many taxpayers affected by these proposals will still oppose them. Some would prefer to see a targeted approach, which would only tackle hybrids that have already been observed in New Zealand. 2 7. However, in order to send the clear message that using hybrid mismatch arrangements should not produce a tax advantage, we are recommending that Cabinet agree to a comprehensive adoption of the OECD recommendations on hybrid mismatch arrangements with suitable modifications for the New Zealand context. To do otherwise may simply encourage the ongoing use of hybrids not covered by any targeted proposal. Other issues raised through the consultation process, and which are likely to attract the most comment (such as the application of the rules to foreign trusts) are set out in paragraphs 24-38 of this paper. 8. We are further recommending that hybrids rules be included in a BEPS taxation bill to be introduced to Parliament before the end of 2017. Background BEPS 9. New Zealand’s BEPS work programme has largely been driven by a wider momentum that has developed since 2012, when the OECD/G20 began work on their BEPS Action Plan,. Its final package of reports was released in October 2015. The Action Plan is a multifaceted approach intending to encourage countries to close many (but not all) of the avenues multinational companies currently use to reduce their worldwide tax liability, and to improve the information available to governments when they deal with multinational companies, without changing the fundamental principles for the taxation of international trade and investment. 10. As a member of the OECD Council, New Zealand approved the 2015 BEPS final package and has supported the BEPS Action Plan since the OECD’s first declaration on BEPS in 2013. Hybrid mismatch arrangements 11. Hybrid mismatch arrangements are a significant base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) strategy used by some multinational companies to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world on some or all of their income. They are, broadly speaking, cross-border arrangements that exploit differences in the tax treatment of an entity or instrument under the laws of two or more countries to achieve double non-taxation. 12. One way in which this double non-taxation can arise is through a payment being deductible for a payer in one country but not included as taxable income for the payee in the other country. Another way double non-taxation can arise is by way of a single payment being deducted against different income streams in two countries. 13. Double non-taxation of this kind is difficult to deal with, because it can be achieved even though both countries’ tax rules are being complied with. However, it clearly reduces fairness, causes harmful distortions in investment patterns, and results in an unintended reduction in aggregate tax revenues. It is often difficult to determine which of the countries involved has lost tax revenue through the use of a hybrid mismatch arrangement, but there is undoubtedly a reduction of worldwide tax paid. 3 The OECD’s response 14. The OECD has made a number of recommendations as to how countries can improve their domest ic rules to prevent mismatches arising and neutralise their effect when they do arise. These recommendations relate to Action 2 of the OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan: Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements. 15. The OECD recommends two kinds of rules. The first are rules specifically designed to reduce the likelihood of hybrid mismatches arising. The second are “linking rules”, which apply to payments that give rise to a deduction in more than one country, or which give rise to a deduction in one country but are not taxed as income in another country due to a hybrid mismatch. These generally only apply to: • arrangements between related parties (25% or more commonly owned) or control groups (50% or more commonly owned); or • structured arrangements - generally, arrangements between non-associated parties which intentionally exploit such mismatches. 16. These linking rules are divided into “primary” and “secondary” responses. Primary responses have precedence, with secondary responses being used if the country that has the primary right does not have hybrid rules. This primary/secondary structure is important for ensuring that all hybrids with a connection to New Zealand are effectively countered irrespective of where the counterparty is based. 17. The OECD has also developed an addit io nal BEPS Act ion 2 report that makes a number of recommendations as to how countries can deal with the problem of branch mismatch arrangements which is closely related to the hybrid mismatches issue. Other countries 18. The UK has introduced into its domestic law rules that reflect a broad adoption of the OECD recommendations. Australia has proposed to do the same and, as part of its 2017 Budget, committed to introduce rules that are effective by 1 January 2018 or six months following Royal assent. 1 The EU has issued a directive requiring its 28 member states (including the UK) to introduce anti-hybrid rules by 1 January 2020. We are not aware of any other countries intending to adopt a comprehensive set of rules, although many countries have more targeted anti-hybrid rules. Hybrids discussion document 19. On 6 September 2016, the Government released a discussion document ent it led “Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements” seeking feedback on proposals to address hybrid mismatch arrangements in line with the OECD recommendations \[CAB-16-MIN-0442\]. 20. 20 submissions were received on the discussion document. Most submitters accepted the need for some hybrid rules, with some submitters expressing support for New Zealand to take action in line with the OECD hybrids package, subject to various provisos, including that it was done in a co-ordinated fashion with other jurisdictions and/or that there should be concessions for hybrid regulatory capital. The majorit y of submissio ns argued that we should only implement rules to counter hybrid mismatches actually observed in New Zealand, rather than the full suite of OECD recommendations. 1 As set out in paragraph 59, Australia has indicated that it is unlikely to implement OECD recommendation 5 at this stage, but may do so in the future if integrity concerns arise. 4 Comment Implementing the full OECD hybrids package 21. As set out in the cover Cabinet paper (Tax measures to counter base erosion and profit shifting), we are recommending that Cabinet agree to a comprehensive implementation of the OECD’s proposed solutions to the hybrid and branch mismatch problem, , even though there was limited evidence of some of the structures being used in New Zealand. We are of the view that the OECD proposals are in New Zealand’s best interests, as enacting these recommendations will improve fairness, reduce harmful distortions in investment patterns, increase tax revenue, and will also address the risk of taxpayers using new hybrid mismatch opportunities if only the more common techniques are addressed initially. 22. In making this recommendation, we recognise that these proposals involve considerable complexity, which will not generally be welcomed by those taxpayers affected. However, we are comfortable that there are a number of factors that outweigh these concerns: • We are proposing to modify the OECD recommendations when it is appropriate to do so for the New Zealand context. Examples are ensuring New Zealand companies with simple foreign branch structures are not caught by the rules (see “application of hybrids rules to foreign branches” below), not applying the rules to purely domestic firms, and not introducing rules when an adequate New Zealand provision already exists. • We are recommending that officials continue to consult on a few particular issues that have the potential to ease the compliance costs of the proposals before we make a final decision on them under Cabinet delegated authority. These consist of elective options which would in effect allow existing hybrids to be treated as simple equity investments. • Despite the necessary complexity, the underlying principle is clear – using hybrid mismatches as a tax-efficient means of inbound, outbound or conduit investment is not appropriate. • We are recommending that relevant parties be consulted on exposure drafts of key aspects of the legislation. This is intended to facilitate workable legislation that is understandable to those applying it. • In almost all cases, the complexity will be optional. Taxpayers can avoid having to deal with these rules by undertaking simple debt or equity funding. 23. Some o f the other more significant issues relating to this proposal are set out below. Those are followed by a brief explanation of each of the OECD recommendations and the principles behind them. The appendix contains a series of detailed aspects of the proposals that we are also seeking Cabinet’s agreement to. These details have been consulted on wit h interested parties, and are consistent with the general recommendations set out below. 5 Significant issues Foreign trusts 24. As set out in the cover Cabinet paper, we are recommending that foreign trusts be included within the scope of these rules in circumstances where their treatment outside of New Zealand means income of the trust is not included in a tax calculation anywhere in the world. This is not because they are foreign trusts, but because in those circumstances they are “reverse hybrids” according to the OECD recommendations (see the discussion on OECD Recommendation 5.2, below). The same rule would equally impose tax on New Zealand limited partnerships that fit within the reverse hybrids definition. 25. We are aware that foreign trusts have recently had a new set of disclosure rules apply to them following the 2016 Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules. In this respect, adding another regulatory regime to the industry now is unfortunate timing. To reflect the fact that these trusts have recently undergone significant compliance costs, and to give the foreign trust and limited partnership industries more time to understand the implications of the proposed rules, we are recommending a delayed effective date for New Zealand reverse hybrids of 1 April 2019. Application of hybrid rules to foreign branches 26. The way in which the OECD recommendations are written would in some circumstances deny a New Zealand company the ability to offset a loss from its foreig n branch against its New Zealand income. This is an issue that some submitters have been very concerned about. 27. We have made various modifications to the OECD recommendations to address this issue, including clarifying that taxpayers who have simple offshore branch structures do not present a hybrid mismatch problem and so are not covered by the rules. Imported mismatches 28. OECD recommendation 8 suggests countries include an “imported mismatch” rule when implementing hybrid and branch mismatch rules. Imported mismatch rules apply when the New Zealand resident is not directly involved in the hybrid mismatch, but the benefit of a mismatch is “imported”. Some submitters on the discussion document viewed this particular recommendation as over-reach, highly complex and impractical. 29. To address these concerns, we recommend that the introduction of the imported mismatch rule be different for “structured” and “unstructured” arrangements. Structured arrangements are deliberately entered into to obtain a tax advantage, so should be implemented at the same time as the rest of the hybrid rules. By contrast, unstructured arrangements are ones where the New Zealand benefit is not the primary reason for entering into the arrangement. We recommend that the unstructured rule has a delayed implementation date of 1 January 2020. By this date, we expect that the EU countries, the UK, and Australia will all have hybrid rules. Delaying the implementation of the unstructured rule until those countries have similar rules will reduce the costs involved in complying with the rule in New Zealand because, by that time, multinationals that are also operating in those countries should already be complying with their equivalent rules, and also because payments 6 to those countries will not be subject to the imported mismatch rule at all. More details regarding the imported mismatch rule are contained later in this paper. Over-taxation by reason of the imposition of NRWT 30. The OECD recommends that countries apply the hybrid rules without regard to any withholding tax collected on the relevant payments. In situations where New Zealand imposes non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on an interest payment that is also denied a deduction under the hybrid rules, there may be over-taxation. 31. As far as our officials are aware, Australia is not planning on departing from the OECD approach. An argument for this approach is that in the majority of cases taxpayers can simply switch to simpler structures and arrangements and be subject to only single taxation. The OECD approach is also less complicated. Nevertheless, there has been an argument from some submitters that the hybrid rules should be modified in New Zealand so as to remove this potential over-taxation for taxpayers that choose to remain in hybrid structures. 32. We recommend that in the case of a hybrid financial instrument, there needs to be further consideration of the possibility of letting taxpayers treat the payment as a dividend. This would allow them to eliminate NRWT by attaching imputation credits to the payment. We recommend that Cabinet delegate the authority to determine the appropriateness of such an approach to us to decide after receiving further advice. For hybrid arrangements other than financial instruments, we are less concerned about the imposition of NRWT. Although there may be some over-taxation, in many cases this will simply be a timing issue. Grandparenting for certain instruments issued by banks to the public 33. We recommend that there be an exception to the rules for certain hybrid instruments (“hybrid regulatory capital”) issued by banks and insurance companies eit her directly or indirectly to third party investors, in partial satisfaction of the capital requirements imposed on those companies by regulators (such as the Reserve Bank and its Australian equivalent, APRA). We recommend that such instruments issued before the date of the discussion document release (6 September 2016) should not be subject to the hybrid rules until the first date on which the issuer has an unconditional right to call or otherwise cancel the instruments without penalt y. 34. This grandparenting date is different to the date proposed in Australia, which is 8 May 2017 (the day before their Federal Budget). We consider differing from Australia is justified in this case. The Australian Government had made public the fact that it was considering how such instruments should be taxed, and did not make an announcement until its 2017 Budget. In New Zealand the hybrids discussion document released on 6 September stated that such instruments would be subject to the hybrid rules. To grandparent instruments issued after the New Zealand discussion document may be seen as encouraging taxpayers to enter into aggressive structures after the government has stated an intention to change the rules but before that change is enacted. We are wary of creating an expectation that such arrangements will be grandparented. Opaque election for foreign hybrid entities 35. The private sector has proposed that a New Zealand investor in a foreign hybrid entity be entitled to elect to treat the entity as tax opaque (like a company) in New Zealand to remove the hybridity and put that entit y outside the scope of the rules. Our initial view is that 7 excluding simple branch structures from the rules, and the ability of hybrid participants to restructure their arrangements, may make such an election redundant. Nevertheless, we have asked officials to continue their consideration of how such an election may work in practice, including whether the costs of administering it for what may be a relatively small group are justified. We recommend that Cabinet delegate to us the authorit y to decide on the appropriateness of an opaque election. Application of rules to branch mismatch arrangements 36. Consultation on branch mismatches has taken place but has not been as comprehensive as that for the remainder of the hybrid proposals. In part this is because such mismatches are less significant for New Zealand, and in part because the OECD draft report on branches was released at around the same time as the New Zealand discussion document, and the proposal was therefore less well developed. Nevertheless, we recommend that New Zealand implement rules that are consistent with the OECD recommendations on branch mismatches (this is also consistent with the approach that has been taken by the UK and which we understand will be taken by Australia). Branch mismatches arising from foreign branch losses are a double non-taxation risk and to leave them out of these proposals would expose the tax base to future risk. The remainder of the branch mismatch concerns addressed are very unlikely to arise in a New Zealand context. They will apply mostly to deny a deduction for a payment made by a New Zealand taxpayer to a foreign member of the same control group, if that payment is not taxed to the foreign member due to conflicts in branch tax rules between two countries other than New Zealand. De minimis rule 37. We recommend that there be no general de minimis for the hybrid rules. We believe that a de minimis may cause additional complexity given that other countries are not proposing a de minimis in their hybrid mismatch rules. This means that any de minimis would likely be ineffective in practice because the other country would still counter the hybrid mismatch using their secondary response right. Also, our proposals will ensure that simple branch structures (the most likely beneficiaries of a de minimis) are not within the scope of the rules. 38. We do however recommend that there should be specific de minimis rules for reverse hybrid entities established in New Zealand (see paragraphs 55-57). OECD recommendations Hybrid financial instrument rules (Recommendations 1 and 2) 39. The following diagram illustrates a typical hybrid financial instrument issued between related parties A Co and B Co. A Co. B Co. + - H yb rid Financial Instrument Deductible Country B Country A N on-assess able 8 40. Double non-taxation arises in this situation because the payment on the hybrid financial instrument is deductible (as interest) in Country B but not taxable (because it is treated as an exempt dividend) in Country A. 41. OECD recommendation 2 is a specific recommendation that countries should amend their domestic law so that dividend payments that are deductible to the payer (B Co) should be treated as ordinary income for the payee (A Co). 42. New Zealand already has a rule that switches off the general exemption for dividends received by a New Zealand company from a foreign company, if the dividend is deductible to the payer. We recommend that this rule be expanded to also apply if the foreign payer receives tax benefits similar in nature to a deduction. 43. We also recommend introducing rules in line with the general principles of OECD recommendation 1. This means that, in relation to hybrid financial instruments that are structured or between related parties, we should deny a New Zealand payer a deduction for the payment (when New Zealand is Country B) to the extent it is not taxed to a non-resident payee. It is in respect of this aspect of recommendation 1 that we are considering the election to treat interest payments as dividends. In addit io n, when New Zealand is Country A and Country B does not have hybrid rules, we should tax the New Zealand payee on the payment as ordinary income, with no entitlement to a tax credit. 44. We also recommend that when there is a timing mismatch that allows a deduction to be claimed in one country in a period that is significantly earlier than the period in which income is included in the other country, the rules above should also apply. Disregarded hybrid payments rule (Recommendation 3) 45. A hybrid entity is an entity which is transparent for tax purposes in the country of an investor (Country A) but opaque for tax purposes in another country, generally where it is established (Country B). In the following diagram, B Co is the hybrid entity. A Co. + - InterestLoan Country B Country A B Sub 1 B Co. 46. The interest payment by B Co is deductible in the hybrid entity country (Country B) but disregarded in the investor country (Country A) because Country A sees B Co as being part of A Co and therefore not capable of making a payment to itself. However, as the interest payment by B Co is deductible in Country B, if B Co has no other income, the payment produces a tax loss, which can be grouped with the income of B Sub 1. The payment can 9 therefore reduce taxable income in Country B without giving rise to any income in Country A, because of the different treatment of B Co in each country. This is a deductible/non- includible mismatch. 47. We recommend introducing rules in line with the general principles of OECD recommendation 3 in order to prevent double non-taxation arising from a payment by a hybrid entity. We recommend that, when New Zealand is Country B and payments are deductible here but are disregarded for tax purposes in Country A (and the payments are part of a structured arrangement or made to a person in the same control group), we should deny a deduction for the payment. Similarly, if New Zealand is Country A and the non-resident payer in Country B has not been denied a deduction for the payment under similar rules, we should tax the receipt by the New Zealand payee as ordinary income. 48. We recommend that deductions denied and income included by the above rules should be reversible to the extent that the hybrid entity has earned “dual inclusion income”, being income taxed in both Country A and Country B. This is because this dual inclusion income is included as inco me in both countries so the corresponding deduction should also be allowed in both countries. The dual inclusion income can be earned in the same period as the payment is made, in an earlier period, or in a later period. Reverse hybrid rules (Recommendations 4 and 5) 49. A reverse hybrid entity is an entity which is opaque for tax purposes in the country of an investor (Country A) but transparent for tax purposes in another country, generally where it is established (Country B). In the following diagram, B Co is the reverse hybrid. A Co. - Interest Loan Country B Country A B Co. C Co. Country C + 50. If B Co (the payee) is a reverse hybrid, double non-taxation arises because the interest payment is deductible to C Co (the payer) and not taxable to either B Co or A Co (the investor). Even on distribution by B Co to A Co it may not be taxable, if protected by an exemption for cross border intra-group dividends. The double non-taxation is due to a hybrid mismatch if the payment would have been taxable had it been made directly from C Co to A Co. 51. We recommend introducing rules in line with the general principles of OECD recommendation 4 to prevent double non-taxation arising from a payment to a reverse hybrid. We recommend that, when New Zealand is Country C, the New Zealand payer be denied a deduction for a payment to a reverse hybrid if the payment would have been taxed if paid directly to the investor (A Co). This rule would only apply when the payer, payee and investor are all in a control group or the payment is part of a structured arrangement. 10 52. OECD recommendation 5.1 is that countries should change their domestic law so that they tax residents on income not taxed in another country due to its being earned by a reverse hybrid. In other words, when New Zealand is Country A, we should tax A Co on the income of B Co if Country B does not tax it (because it treats B Co as transparent for tax purposes). 53. We recommend that New Zealand should have rules that are in line with the general principles of recommendation 5.1 and other international tax principles. New Zealand already has controlled foreign companies (CFC) rules that in most cases would prevent a reverse hybrid entity mismatch outcome from occurring when a New Zealand resident is the investor (A Co). We recommend that Cabinet delegate authority to us to determine whether our current CFC rules should be enhanced to deal with any forms of reverse hybrid income not currently dealt with, in line with the general principles of recommendation 5.1. 54. OECD recommendation 5.2 is that countries should change their domestic law so that they tax income which is earned by a reverse hybrid entity established in their country. So, when New Zealand is Country B, we recommend introducing rules in line with the general principles of this recommendation. As set out in the cover Cabinet paper and in paragraphs 24-25, this will require amendments to existing law regarding New Zealand limited partnerships and foreign trusts, which can be reverse hybrid entities depending on the tax treatment in the investor country. 55. In regards to limited partnerships, we recommend taxing the partnership income of a non-resident partner if they are in a control group with the partnership and not taxed on their share of the partnership income because their jurisdiction views the income as earned by the partnership as a separate taxpayer from the partner. This rule will only apply if the limited partnership has total foreign-sourced income of greater than $10,000 or 20% of its total income. This de minimis rule, and the corresponding one for foreign trusts in the following paragraphs, is consistent with the recently-enacted de minimis rule for foreign sourced income of look-through companies. 56. In regards to foreign trusts, we recommend taxing the foreign-source trustee income of the trust, provided that the non-resident settlor and trust are all in a control group. Many family trusts would meet this requirement. Foreign source trustee income will only be taxed if the non-resident settlor is not taxed on the trustee income in their residence country simply because the income is earned by the New Zealand trustee rather than the settlor directly. This rule will only apply if the trust has total foreign-sourced income of greater than $10,000 or 20% of its total income. 57. We also recommend taxing the foreign-source beneficiary income of a non-resident beneficiary of a foreign trust if they are not taxed on the income in their residence country because that country views the income as earned by the trustee and not the beneficiary. This rule will only apply if the trust has total foreign-sourced income of greater than $10,000 or 20% of its total income, and the non-resident beneficiary is part of a control group with the trust/trustee. In relation to both beneficiary and trustee income, tax would only be imposed if there was no-one else in the same control group required to include that income in their taxable income. 58. OECD recommendation 5.3 is that countries should consider improvements to record keeping and disclosure rules for tax transparent entities established in their country. Following the 2016 Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules, the disclosure rules for foreign trusts have been enhanced. New Zealand is regularly reviewed by the OECD to ensure that we are meeting international standards in this area. The Government will 11 continue to work with the OECD and make improvements to disclosure rules as necessary to ensure compliance with best practice. 59. We note that Australia has indicated that it is unlikely to implement any of recommendation 5 at this point – this is largely because they see their existing rules as adequate. However, they have reserved the right to do so in the future if integrity concerns arise. We are not as confident that our existing rules in relation to reverse hybrids are adequate to prevent mismatches from occurring. As set out above, we are concerned that leaving ‘gaps’ in our rules exposes our tax base to risks that can be mitigated by following all of the OECD’s recommendations. Hybrid entities – double deductions (Recommendation 6) 60. In addition to being capable of generating a deductible/non-inclusion hybrid mismatch, a hybrid entity can also be used to generate a double deduction mismatch. A diagram illustrating this possibility follows, where B Co is the hybrid entity. A Co. +- Interest Loan Country B Country A B Sub 1 B Co. Bank 61. Because A Co treats B Co as fiscally transparent, in Country A the interest paid by B Co is deductible against A Co’s other income. In Country B the interest payment can offset income earned by B Sub 1, which is in a tax consolidated group with B Co. This is a double non-taxation outcome because a single payment has been deducted against different income in two countries. 62. In Budget 2017 Cabinet agreed to restrict the ability of New Zealand businesses to use double deductions of foreign hybrid entities to reduce their tax liabilities in New Zealand \[CAB-17-MIN-0164\]. This means that, when New Zealand is Country A, the deductions in B Co would not flow back to New Zealand if it is possible for that deduction to also offset Country B income that does not flow back to A Co (in this case, the income of B Sub 1). 63. Nothing in this paper is inconsistent with that specific decision. However, as mentioned in paragraph 26-27, we are recommending a slightly narrowed approach to the OECD recommendation 6, whereby simple structures involving a New Zealand company with only an offshore branch would not fall within the scope of the rules. 64. We also recommend implementing a rule that would, when New Zealand is Country B, disallow the lo sses o f a foreign-owned New Zealand hybrid entity or branch when the country of the owner (Country A) has not denied the loss. 12 65. As with the recommendation 3 rule, denial of a deduction under the recommendation 6 rule should be reversed to the extent that the hybrid entity has dual inclusion income, whether in the current period, an earlier period, or a later period. Dual resident entities (Recommendation 7) 66. OECD recommendation 7 is that countries should deny a deduction to dual resident companies except to the extent of dual inclusion income. Expenditure incurred by a co mpany that is a resident of two different countries can potentially be used in each country to offset non-dual inclusion income, which is income taxed only in that country. This would achieve the same double deduction outcomes that hybrid ent it ies can produce under recommendation 6 (above). 67. New Zealand tax law already prevents a dual resident company from grouping its losses or forming a tax consolidated group. However, it does not prevent them offsetting expenditure against non-dual inclusion income earned through a reverse hybrid, such as (potentially) a New Zealand limited liability partnership. We recommend that New Zealand amend its existing rules relating to losses incurred by dual resident companies, to ensure they are fully effective to prevent deductions being taken against non-dual inclusion income. Imported mismatches (Recommendation 8) 68. As set out in paragraphs 28-29, we recommend that New Zealand introduce rules in line with OECD recommendation 8 to deny a deduction for a payment that funds another payment under a hybrid mismatch, including a branch mismatch. This is referred to as an imported mismatch rule. An example follows. Loan A Co. + - H yb rid Financial Instrument Country B Country A Borrower Co. B Co. Country C - + 69. In this example, New Zealand is Country C. The loan between A Co and B Co generates a deduction in Country B, with no corresponding income inclusion in Country A. This is a double non-taxation outcome. However, this tax mismatch is not counteracted because neither Country A nor Country B has hybrid rules. The tax benefit of the A/B mismatch helps fund the seemingly benign arrangement between B Co and the New Zealand entity (Borrower Co). 70. The imported mismatch rule would require New Zealand, as Country C, to deny a deduction for interest payments from Borrower Co to B Co to the extend they do not exceed the payments under the hybrid financial instrument between B Co and A Co. This is an integrity measure that prevents New Zealand’s other hybrid rules from being circumvented. 13 Without this rule, businesses in Country A can simply avoid our proposed rules by going from A to C via B. 71. We recommend that the imported mismatch rule applies to both structured arrangements that are designed to produce an imported mismatch outcome, and unstructured arrangements within a control group. However, because unstructured arrangements may not be deliberately contemplated, we are recommending a delayed implementation for those arrangements until more countries, the EU countries in particular, have hybrids rules in place. Agency consultation 72. The consultation on this project has been explained in the cover Cabinet paper. Briefly, there have been two rounds of consultation: one on the proposals in the discussion document; and a further round with selected submitters on branch mismatches and some of the detailed aspects set out in this paper. Financial implications 73. The proposed hybrid rule denying double deductions for foreign hybrid entities is estimated to increase tax revenue by $50 million per year from the 2019-20 year onwards. These amounts are already included in the forecasts as per Budget 2017 (CAB-17-MIN- 0164). 74. In addit io n, the proposed approach to grandparenting certain hybrid instruments as discussed at paragraphs 33-34 is expected to generate a total of $71 million over four years which is not currently included in the forecasts. This revenue is contingent on taxpayer behaviour after the implementation of the hybrid rules. 75. The combined revenue impact of all proposals is estimated as: $ million – increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue 2016 /17 2017 /18 2018 /19 2019 /20 2020 /21 2021 /22 2022/23 and out years Foreign hybrid entity double deductions (already included in forecast) 0 0 25 50 50 50 50 Hybrid instruments – grandparenting (new adjustment to forecasts) 0 0 19 19 19 14 0 Total revenue effect 0 0 44 69 69 64 50 Human rights, administrative impacts, legislative implications, publicity 76. These are set out in the accompanying covering Cabinet paper for the overall BEPS package (Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting). 14 Impact Analysis Requirements 77. Cabinet's Impact Analysis Requirements apply to these proposals and a Regulatory Impact Assessment is required. This has been prepared by Inland Revenue and is attached. 78. The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Regulatory Impact Assessment and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria. Recommendations 79. We recommend that Cabinet: 1. Agree that for payments under a financial instrument between related parties or that is a structured arrangement, and that results in a hybrid mismatch: a. to deny a New Zealand payer a deduction for the payment to the extent it is not taxed to a non-resident payee (OECD recommendation 1 primary rule); and b. if a non-resident payer has not been denied a deduction for the payment under similar rules, to tax a New Zealand payee on the payment as ordinary income, with no entitlement to a tax credit (OECD recommendation 1 defensive rule). 2. Agree to expand New Zealand’s current rule which denies a dividend exemption to a deductible dividend paid by a foreign company to a New Zealand company so that it also applies if the foreign payer receives tax benefits similar in nature to a deduction (OECD recommendation 2). 3. Agree that for payments made to a person in the same control group as the payee or pursuant to a structured transaction, where the payment is deductible to the payer but not recognised under the tax law in the payee country because the payment is disregarded under that law: a. to deny a deduction for the payment if made by a New Zealand payer (OECD recommendation 3 primary rule); b. if the payment is made by a non-resident, who is not denied a deduction under similar rules, to a New Zealand resident, to include the payment in ordinary income of the New Zealand resident (OECD recommendation 3 defensive rule); c. to allow any such deduction or income inclusion to be reversed to the extent that the deduction to the payer is set off against income that is included as income in both relevant countries (“dual inclusion income”). 4. Agree to deny a New Zealand payer a deduction in relation to payments made to a reverse hybrid entity in the same control group as the payer or pursuant to a structured transaction, where the payment is deductible to the payer but not included as income under the tax law in the reverse hybrid establishment country or in the country of the entity or person investing in the reverse hybrid entit y (OECD recommendation 4). 15 5. Agree that New Zealand should tax the income of a reverse hybrid established in New Zealand (such as a foreign trust or a limited partnership) to the extent that: a. the reverse hybrid income is not subject to tax in another jurisdiction (OECD recommendation 5.2); and b. the total foreign sourced income of the reverse hybrid exceeds the greater of $10,000 or 20% of the total income of the reverse hybrid. 6. Agree to the following in relation to double deduction outcomes produced by branches and hybrid entity structures: a. disallow the losses of a New Zealand-owned foreign hybrid entity or foreign branch if there is another entity in that foreign country whose income is capable of being offset against the losses of the hybrid entity or branch and that income is not taxable in New Zealand (modified OECD recommendation 6 primary); b. disallow the losses of a foreign-owned New Zealand hybrid entity or branch if the owner of the branch is not denied the loss under recommendation 6 primary rule in another country (OECD recommendation 6 defensive); and c. do not disallow losses (or reverse any previous disallowance) to the extent that the hybrid entity or branch earns dual inclusion income. 7. Agree to deny a deduction claimed in New Zealand by a dual resident company except to the extent that the dual resident company earns dual inclusion income (OECD recommendation 7). 8. Agree to deny a deduction in New Zealand for any payment that imports an offshore hybrid or branch mismatch arrangement into New Zealand, except to the extent that the payment is made to a country that has hybrid mismatch rules (OECD recommendation 8). 9. Note that, consistent with the Budget 2017 Cabinet paper (CAB-17-MIN-0164 refers), the hybrid rules should generally apply from 1 July 2018. 10. Agree that the effective date of the rule relating to unstructured imported mismatches (part of recommendation 8 above) should be delayed until 1 January 2020. 11. Agree that the application of the rule relating to New Zealand reverse hybrids (recommendation 5 above) should be for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2019. 12. Agree that there will be no general grandparenting of hybrid instruments or entities from the application of the hybrid mismatch rules, with the exception of hybrid financial instruments which are entitled to grandparented tax treatment until their next call date provided that they are: a. issued to satisfy the regulatory capital requirements imposed by New Zealand or Australian law; b. directly to, or are traceable to, issues to the public; and c. issued before the release of the Government’s Addressing Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements discussion document on 6 September 2016. 16 13. Note that the fiscal consequences of agreeing to recommendation 12 above is set out in the covering Cabinet paper for the overall BEPS package (Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting). 14. Agree to the detailed design proposals set out in the appendix to this paper. 15. Agree that the Ministers of Finance and Revenue be authorised to make decisions on further detail of these proposals, or to amend the detail in the appendix, provided any such decisions are not contradictory with the principles set out in recommendations 1 to 12, without further reference to Cabinet. 16. Agree to delegate authority to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue to make final policy decisions on the following policy issues wit hout further reference to Cabinet: a. whether New Zealand’s controlled foreign company (CFC) rules should be modified to include as attributable foreign income all inco me of a reverse hybrid entity which would have been taxed to the New Zealand investor had it derived the income directly but which is not taxed by the country of the entity because the entity is treated as fiscally transparent in that country (OECD recommendation 5.1); b. whether New Zealand can and should include a tightly targeted and simple optional regime whereby foreign hybrid entities can elect to be treated as opaque entities for New Zealand tax purposes; and c. whether, the payer under a hybrid financial arrangement for which a deduction is denied, should be allowed to treat the payment as a dividend for purposes of both (but not only one of) the non-resident withholding tax and the imputation credit rules. 17. Agree that the results of the decisions in recommendations 1-16 be included in a BEPS taxation bill to be introduced to Parliament before the end of 2017. Authorised for lodgement Hon Steven Joyce Minister of Finance Hon Judith Collins Minister of Revenue Appendix List of detailed design decisions OECD Recommendations 1 and 2 1. A person who receives a payment which is deductible to the payer in another country will not be entitled to the benefit of any imputation credit attached to the payment. 2. When the hybrid rules apply to a hybrid financial instrument issued by a New Zealand taxpayer and denominated in a foreign currency, the deduction denied will take into account any foreign currency fluctuations on the instrument which would otherwise be taken into account for tax purposes, and any net income from the instrument including any foreign currency fluctuations will be non- taxable. 3. When the hybrid rules apply to a hybrid financial instrument held by a New Zealand taxpayer and denominated in a foreign currency, the taxpayer will not take into account any foreign currency fluctuations on the instrument, unless the instrument is an interest in a FIF which is subject to the comparative value method. 4. To the extent that a payment on a hybrid financial instrument can be proven to give rise to taxation of an investor in the payee entit y under another country’s controlled foreign company (CFC) regime, the payer will be allowed a deduction for the payment. 5. If a person holds a FIF interest as part of a share repo arrangement, that person will be required to use the comparative value or attributed foreign income method to determine their income from the FIF interest. 6. If a person holds New Zealand shares as part of a share repo arrangement, where the borrower is a non-resident, the person is not entitled to the benefit of an imputation credit attached to any dividends on the shares. 7. OECD recommendation 1 will only apply to timing mismatches if: • the mismatch arises on an instrument with a term of 3 years or more or on an instrument that has been extended to beyond 3 years; and • the lender is not accounting for the payment, for tax purposes, on a reasonable accrual basis; and • it is not reasonable, having regard to the terms of the instrument and the payments made to date, to believe that the expenditure will be included in income in the payee’s accounting period beginning within 24 months 18 of the end of the period in which the expenditure is incurred. 8. Amendments be made to the non-resident withholding tax rules so that in determining whether the rules require tax to be withheld on an accrual (rather than payments) basis, amounts for which a deduction is denied or deferred under OECD recommendation 1 are not taken into account unless and until they are deducted. 9. Interest that is permanently denied a deduction under recommendation 1 and the debt under which that interest paid is disregarded for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules. 10. There will be no exclusion for regulatory capital issued by banks and insurance companies except for some issues made before the release of the discussion document (6 September 2016). OECD Recommendation 3 11. Any foreign currency fluctuations recognised for tax purposes in relation to a financial arrangement denominated in a foreign currency will be taken into account when denying a deduction to a New Zealand payer. 12. Dual inclusion income will be calculated in accordance with New Zealand tax principles on the income of the hybrid payer from activities that are taxed in New Zealand, except that it will not include income which is protected from New Zealand tax by a foreign tax credit. 13. For the purposes of denying a deduction for a New Zealand payer, full taxation of income under a CFC regime will prevent income being treated as not taxable to a payee and will qualify income as dual inclusion income where it is not otherwise taxed to the payee and is not sheltered from tax by a foreign tax credit. 14. When an amount of deemed hybrid income is reversed in a later year because it is offset against dual inclusion income, that will be taken into account in determining the limit on the amount of foreign tax credit for which a New Zealand taxpayer applying the defensive rule is eligible. 15. The ability to claim a deduction in relation to a later year due to future dual inclusion income will be lost if there is a more than 51% change in a company’s ownership since the time the relevant deduction was incurred or deemed expenditure arose. 16. Amendments be made to the non-resident withholding tax rules so that in determining whether the rules require tax to be withheld on an accrual (rather than payments) basis, amounts for which a deduction is deferred under OECD recommendation 3 are not taken into account unless and until they are deducted. 19 17. Denial of a deduction for interest under recommendation 3 will not affect the amount of recognised interest or amount of debt for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules. 18. A deduction would be denied where a branch is treated in the branch country as making a deductible payment to its head office which is not a simple allocation of third party costs. 19. Where a New Zealand taxpayer has recognized income as a result of receiving a disregarded payment from a foreign hybrid entity, that income will be reversed in a later year when there is dual inclusion income earned through the hybrid entity. OECD Recommendation 4 20. Diverted branch payments and payments made to a disregarded branch are included within the scope of recommendation 4. 21. Recommendation 4 deduction denial in respect of a payment under a foreign currency loan includes foreign currency gains or losses. 22. To the extent a payment to a reverse hybrid can be proven to be taxed under the CFC regime of an investor country, a deduction will be allowed. 23. Non-resident withholding tax will continue to be applied to payments, despite the denial of the deduction 24. Interest that is denied a deduction under recommendation 4 and the debt under which that interest paid is disregarded for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules. OECD Recommendation 5.2 25. Tax the partnership income of a non-resident partner of a New Zealand limited partnership if the non-resident partner is in a control group with the partnership and the non-resident partner is not taxed on their share of the income of the partnership because their jurisdiction views the income as earned by the partnership and not by the partner. 26. Tax a New Zealand resident trustee on foreign-sourced beneficiary income allocated to a non-resident beneficiary as if the trustee were a New Zealand resident individual taxpayer to the extent that: • the beneficiary is in the same control group as the trustee; and • the beneficiary would be taxed on income from the assets giving rise to the beneficiary income if it held the assets directly; and • the income is not subject to tax as the income of any person other than 20 the trustee (such as the beneficiary or settlor). 27. Tax a New Zealand trustee of a foreign trust on foreign-sourced trustee income to the extent that: • the settlor is in the same control group as the trustee; • the settlor would be taxed on the trustee income if it held the trust assets directly; and • the income is not subject to tax as the income of any person other than the trustee. 28. Include a de minimis so that none of the above recommendation 5.2 rules apply if the total foreign sourced income of the trustee does not exceed the greater of $10,000 and 20% of the total income of the trust. OECD Recommendation 6 29. There will be a transitional rule such that a New Zealand-owned foreign hybrid entity or foreign branch’s accumulated loss is recaptured where that entity or branch’s control group acquires an interest in an entity in the foreign country except in cases where the accumulated loss cannot be offset against current and future income of the newly acquired entity. 30. A deduction will be allowed in New Zealand for losses of New Zealand-owned foreign hybrid entities or foreign branches if those losses cannot ever be used in the foreign country 31. Income which can be shown to be taxable in the foreign country and in New Zealand under New Zealand’s CFC rules can be regarded as dual inclusion income except to the extent that the income is sheltered by a foreign tax credit. 32. Double deduction amounts and dual inclusion income amounts for a foreign hybrid entity or branch will be calculated in accordance with New Zealand tax principles on the income of the foreign hybrid entity/branch/ from activities that are taxed in New Zealand, except that income which is protected from New Zealand tax by a foreign tax credit will not be regarded as dual inclusion income. 33. The ability to claim a deduction in relation in a later year due to future dual inclusion income will be lost if there is a more than 51% change in a company’s ownership since the time the relevant deduction was incurred or deemed expenditure arose. 34. Amendments will be made to the non-resident withholding tax rules so that in determining whether the rules require tax to be withheld on an accrual (rather than payments) basis, amounts for which a deduction is deferred under OECD recommendations 6 are not taken into account unless and until they are 21 deducted. 35. Denial of a deduction for interest under recommendations 6 will not affect the amount of recognised interest or amount of debt for the purposes of thin capitalisation rules. OECD Recommendation 7 36. Amend existing consolidation and loss grouping rules for dual resident company losses to ensure that those losses cannot be offset against income earned by a New Zealand reverse hybrid. 37. Double deduction amounts and dual inclusion income amounts will be calculated in accordance with New Zealand tax principles on the income of the dual resident company from activities that are taxed in New Zealand, except that income which is protected from New Zealand tax by a foreign tax credit will not be regarded as dual inclusion income. 38. The ability to claim a deduction in relation in a later year due to future dual inclusion income will be lost if there is a more than 51% change in a company’s ownership since the time the relevant deduction was incurred. 39. Denial of a deduction for interest will not affect the amount of recognised interest or amount of debt for the purposes of thin capitalisation rules. OECD Recommendation 8 40. When recommendation 8 applies to a payment that imports an offshore hybrid or branch mismatch arrangement into New Zealand, the deduction denied will ignore any foreign currency fluctuations on the instrument. 41. Interest that is denied a deduction under recommendation 8 and the debt under which that interest paid is disregarded for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules General design and definitional matters 42. A coordination rule will be included in the hybrid rules to ensure that the hybrid mismatch rules of other countries mesh well with New Zealand’s rules. 43. A specific anti-avoidance rule will be included in the hybrid rules to allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to counteract arrangements that have the purpose or effect of defeating the intent or application of the hybrid rules.

**BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules**

Proposal
========

This paper seeks Cabinet approval to strengthen New Zealand’s rules that prevent excess interest deductions being taken in New Zealand. This paper is part of a comprehensive package of measures to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS).

Executive summary
=================

The use of debt is one of the simplest BEPS strategies. Multinationals with excessive levels of debt, or with related-party debt with high interest rates, have large interest deductions leaving little taxable profit in New Zealand. Robust rules limiting the use of debt (and the interest rates of that debt) are important base protection measures.

We recommend that Cabinet agree in principle to two major reforms to our interest limitation rules:

*   *   a _restricted transfer pricing_ _rule_ for setting the allowable interest rate on related-party loans from a non-resident to a New Zealand borrower; and
    *   tightening the rules that set the debt levels allowed in New Zealand for taxpayers with international connections (the thin capitalisation rules) – in particular, setting the allowable debt level with reference to the taxpayer’s assets net of its non-debt liabilities.

We also recommend several minor improvements to the rules to ensure they are robust and fit for purpose.

These changes follow the Government discussion document _BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules (March 2017)._ In general, submitters on the discussion document acknowledged the need to respond to BEPS concerns but most did not agree with the specific proposals put forward.

Some of the proposals have been modified in response to these submissions. In particular, the approach for setting the allowable interest rate on related-party loans is different to that proposed in the discussion document. We anticipate that this new approach will address many, but not all, of submitters’ concerns.

There are some technical elements to these reforms that could benefit from further discussion with stakeholders. We therefore request that authority be delegated to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue to finalise the reforms.

The forecast revenue from implementing these changes is $45m in 2018/19 and $90m per annum from 2019/20. Note, however, that one technical detail to be canvassed in the further discussion with stakeholders could reduce the forecast revenue by up to $10m per annum.

Background
==========

The use of debt is one of the simplest BEPS strategies. Multinationals with excessive levels of debt, or with related-party debt with high interest rates, are able to take large interest deductions. This results in little taxable profit being left in New Zealand. Robust rules limiting the use of debt (and the interest rates of that debt) are important base protection measures.

Accordingly, in March this year the Government released the discussion document _BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules_. There were two key proposals: one to strengthen how related-party debt is priced, and one tightening the rules governing allowable debt levels.

The discussion document also recommended several minor improvements to New Zealand’s interest limitation rules to ensure they are robust and fit for purpose.

Comment
=======

The majority of multinationals operating in New Zealand have relatively conservative debt positions, and the Government is committed to making sure New Zealand remains an attractive place for them to do business.

However, there are some multinationals that deliberately attempt to minimise their tax payments in New Zealand by engaging in BEPS strategies, such as by having related-party debt with excessive interest rates. These multinationals should not be allowed to exploit weaknesses in the current rules to achieve a competitive advantage over more compliant multinationals or domestic firms.

Accordingly, we recommend changes to New Zealand’s interest limitation rules, most significantly:

*   *   a _restricted transfer pricing_ _rule_ for setting the allowable interest rate on related-party loans from a non-resident to a New Zealand borrower; and
    *   tightening the thin capitalisation rules, which set the debt levels allowed in New Zealand for taxpayers either with foreign parents (the inbound rules) or foreign subsidiaries (the outbound rules) – in particular, setting the allowable debt level with reference to the taxpayer’s assets net of its non-debt liabilities.

Restricted transfer pricing
---------------------------

When borrowing from a third party (such as a bank), commercial pressure will drive the borrower to obtain a low interest rate. The same pressure does not necessarily exist in a related-party context, such as when a New Zealand subsidiary borrows from its foreign parent. A rule to constrain the interest rate of such debt is necessary. Transfer pricing rules provide the current constraint on interest rates.

Broadly speaking, transfer pricing a loan agreement involves determining (hypothetically) the interest rate a third party lender would be willing to lend at, given the terms and conditions of the related-party loan. It is a fact specific and resource intensive exercise and can be manipulated (for example, by adding terms and conditions to the related-party loan that are not frequently seen between unrelated parties). We note that commentators such as Richard Vann, a professor of tax at the University of Sydney, have said that ordinary transfer pricing is unsuited to pricing related-party financing transactions.

For these reasons, the international consensus is moving away from using ordinary transfer pricing as the primary mechanism to limit the interest rates on related-party debt. The OECD, for example, has recommended that countries adopt a simple formulaic approach for limiting interest deductions, which would largely eliminate the advantage of using related-party debt with excessive interest rates (this approach was raised in consultation but was not supported by submitters as it would make a taxpayer’s allowable interest deductions volatile. Instead, as outlined below, we are recommending that the current rules for setting allowable debt levels be buttressed by rules that ensure related-party interest rates are appropriate).

Accordingly, we recommend that the allowable interest rate for inbound related-party loans be determined under a _restricted transfer pricing_ methodology. Inbound related-party loans would be priced following the standard transfer pricing methodology. However, it would contain two additional elements to clarify that:

*   *   There is a rebuttable presumption that the New Zealand subsidiary would be supported by its foreign parent; and
    *   All circumstances, terms, and conditions that could result in an excessive interest rate will be required to be ignored – unless the taxpayer can demonstrate that they have substantial third party debt featuring those terms and conditions.

The combined effect of these additional elements is that the interest rate on related-party debt will generally be in line with the interest rate facing the New Zealand borrower’s foreign parent.

This _restricted transfer pricing rule_ would be coupled with a safe harbour, which would be based on the interest rate cap as initially proposed. This could be provided administratively. A related-party loan with an interest rate that is the same as the interest rate facing the borrower’s foreign parent would automatically be considered acceptable. This safe harbour would be attractive to many companies as it is both simple and provides certainty.

We note that the Australian Taxation Office has recently released administrative guidelines which outline a similar approach for limiting related-party interest rates (albeit Australia is implementing this approach as an operational policy, rather than a law change).

### Private sector consultation

This _restricted transfer pricing rule_ is different to the proposal suggested in the March discussion document. The original proposal was a hard rule to cap the interest rate a foreign parent could charge its New Zealand subsidiary based on the foreign parent’s credit rating (an “interest rate cap”).

We consider that the _restricted transfer pricing rule_ is a more workable way of achieving essentially the same objective – ensuring the interest rate on related-party debt is in line with what would actually be paid on third party debt. While the methods (restricted transfer pricing and the interest rate cap) are different in approach, the outcome of both will generally be the same – with differences only at the margin. Accordingly, both approaches have the same revenue impact.

Submitters on the March discussion document did not support the original proposal. Many submitters argued that a new approach for pricing related-party debt is unnecessary, noting that the Government proposed to strengthen the transfer pricing rules generally (in the other March discussion document _BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_).

Some submissions highlighted the consequences of adopting a blunt rule in the nature of the cap. These include concerns that:

*   *   the cap is not a good proxy for an arm’s length interest rate in some situations and so could result in double taxation;
    *   the cap would deny deductions even when the amount of debt in the subsidiary was low;
    *   the cap may increase compliance costs, for example, where a foreign parent has no credit rating (about half of New Zealand’s largest foreign-owned businesses are owned by companies with no credit rating); and
    *   the proposal involves different rules for firms owned by a group of non-residents rather than a single foreign parent, which creates perceptions of unfairness.

It should be noted that the _restricted transfer pricing rule_ we are recommending will address many, but not all, of submitters’ concerns because it is still a significant departure from using ordinary transfer pricing. Accordingly, we expect it will be more acceptable compared to the originally proposed interest rate cap because:

*   *   it allows for some limited flexibility – meaning the allowable interest rate can depart from the cost of funds facing the foreign parent if that is appropriate in the circumstances; and
    *   it would be subject to the Mutual Agreement Procedure under New Zealand’s Double Tax Agreements, meaning taxpayers who consider that the new rule is inconsistent with the relevant treaty could seek resolution. This will address double taxation concerns. We do not, however, expect this will occur with any frequency because of the shift in the international consensus on what is acceptable in relation to the pricing of related-party debt.

Allowable debt levels in the thin capitalisation rules
------------------------------------------------------

New Zealand has rules to prevent the excessive use of debt by foreign-owned entities operating in New Zealand (inbound investment) and New Zealand-owned entities with international operations (outbound investment). Interest deductions are denied to the extent that the entity’s debt level with reference to its assets is determined to be excessive.

The March discussion document proposed changing this, so that a taxpayer’s maximum debt level is set with reference to the taxpayer’s assets net of its non-debt liabilities (that is, its liabilities other than its interest bearing debts). Some common examples of non-debt liabilities are accounts payable, reserves and provisions, and deferred tax liabilities.

The core objectives of the thin capitalisation rules are better served with the non-debt liability adjustment. Under the current rules, where non-debt liabilities are ignored, companies are able to have high levels of debt (and therefore high interest deductions) relative to the capital invested in the company. The current treatment of non-debt liabilities also mean the rules apply unevenly across companies: companies with the same level of profit or loss can have very different thin capitalisation outcomes, depending on their non-debt liabilities.

In addition, one of the objectives of the thin capitalisation rules (ensuring that a taxpayer is limited to a commercial level of debt) is undermined by the current treatment of non-debt liabilities. A third party lender, when assessing the credit worthiness of a borrower, would take into account its non-debt liabilities.

Australia requires this same adjustment for non-debt liabilities.

### Private sector consultation

This proposal was accepted by some submitters but opposed by others who argued, for example, that the proposal amounts to a substantial reduction in the amount of deductible debt allowable under the thin capitalisation rules. Overall, this proposal was much less contentious than the interest rate cap.

None of the submissions against the core proposal convinced us that the analysis above, suggesting that the non-debt liability adjustment is appropriate, is incorrect. Accordingly, we recommend that the proposed adjustment to the allowable debt level under the thin capitalisation rule proceed. That is, a taxpayer’s allowable debt level under the rules should be set with reference to their assets net of their non-debt liabilities.

A near-universal comment from submitters was that certain non-debt liabilities – most significantly _deferred tax liabilities_ – should be carved out from the proposed non-debt liability adjustment. Deferred tax is an accounting concept. Accounting standards require that companies recognise deferred tax on their balance sheets in certain situations. In principle, a deferred tax liability is supposed to represent future tax payments that a taxpayer will be required to make. Submitters argued that this is often not the case – deferred tax liabilities are frequently technical accounting entries and do not reflect future tax obligations. Submitters also pointed to the rules in Australia, which do include a carve-out for deferred tax liabilities and assets.

We recommend further consultation on whether deferred tax should be carved-out from this non-debt liability adjustment. Many, but not all, deferred tax liabilities represent a genuine requirement that tax on current accounting profits will be payable in the future. Given the concerns raised by submitters, further consultation on this technical detail would be beneficial.

Other changes
-------------

We recommend five other changes to the thin capitalisation rules:

*   *   a special rule for infrastructure projects (such as public private partnerships) that are controlled by a single non-resident;
    *   a de minimis for the inbound thin capitalisation rules;
    *   reducing the ability for companies owned by a group of non-residents to use related-party debt;
    *   removing the ability to use asset valuations for the thin capitalisation rules that differ from those reported in a firm’s financial accounts; and
    *   removing the ability to measure assets and debts on the final day of a firm’s income year.

These measures were all discussed in the March discussion document. Some were supported by submitters, while others were opposed. Where they were opposed, we are recommending changes to the proposals which will, in general, address submitters’ concerns.

### Rule for infrastructure projects

We recommend a special rule that allows all of a taxpayer’s third party debt to be deductible even if the debt levels exceed the normal thin capitalisation limits, provided the debt is non-recourse with interest funded solely from project income.

This will allow a wider group of investors to participate in public-private partnerships without interest expense denial than has been possible previously.

This rule was well received by submitters; however, some technical issues have been raised which we will consult further on.

### De minimis for the inbound rules

The thin capitalisation rules that apply to New Zealand-owned taxpayers with foreign operations (the outbound rules) has a de minimis (the rules do not apply if a taxpayer has interest deductions of less than $1 million). The thin capitalisation rules that apply to foreign-owned taxpayers (the inbound rules) do not have a similar de minimis.

We recommend the current de minimis in the outbound rules be extended to taxpayers subject to the inbound rules, provided the taxpayer has only third party debt. This proposal is to reduce compliance costs for small foreign-owned entities that have a low risk of BEPS.

This proposal was generally supported by submitters.

### Allowable debt levels for companies owned by a group of non-residents

At present, when an entity is controlled by a group of non-residents acting together, its allowable debt level is the greater of:

*   *   60 percent; and
    *   110 percent of its third party debt.

However, this means that a taxpayer with high levels of third party debt can be funded with almost no equity. For example, a project funded 90 percent with third party debt could have 9 percent shareholder debt and only 1 percent equity.

To address this, we recommend changing this test so that, if an entity has a debt level in excess of 60 percent, the interest deductions on its related-party debt should be denied to the extent the entity’s debt level exceeded 60 percent. This proposal was generally accepted by submitters.

The March discussion document proposed that this change be grandparented, as the rules it relates to (for non-residents acting together) have only just taken effect. We recommend that the precise design of this grandparenting be subject to further consultation with stakeholders, with decisions on its final design being delegated to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue.

### Asset valuations

In general, the thin capitalisation rules are based on the value of a company’s assets as reported in its financial statements. However, a company may use the net current value of an asset as an alternative to its financial statement value, provided that would be allowable under generally accepted accounting principles.

While it is permissible to use an asset’s net current value, the thin capitalisation rules set out what is required if taxpayers utilise this option. Accordingly, we recommend that this new net current valuation option be available only if certain criteria are met – such as if the valuation is from an independent expert valuer.

Recommendations
===============

We recommend that the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee:

1.  **Note** that in March this year the Government released a discussion document called _BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules_ which proposed some detailed measures to improve our ability to tax multinationals that operate in New Zealand.
2.  **Note** that in response to submissions we have made the proposed measures better targeted at the BEPS concerns without reducing their overall effectiveness.
3.  **Agree** that the interest rate on inbound related-party loans should be set using a _restricted transfer pricing_ rule, whereby the interest rate is set under transfer pricing but ignoring all surrounding circumstances, terms, and conditions that could result in an excessive interest rate unless similar terms apply to significant amounts of third party debt, and with the rebuttable presumption that the borrower would be supported by its foreign parent.
4.  **Agree** that a taxpayer’s allowable debt level in the thin capitalisation rules should be set with reference to its assets less its non-debt liabilities.
5.  **Agree** that the de minimis in the outbound thin capitalisation rules, which provides an exemption from the rules for groups with interest deductions of $1 million or less, be made available also to foreign-controlled taxpayers provided they have no owner-linked debt.
6.  **Agree** that an exemption should be provided from the thin capitalisation rules for certain infrastructure projects funded entirely with third party limited recourse loans.
7.  **Agree** that, when an entity is controlled by a group of non-residents acting together, interest deductions on any related-party debt should be denied to the extent the entity’s debt level exceeds 60 percent.
8.  **Agree** that clear legislative requirements be developed for when taxpayers choose to value their assets for thin capitalisation purposes on a basis other than that used in their financial accounts.
9.  **Agree** that an anti-avoidance rule should be inserted into the thin capitalisation rules, to apply when a taxpayer substantially repays a loan just before the end of the year.
10.  **Note** that the fiscal consequences of the above measures are set out in the covering Cabinet paper for the overall BEPS package (_Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting_).
11.  **Delegate** authority to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue to make final decisions on the detailed design of the above measures.
12.  **Authorise** the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue jointly to take final decisions on the extent to which deferred tax liabilities are included in non-debt liabilities, up to a limit of reducing the level of expected revenue increases anticipated by the BEPS measures as set out in recommendation 7 in the accompanying Cabinet paper  _Tax Measures To Prevent Base Erosion And Profit Shifting_ by up to $10 million per annum
13.  **Agree** that the results of the decisions in recommendations 3-12 be included in a BEPS taxation bill to be introduced to Parliament before the end of 2017.

In Confidence Office of the Minister of Finance Office of the Minister of Revenue Ca binet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules Proposal 1.This paper seeks Cabinet approval to strengthen New Zealand’s rules that prevent excess interest deductions being taken in New Zealand. This paper is part of a comprehensive package of measures to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). Executive summary 2.The use of debt is one of the simplest BEPS strategies. Multinationals with excessive levels of debt, or with related-party debt with high interest rates, have large interest deductions leaving little taxable profit in New Zealand. Robust rules limiting the use of debt (and the interest rates of that debt) are important base protection measures. 3.We recommend that Cabinet agree in principle to two major reforms to our interest limitation rules: •a restricted transfer pricing rule for setting the allowable interest rate on related- party loans from a non-resident to a New Zealand borrower; and •tightening the rules that set the debt levels allowed in New Zealand for taxpayers with international connections (the thin capitalisation rules) – in particular, setting the allowable debt level with reference to the taxpayer’s assets net of its non-debt liabilities. 4.We also recommend several minor improvements to the rules to ensure they are robust and fit for purpose. 5.These changes follow the Government discussio n document BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules (March 2017). In general, submitters on the discussion document acknowledged the need to respond to BEPS concerns but most did not agree with the specific proposals put forward. 6.Some of the proposals have been modified in response to these submissions. In particular, the approach for setting the allowable interest rate on related-party loans is different to that proposed in the discussion document. We anticipate that this new approach will address many, but not all, of submitters’ concerns. 7.There are some technical elements to these reforms that could benefit from further discussion with stakeholders. We therefore request that authority be delegated to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue to finalise the reforms. Treasury:3750405v1 BEPS documents release - August 2017: #15 2 8. The forecast revenue from implementing these changes is $45m in 2018/19 and $90m per annum from 2019/20. Note, however, that one technical detail to be canvassed in the further discussion with stakeholders could reduce the forecast revenue by up to $10m per annum. Background 9. The use of debt is one of the simplest BEPS strategies. Multinationals with excessive levels of debt, or with related-party debt with high interest rates, are able to take large interest deductions. This result s in litt le taxable profit being left in New Zealand. Robust rules limiting the use of debt (and the interest rates of that debt) are important base protection measures. 10. Accordingly, in March this year the Government released the discussion document BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules. There were two key proposals: one to strengthen how related-party debt is priced, and one tightening the rules governing allowable debt levels. 11. The discussion document also recommended several minor improvements to New Zealand’s interest limitation rules to ensure they are robust and fit for purpose. Comment 12. The majority of multinationals operating in New Zealand have relatively conservative debt positions, and the Government is committed to making sure New Zealand remains an attractive place for them to do business. 13. However, there are some multinationals that deliberately attempt to minimise their tax payments in New Zealand by engaging in BEPS strategies, such as by having related-party debt with excessive interest rates. These multinationals should not be allowed to exploit weaknesses in the current rules to achieve a competitive advantage over more compliant multinationals or domestic firms. 14. Accordingly, we recommend changes to New Zealand’s interest limitation rules, most significantly: • a restricted transfer pricing rule for setting the allowable interest rate on related- party loans from a non-resident to a New Zealand borrower; and • tightening the thin capitalisation rules, which set the debt levels allowed in New Zealand for taxpayers either with foreign parents (the inbound rules) or foreign subsidiaries (the outbound rules) – in particular, setting the allowable debt level with reference to the taxpayer’s assets net of its non-debt liabilities. Restricted transfer pricing 15. When borrowing from a third party (such as a bank), commercial pressure will drive the borrower to obtain a low interest rate. The same pressure does not necessarily exist in a related-party context, such as when a New Zealand subsidiary borrows from its foreig n parent. A rule to constrain the interest rate of such debt is necessary. Transfer pricing rules provide the current constraint on interest rates. 3 16. Broadly speaking, transfer pricing a loan agreement involves determining (hypothetically) the interest rate a third party lender would be willing to lend at, given the terms and conditions of the related-party loan. It is a fact specific and resource intensive exercise and can be manipulated (for example, by adding terms and conditions to the related- party loan that are not frequently seen between unrelated parties). We note that commentators such as Richard Vann, a professor of tax at the University of Sydney, have said that ordinary transfer pricing is unsuited to pricing related-party financing transactions. 17. For these reasons, the international consensus is moving away from using ordinary transfer pricing as the primary mechanism to limit the interest rates on related-party debt. The OECD, for example, has recommended that countries adopt a simple formulaic approach for limiting interest deductions, which would largely eliminate the advantage of using related- party debt with excessive interest rates (this approach was raised in consultation but was not supported by submitters as it would make a taxpayer’s allowable interest deductions volatile. Instead, as outlined below, we are recommending that the current rules for setting allowable debt levels be buttressed by rules that ensure related-party interest rates are appropriate). 18. Accordingly, we recommend that the allowable interest rate for inbound related-party loans be determined under a restricted transfer pricing methodology. Inbound related-party loans would be priced following the standard transfer pricing methodology. However, it would contain two additional elements to clarify that: • There is a rebuttable presumption that the New Zealand subsidiary would be supported by its foreign parent; and • All circumstances, terms, and conditions that could result in an excessive interest rate will be required to be ignored – unless the taxpayer can demonstrate that they have substantial third party debt featuring those terms and conditions. 19. The combined effect of these additional elements is that the interest rate on related-party debt will generally be in line with the interest rate facing the New Zealand borrower’s foreign parent. 20. This restricted transfer pricing rule would be coupled with a safe harbour, which would be based on the interest rate cap as initially proposed. This could be provided administratively. A related-party loan with an interest rate that is the same as the interest rate facing the borrower’s foreign parent would automatically be considered acceptable. This safe harbour would be attractive to many companies as it is both simple and provides certainty. 21. We note that the Australian Taxation Office has recently released administrative guidelines which outline a similar approach for limiting related-party interest rates (albeit Australia is implementing this approach as an operational policy, rather than a law change). Private sector consultation 22. This restricted transfer pricing rule is different to the proposal suggested in the March discussion document. The original proposal was a hard rule to cap the interest rate a foreign parent could charge its New Zealand subsidiary based on the foreign parent’s credit rating (an “interest rate cap”). 23. We consider that the restricted transfer pricing rule is a more workable way of achieving essentially the same objective – ensuring the interest rate on related-party debt is in line with what would actually be paid on third party debt. While the methods (restricted 4 transfer pricing and the interest rate cap) are different in approach, the outcome of both will generally be the same – with differences only at the margin. Accordingly, both approaches have the same revenue impact. 24. Submitters on the March discussion document did not support the original proposal. Many submitters argued that a new approach for pricing related-party debt is unnecessary, noting that the Government proposed to strengthen the transfer pricing rules generally (in the other March discussion document BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance). 25. Some submissions highlighted the consequences of adopting a blunt rule in the nature of the cap. These include concerns that: • the cap is not a good proxy for an arm’s length interest rate in some situations and so could result in double taxation; • the cap would deny deductions even when the amount of debt in the subsidiary was low; • the cap may increase compliance costs, for example, where a foreign parent has no credit rating (about half of New Zealand’s largest foreign-owned businesses are owned by companies with no credit rating); and • the proposal involves different rules for firms owned by a group of non-residents rather than a single foreign parent, which creates perceptions of unfairness. 26. It should be noted that the restricted transfer pricing rule we are recommending will address many, but not all, of submitters’ concerns because it is still a significant departure from using ordinary transfer pricing. Accordingly, we expect it will be more acceptable compared to the originally proposed interest rate cap because: • it allo ws for some limit ed flexibilit y – meaning the allowable interest rate can depart from the cost of funds facing the foreign parent if that is appropriate in the circumstances; and • it would be subject to the Mutual Agreement Procedure under New Zealand’s Double Tax Agreements, meaning taxpayers who consider that the new rule is inconsistent with the relevant treaty could seek resolution. This will address double taxation concerns. We do not, however, expect this will occur with any frequency because of the shift in the international consensus on what is acceptable in relation to the pricing of related-party debt. Allowable debt levels in the thin capitalisation rules 27. New Zealand has rules to prevent the excessive use of debt by foreign-owned ent it ies operating in New Zealand (inbound investment) and New Zealand-owned ent it ies wit h international operations (outbound investment). Interest deductions are denied to the extent that the entity’s debt level with reference to its assets is determined to be excessive. 28. The March discussion document proposed changing this, so that a taxpayer’s maximum debt level is set with reference to the taxpayer’s assets net of its non-debt liabilities (that is, its liabilities other than its interest bearing debts). Some common examples of non-debt liabilities are accounts payable, reserves and provisions, and deferred tax liabilities. 5 29. The core objectives of the thin capitalisation rules are better served with the non-debt liability adjustment. Under the current rules, where non-debt liabilities are ignored, companies are able to have high levels of debt (and therefore high interest deductions) relative to the capital invested in the company. The current treatment of non-debt liabilities also mean the rules apply unevenly across companies: companies with the same level of profit or loss can have very different thin capitalisation outcomes, depending on their non-debt liabilities. 30. In addition, one of the objectives of the thin capitalisation rules (ensuring that a taxpayer is limited to a commercial level of debt) is undermined by the current treatment of non-debt liabilities. A third party lender, when assessing the credit worthiness of a borrower, would take into account its non-debt liabilities. 31. Australia requires this same adjustment for non-debt liabilities. Private sector consultation 32. This proposal was accepted by some submitters but opposed by others who argued, for example, that the proposal amounts to a substantial reduction in the amount of deductible debt allowable under the thin capitalisation rules. Overall, this proposal was much less contentious than the interest rate cap. 33. None of the submissions against the core proposal convinced us that the analysis above, suggesting that the non-debt liability adjustment is appropriate, is incorrect. Accordingly, we recommend that the proposed adjustment to the allowable debt level under the thin capitalisation rule proceed. That is, a taxpayer’s allowable debt level under the rules should be set with reference to their assets net of their non-debt liabilities. 34. A near-universal comment from submitters was that certain non-debt liabilities – most significantly deferred tax liabilities – should be carved out from the proposed non-debt liability adjustment. Deferred tax is an accounting concept. Accounting standards require that companies recognise deferred tax on their balance sheets in certain situations. In principle, a deferred tax liability is supposed to represent future tax payments that a taxpayer will be required to make. Submitters argued that this is often not the case – deferred tax liabilities are frequently technical accounting entries and do not reflect future tax obligations. Submitters also pointed to the rules in Australia, which do include a carve-out for deferred tax liabilities and assets. 35. We recommend further consultation on whether deferred tax should be carved-out from this non-debt liability adjustment. Many, but not all, deferred tax liabilities represent a genuine requirement that tax on current accounting profits will be payable in the future. Given the concerns raised by submitters, further consultation on this technical detail would be beneficial. Other changes 36. We recommend five other changes to the thin capitalisation rules: • a special rule for infrastructure projects (such as public private partnerships) that are controlled by a single non-resident; • a de minimis for the inbound thin capitalisation rules; • reducing the ability for companies owned by a group of non-residents to use related-party debt; 6 • removing the ability to use asset valuations for the thin capitalisation rules that differ from those reported in a firm’s financial accounts; and • removing the ability to measure assets and debts on the final day of a firm’s income year. 37. These measures were all discussed in the March discussion document. Some were supported by submitters, while others were opposed. Where they were opposed, we are recommending changes to the proposals which will, in general, address submitters’ concerns. Rule for infrastructure projects 38. We recommend a special rule that allows all of a taxpayer’s third party debt to be deductible even if the debt levels exceed the normal thin capitalisation limits, provided the debt is non-recourse with interest funded so lely from pro ject inco me. 39. This will allow a wider group of investors to participate in public-private partnerships without interest expense denial than has been possible previously. 40. This rule was well received by submitters; however, some technical issues have been raised which we will consult further on. De minimis for the inbound rules 41. The thin capitalisation rules that apply to New Zealand-owned taxpayers with foreign operations (the outbound rules) has a de minimis (the rules do not apply if a taxpayer has interest deductions of less than $1 million). The thin capitalisation rules that apply to foreign- owned taxpayers (the inbound rules) do not have a similar de minimis. 42. We recommend the current de minimis in the outbound rules be extended to taxpayers subject to the inbound rules, provided the taxpayer has only third party debt. This proposal is to reduce compliance costs for small foreign-owned entities that have a low risk of BEPS. 43. This proposal was generally supported by submitters. Allowable debt levels for companies owned by a group of non-residents 44. At present, when an entity is controlled by a group of non-residents acting together, its allowable debt level is the greater of: • 60 percent; and • 110 percent of its third party debt. 45. However, this means that a taxpayer with high levels of third party debt can be funded with almo st no equit y. For example, a project funded 90 percent with third party debt could have 9 percent shareholder debt and only 1 percent equity. 46. To address this, we recommend changing this test so that, if an entity has a debt level in excess of 60 percent, the interest deductions on its related-party debt should be denied to the extent the entity’s debt level exceeded 60 percent. This proposal was generally accepted by submitters. 7 47. The March discussion document proposed that this change be grandparented, as the rules it relates to (for non-residents acting together) have only just taken effect. We recommend that the precise design of this grandparenting be subject to further consultation with stakeholders, with decisions on its final design being delegated to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue. Asset valuations 48. In general, the thin capitalisation rules are based on the value of a company’s assets as reported in its financial statements. However, a company may use the net current value of an asset as an alternative to its financial statement value, provided that would be allowable under generally accepted accounting principles. 49. While it is permissible to use an asset’s net current value, the thin capitalisation rules set out what is required if taxpayers utilise this option. Accordingly, we recommend that this new net current valuation option be available only if certain criteria are met – such as if the valuation is from an independent expert valuer. Agency consultation 50. Inland Revenue and Treasury officials have consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment on this Cabinet paper. Financial implications, human rights, administrative impacts, legislative implications, and publicity 51. These are set out in the accompanying covering Cabinet paper for the overall BEPS package (Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting). Impact Analysis Requirements 52. Cabinet's Impact Analysis Requirements apply to these proposals and a Regulatory Impact Assessment is required. This has been prepared by Inland Revenue and is attached. 53. The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Regulatory Impact Assessment and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria. 8 Recommendations 54. We recommend that the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee: 1. Note that in March this year the Government released a discussion document called BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules which proposed some detailed measures to improve our ability to tax multinationals that operate in New Zealand. 2. Note that in response to submissions we have made the proposed measures better targeted at the BEPS concerns without reducing their overall effectiveness. 3. Agree that the interest rate on inbound related-party loans should be set using a restricted transfer pricing rule, whereby the interest rate is set under transfer pricing but ignoring all surrounding circumstances, terms, and conditions that could result in an excessive interest rate unless similar terms apply to significant amounts of third party debt, and with the rebuttable presumption that the borrower would be supported by its foreign parent. 4. Agree that a taxpayer’s allowable debt level in the thin capitalisation rules should be set with reference to its assets less its non-debt liabilities. 5. Agree that the de minimis in the outbound thin capitalisation rules, which provides an exemption from the rules for groups with interest deductions of $1 million or less, be made available also to foreign-controlled taxpayers provided they have no owner-linked debt. 6. Agree that an exemption should be provided from the thin capitalisation rules for certain infrastructure projects funded entirely with third party limited recourse loans. 7. Agree that, when an entity is controlled by a group of non-residents acting together, interest deductions on any related-party debt should be denied to the extent the entity’s debt level exceeds 60 percent. 8. Agree that clear legislative requirements be developed for when taxpayers choose to value their assets for thin capitalisation purposes on a basis other than that used in their financial accounts. 9. Agree that an anti-avoidance rule should be inserted into the thin capitalisation rules, to apply when a taxpayer substantially repays a loan just before the end o f the year. 10. Note that the fiscal consequences of the above measures are set out in the covering Cabinet paper for the overall BEPS package (Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting). 11. Delegate authority to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue to make final decisions on the detailed design of the above measures. 12. Authorise the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue jointly to take final decisions on the extent to which deferred tax liabilities are included in non- debt liabilities, up to a limit of reducing the level of expected revenue increases 9 anticipated by the BEPS measures as set out in recommendation 7 in the accompanying Cabinet paper Tax Measures To Prevent Base Erosion And Profit Shifting by up to $10 million per annum 13. Agree that the results of the decisions in recommendations 3-12 be included in a BEPS taxation bill to be introduced to Parliament before the end of 2017.

Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach
--------------------------------------

|     |
| --- |
| Problem Definition  <br>What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required?<br>============================================================================================================================= |
| The problem the proposals discussed in this impact statement seek to address is the use of debt financing by taxpayers to reduce their New Zealand income tax liability significantly. |

|     |
| --- |
| Proposed Approach  <br>How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option?<br>========================================================================================================================= |
| The adoption of a restricted transfer pricing rule for determining the allowable interest rate (for tax purposes) on related-party loans from a non-resident to a New Zealand borrower will help ensure interest rates on such loans cannot be excessive.<br><br>In addition, changing the way deductible debt levels are calculated under the thin capitalisation rules will ensure that taxpayers with little equity are unable to have large amounts of deductible debt.<br><br>These changes will provide a solution that is sustainable, efficient and equitable, while minimising impacts on compliance and administration costs. |

Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs
----------------------------------------------

|     |
| --- |
| Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit?<br>======================================================================================= |
| The Government will benefit in that the new interest limitation rules are forecast to produce approximately $80–90 million per year on an ongoing basis.<br><br>There are also efficiency and fairness benefits to these proposals which cannot be assigned to particular beneficiaries. |

|     |
| --- |
| Where do the costs fall?<br>======================== |
| The costs primarily fall on foreign-owned taxpayers operating in New Zealand (though there may be some minor impacts on New Zealand-owned taxpayers with international operations). Tax payments for affected parties are forecast to increase by approximately $80–90 million per year on an ongoing basis. |

|     |
| --- |
| What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated?<br>======================================================================================================================= |
| As with all tax rules, there is some risk of taxpayer non-compliance. However, this is mitigated as the rules predominately apply to large companies – and the tax affairs of large companies are closely monitored by Inland Revenue. |

|     |
| --- |
| Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’.<br>=================================================================================================================== |
| There is no incompatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. |

Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance
---------------------------------------------------

|     |
| --- |
| Agency rating of evidence certainty?<br>==================================== |
| There is moderate evidence in relation to the problem of excessive interest rates on related-party debt, and good evidence in relation to allowable debt levels. Inland Revenue has some data on interest rates paid on related-party debts, as well as examples of structures that appear to have the effect of increasing the interest rate on such debt. However, this data is not comprehensive.<br><br>Inland Revenue has data on the debt, asset and equity levels of significant foreign-owned enterprises, which allows an accurate estimation of the impact of the non-debt liability adjustment for those firms. |

Impact Statement: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules
====================================================================

Section 1: General information
------------------------------

|     |
| --- |
| Purpose<br>======= |
| Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated.  This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with policy changes to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. |
| Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis<br>========================================== |
| Evidence of the problem<br>=======================<br><br>While good evidence of base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) is generally difficult to come by, there is an exception for BEPS in relation to interest payments. Fairly good data on interest deductions (especially for large firms) is available for analysis through Inland Revenue’s International Questionnaire. This dataset includes debt levels, related-party debt levels, and related-party interest payments of large foreign-owned firms.<br><br>However, there are still limitations to that data – for example, data on interest rates on related-party debt (and the interest rates facing a New Zealand subsidiary’s parent company) is not captured in the Questionnaire. Where possible, this information was obtained from other sources (such as credit ratings of parent companies and disclosed related-party interest rates in financial statements) or estimated (for example, estimating interest rates based on related-party interest payments and related-party debt amounts). However, this other data is less comprehensive and accurate.<br><br>Consultation<br>============<br><br>The preferred option in relation to limiting interest rates on related-party interest rates has not been subject to consultation. This was because it was developed in response to submissions on the original proposals. However, it is similar in many respects to the original proposal, which was subject to consultation. In addition, to ensure the rule operates effectively and to mitigate the risk of unintended outcomes, it will be subject to consultation with submitters on the technical detail. |

Section 2: Problem definition and objectives
--------------------------------------------

|     |
| --- |
| 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed?<br>======================================================== |
| BEPS<br>====<br><br>BEPS refers to tax planning strategies used by some multinational enterprises (MNEs) to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. This outcome is achieved by exploiting gaps and mismatches in countries’ domestic tax rules to avoid tax. BEPS strategies distort investment decisions, allow multinationals to benefit from unintended competitive advantages over MNEs not engaged in BEPS and domestic companies, and result in the loss of substantial corporate tax revenue. More fundamentally, the perceived unfairness resulting from BEPS jeopardises citizens’ trust in the integrity of the tax system as a whole.<br><br>In October 2015, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its final package of 15 recommended tax measures for countries to implement to counter BEPS.<br><br>BEPS using interest deductions<br>==============================<br><br>The use of debt financing is one of the simplest ways of shifting taxable profits from one jurisdiction to another. For example, because interest payments are deductible, a related-party cross-border loan from a parent to a subsidiary can be used to reduce taxes payable in the jurisdiction that the subsidiary is located.<br><br>New Zealand’s BEPS work<br>=======================<br><br>The New Zealand Government has signalled a willingness to address BEPS issues and has taken tangible action in this regard. New Zealand is a supporter of the OECD/G20 BEPS project to address international tax avoidance and is advancing a number of measures that are OECD/G20 BEPS recommendations. This includes developing best-practice rules to limit BEPS using interest deductions (BEPS Action 4).<br><br>If no further action is taken, MNEs that currently have high levels of debt in New Zealand, or highly-priced related-party debt, will be able to continue paying little tax in New Zealand. There is also a risk that additional MNEs would adopt similar structures. |

|     |
| --- |
| 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place?<br>============================================================= |
| New Zealand’s tax system<br>========================<br><br>New Zealand has a broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) taxation framework. This means that tax bases are broad and tax rates are kept as low as possible while remaining consistent with the Government’s distributional objectives. The BBLR framework also means that the tax system is not generally used to deliver incentives or encourage particular behaviours.<br><br>New Zealand’s tax system has been the subject of numerous broad-based reviews – most recently the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group in 2010. It is well regarded and generally functions well.<br><br>No other government agencies have a direct interest in the tax system. However, a good tax system is important for a well-functioning economy – many government agencies therefore have an indirect interest in the tax system.<br><br>Foreign investment in New Zealand is generally taxed under our company tax at 28 percent. New Zealand’s tax system has rules that limit the deductible debt levels and interest rates for taxpayers with foreign connections. These rules affect only foreign-owned New Zealand taxpayers, and New Zealand-owned taxpayers with foreign operations. The impacted population is therefore predominately large companies.<br><br>Thin capitalisation rules<br>=========================<br><br>New Zealand has “thin capitalisation” rules to limit tax deductions for interests that non-residents are allowed. These rules generally require an investment owned by a non-resident to have a debt-to-asset ratio of no more than 60 percent (interest deductions are denied to the extent the allowable debt-to-asset ratio is exceeded).<br><br>Thin capitalisation rules also apply to New Zealand-owned firms (frequently referred to as the “outbound thin capitalisation rules”). These rules generally require a debt-to-asset ratio of no more than 75 percent. They are designed to prevent a disproportionate portion of a New Zealand company’s debt being placed in New Zealand.<br><br>Like the tax system as a whole, we consider that the thin capitalisation rules are serving us well. The rules are well understood and taxpayers subject to the rules generally have conservative debt levels and, for those with related-party debt, the debt is at conservative interest rates – as evidenced by the significant amount of tax paid by foreign-owned firms operating in New Zealand (foreign controlled firms paid 39 percent of company tax in the 2015 tax year).<br><br>Transfer pricing rules<br>======================<br><br>It is important to limit not just the quantum of debt in New Zealand, but also the interest rate on that debt. For third-party debt, commercial pressures will drive the borrower to obtain as low an interest rate as possible. However, these pressures do not necessarily exist in a related-party context. A rule to constrain the interest rate of such debt is necessary. Transfer pricing rules provide the current constraint on interest rates. Broadly speaking (and as they apply to related-party debt), these rules seek to ensure that the interest rate on a given loan contract is in line with what would have been agreed between unrelated parties.<br><br>NRWT<br>====<br><br>While payments of interest to related parties are deductible, they are subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). NRWT applies at either 15 percent or 10 percent, depending on whether New Zealand has a Double Taxation Treaty with the interest recipient’s home jurisdiction. This means that, while the use of debt can reduce tax payable in New Zealand, it does not completely eliminate it. |

|     |
| --- |
| 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity?<br>============================================== |
| A simple way that non-residents can reduce their New Zealand tax liability significantly is by capitalising a New Zealand investment with debt instead of equity, because they can then take interest deductions in New Zealand. This is shown in the example below.<br><br>**_Example  <br>_**_Australian investor A puts $100m of capital in a New Zealand company as equity. Company earns $10m from sales and pays $2.8m New Zealand tax. Company pays a net dividend (not tax deductible) of $7.2m to A. Total New Zealand tax is $2.8m._<br><br>_Australian investor B puts $100m of capital into a New Zealand company as debt, with an interest rate of 10%. Company earns $10m from sales but has to pay $10m of tax-deductible interest to B, reducing taxable income to $0. No tax is paid by the company, but a 10% tax on interest is imposed on B (non-resident withholding tax). Total New Zealand tax is $1m._<br><br>Having a generally well regarded tax system does not mean that tax changes are unnecessary. An on-going policy challenge is to ensure that our tax rules are up to date and ensure that MNEs are paying a fair amount of tax in New Zealand. Base protection measures – such as rules for limiting the amount of debt allowable in New Zealand, and the interest rate on that debt – are therefore important.<br><br>At the same time, it is important that New Zealand continues to be a good place to base a business and that tax does not get in the way of this happening. New Zealand relies heavily on foreign direct investment to fund domestic investment and, as such, the Government is committed to ensuring New Zealand remains an attractive place for non-residents to invest.<br><br>This impact statement considers two related policy opportunities:<br><br>*   ensuring the rules for setting the allowable interest rates on related-party debt are sufficiently robust; and<br>*   ensuring the basis for setting the allowable debt level in the thin capitalisation rules is appropriate.<br><br>Scale of the problem<br>====================<br><br>The OECD’s _Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting_ (BEPS Action Plan) included developing best-practice rules to limit BEPS using interest deductions (BEPS Action 4). We consider the fact that the OECD has included profit shifting using interest in its BEPS Action Plan as evidence that this is a significant policy issue internationally.<br><br>As mentioned above, most MNEs operating here have relatively low levels of debt and do not have interest rates considered to be excessive. However, there are a small number of taxpayers with either debt levels that are too high, or interest rates that are excessive. While small in number, the fiscal impact of these arrangements is significant – we estimate the tax revenue lost is $80–90 million per year. |

| 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making?<br>=============================================================== |
| There are no constraints on scope. |

|     |
| --- |
| 2.5 What do stakeholders think?<br>=============================== |
| Stakeholders<br>============<br><br>The stakeholders are primarily taxpayers (in particular, MNEs) and tax advisors. The proposed rules will be applied to taxpayers’ affairs, while tax advisors will assist (taxpayer) clients as to the application of the proposed rules.<br><br>Consultation already undertaken<br>===============================<br><br>In March 2017, the Government released the discussion document _BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules_. The discussion document consulted on two key proposals which are considered in this impact statement – new interest limitation rules and a non-debt liabilities adjustment to the thin capitalisation rules.<br><br>The Government received 27 submissions on the discussion document. Most submitters were stakeholder groups, tax advisors, and foreign-owned firms that would be affected by the proposals.<br><br>In general, submitters acknowledged the need to respond to BEPS risks facing New Zealand, and that part of this would involve strengthening New Zealand’s rules for limiting interest deductions for firms with cross-border related-party debt. However, many submitters did not support the specific proposals put forward.<br><br>The Treasury has been heavily involved with the policy development process in their joint role with Inland Revenue as tax policy advisors for the Government.<br><br>_Interest limitation_<br>=====================<br><br>The discussion document proposed moving away from a transfer pricing approach for pricing inbound related-party loans. Instead, the allowable interest rate for such a loan would – in most instances – be set with reference to the New Zealand borrower’s parent’s borrowing costs (referred to as an “interest rate cap”).<br><br>_General reaction_<br>==================<br><br>Most submitters argued that the interest rate cap proposal was not necessary and should not proceed. They noted that the Government, in the discussion document _BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_, proposed to strengthen the transfer pricing rules generally. Submitters wrote that these strengthened rules should be sufficient to address any concerns about interest rates.<br><br>Submitters expressed concern about the proposed interest rate cap for a number of reasons, including that it:<br><br>*   is inconsistent with the arm’s length standard, so would result in double taxation;<br>*   will increase compliance costs;<br>*   will apply to firms with a low BEPS risk; and<br>*   has no international precedent.<br><br>Only two submitters wrote in favour of the proposed cap. However, the proposal did attract positive comments from knowledgeable parties that did not put in a formal submission. Michael Littlewood, a professor of tax at Auckland University, has said that the Government is right to seek to limit interest rates on related-party debts.<br><br>Richard Vann, a professor of tax at the University of Sydney, has made similar remarks – “transfer pricing has not proved up to the task of dealing with interest rates, so it is necessary to come up with clearer and simpler rules”.<br><br>_Allowable debt levels_<br>=======================<br><br>The thin capitalisation rules limit the amount of debt a taxpayer can claim interest deductions on in New Zealand (“deductible debt”). Currently, the maximum amount of deductible debt is set with reference to the value of the taxpayer’s assets (generally, debt up to 60 percent of the taxpayer’s assets is allowable).<br><br>The discussion document proposed changing this, so that a taxpayer’s maximum debt level is set with reference to the taxpayer’s assets net of its non-debt liabilities (that is, its liabilities other than its interest-bearing debts (a “non-debt liability adjustment”). Some common examples of non-debt liabilities are accounts payable, reserves and provisions, and deferred tax liabilities.<br><br>_General reaction_<br>==================<br><br>Several submitters indicated they supported the proposal in principle and understood the need for this change, raising only technical design issues (particularly relating to deferred tax).<br><br>A number of other submitters argued that the proposal should not go ahead. They submitted that the proposed change would introduce volatility to taxpayers’ thin capitalisation calculations and is not relevant to BEPS. They also wrote that the proposed exclusion of non-debt liabilities from assets would amount to a material reduction in the existing 60 percent safe harbour threshold.<br><br>Stakeholders’ views displayed no clear pattern. Two big accounting firms agreed with the proposal while two others disagreed. Similarly, of the three major stakeholder groups who submitted on the proposal, one supported and two opposed the change.<br><br>_Deferred tax_<br>==============<br><br>To remove the mismatch between income tax calculated on taxable profits and income tax calculated on profits recognised for accounting purposes, deferred tax balances are recognised in financial statements. As such, a taxpayer’s non-debt liabilities could include “deferred tax liabilities”, which arise when accounting profits are greater than profits for tax purposes. Similarly, a taxpayer’s assets could include “deferred tax assets” which arise when profit for tax purposes is greater than accounting profit.<br><br>All submitters that commented on this proposal were of the view that, for the purposes of the non-debt liability adjustment, deferred tax liabilities should be ignored. Submitters also wrote that deferred tax assets should be excluded from assets. That is, a taxpayer’s assets for thin capitalisation purposes would be: (assets – deferred tax assets) – (non-debt liabilities – deferred tax liabilities).<br><br>Submitters noted that Australia’s thin capitalisation rules feature this adjustment for deferred tax. They argued that our rules should feature a similar adjustment because:<br><br>*   often deferred tax does not represent a real cash liability the company has to pay in the future;<br>*   deferred tax balances are ignored when third-parties (including third-party lenders) are assessing the financial position of an entity; and<br>*   deferred tax balances can be volatile – taxpayer thin capitalisation levels could become volatile without excluding them.<br><br>Further consultation<br>====================<br><br>Following Cabinet decisions in July 2017, officials are planning to undertake further public consultation on outstanding policy issues, technical design details and an exposure draft of selected parts of the planned BEPS bill. |

Section 3: Options identification
---------------------------------

|     |
| --- |
| 3.1 What options are available to address the problem?<br>====================================================== |
| Related-party interest rates<br>============================<br><br>We have identified five mutually exclusive options to the address the problem of excessive interest rates on related-party debts.<br><br>Option 4 (administrative guidance) is a non-regulatory option. The other options for change involve changing New Zealand’s tax legislation.<br><br>_Option 1: Interest rate cap (discussion document proposal)_<br>============================================================<br><br>As described in section 2.5.<br><br>_Option 2: Restricted transfer pricing_<br>=======================================<br><br>Under a restricted transfer pricing approach, inbound related-party loans would be priced following the standard transfer pricing methodology. However, it would contain two additional elements to clarify that:<br><br>*   There is a rebuttable presumption that the New Zealand subsidiary would be supported by its foreign parent; and<br>*   All circumstances, terms, and conditions that could result in an excessive interest rate will be required to be ignored – unless the taxpayer can demonstrate that they have third-party debt featuring those terms and conditions. The types of modifications to the terms, conditions and surrounding circumstances we would seek to make under this approach are:<br>*   That the loan has no exotic terms that are generally not seen with third-party lending<br>*   That the loan is not subordinated<br>*   That the loan duration is not excessive<br>*   That the debt level of the borrower is not excessive.<br><br>The combined effect of these additional elements is that the interest rate on related-party debt will generally be in line with the interest rate facing the New Zealand borrower’s foreign parent.<br><br>This restricted transfer pricing rule would be coupled with a safe harbour, which would be based on the interest rate cap as initially proposed. This could be provided administratively. A related-party loan with an interest rate consistent with the interest rate cap would automatically be considered acceptable.<br><br>This option was developed following consultation to address some of the concerns raised by submitters; however, it has not itself been subject to consultation.<br><br>_Option 3: Adopt EBITDA-based rule (OECD recommended approach)_<br>===============================================================<br><br>This option would involve limiting the amount of interest deductions a taxpayer is allowed with reference to their earnings (specifically, their profits before deductions for interest, depreciation and amortisation are taken into account, also known as their EBITDA). This new approach would completely replace the thin capitalisation rules, becoming the new method for limiting interest deductions for taxpayers with international connections.<br><br>This approach would constrain the tax effectiveness of highly priced debt, since it directly limits interest deductions rather than limiting the amount of debt; a taxpayer with highly priced debt would be more likely to exceed their EBITDA limit and face interest denial.<br><br>Almost all submitters did not support the adoption of an EBITDA-based rule.<br><br>_Option 4: Administrative guidance_<br>===================================<br><br>This option would involve Inland Revenue issuing administrative guidance on how it will assess the risk of related-party lending transactions – similar to what has recently been released by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) (discussed below).<br><br>Under this option, related-party loans with certain features (such as having an interest rate in line with the interest rate facing the borrower’s foreign parent) would be given a low risk rating and be unlikely to be challenged by Inland Revenue. Taxpayers with higher interest rates would be more likely to have their related-party loan investigated.<br><br>Several submitters suggested this option be adopted in place of the interest rate cap. They argued that it would provide certainty for taxpayers who desired it, but taxpayers who value certainty less would be free to breach the guidelines.<br><br>_Option 5: Status quo (ordinary transfer pricing)_<br>==================================================<br><br>This option would involve continuing to price related-party debt under the transfer pricing rules. As discussed above, the Government proposed strengthening these rules in the discussion document _BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance._ Many submitters argued that this should be sufficient to address any concerns over related-party interest rates.<br><br>_Relevant experience from other countries_<br>==========================================<br><br>The ATO has released draft guidelines regarding the interest rates of cross-border related-party loans.[\[1\]](#footnote-1)<br> These guidelines are designed to encourage Australian subsidiaries of multinational companies to restructure their related-party loans into ordinary “vanilla” loans. Overall, the guidelines have a clear expectation that the interest rate on related-party loans should be in line with the foreign parent’s cost of funds:<br><br>“Generally, the ATO expects any pricing of a related-party debt to be in line with the commercial incentive of achieving the lowest possible ‘all-in’ cost to the borrower. The ATO expects, in most cases, the cost of the financing to align with the costs that could be achieved, on an arm’s length basis, by the parent of the global group to which the borrower and lender both belong.”<br><br>Allowable debt levels<br>=====================<br><br>We have identified three mutually exclusive options relating to setting the allowable debt level under the thin capitalisation rules.<br><br>The options (other than the status quo) involve changing New Zealand’s tax legislation.<br><br>_Option 1: Proceed with non-debt liabilities adjustment (as proposed in the discussion document)_<br>=================================================================================================<br><br>As described in section 2.5.<br><br>_Option 2: Proceed with non-debt liabilities proposal excluding deferred tax_<br>=============================================================================<br><br>Under this option, a taxpayer’s deferred tax would be ignored for the purposes of the non-debt liability adjustment. That is, a taxpayer’s allowable debt level would be set with reference to the result of the formula: (assets – deferred tax assets) – (non-debt liabilities – deferred tax liabilities).<br><br>Of submitters who supported the proposed non-debt liability adjustment in principle, this was the preferred option.<br><br>_Option 3: Status quo (do not proceed with non-debt liabilities adjustment)_<br>============================================================================<br><br>Under this option, maximum deductible debt levels would continue to be calculated under the thin capitalisation rules with reference to assets, ignoring non-debt liabilities.<br><br>As mentioned in section 2.5, this was the preferred option of some submitters.<br><br>_Relevant experience from other countries_<br>==========================================<br><br>Australia has thin capitalisation rules that are broadly similar to New Zealand’s. Australia’s rules currently require a non-debt liability adjustment, but deferred tax is carved-out. That is, Australia’s rules are consistent with option 2. |

|     |
| --- |
| 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration?<br>============================================================================================================================================== |
| The generic tax policy process (GTPP) includes a framework for assessing key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals.  This framework is consistent with the Government’s vision for the tax and social policy system, and is captured by the following criteria:<br><br>*   _Efficiency and neutrality_ – the tax system should bias economic decisions as little as possible;<br>*   _Fairness and equity –_ similar taxpayers in similar circumstances should be treated in a similar way;<br>*   _Efficiency of compliance –_ compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as possible;<br>*   _Efficiency of administration –_ administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible; and<br>*   _Sustainability –_ the potential for tax evasion and avoidance should be minimised while keeping counteracting measures proportionate to risks involved<br><br>Efficiency, fairness and sustainability are the most important criteria. It is generally worth trading-off increased compliance costs or administration costs for gains in these three criteria. |

| No options were ruled out of scope. |

Section 4: Impact Analysis
--------------------------

|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | **Option 1 (interest rate cap)** | **Option 2 (restricted transfer pricing)** | **Option 3 (EBITDA-based rule)** | **Option 4 (administrative guidance)** | **Status quo** |
| **Efficiency and neutrality** | **+**<br><br>Option 1 will provide a strong limit on related-party interest rates, reducing the ability for some firms to profit shift. This would level the playing field for firms, providing efficiency gains.<br><br>However, for some firms the interest rate allowed under the cap may be too low, which lowers the efficiency benefits. | **++**<br><br>Option 2 will provide a reasonably strong limit on related-party debt interest rates, reducing the ability for some firms to profit shift. This would level the playing field for firms, providing efficiency gains. | **0**<br><br>Option 3 will provide an effective limit on all interest expenses (including related-party interest expenses).<br><br>However, it also increases the uncertainty of returns on New Zealand investment, since whether or not interest is deductible turns on a taxpayer’s EBITDA, which can be very variable. | **+**<br><br>Some taxpayers would benefit from the certainty provided by the administrative safe harbour.<br><br>However, for taxpayers willing to exceed the safe harbour, this option is no different than the status quo – excessive interest rates on related-party debt would still be possible. | **0** |
| **Fairness and equity** | **++**<br><br>Option 1 has fairness benefits as it would ensure taxpayers cannot have excessive interest rates on their related-party debts. | **++**<br><br>Option 2 has fairness benefits as it would ensure taxpayers cannot have excessive interest rates on their related-party debts. | **0**<br><br>On the one hand, option 3 would be somewhat effective at preventing excessive interest rates. On the other hand, it could result in interest denial for firms with very conservative interest rates and debt positions (say, for example, if a taxpayer is in loss). | **0**<br><br>Option 4 would not prevent firms from achieving excessive interest rates on related-party debt. For taxpayers willing to exceed the administrative safe, harbour this option is no different to the status quo. | **0** |

Section 5: Conclusions
----------------------

|     |
| --- |
| 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits?<br>=================================================================================================================================================== |
| Interest limitation<br>===================<br><br>We consider that option 2 – developing a restricted transfer pricing approach – is the best option to limit interest expenses in relation to inbound related-party debt.<br><br>Following consultation and further analysis, we consider that if the Government pursued the interest rate cap (option 1), adjustments would be needed to the original discussion document proposal which would make it more complex. For example, to address some of the concerns expressed by submitters, a different or modified rule may need to be applied to firms with low levels of debt. The result of these adjustments would be that different rules would apply to taxpayers in different situations (more so than originally proposed). Such differences create perceptions of unfairness, and give rise to boundaries that can be difficult to formulate, administer and comply with. At the margins they may give rise to behaviours that are inefficient – especially as taxpayers try to arrange their circumstances to fall within certain boundaries.<br><br>The difficulty is, however, that simply relying on transfer pricing, as suggested by some submitters, will not achieve the desired policy outcomes. It is clear that the international consensus (as reflected in the OECD recommendation for countries to adopt an arbitrary formulaic approach (EBITDA)) is to move away from using ordinary transfer pricing to limit the interest rates on related-party debt. In addition, as noted in section 2.5, commentators have said that ordinary transfer pricing is unsuited to pricing related-party financing transactions.<br><br>Accordingly, we consider that the restricted transfer pricing rule is the best approach. Like the interest rate cap, it will ensure the policy objective – ensuring there is a robust mechanism for determining the interest rates for inbound related-party debt; however, since the restricted transfer pricing rule has more flexibility (compared to the interest rate cap – the other option that would most effectively achieve the policy objective) it is both more efficient and fairer.<br><br>Owing to the time available (and since it was developed subsequent to the initial consultation), this option has not been subject to consultation with stakeholders. This modification will address many, but not all of, submitters’ concerns – it is still a departure from using ordinary transfer pricing. Nevertheless, we expect that it will be more acceptable compared to the originally proposed interest rate cap because:<br><br>*   *   it allows for some limited flexibility – meaning the allowable interest rate can depart from the cost of funds facing the foreign parent if that is appropriate in the circumstances; and<br>    *   it would be subject to the Mutual Agreement Procedure under New Zealand’s Double Tax Agreements, meaning taxpayers who consider that the new rule is inconsistent with the relevant treaty could seek resolution. This will address double taxation concerns. We do not, however, expect this will occur frequently because of the shift in the international consensus on what is acceptable in relation to the pricing of related party debt.<br><br>Allowable debt levels<br>=====================<br><br>At this stage, we do not have a preference between option 1 (non-debt liability adjustment as originally proposed) and option 2 (non-debt liability adjustment with deferred tax carve-out). Option 3 (status quo) is not preferred.<br><br>Both options 1 and 2 have similar impacts in terms of efficiency and fairness (and have no significant impacts in terms of compliance and administration costs). The non-debt liability adjustment in option 1 is potentially too extensive because of the inclusion of _all_ types of deferred tax, but, on the other hand, the adjustment in option 2 is too narrow because of the exclusion of all deferred tax.<br><br>We consider that the best approach is to recommend neither options 1 or 2 at this stage, but instead consult further with stakeholders on whether there is another feasible option (since this is a minor technical detail, more consultation on this matter is feasible). For example, it might be possible to identify deferred tax liabilities that are the least likely to result in a future tax payment, and restrict the carve-out of deferred tax to just that identified group. |

| 5.3 What other impacts is this approach likely to have?<br>======================================================= |
| As discussed above, allowing BEPS through interest deductions is inefficient and unfair, as it results in uneven tax burdens across different businesses. This is an issue in itself, but it may also weaken taxpayer morale. The perception of unfairness that comes from the reported low corporate taxes paid by taxpayers who can take use interest deductions to reduce their New Zealand (and possibly worldwide) tax liability is an important issue. This perception of unfairness undermines public confidence in the tax system and therefore the willingness of taxpayers to voluntarily comply with their own tax obligations. This integrity factor is difficult to assign to a particular set of stakeholders. It is something that is fundamental to the tax system itself, which all of the stakeholders already discussed have an interest in preserving. |

| 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’?<br>================================================================================================================= |
| Yes. |

Section 6: Implementation and operation
---------------------------------------

|     |
| --- |
| 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice?<br>=================================================== |
| Implementation of both reforms (relating to related-party interest rates and allowable debt level) will be given effect through a combination of legislation and Inland Revenue administrative guidance. The legislative changes proposed will be progressed (subject to Cabinet approval) as part of a BEPS taxation bill to be introduced in late 2017. The bill, when introduced, will be accompanied by commentary in order to provide stakeholders with guidance as to the intended application of the provisions. Inland Revenue will also produce guidance on the enacted legislation in its _Tax Information Bulletin_.<br><br>In relation to the allowable debt level proposal, we will consult further with stakeholders on whether a preferred option can be identified. The Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue will make the final decision on which option should be progressed (option 1, option 2, or a potential new option) following this consultation.<br><br>These reforms are expected to apply from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018, subject to legislation progressing to enactment before this date.<br><br>Some submitters on the discussion document argued that transitional relief or grandparenting should be provided to give taxpayers sufficient lead-in time to restructure their affairs if necessary. We consider that the planned application date of 1 July 2018 is sufficiently prospective because:<br><br>*   the interest rate proposal applies only to related-party transactions (which are more easily altered compared to transactions with third-parties); and<br>*   in relation to the allowable debt level proposal, debt and asset levels under the thin capitalisation rules can be measured as at the end of the relevant income year, meaning taxpayers would have until at least 30 June 2019 to rearrange their affairs.<br><br>In addition, in response to consultation, we propose that advanced pricing agreements (APAs) existing prior to the application date of these changes will be grandparented.<br><br>Once the proposals are implemented, Inland Revenue will be responsible for the ongoing operation and enforcement of the new rules. Inland Revenue has not identified any concerns with its ability to implement these reforms. |

|     |
| --- |
| 6.2 What are the implementation risks?<br>====================================== |
| There is the risk that the relevant transfer pricing legislation could contain unintended errors or have unintended consequences. However, this risk can be efficiently managed by way of remedial amendments. |

Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review
--------------------------------------------

|     |
| --- |
| 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored?<br>============================================================= |
| In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of tax changes would take place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995.<br><br>Existing investigations functions for monitoring the behaviour of taxpayers will continue to be used for the proposed rules of this regulatory proposal. Inland Revenue closely monitors the tax affairs of New Zealand’s largest companies (which are, in general, the affected population of these proposals). For example, Inland Revenue currently collects data from these firms on their debt levels (including levels of related-party debt) through its International Questionnaire. This will allow how the proposals have impacted debt levels and related-party interest payments to be analysed.<br><br>More generally, Inland Revenue is considering the appropriate level of information that should be collected to support the proposed rules for all the BEPS measures being implemented. Any additional information may be collected via a disclosure statement that must be provided to Inland Revenue or it may be collected using existing information gathering tools. |

|     |
| --- |
| 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed?<br>======================================================= |
| The final step in the GTTP involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. In practice, following enactment, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect could either be included as remedial amendments in future tax bills, or if they involve more complex issues could be added to the tax policy work programme. Further consultation would be implicit in this approach.<br><br>If it became apparent that an aspect of the proposed rules is unworkable, or if the rules have created unintended consequences whether tax-related or otherwise, this would justify a review of all or part of the legislation. |

1.  ATO compliance approach to taxation issues associated with cross-border related-party financing arrangements and related transactions, PCG 2017/D4. [↑](#footnote-ref-1)
Coversheet: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules Advising agencies The Treasury and Inland Revenue Decision sought The analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final tax policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet Proposing Ministers Steven Joyce (Finance) and Hon Judith Collins (Revenue) Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? The problem the proposals discussed in this impact statement seek to address is the use of debt financing by taxpayers to reduce their New Zealand income tax liability significantly. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? The adoption of a restricted transfer pricing rule for determining the allowable interest rate (for tax purposes) on related-party loans from a non-resident to a New Zealand borrower will help ensure interest rates on such loans cannot be excessive. In addition, changing the way deductible debt levels are calculated under the thin capitalisation rules will ensure that taxpayers with little equity are unable to have large amounts of deductible debt. These changes will provide a solution that is sustainable, efficient and equitable, while minimising impacts on compliance and administration costs. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The Government will benefit in that the new interest limitation rules are forecast to produce approximately $80–90 million per year on an ongoing basis. There are also efficiency and fairness benefits to these proposals which cannot be assigned to particular beneficiaries. Reg ulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 1 BEPS documents release - August 2017: #16 Where do the costs fall? The costs primarily fall on foreign-owned taxpayers operating in New Zealand (though there may be some minor impacts on New Zealand-owned taxpayers with international operations). Tax payments for affected parties are forecast to increase by approximately $80–90 million per year on an ongoing basis. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? As with all tax rules, there is some risk of taxpayer non-compliance. However, this is mitigated as the rules predominately apply to large companies – and the tax affairs of large companies are closely monitored by Inland Revenue. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. There is no incompatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? There is moderate evidence in relation to the problem of excessive interest rates on related-party debt, and good evidence in relation to allowable debt levels. Inland Revenue has some data on interest rates paid on related-party debts, as well as examples of structures that appear to have the effect of increasing the interest rate on such debt. However, this data is not comprehensive. Inland Revenue has data on the debt, asset and equity levels of significant foreign-owned enterprises, which allows an accurate estimation of the impact of the non-debt liability adjustment for those firms. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules Regulatory Impact Assessment prepared by Inland Revenue and associated supporting material and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 2 Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer’s comments on earlier versions of the Regulatory Impact Assessment have been incorporated into the final version. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 3 Impact Statement: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with policy changes to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Evidence of the problem While good evidence of base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) is generally difficult to come by, there is an exception for BEPS in relation to interest payments. Fairly good data on interest deductions (especially for large firms) is available for analys is through Inland Revenue’s International Questionnaire. This dataset includes debt levels, related-party debt levels, and related-party interest payments of large foreign-owned firms. However, there are still limitations to that data – for example, data on interest rates on related-party debt (and the interest rates facing a New Zealand subsidiary’s parent company) is not captured in the Questionnaire. Where possible, this information was obtained from other sources (such as credit ratings of parent companies and disclosed related-party interest rates in financial statements) or estimated (for example, estimating interest rates based on related-party interest payments and related-party debt amounts). However, this other data is less comprehensive and accurate. Consultation The preferred option in relation to limiting interest rates on related-party interest rates has not been subject to consultation. This was because it was developed in response to submissions on the original proposals. However, it is similar in many respects to the original proposal, which was subject to consultation. In addition, to ensure the rule operates effectively and to mitigate the risk of unintended outcomes, it will be subject to consultation with submitters on the technical detail. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Carmel Peters Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 13 July 2017 Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 4 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? BEPS BEPS refers to tax planning strategies used by some multinational enterprises (MNEs) to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. This outcome is achieved by exploiting gaps and mismatches in countries’ domestic tax rules to avoid tax. BEPS strategies distort investment decisions, allow multinationals to benefit from unintended competitive advantages over MNEs not engaged in BEPS and domestic companies, and result in the loss of substantial corporate tax revenue. More fundamentally, the perceived unfairness resulting from BEPS jeopardises citizens’ trust in the integrity of the tax system as a whole. In October 2015, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its final package of 15 recommended tax measures for countries to implement to counter BEPS. BEPS using interest deductions The use of debt financing is one of the simplest ways of shifting taxable profits from one jurisdiction to another. For example, because interest payments are deductible, a related- party cross-border loan from a parent to a subsidiary can be used to reduce taxes payable in the jurisdiction that the subsidiary is located. New Zealand’s BEPS work The New Zealand Government has signalled a willingness to address BEPS issues and has taken tangible action in this regard. New Zealand is a supporter of the OECD/G20 BEPS project to address international tax avoidance and is advancing a number of measures that are OECD/G20 BEPS recommendations. This includes developing best-practice rules to limit BEPS using interest deductions (BEPS Action 4). If no further action is taken, MNEs that currently have high levels of debt in New Zealand, or highly-priced related-party debt, will be able to continue paying little tax in New Zealand. There is also a risk that additional MNEs would adopt similar structures. 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? New Zealand’s tax system New Zealand has a broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) taxation framework. This means that tax bases are broad and tax rates are kept as low as possible while remaining consistent with the Government’s distributional objectives. The BBLR framework also means that the tax system is not generally used to deliver incentives or encourage particular behaviours. New Zealand’s tax system has been the subject of numerous broad-based reviews – most recently the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group in 2010. It is well regarded and generally functions well. No other government agencies have a direct interest in the tax system. However, a good tax system is important for a well-functioning economy – many government agencies therefore Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 5 have an indirect interest in the tax system. Foreign investment in New Zealand is generally taxed under our company tax at 28 percent. New Zealand’s tax system has rules that limit the deductible debt levels and interest rates for taxpayers with foreign connections. These rules affect only foreign-owned New Zealand taxpayers, and New Zealand-owned taxpayers with foreign operations. The impacted population is therefore predominately large companies. Thin capitalisation rules New Zealand has “thin capitalisation” rules to limit tax deductions for interests that non- residents are allowed. These rules generally require an investment owned by a non-resident to have a debt-to-asset ratio of no more than 60 percent (interest deductions are denied to the extent the allowable debt-to-asset ratio is exceeded). Thin capitalisation rules also apply to New Zealand-owned firms (frequently referred to as the “outbound thin capitalisation rules”). These rules generally require a debt-to-asset ratio of no more than 75 percent. They are designed to prevent a disproportionate portion of a New Zealand company’s debt being placed in New Zealand. Like the tax system as a whole, we consider that the thin capitalisation rules are serving us well. The rules are well understood and taxpayers subject to the rules generally have conservative debt levels and, for those with related-party debt, the debt is at conservative interest rates – as evidenced by the significant amount of tax paid by foreign-owned firms operating in New Zealand (foreign controlled firms paid 39 percent of company tax in the 2015 tax year). Transfer pricing rules It is important to limit not just the quantum of debt in New Zealand, but also the interest rate on that debt. For third-party debt, commercial pressures will drive the borrower to obtain as low an interest rate as possible. However, these pressures do not necessarily exist in a related-party context. A rule to constrain the interest rate of such debt is necessary. Transfer pricing rules provide the current constraint on interest rates. Broadly speaking (and as they apply to related-party debt), these rules seek to ensure that the interest rate on a given loan contract is in line with what would have been agreed between unrelated parties. NRWT While payments of interest to related parties are deductible, they are subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). NRWT applies at either 15 percent or 10 percent, depending on whether New Zealand has a Double Taxation Treaty with the interest recipient’s home jurisdiction. This means that, while the use of debt can reduce tax payable in New Zealand, it does not completely eliminate it. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 6 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? A simple way that non-residents can reduce their New Zealand tax liability significantly is by capitalising a New Zealand investment with debt instead of equity, because they can then take interest deductions in New Zealand. This is shown in the example below. Example Australian investor A puts $100m of capital in a New Zealand company as equity. Company earns $10m from sales and pays $2.8m New Zealand tax. Company pays a net dividend (not tax deductible) of $7.2m to A. Total New Zealand tax is $2.8m. Australian investor B puts $100m of capital into a New Zealand company as debt, with an interest rate of 10%. Company earns $10m from sales but has to pay $10m of tax-deductible interest to B, reducing taxable income to $0. No tax is paid by the company, but a 10% tax on interest is imposed on B (non-resident withholding tax). Total New Zealand tax is $1m. Having a generally well regarded tax system does not mean that tax changes are unnecessary. An on-going policy challenge is to ensure that our tax rules are up to date and ensure that MNEs are paying a fair amount of tax in New Zealand. Base protection measures – such as rules for limiting the amount of debt allowable in New Zealand, and the interest rate on that debt – are therefore important. At the same time, it is important that New Zealand continues to be a good place to base a business and that tax does not get in the way of this happening. New Zealand relies heavily on foreign direct investment to fund domestic investment and, as such, the Government is committed to ensuring New Zealand remains an attractive place for non-residents to invest. This impact statement considers two related policy opportunities: • ensuring the rules for setting the allowable interest rates on related-party debt are sufficiently robust; and • ensuring the basis for setting the allowable debt level in the thin capitalisation rules is appropriate. Scale of the problem The OECD’s Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS Action Plan) included developing best-practice rules to limit BEPS using interest deductions (BEPS Action 4). We consider the fact that the OECD has included profit shifting using interest in its BEPS Action Plan as evidence that this is a significant policy issue internationally. As mentioned above, most MNEs operating here have relatively low levels of debt and do not have interest rates considered to be excessive. However, there are a small number of taxpayers with either debt levels that are too high, or interest rates that are excessive. While small in number, the fiscal impact of these arrangements is significant – we estimate the tax revenue lost is $80–90 million per year. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 7 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There are no constraints on scope. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? Stakeholders The stakeholders are primarily taxpayers (in particular, MNEs) and tax advisors. The proposed rules will be applied to taxpayers’ affairs, while tax advisors will assist (taxpayer) clients as to the application of the proposed rules. Consultation already undertaken In March 2017, the Government released the discussion document BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules. The discussion document consulted on two key proposals which are considered in this impact statement – new interest limitation rules and a non-debt liabilities adjustment to the thin capitalisation rules. The Government received 27 submissions on the discussion document. Most submitters were stakeholder groups, tax advisors, and foreign-owned firms that would be affected by the proposals. In general, submitters acknowledged the need to respond to BEPS risks facing New Zealand, and that part of this would involve strengthening New Zealand’s rules for limiting interest deductions for firms with cross-border related-party debt. However, many submitters did not support the specific proposals put forward. The Treasury has been heavily involved with the policy development process in their joint role with Inland Revenue as tax policy advisors for the Government. Interest limitation The discussion document proposed moving away from a transfer pricing approach for pricing inbound related-party loans. Instead, the allowable interest rate for such a loan would – in most instances – be set with reference to the New Zealand borrower’s parent’s borrowing costs (referred to as an “interest rate cap”). General reaction Most submitters argued that the interest rate cap proposal was not necessary and should not proceed. They noted that the Government, in the discussion document BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance, proposed to strengthen the transfer pricing rules generally. Submitters wrote that these strengthened rules should be sufficient to address any concerns about interest rates. Submitters expressed concern about the proposed interest rate cap for a number of reasons, including that it: • is inconsistent with the arm’s length standard, so would result in double taxation; • will increase compliance costs; • will apply to firms with a low BEPS risk; and • has no international precedent. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 8 Only two submitters wrote in favour of the proposed cap. However, the proposal did attract positive comments from knowledgeable parties that did not put in a formal submission. Michael Littlewood, a professor of tax at Auckland University, has said that the Government is right to seek to limit interest rates on related-party debts. Richard Vann, a professor of tax at the University of Sydney, has made similar remarks – “transfer pricing has not proved up to the task of dealing with interest rates, so it is necessary to come up with clearer and simpler rules”. Allowable debt levels The thin capitalisation rules limit the amount of debt a taxpayer can claim interest deductions on in New Zealand (“deductible debt”). Currently, the maximum amount of deductible debt is set with reference to the value of the taxpayer’s assets (generally, debt up to 60 percent of the taxpayer’s assets is allowable). The discussion document proposed changing this, so that a taxpayer’s maximum debt level is set with reference to the taxpayer’s assets net of its non-debt liabilities (that is, its liabilities other than its interest-bearing debts (a “non-debt liability adjustment”). Some common examples of non-debt liabilities are accounts payable, reserves and provisions, and deferred tax liabilities. General reaction Several submitters indicated they supported the proposal in principle and understood the need for this change, raising only technical design issues (particularly relating to deferred tax). A number of other submitters argued that the proposal should not go ahead. They submitted that the proposed change would introduce volatility to taxpayers’ thin capitalisation calculations and is not relevant to BEPS. They also wrote that the proposed exclusion of non-debt liabilities from assets would amount to a material reduction in the existing 60 percent safe harbour threshold. Stakeholders’ views displayed no clear pattern. Two big accounting firms agreed with the proposal while two others disagreed. Similarly, of the three major stakeholder groups who submitted on the proposal, one supported and two opposed the change. Deferred tax To remove the mismatch between income tax calculated on taxable profits and income tax calculated on profits recognised for accounting purposes, deferred tax balances are recognised in financial statements. As such, a taxpayer’s non-debt liabilities could include “deferred tax liabilities”, which arise when accounting profits are greater than profits for tax purposes. Similarly, a taxpayer’s assets could include “deferred tax assets” which arise when profit for tax purposes is greater than accounting profit. All submitters that commented on this proposal were of the view that, for the purposes of the non-debt liability adjustment, deferred tax liabilities should be ignored. Submitters also wrote that deferred tax assets should be excluded from assets. That is, a taxpayer’s assets for thin capitalisation purposes would be: (assets – deferred tax assets) – (non-debt liabilities – deferred tax liabilities). Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 9 Submitters noted that Australia’s thin capitalisation rules feature this adjustment for deferred tax. They argued that our rules should feature a similar adjustment because: • often deferred tax does not represent a real cash liability the company has to pay in the future; • deferred tax balances are ignored when third-parties (including third-party lenders) are assessing the financial position of an entity; and • deferred tax balances can be volatile – taxpayer thin capitalisation levels could become volatile without excluding them. Further consultation Following Cabinet decisions in July 2017, officials are planning to undertake further public consultation on outstanding policy issues, technical design details and an exposure draft of selected parts of the planned BEPS bill. Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? Related-party interest rates We have identified five mutually exclusive options to the address the problem of excessive interest rates on related-party debts. Option 4 (administrative guidance) is a non-regulatory option. The other options for change involve changing New Zealand’s tax legislation. Option 1: Interest rate cap (discussion document proposal) As described in section 2.5. Option 2: Restricted transfer pricing Under a restricted transfer pricing approach, inbound related-party loans would be priced following the standard transfer pricing methodology. However, it would contain two additional elements to clarify that: • There is a rebuttable presumption that the New Zealand subsidiary would be supported by its foreign parent; and • All circumstances, terms, and conditions that could result in an excessive interest rate will be required to be ignored – unless the taxpayer can demonstrate that they have third-party debt featuring those terms and conditions. The types of modifications to the terms, conditions and surrounding circumstances we would seek to make under this approach are: o That the loan has no exotic terms that are generally not seen with third-party lending o That the loan is not subordinated o That the loan duration is not excessive o That the debt level of the borrower is not excessive. The combined effect of these additional elements is that the interest rate on related-party debt will generally be in line with the interest rate facing the New Zealand borrower’s foreign Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 10 parent. This restricted transfer pricing rule would be coupled with a safe harbour, which would be based on the interest rate cap as initially proposed. This could be provided administratively. A related-party loan with an interest rate consistent with the interest rate cap would automatically be considered acceptable. This option was developed following consultation to address some of the concerns raised by submitters; however, it has not itself been subject to consultation. Option 3: Adopt EBITDA-based rule (OECD recommended approach) This option would involve limiting the amount of interest deductions a taxpayer is allowed with reference to their earnings (specifically, their profits before deductions for interest, depreciation and amortisation are taken into account, also known as their EBITDA). This new approach would completely replace the thin capitalisation rules, becoming the new method for limiting interest deductions for taxpayers with international connections. This approach would constrain the tax effectiveness of highly priced debt, since it directly limits interest deductions rather than limiting the amount of debt; a taxpayer with highly priced debt would be more likely to exceed their EBITDA limit and face interest denial. Almost all submitters did not support the adoption of an EBITDA-based rule. Option 4: Administrative guidance This option would involve Inland Revenue issuing administrative guidance on how it will assess the risk of related-party lending transactions – similar to what has recently been released by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) (discussed below). Under this option, related-party loans with certain features (such as having an interest rate in line with the interest rate facing the borrower’s foreign parent) would be given a low risk rating and be unlikely to be challenged by Inland Revenue. Taxpayers with higher interest rates would be more likely to have their related-party loan investigated. Several submitters suggested this option be adopted in place of the interest rate cap. They argued that it would provide certainty for taxpayers who desired it, but taxpayers who value certainty less would be free to breach the guidelines. Option 5: Status quo (ordinary transfer pricing) This option would involve continuing to price related-party debt under the transfer pricing rules. As discussed above, the Government proposed strengthening these rules in the discussion document BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance. Many submitters argued that this should be sufficient to address any concerns over related- party interest rates. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 11 Relevant experience from other countries The ATO has released draft guidelines regarding the interest rates of cross-border related- party loans. 1 These guidelines are designed to encourage Australian subsidiaries of multinational companies to restructure their related-party loans into ordinary “vanilla” loans. Overall, the guidelines have a clear expectation that the interest rate on related-party loans should be in line with the foreign parent’s cost of funds: “Generally, the ATO expects any pricing of a related-party debt to be in line with the commercial incentive of achieving the lowest possible ‘all-in’ cost to the borrower. The ATO expects, in most cases, the cost of the financing to align with the costs that could be achieved, on an arm’s length basis, by the parent of the global group to which the borrower and lender both belong.” Allowable debt levels We have identified three mutually exclusive options relating to setting the allowable debt level under the thin capitalisation rules. The options (other than the status quo) involve changing New Zealand’s tax legislation. Option 1: Proceed with non-debt liabilities adjustment (as proposed in the discussion document) As described in section 2.5. Option 2: Proceed with non-debt liabilities proposal excluding deferred tax Under this option, a taxpayer’s deferred tax would be ignored for the purposes of the non- debt liability adjustment. That is, a taxpayer’s allowable debt level would be set with reference to the result of the formula: (assets – deferred tax assets) – (non-debt liabilities – deferred tax liabilities). Of submitters who supported the proposed non-debt liability adjustment in principle, this was the preferred option. Option 3: Status quo (do not proceed with non-debt liabilities adjustment) Under this option, maximum deductible debt levels would continue to be calculated under the thin capitalisation rules with reference to assets, ignoring non-debt liabilities. As mentioned in section 2.5, this was the preferred option of some submitters. Relevant experience from other countries Australia has thin capitalisation rules that are broadly similar to New Zealand’s. Australia’s rules currently require a non-debt liability adjustment, but deferred tax is carved-out. That is, Australia’s rules are consistent with option 2. 1 ATO compliance approach to taxation issues associated with cross-border related-party financing arrangements and related transactions, PCG 2017/D4. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 12 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The generic tax policy process (GTPP) includes a framework for assessing key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals. This framework is consistent with the Government’s vision for the tax and social policy system, and is captured by the following criteria: • Efficiency and neutrality – the tax system should bias economic decisions as little as possible; • Fairness and equity – similar taxpayers in similar circumstances should be treated in a similar way; • Efficiency of compliance – compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as possible; • Efficiency of administration – administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible; and • Sustainability – the potential for tax evasion and avoidance should be minimised while keeping counteracting measures proportionate to risks involved Efficiency, fairness and sustainability are the most important criteria. It is generally worth trading-off increased compliance costs or administration costs for gains in these three criteria. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? No options were ruled out of scope. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 13 Section 4: Impact Analysis Option 1 (interest rate cap) Option 2 (restricted transfer pricing) Option 3 (EBITDA-based rule) Option 4 (administrative guidance) Status quo Efficiency and neutrality + Option 1 will provide a strong limit on related-party interest rates, reduc ing the ability for some firms to profit shift. This would level the playing field for firms, providing efficiency gains. However, for some firms the interest rate allowed under the cap may be too low, which lowers the efficiency benefits. ++ Option 2 will provide a reasonably strong limit on related- party debt interest rates, reducing the ability for some firms to profit shift. This would level the playing field for firms, providing efficiency gains. 0 Option 3 will provide an effective limit on all interest expenses (including related-party interest expenses). However, it also increases the uncertainty of returns on New Zealand investment, since whether or not interest is deductible turns on a taxpayer’s EBITDA, which can be very variable. + Some taxpayers would benefit from the certainty provided by the administrative safe harbour. However, for taxpayers willing to exceed the safe harbour, this option is no different than the status quo – excessive interest rates on related-party debt would still be possible. 0 Fairness and equity ++ Option 1 has fairness benefits as it would ensure taxpayers cannot have excessive interest rates on their related-party debts. ++ Option 2 has fairness benefits as it would ensure taxpayers cannot have excessive interest rates on their related-party debts. 0 On the one hand, option 3 would be somewhat effective at preventing excessive interest rates. On the other hand, it could result in interest denial for firms with very conservative interest rates and debt positions (say, for example, if a taxpayer is in loss). 0 Option 4 would not prevent firms from achieving excessive interest rates on related-party debt. For taxpayers willing to exceed the administrative safe, harbour this option is no different to the status quo. 0 Efficiency of compliance ++ Option 1 would reduce compliance costs for many taxpayers – the allowable interest rate on related-party debt would be set on a clear objective factor (the credit rating of the foreign parent). However, in some cases – where the non-resident parent has no credit rating – compliance costs will stay the same or could potentially increase. + Option 2 would reduce complianc e costs s omewhat, as the interest rat e cap would be available as a safe harbour. Taxpayers not utilising the safe harbour will still be required to do a transfer pricing analysis (i.e. same as status quo) 0 Compliance costs in some instances would reduce under option 3, as there would be fewer transfer pricing disputes about related- party debt. However, an EBITDA-based rule would be a fundamental shift in our interest limitation rules – taxpayers and agents would have to come to grips with an entirely new regime. + Option 4 would reduce compliance costs somewhat, as the interest rate cap would be available as a safe harbour. Taxpayers not utilising the safe harbour will still be required to do a transfer pricing analysis (i.e. same as status quo). 0 Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 14 Efficiency of administration ++ Option 1 would avoid the need for potentially complex and expensive disputes over whether the interest rate on related- party debt is set appropriate. ++ Option 2 would reduce the need to review the interest rates of taxpayers utilising the safe harbour. F or the remaining taxpayers, the restrictions (e.g. striking out exotic terms) would simplify the transfer pricing analysis. + Option 3 would reduce administration costs because there would be less need to review and challenge related- party loans under transfer pricing. + Option 4 would reduce the need to review the interest rates of taxpayers utilising the safe harbour. 0 Sustainability + Option 1 would apply to taxpayers that have structured their affairs to strip the maximum profits out of New Zealand; however, it could also affect the interest rates of less aggressive taxpayers. ++ Option 2 should generally only affect taxpayers with more aggressive debt structures. 0 Option 3 could result in interest deduction denial even if a taxpayer has conservative debt levels. + Option 4 would not prevent firms from achieving excessive interest rates on related-party debt. 0 Overall assessment + ++ Recommended option 0 + 0 Key: ++ much better than the status quo + better than the status quo 0 about the same as the status quo - worse than the status quo - - much worse than the status quo Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 15 Allowable debt levels Option 1 (non-debt liability adjustment) Option 2 (adjustment with no deferred tax) Status quo Efficiency and neutrality + Option 1 will reduce the allowable debt levels for taxpayers with little equity (and high levels of non-debt liabilities). This will help ensure taxpayers have a more commercial level of debt. It will also equalise the thin capitalisation outcomes for taxpayers in otherwise similar situations. This should improve efficiency. However, submitters have argued that in some instances deferred tax (a type of non- debt liability) does not represent real liabilities; to the extent this is correct, reducing allowable debt levels in relation to these liabilities could hamper efficiency. + Option 2 will reduce the allowable debt levels for taxpayers with little equity (and high levels of non-debt liabilities). This will help ensure taxpayers have a more commercial level of debt. It will also equalise the thin capitalisation outcomes for taxpayers in otherwise similar situations. This should improve efficiency. However, this option carves out all types of deferred tax – yet, in many instances, deferred tax will represent a future tax payment a taxpayer will be required to make. To the extent this is the case, this option would allow some taxpayers to have too high a debt level. 0 Fairness and equity + Taxpayers with the same level of accounting profit will have the same thin capitalisation outcomes. This option therefore improves fairness. However, submitters have argued that in some instances deferred tax does not represent a real liability. To the extent this is correct, including deferred tax in the non-debt liability adjustment could be seen as unfair. + Taxpayers with the same level of accounting profit will have the same thin capitalisation outcomes. This option therefore improves fairness. However, this option excludes all deferred tax – yet, in many instances, deferred tax will represent a future tax payment a taxpayer will be required to make. To the extent this is the case, this option will not treat taxpayers in the same situation the same. 0 Efficiency of compliance 0 Neither option will have a significant impact on compliance costs. The result of both options is just a change to how the existing thin capitalisation calculations are carried out. However, there may be some one-off compliance costs if the changes mean taxpayers breach their thin capitalisation limits and, as a result, decide to restructure their borrowing. 0 Efficiency of administration 0 Neither option has a significant impact on administrative costs. Thin capitalisation calculations are carried out by taxpayers – this change has no substantive impact on Inland Revenue. 0 Sustainability + Both options similarly target firms with debt levels that are too high relative to their levels of equity and are therefore well targeted. Firms with low levels of debt, or with reasonable levels of debt relative to equity, will be largely unaffected by either option. 0 Overall assessment + + 0 Key: ++ much better than the status quo + better than the status quo 0 about the same as the status quo - worse than the status quo - - much worse than the status quo Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 16 Section 5: Conclusions 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits? Interest limitation We consider that option 2 – developing a restricted transfer pricing approach – is the best option to limit interest expenses in relation to inbound related-party debt. Following consultation and further analysis, we consider that if the Government pursued the interest rate cap (option 1), adjustments would be needed to the original discussion document proposal which would make it more complex. For example, to address some of the concerns expressed by submitters, a different or modified rule may need to be applied to firms with low levels of debt. The result of these adjustments would be that different rules would apply to taxpayers in different situations (more so than originally proposed). Such differences create perceptions of unfairness, and give rise to boundaries that can be difficult to formulate, administer and comply with. At the margins they may give rise to behaviours that are inefficient – especially as taxpayers try to arrange their circumstances to fall within certain boundaries. The difficulty is, however, that simply relying on transfer pricing, as suggested by some submitters, will not achieve the desired policy outcomes. It is clear that the international consensus (as reflected in the OECD recommendation for countries to adopt an arbitrary formulaic approach (EBITDA)) is to move away from using ordinary transfer pricing to limit the interest rates on related-party debt. In addition, as noted in section 2.5, commentators have said that ordinary transfer pricing is unsuited to pricing related-party financing transactions. Accordingly, we consider that the restricted transfer pricing rule is the best approach. Like the interest rate cap, it will ensure the policy objective – ensuring there is a robust mechanism for determining the interest rates for inbound related-party debt; however, since the restricted transfer pricing rule has more flexibility (compared to the interest rate cap – the other option that would most effectively achieve the policy objective) it is both more efficient and fairer. Owing to the time available (and since it was developed subsequent to the initial consultation), this option has not been subject to consultation with stakeholders. This modification will address many, but not all of, submitters’ concerns – it is still a departure from using ordinary transfer pricing. Nevertheless, we expect that it will be more acceptable compared to the originally proposed interest rate cap because: • it allows for some limited flexibility – meaning the allowable interest rate can depart from the cost of funds facing the foreign parent if that is appropriate in the circumstances; and • it would be subject to the Mutual Agreement Procedure under New Zealand’s Double Tax Agreements, meaning taxpayers who consider that the new rule is inconsistent with the relevant treaty could seek resolution. This will address double taxation concerns. We do not, however, expect this will occur frequently because of the shift in the international consensus on what is acceptable in relation to the pricing of related party debt. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 17 Allowable debt levels At this stage, we do not have a preference between option 1 (non-debt liability adjustment as originally proposed) and option 2 (non-debt liability adjustment with deferred tax carve- out). Option 3 (status quo) is not preferred. Both options 1 and 2 have similar impacts in terms of efficiency and fairness (and have no significant impacts in terms of compliance and administration costs). The non-debt liability adjustment in option 1 is potentially too extensive because of the inclusion of all types of deferred tax, but, on the other hand, the adjustment in option 2 is too narrow because of the exclusion of all deferred tax. We consider that the best approach is to recommend neither options 1 or 2 at this stage, but instead consult further with stakeholders on whether there is another feasible option (since this is a minor technical detail, more consultation on this matter is feasible). For example, it might be possible to identify deferred tax liabilities that are the least likely to result in a future tax payment, and restrict the carve-out of deferred tax to just that identified group.

As discussed above, allowing BEPS through interest deductions is inefficient and unfair, as it results in uneven tax burdens across different businesses. This is an issue in itself, but it may also weaken taxpayer morale. The perception of unfairness that comes from the reported low corporate taxes paid by taxpayers who can take use interest deductions to reduce their New Zealand (and possibly worldwide) tax liability is an important issue. This perception of unfairness undermines public confidence in the tax system and therefore the willingness of taxpayers to voluntarily comply with their own tax obligations. This integrity factor is difficult to assign to a particular set of stakeholders. It is something that is fundamental to the tax system itself, which all of the stakeholders already discussed have an interest in preserving. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’? Yes. Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? Implementation of both reforms (relating to related-party interest rates and allowable debt level) will be given effect through a combination of legislation and Inland Revenue administrative guidance. The legislative changes proposed will be progressed (subject to Cabinet approval) as part of a BEPS taxation bill to be introduced in late 2017. The bill, when introduced, will be accompanied by commentary in order to provide stakeholders with guidance as to the intended application of the provisions. Inland Revenue will also produce guidance on the enacted legislation in its Tax Information Bulletin. In relation to the allowable debt level proposal, we will consult further with stakeholders on whether a preferred option can be identified. The Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue will make the final decision on which option should be progressed (option 1, option 2, or a potential new option) following this consultation. These reforms are expected to apply from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018, subject to legislation progressing to enactment before this date. Some submitters on the discussion document argued that transitional relief or grandparenting should be provided to give taxpayers sufficient lead-in time to restructure their affairs if necessary. We consider that the planned application date of 1 July 2018 is sufficiently prospective because: • the interest rate proposal applies only to related-party transactions (which are more easily altered compared to transactions with third-parties); and • in relation to the allowable debt level proposal, debt and asset levels under the thin capitalisation rules can be measured as at the end of the relevant income year, meaning taxpayers would have until at least 30 June 2019 to rearrange their affairs. In addition, in response to consultation, we propose that advanced pricing agreements Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 21 (APAs) existing prior to the application date of these changes will be grandparented. Once the proposals are implemented, Inland Revenue will be responsible for the ongoing operation and enforcement of the new rules. Inland Revenue has not identified any concerns with its ability to implement these reforms. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? There is the risk that the relevant transfer pricing legislation could contain unintended errors or have unintended consequences. However, this risk can be efficiently managed by way of remedial amendments. Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of tax changes would take place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. Existing investigations functions for monitoring the behaviour of taxpayers will continue to be used for the proposed rules of this regulatory proposal. Inland Revenue closely monitors the tax affairs of New Zealand’s largest companies (which are, in general, the affected population of these proposals). For example, Inland Revenue currently collects data from these firms on their debt levels (including levels of related-party debt) through its International Questionnaire. This will allow how the proposals have impacted debt levels and related-party interest payments to be analysed. More generally, Inland Revenue is considering the appropriate level of information that should be collected to support the proposed rules for all the BEPS measures being implemented. Any additional information may be collected via a disclosure statement that must be provided to Inland Revenue or it may be collected using existing information gathering tools. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTTP involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. In practice, following enactment, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect could either be included as remedial amendments in future tax bills, or if they involve more complex issues could be added to the tax policy work programme. Further consultation would be implicit in this approach. If it became apparent that an aspect of the proposed rules is unworkable, or if the rules have created unintended consequences whether tax-related or otherwise, this would justify a review of all or part of the legislation. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 22
Coversheet: BEPS - strengthening our interest limitation rules Advising agencies The Treasury and Inland Revenue Decision sought The analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final tax policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet Proposing Ministers Steven Joyce (Finance) and Hon Judith Col/ins (Revenue) Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? The problem the proposals discussed in this impact statement seek to address is the use of debt financing by taxpayers to reduce their New Zealand income tax liability significantly. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? The adoption of a restricted transfer pricing rule for determining the allowable interest rate (for tax purposes) on related-party loans from a non-resident to a New Zealand borrower will help ensure interest rates on such loans cannot be excessive. In addition, changing the way deductible debt levels are calculated under the thin capitalisation rules will ensure that taxpayers with little equity are unable to have large amounts of deductible debt. These changes will provide a solution that is sustainable , efficient and equitable, while minimising impacts on compliance and administration costs. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The Government will benefit in that the new interest limitation rules are forecast to produce approximately $80-90 million per year on an ongoing basis. There are also efficiency and fairness benefits to these proposals which cannot be assigned to particular beneficiaries. R eg ul atory Imp ac t Assess ment: BEP S - s tr ength enin g o ur int eres t li mit ati on rule s 1 1 Where do the costs fall? The costs primarily fall on foreign-owned taxpayers operating in New Zealand (though there may be some minor impacts on New Zealand-owned taxpayers with international operations). Tax payments for affected parties are forecast to increase by approximately $80-90 million per year on an ongoing basis. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? As with all tax rules, there is some risk of taxpayer non-compliance. However, this is mitigated as the rules predominately apply to large companies- and the tax affairs of large companies are closely monitored by Inland Revenue. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government's 'Expectations for the design of regulatory systems'. There is no incompat ibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government's 'Expectations for the design of regulatory systems '. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? There is moderate evidence in relation to the problem of excessive interest rates on related-party debt, and good evidence in relation to allowable debt levels . Inland Revenue has some data on interest rates paid on related-party debts, as well as examples of structures that appear to have the effect of increasing the interest rate on such debt. However, this data is not comprehensive. Inland Revenue has data on the debt, asset and equity levels of significant foreign-owned enterprises, which allows an accurate estimation of the impact of the non-debt liability adjustment for those firms. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the BEPS - strengthening our interest limitation rules Regulatory Impact Assessment prepared by Inland Revenue and associated supporting material and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria.

Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS- strengthening our interest limitation rules I 3 Impact Statement: BEPS - strengthening our interest limitation rules Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement , except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with policy changes to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Evidence of the problem While good evidence of base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) is generally difficult to come by, there is an exception for BEPS in relation to interest payments . Fairly good data on interest deductions (especially for large firms) is available for analysis through Inland Revenue's International Questionnaire. This dataset includes debt levels, related-party debt levels, and related-party interest payments of large foreign-owned firms. However, there are still limitations to that data - for example, data on interest rates on related-party debt (and the interest rates facing a New Zealand subsidiary's parent company) is not captured in the Questionnaire. Where possible, this information was obtained from other sources (such as credit ratings of parent companies and disclosed related -party interest rates in financial statements) or estimated (for example, estimating interest rates based on related-party interest payments and related-party debt amounts). However, this other data is less comprehensive and accurate. Consultation The preferred option in relation to limiting interest rates on related-party interest rates has not been subject to consultation . This was because it was developed in response to submissions on the original proposals . However, it is similar in many respects to the original proposal, which was subject to consultation. In addition, to ensure the rule operates effectively and to mitigate the risk of unintended outcomes, it will be subject to consultation with submitters on the technical detail. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Carmel Peters Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 13July2017 Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - strengthening our interest limitation rules I 4 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? BEPS BEPS refers to tax planning strategies used by some multinational enterprises (MNEs) to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. This outcome is achieved by exploiting gaps and mismatches in countries' domestic tax rules to avoid tax. BEPS strategies distort investment decisions, allow multinationals to benefit from unintended competitive advantages over MNEs not engaged in BEPS and domestic companies, and result in the loss of substantial corporate tax revenue. More fundamentally, the perceived unfairness resulting from BEPS jeopardises citizens' trust in the integrity of the tax system as a whole. In October 2015, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its final package of 15 recommended tax measures for countries to implement to counter BEPS. BEPS using interest deductions The use of debt financing is one of the simplest ways of shifting taxable profits from one jurisdiction to another. For example, because interest payments are deductible, a related- party cross-border loan from a parent to a subsidiary can be used to reduce taxes payable in the jurisdiction that the subsidiary is located. New Zealand's BEPS work The New Zealand Government has signalled a willingness to address BEPS issues and has taken tangible action in this regard. New Zealand is a supporter of the OECD/G20 BEPS project to address international tax avoidance and is advancing a number of measures that are OECD/G20 BEPS recommendations. This includes developing best-practice rules to limit BEPS using interest deductions (BEPS Action 4). If no further action is taken, MNEs that currently have high levels of debt in New Zealand, or highly-priced related-party debt, will be able to continue paying little tax in New Zealand. There is also a risk that additional MNEs would adopt similar structures. 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? New Zealand's tax system New Zealand has a broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) taxation framework. This means that tax bases are broad and tax rates are kept as low as possible while remaining consistent with the Government's distributional objectives. The BBLR framework also means that the tax system is not generally used to deliver incentives or encourage particular behaviours. New Zealand's tax system has been the subject of numerous broad-based reviews - most recently the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group in 2010. it is well regarded and generally functions well. No other government agencies have a direct interest in the tax system. However, a good tax system is important for a well-functioning economy - many government agencies therefore Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-strengthening our interest limitation rules I 5 have an indirect interest in the tax system. Foreign investment in New Zealand is generally taxed under our company tax at 28 percent. New Zealand's tax system has rules that limit the deductible debt levels and interest rates for taxpayers with foreign connections. These rules affect only foreign-owned New Zealand taxpayers, and New Zealand-owned taxpayers with foreign operations. The impacted population is therefore predominately large companies. Thin capitalisation rules New Zealand has "thin capitalisation" rules to limit tax deductions for interests that non- residents are allowed. These rules generally require an investment owned by a non-resident to have a debt-to-asset ratio of no more than 60 percent (interest deductions are denied to the extent the allowable debt-to-asset ratio is exceeded). Thin capitalisation rules also apply to New Zealand-owned firms (frequently referred to as the "outbound thin capitalisation rules"). These rules generally require a debt-to-asset ratio of no more than 75 percent. They are designed to prevent a disproportionate portion of a New Zealand company's debt being placed in New Zealand. Like the tax system as a whole, we consider that the thin capitalisation rules are serving us well. The rules are well understood and taxpayers subject to the rules generally have conservative debt levels and, for those with related-party debt, the debt is at conservative interest rates - as evidenced by the significant amount of tax paid by foreign-owned firms operating in New Zealand (foreign controlled firms paid 39 percent of company tax in the 2015 tax year). Transfer pricing rules lt is important to limit not just the quantum of debt in New Zealand, but also the interest rate on that debt. For third-party debt, commercial pressures will drive the borrower to obtain as low an interest rate as possible. However, these pressures do not necessarily exist in a related-party context. A rule to constrain the interest rate of such debt is necessary. Transfer pricing rules provide the current constraint on interest rates. Broadly speaking (and as they apply to related-party debt), these rules seek to ensure that the interest rate on a given loan contract is in line with what would have been agreed between unrelated parties. NRWT While payments of interest to related parties are deductible, they are subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). NRWT applies at either 15 percent or 10 percent, depending on whether New Zealand has a Double Taxation Treaty with the interest recipient's home jurisdiction. This means that, while the use of debt can reduce tax payable in New Zealand, it does not completely eliminate it. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS- strengthening our interest limitation rules I 6 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? A simple way that non-residents can reduce their New Zealand tax liability significantly is by capitalising a New Zealand investment with debt instead of equity, because they can then take interest deductions in New Zealand. This is shown in the example below. Example Australian investor A puts $1 OOm of capital in a New Zealand company as equity. Company earns $10m from sales and pays $2.8m New Zealand tax. Company pays a net dividend (not tax deductible) of $7.2m to A. Total New Zealand tax is $2.8m. Australian investor B puts $100m of capital into a New Zealand company as debt, with an interest rate of 10%. Company earns $10m from sales but has to pay $10m of tax-deductible interest to B, reducing taxable income to $0. No tax is paid by the company, but a 10% tax on interest is imposed on B (non-resident withholding tax). Total New Zealand tax is $1 m. Having a generally well regarded tax system does not mean that tax changes are unnecessary. An on-going policy challenge is to ensure that our tax rules are up to date and ensure that MNEs are paying a fair amount of tax in New Zealand. Base protection measures - such as rules for limiting the amount of debt allowable in New Zealand, and the interest rate on that debt-are therefore important. At the same time, it is important that New Zealand continues to be a good place to base a business and that tax does not get in the way of this happening. New Zealand relies heavily on foreign direct investment to fund domestic investment and, as such, the Government is committed to ensuring New Zealand remains an attractive place for non-residents to invest. This impact statement considers two related policy opportunities: • ensuring the rules for setting the allowable interest rates on related-party debt are sufficiently robust; and • ensuring the basis for setting the allowable debt level in the thin capitalisation rules is appropriate. Scale of the problem The OECD's Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS Action Plan) included developing best-practice rules to limit BEPS using interest deductions (BEPS Action 4). We consider the fact that the OECD has included profit shifting using interest in its BEPS Action Plan as evidence that this is a significant policy issue internationally. As mentioned above, most MNEs operating here have relatively low levels of debt and do not have interest rates considered to be excessive. However, there are a small number of taxpayers with either debt levels that are too high, or interest rates that are excessive. While small in number, the fiscal impact of these arrangements is significant - we estimate the tax revenue lost is $80-90 million per year. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-strengthening our interest limitation rules I 7 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There are no constraints on scope. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? Stake holders The stakeholders are primarily taxpayers (in particular , MNEs) and tax advisors . The proposed rules will be applied to taxpayers ' affairs, while tax advisors will assist (taxpayer) clients as to the application of the proposed rules. Consultation already undertaken In March 2017, the Government released the discussion document BEPS - strengthening our interest limitation rules . The discussion document consulted on two key proposals which are considered in this impact statement - new interest limitation rules and a non-debt liabilities adjustment to the thin capitalisation rules . The Government received 27 submissions on the discussion document. Most submitters were stakeholder groups, tax advisors, and foreign-owned firms that would be affected by the proposals. In general, submitters acknowledged the need to respond to BEPS risks facing New Zealand , and that part of this would involve strengthening New Zealand's rules for limiting interest deductions for firms with cross-border related-party debt. However, many submitters did not support the specific proposals put forward . The Treasury has been heavily involved with the policy development process in their joint role with Inland Revenue as tax policy advisors for the Government. Interest limitation The discussion document proposed moving away from a transfer pricing approach for pricing inbound related-party loans. Instead, the allowable interest rate for such a loan would - in most instances - be set with reference to the New Zealand borrower's parent 's borrowing costs (referred to as an "interest rate cap "). General reaction Most submitters argued that the interest rate cap proposal was not necessary and should not proceed. They noted that the Government , in the discussion document BEPS - transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance , proposed to strengthen the transfer pricing rules generally . Submitters wrote that these strengthened rules should be sufficient to address any concerns about interest rates . Submitters expressed concern about the proposed interest rate cap for a number of reasons , including that it: • is inconsistent with the arm's length standard, so would result in double taxation; • will increase compliance costs; • will apply to firms with a low BEPS risk ; and • has no international precedent. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - strengthening our interest limitation rules I 8 Only two submitters wrote in favour of the proposed cap. However, the proposal did attract positive comments from knowledgeable parties that did not put in a formal submission. Michael Littlewood, a professor of tax at Auckland University, has said that the Government is right to seek to limit interest rates on related-party debts. Richard Vann, a professor of tax at the University of Sydney, has made similar remarks - "transfer pricing has not proved up to the task of dealing with interest rates , so it is necessary to come up with clearer and simpler rules ". Allowable debt levels The thin capitalisation rules limit the amount of debt a taxpayer can claim interest deductions on in New Zealand ("deductible debt"). Currently , the maximum amount of deductible debt is set with reference to the value of the taxpayer 's assets (generally, debt up to 60 percent of the taxpayer's assets is allowable). The discussion document proposed changing this, so that a taxpayer's maximum debt level is set with reference to the taxpayer's assets net of its non-debt liabilities (that is, its liabilities other than its interest-bearing debts (a "non-debt liability adjustment " ). Some common examples of non-debt liabilities are accounts payable, reserves and provis ions , and deferred tax liabilities. General reaction Several submitters indicated they supported the proposal in principle and understood the need for this change, raising only technical design issues (particularly relating to deferred tax). A number of other submitters argued that the proposal should not go ahead. They submitted that the proposed change would introduce volatility to taxpayers ' thin capitalisation calculations and is not relevant to BEPS. They also wrote that the proposed exclusion of non-debt liabilities from assets would amount to a material reduction in the existing 60 percent safe harbour threshold. Stakeholders' views displayed no clear pattern. Two big accounting firms agreed with the proposal while two others disagreed . Similarly , of the three major stakeholder groups who submitted on the proposal , one supported and two opposed the change . Deferred tax To remove the mismatch between income tax calculated on taxable prof its and income tax calculated on profits recognised for accounting purposes, deferred tax balances are recognised in financial statements. As such, a taxpayer's non-debt liabilities could include "deferred tax liabilities ", which arise when accounting profits are greater than profits for tax purposes. Similarly, a taxpayer 's assets could include "deferred tax assets" which arise when profit for tax purposes is greater than accounting profit. All submitters that commented on this proposal were of the view that , for the purposes of the non-debt liability adjustment, deferred tax liabilities should be ignored . Submitters also wrote that deferred tax assets should be excluded from assets. That is, a taxpayer 's assets for thin capitalisation purposes would be: (assets - deferred tax assets) - (non-debt liabilities - deferred tax liabilit ies) . Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - strengthening our interest limitation rules I 9 Submitters noted that Australia's thin capitalisation rules feature this adjustment for deferred tax. They argued that our rules should feature a similar adjustment because: • often deferred tax does not represent a real cash liability the company has to pay in the future; • deferred tax balances are ignored when third-parties (including third-party lenders) are assessing the financial position of an entity; and • deferred tax balances can be volatile - taxpayer thin capitalisation levels could become volatile without excluding them. Further consultation Following Cabinet decisions in July 2017, officials are planning to undertake further public consultation on outstanding policy issues, technical design details and an exposure draft of selected parts of the planned BEPS bill. Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? Related-party interest rates We have identified five mutually exclusive options to the address the problem of excessive interest rates on related-party debts. Option 4 (administrative guidance) is a non-regulatory option. The other options for change involve changing New Zealand's tax legislation. Option 1: Interest rate cap (discussion document proposal) As described in section 2.5. Option 2: Restricted transfer pricing Under a restricted transfer pricing approach, inbound related-party loans would be priced following the standard transfer pricing methodology. However, it would contain two additional elements to clarify that: • There is a rebuttable presumption that the New Zealand subsidiary would be supported by its foreign parent; and • All circumstances, terms, and conditions that could result in an excessive interest rate will be required to be ignored -unless the taxpayer can demonstrate that they have third-party debt featuring those terms and conditions. The types of modifications to the terms, conditions and surrounding circumstances we would seek to make under this approach are: o That the loan has no exotic terms that are generally not seen with third-party lending o That the loan is not subordinated o That the loan duration is not excessive o That the debt level of the borrower is not excessive. The combined effect of these additional elements is that the interest rate on related-party debt will generally be in line with the interest rate facing the New Zealand borrower's foreign Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS- strengthening our interest limitation rules I 10 parent. This restricted transfer pricing rule would be coupled with a safe harbour, which would be based on the interest rate cap as initially proposed. This could be provided administratively. A related-party loan with an interest rate consistent with the interest rate cap would automatically be considered acceptable. This option was developed following consultation to address some of the concerns raised by submitters; however, it has not itself been subject to consultation. Option 3: Adopt EBITDA-based rule (OECD recommended approach) This option would involve limiting the amount of interest deductions a taxpayer is allowed with reference to their earnings (specifically, their profits before deductions for interest, depreciation and amortisation are taken into account, also known as their EBITDA). This new approach would completely replace the thin capitalisation rules, becoming the new method for limiting interest deductions for taxpayers with international connections. This approach would constrain the tax effectiveness of highly priced debt, since it directly limits interest deductions rather than limiting the amount of debt; a taxpayer with highly priced debt would be more likely to exceed their EBITDA limit and face interest denial. Almost all submitters did not support the adoption of an EBITDA-based rule. Option 4: Administrative guidance This option would involve Inland Revenue issuing administrative guidance on how it will assess the risk of related-party lending transactions -similar to what has recently been released by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) (discussed below). Under this option, related-party loans with certain features (such as having an interest rate in line with the interest rate facing the borrower's foreign parent) would be given a low risk rating and be unlikely to be challenged by Inland Revenue. Taxpayers with higher interest rates would be more likely to have their related-party loan investigated. Several submitters suggested this option be adopted in place of the interest rate cap. They argued that it would provide certainty for taxpayers who desired it, but taxpayers who value certainty less would be free to breach the guidelines. Option 5: Status quo (ordinary transfer pricing) This option would involve continuing to price related-party debt under the transfer pricing rules. As discussed above, the Government proposed strengthening these rules in the discussion document BEPS -transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance. Many submitters argued that this should be sufficient to address any concerns over related- party interest rates. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-strengthening our interest limitation rules I 11 Relevant experience from other countries The ATO has released draft guidelines regarding the interest rates of cross-border related- party loans. 1 These guidelines are designed to encourage Australian subsidiaries of multinational companies to restructure their related-party loans into ordinary "vanilla" loans. Overall, the guidelines have a clear expectation that the interest rate on related-party loans should be in line with the foreign parent's cost of funds: "Generally, the ATO expects any pricing of a related-party debt to be in line with the commercial incentive of achieving the lowest possible 'all-in' cost to the borrower. The A TO expects, in most cases, the cost of the financing to align with the costs that could be achieved, on an arm's length basis, by the parent of the global group to which the borrower and lender both belong." Allowable debt levels We have identified three mutually exclusive options relating to setting the allowable debt level under the thin capitalisation rules. The options (other than the status quo) involve changing New Zealand's tax legislation. Option 1: Proceed with non-debt liabilities adjustment (as proposed in the discussion document) As described in section 2.5. Option 2: Proceed with non-debt liabilities proposal excluding deferred tax Under this option, a taxpayer's deferred tax would be ignored for the purposes of the non- debt liability adjustment. That is, a taxpayer's allowable debt level would be set with reference to the result of the formula: (assets- deferred tax assets)-(non-debt liabilities- deferred tax liabilities). Of submitters who supported the proposed non-debt liability adjustment in principle, this was the preferred option. Option 3: Status quo (do not proceed with non-debt liabilities adjustment) Under this option, maximum deductible debt levels would continue to be calculated under the thin capitalisation rules with reference to assets, ignoring non-debt liabilities. As mentioned in section 2.5, this was the preferred option of some submitters. Relevant experience from other countries Australia has thin capitalisation rules that are broadly similar to New Zealand's. Australia's rules currently require a non-debt liability adjustment, but deferred tax is carved-out. That is, Australia's rules are consistent with option 2. 1 ATO compliance approach to taxation issues associated with cross-border related-party financing arrangements and related transactions, PCG 2017/04. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-strengthening our interest limitation rules I 12 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The generic tax policy process (GTPP) includes a framework for assessing key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals. This framework is consistent with the Government's vision for the tax and social policy system, and is captured by the following criteria: • Efficiency and neutrality-the tax system should bias economic decisions as little as possible; • Fairness and equity-similar taxpayers in similar circumstances should be treated in a similar way; • Efficiency of compliance -compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as possible; • Efficiency of administration -administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible; and • Sustainability -the potential for tax evasion and avoidance should be minimised while keeping counteracting measures proportionate to risks involved Efficiency, fairness and sustainability are the most important criteria. lt is generally worth trading-off increased compliance costs or administration costs for gains in these three criteria. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? No options were ruled out of scope.

Option 2 (restricted transfer pricing) ++ Option 2 will provide a reasonably strong limit on related-party debt interest rates, reducing the ability for some firms to profit shift.

However, it also increases the uncertainty of returns on New Zealand investment, since whether or not interest is deductible turns on a taxpayer's EBITDA, which can be very variable. 0 On the one hand, option 3 would be somewhat effective at preventing excessive interest rates.

Interest limitation We consider that option 2 -developing a restricted transfer pricing approach - is the best option to limit interest expenses in relation to inbound related-party debt. Following consultation and further analysis, we consider that if the Government pursued the interest rate cap (option 1 ), adjustments would be needed to the original discussion document proposal which would make it more complex. For example, to address some of the concerns expressed by submitters, a different or modified rule may need to be applied to firms with low levels of debt. The result of these adjustments would be that different rules would apply to taxpayers in different situations (more so than originally proposed). Such differences create perceptions of unfairness, and give rise to boundaries that can be difficult to formulate, administer and comply with. At the margins they may give rise to behaviours that are inefficient -especially as taxpayers try to arrange their circumstances to fall within certain boundaries. The difficulty is, however, that simply relying on transfer pricing, as suggested by some submitters, will not achieve the desired policy outcomes. lt is clear that the international consensus (as reflected in the OECD recommendation for countries to adopt an arbitrary formulaic approach (EBITDA)) is to move away from using ordinary transfer pricing to limit the interest rates on related-party debt. In addition, as noted in section 2.5, commentators have said that ordinary transfer pricing is unsuited to pricing related-party financing transactions. Accordingly, we consider that the restricted transfer pricing rule is the best approach. Like the interest rate cap, it will ensure the policy objective -ensuring there is a robust mechanism for determining the interest rates for inbound related-party debt; however, since the restricted transfer pricing rule has more flexibility (compared to the interest rate cap - the other option that would most effectively achieve the policy objective) it is both more efficient and fairer. Owing to the time available (and since it was developed subsequent to the initial consultation), this option has not been subject to consultation with stakeholders. This modification will address many, but not all of, submitters' concerns - it is still a departure from using ordinary transfer pricing. Nevertheless, we expect that it will be more acceptable compared to the originally proposed interest rate cap because: • it allows for some limited flexibility- meaning the allowable interest rate can depart from the cost of funds facing the foreign parent if that is appropriate in the circumstances; and • it would be subject to the Mutual Agreement Procedure under New Zealand's Double Tax Agreements, meaning taxpayers who consider that the new rule is inconsistent with the relevant treaty could seek resolution. This will address double taxation concerns. We do not, however, expect this will occur frequently because of the shift in the international consensus on what is acceptable in relation to the pricing of related party debt. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-strengthening our interest limitation rules 1 17 Allowable debt levels At this stage, we do not have a preference between option 1 (non-debt liability adjustment as originally proposed) and option 2 (non-debt liability adjustment with deferred tax carve- out). Option 3 (status quo) is not preferred. Both options 1 and 2 have similar impacts in terms of efficiency and fairness (and have no significant impacts in terms of compliance and administration costs). The non-debt liability adjustment in option 1 is potentially too extensive because of the inclusion of all types of deferred tax, but, on the other hand, the adjustment in option 2 is too narrow because of the exclusion of all deferred tax. We consider that the best approach is to recommend neither options 1 or 2 at this stage, but instead consult further with stakeholders on whether there is another feasible option (since this is a minor technical detail, more consultation on this matter is feasible). For example, it might be possible to identify deferred tax liabilities that are the least likely to result in a future tax payment, and restrict the carve-out of deferred tax to just that identified group.

As discussed above, allowing BEPS through interest deductions is inefficient and unfair, as it results in uneven tax burdens across different businesses. This is an issue in itself, but it may also weaken taxpayer morale. The perception of unfairness that comes from the reported low corporate taxes paid by taxpayers who can take use interest deductions to reduce their New Zealand (and possibly worldwide) tax liability is an important issue. This perception of unfairness undermines public confidence in the tax system and therefore the willingness of taxpayers to voluntarily comply with their own tax obligations. This integrity factor is difficult to assign to a particular set of stakeholders. lt is something that is fundamental to the tax system itself, which all of the stakeholders already discussed have an interest in preserving. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government's 'Expectations for the design of regulatory systems'? Yes. Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? Implementation of both reforms (relating to related-party interest rates and allowable debt level) will be given effect through a combination of legislation and Inland Revenue administrative guidance. The legislative changes proposed will be progressed (subject to Cabinet approval) as part of a BEPS taxation bill to be introduced in late 2017. The bill, when introduced, will be accompanied by commentary in order to provide stakeholders with guidance as to the intended application of the provisions. Inland Revenue will also produce guidance on the enacted legislation in its Tax Information Bulletin. In relation to the allowable debt level proposal, we will consult further with stakeholders on whether a preferred option can be identified. The Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue will make the final decision on which option should be progressed (option 1, option 2, or a potential new option) following this consultation. These reforms are expected to apply from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018, subject to legislation progressing to enactment before this date. Some submitters on the discussion document argued that transitional relief or grandparenting should be provided to give taxpayers sufficient lead-in time to restructure their affairs if necessary. We consider that the planned application date of 1 July 2018 is sufficiently prospective because: • the interest rate proposal applies only to related-party transactions (which are more easily altered compared to transactions with third-parties); and • in relation to the allowable debt level proposal, debt and asset levels under the thin capitalisation rules can be measured as at the end of the relevant income year, meaning taxpayers would have until at least 30 June 2019 to rearrange their affairs. In addition, in response to consultation, we propose that advanced pricing agreements Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-strengthening our interest limitation rules 1 21 (APAs) existing prior to the application date of these changes will be grandparented. Once the proposals are implemented, Inland Revenue will be responsible for the ongoing operation and enforcement of the new rules. Inland Revenue has not identified any concerns with its ability to implement these reforms. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? There is the risk that the relevant transfer pricing legislation could contain unintended errors or have unintended consequences. However, this risk can be efficiently managed by way of remedial amendments. Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of tax changes would take place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. Existing investigations functions for monitoring the behaviour of taxpayers will continue to be used for the proposed rules of this regulatory proposal. Inland Revenue closely monitors the tax affairs of New Zealand's largest companies {which are, in general, the affected population of these proposals). For example, Inland Revenue currently collects data from these firms on their debt levels (including levels of related-party debt) through its International Questionnaire. This will allow how the proposals have impacted debt levels and related-party interest payments to be analysed. More generally, Inland Revenue is considering the appropriate level of information that should be collected to support the proposed rules for all the BEPS measures being implemented. Any additional information may be collected via a disclosure statement that must be provided to Inland Revenue or it may be collected using existing information gathering tools. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTTP involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. In practice, following enactment, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect could either be included as remedial amendments in future tax bills, or if they involve more complex issues could be added to the tax policy work programme. Further consultation would be implicit in this approach. If it became apparent that an aspect of the proposed rules is unworkable, or if the rules have created unintended consequences whether tax-related or otherwise, this would justify a review of all or part of the legislation.

**BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance**

**Proposal**

1.  This paper seeks Cabinet approval to introduce new tax rules to prevent permanent establishment avoidance, strengthen our transfer pricing rules, and help Inland Revenue investigate uncooperative multinationals. This paper is part of a comprehensive package of measures to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS).

**Executive summary**

1.  Some large multinationals are currently using tax arrangements which allow them to report low taxable profits in New Zealand despite carrying on significant economic activity here.
2.  In March this year, the Government released a discussion document called _BEPS –_ _Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_ to consult on proposals to combat these arrangements. Many of these proposals are similar to tax reforms that Australia has introduced in recent years. They are also broadly consistent with the OECD’s _Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting_ (BEPS Action Plan).
3.  Submissions and workshops with the private sector were used to refine the proposals and better target them at the BEPS activities we are concerned about, whilst reducing the compliance costs and other unintended impacts on taxpayers engaging in ordinary, commercial dealings.
4.  We recommend that nearly all of the proposals in the discussion document proceed, subject to some changes following consultation. The most significant changes made to the original proposals as a result of consultation were:

*   The proposed permanent establishment (PE) avoidance rule should be more narrowly targeted at avoidance arrangements. We would like to consult further as to how best to achieve this.
*   Clarification of the circumstances in which Inland Revenue would be able to reconstruct a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position. We recommend clarifying that the test for reconstructing an arrangement would be based on the corresponding test in the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines.
*   The proposal to require disputed tax to be paid earlier should not proceed. This is because we consider it to be unnecessary in light of the current “use of money” interest rate regime.

1.  These changes are likely to be welcomed by submitters and do not reduce the overall effectiveness of the proposed reforms.
2.  We recommend Cabinet delegate authority to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue to make final decisions on the detailed design of the proposed rules. As we continue to design the detail of the proposals there will be further targeted consultation with interested parties.
3.  The forecast tax revenue from implementing the transfer pricing and PE avoidance measures is $25m in 2018/19 and $50m per annum from 2019/20. Some of this revenue has already been included in the Budget 2017 forecasts.

**Background**

1.  In February this year, Cabinet agreed to release the Government discussion document _BEPS –_ _Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_ (CAB-17-MIN-0041 refers).
2.  The discussion document, which was released in March 2017, consulted on proposals to combat aggressive tax strategies which allow some multinationals to report low taxable profits in New Zealand despite carrying on significant economic activity here. These strategies involve:

*   **_Tax structuring_**: In order for New Zealand to tax a non-resident on its sales here, the non-resident must have a taxable presence (a permanent establishment or “PE”) in New Zealand. However, non-residents can structure their affairs to avoid such a taxable presence, even when they are involved in significant economic activity here (PE avoidance). Non-residents can also enter into arrangements with related parties that reduce their taxable profits in New Zealand, but lack economic substance (transfer pricing avoidance).
*   **_Creating enforcement barriers:_** It is difficult and resource intensive to assess and engage in disputes with multinationals in practice. This is due to the highly factual nature of the issues and the difficulties Inland Revenue faces in obtaining the relevant information.

1.  The OECD and the G20 are also concerned about these kinds of BEPS strategies, and have recommended measures to address them in their 15 point BEPS Action Plan. These include:

*   a widened definition of “permanent establishment” for double tax agreements (DTAs), to counter PE avoidance (however this will only be included in a DTA if both countries agree); and

*   updated transfer pricing guidelines, to counter profit shifting.

**Comment**

1.  We have developed a package of proposed tax law changes to combat transfer pricing and PE avoidance. The main elements of the proposed reform package are:

*   The introduction of a new PE avoidance rule that will prevent multinationals from structuring their operations to avoid having a PE in New Zealand where one exists in substance.
*   Stronger “source rules” so New Zealand has a greater ability to tax New Zealand-sourced income.
*   Stronger transfer pricing rules which will adjust related party transactions if they do not align with the actual substance of the multinational’s economic activities. We also propose shifting the burden of proof onto the taxpayer (rather than Inland Revenue) for proving that their related party dealings are consistent with those that would be agreed by third parties operating at arm’s length, and extending the time bar (the period of time which Inland Revenue has to reassess a taxpayer) from four years to seven years for transfer pricing.
*   A range of administrative measures that will strengthen Inland Revenue’s powers to investigate large multinationals (with at least EUR €750m of global revenues). These are similar to some of the administrative powers provided under the UK and Australia’s Diverted Profit Taxes but New Zealand’s administrative measures are more targeted at the practical barriers faced by tax investigators as they will only apply when a multinational does not cooperate with a tax investigation.

1.  Many of these proposals are similar to tax reforms that Australia has introduced in recent years. They are also broadly consistent with the OECD’s BEPS Action Plan, although the specific proposals are tailored for the New Zealand environment to address issues that Inland Revenue has identified when investigating multinationals.

**Private sector consultation**

1.  15 submitters provided written submissions on the discussion document. The Treasury and Inland Revenue also met with six of these submitters to discuss their submissions.

**_General reaction_**

1.  Overall, most submitters accepted in principle the need for measures to address the transfer pricing and PE avoidance issues identified in the discussion document. However, they did raise issues with certain features of the proposed measures and made suggestions to make them more certain and better targeted.
2.  Two of the 15 submitters welcomed the proposals as a positive step by the Government to ensure that all large multinationals are paying their fair share of tax.
3.  The other 13 submitters were tax advisors or represent multinationals that could be negatively affected by the proposals. Their submissions were critical of some of the measures.
4.  Some submitters argued that the proposals could have a detrimental effect on New Zealand being an attractive investment destination and should not be implemented. As noted in the accompanying covering Cabinet Paper (_Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting_), there will be additional tax and compliance costs for some investors but these additional costs will mostly be borne by taxpayers engaging in BEPS activities and the overall benefits to New Zealand of addressing BEPS outweigh these costs.
5.  As expected, most of the submitters opposed the administrative proposals to increase Inland Revenue's powers to investigate multinationals. However, we consider these new powers are necessary to ensure Inland Revenue can effectively enforce the new rules. These new powers include:

*   Expanding Inland Revenue's ability to request information that is held by a related group member offshore. Submitters considered this proposal could unfairly penalise a New Zealand entity that may not be able to get the information from their multinational group members. However, we consider it is unacceptable for Inland Revenue’s investigations to be frustrated because a multinational group fails to provide information that is under its control.

*   Shifting the burden of proof for transfer pricing onto the taxpayer (rather than Inland Revenue) for proving that their related party dealings are consistent with those that would be agreed by third parties operating at arm’s length. Submitters considered Inland Revenue had information regarding comparable transactions and should bear the burden of proof. However, shifting the burden of proof is consistent with the fact that the taxpayer holds the relevant information on their own transfer pricing practices. The burden of proof is already on the taxpayer for other tax matters and is also on the taxpayer for transfer pricing matters in most other OECD and G20 countries, including Australia. Because most multinationals already prepare transfer pricing documentation that satisfies the burden of proof for other countries, the additional compliance costs from this change are not expected to be substantial.

*   Extending the time bar (the period of time which Inland Revenue has to adjust a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position) from four years to seven years for transfer pricing. Submitters opposed this extension on the basis that it increased uncertainty and was out of step with the general time bar, which applies to other areas of tax. However, we are continuing to recommend the seven year rule. Having a longer time bar for transfer pricing cases is consistent with both Australia and Canada (who also have a special seven year time bar for transfer pricing) and reflects the information asymmetry that exists in transfer pricing cases (especially where taxpayers may hold relevant information offshore).

**_Changes made as a result of consultation_**

1.  In response to submissions, we have updated the proposals to address many of the submitters’ concerns while ensuring the measures are just as effective at combatting BEPS.
2.  Many submissions focused on when the PE avoidance rule would apply. Submitters considered the proposal outlined in the discussion document applied too broadly and could have unintended impacts on compliant taxpayers engaging in ordinary, commercial dealings.
3.  We consider the PE avoidance rule should be more narrowly targeted at avoidance arrangements. We would like to consult further as to how best to achieve this.
4.  Submitters also pointed out that the OECD has updated their model DTA to address PE avoidance and New Zealand is currently in the process of adopting this into some of our tax treaties by signing the OECD’s _Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting_ and through negotiating new tax treaties. We agree that the domestic law PE avoidance rule will only be necessary when the relevant tax treaty does not yet include the OECD’s new recommendation and propose narrowing the application of rule accordingly.
5.  The PE avoidance rule would apply notwithstanding the relevant DTAs (that don’t yet include the OECD’s new model PE rule). We consider that this is acceptable for two reasons:

*   The OECD’s commentary to their model DTA contemplates that countries can adopt anti-avoidance rules and states that, as a general rule, there will be no conflict between such anti-avoidance provisions and the provisions of a DTA. An existing example of this is New Zealand’s General Anti-Avoidance Rule which explicitly overrides our DTAs to allow New Zealand to combat tax avoidance arrangements. The PE avoidance rule would be a specific anti-avoidance rule, which would also be consistent with the principle in the OECD’s commentary.
*   The UK and Australia have already implemented similar PE avoidance rules in their domestic laws which override their DTAs and their treaty partners have not challenged this.

1.  Another major point raised by submitters was the need to clarify the circumstances in which Inland Revenue would be able to reconstruct a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position. We recommend clarifying that the test for reconstructing an arrangement would be based on the corresponding test in the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines.
2.  Other significant changes made as a result of consultation were:

*   The anti-avoidance source rule will be more narrowly targeted at the existing issues Inland Revenue has identified with the source rules.
*   We have decided not to proceed with the proposal to require multinationals to pay disputed tax upfront as we agree with submitters that the existing “use of money” interest rates that Inland Revenue charges on unpaid tax provide a sufficient incentive to pay tax that is in dispute.

1.  The above changes will make the rules more certain and better targeted and are likely to be welcomed by submitters.
2.  We also recommend widening the scope of the original proposal to deem an amount of income to have a New Zealand source under our domestic legislation if we have a right to tax the income under a DTA. The rule proposed in the discussion document was limited to income covered by the PE and royalty articles of our DTAs. We should extend the rule to all types of income that we can tax under a DTA – as Australia does. This ensures we can exercise a taxing right that we have negotiated under a DTA. We will consult further on this wider proposal in the next round of consultation.
3.  These recommended changes will not affect the originally forecast revenue from implementing the transfer pricing and PE avoidance measures, which is $25m in 2018/19 and $50m per annum from 2019/20 (some of this revenue has already been included in the Budget 2017 forecasts).
4.  We recommend Cabinet delegate authority to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue to make final decisions on the detailed design of the proposed rules. As we continue to design the detail of the proposals there will be further targeted consultation with interested parties.

**Agency consultation**

1.  Inland Revenue and Treasury officials have consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment on this Cabinet paper.

**Financial implications, human rights, administrative impacts, legislative implications, publicity**

1.  These are set out in the accompanying covering Cabinet paper for the overall BEPS package (_Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting_).

**Impact Analysis Requirements**

1.  Cabinet's Impact Analysis Requirements apply to these proposals and a Regulatory Impact Assessment is required. This has been prepared by Inland Revenue and is attached.
2.  The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Regulatory Impact Assessment and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria.

**Recommendations**

1.  We recommend that the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee:

1\. **Note** that in March this year the Government released a discussion document called _BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_ which proposed some detailed measures to improve our ability to tax multinationals that operate in New Zealand.

2\. **Note** that in response to submissions we have made the proposed measures better targeted at the BEPS concerns without reducing the overall effectiveness of the proposed reforms.

3. **Agree** to introduce a new PE avoidance rule that will apply to large multinationals that structure their businesses to avoid having a PE (taxable presence) in New Zealand.

4\. **Agree** to expand and strengthen the rules for taxing New Zealand-sourced income by:

*   deeming certain amounts of income to have a source in New Zealand if New Zealand has a right to tax that income under any applicable DTA;
*   introducing an anti-avoidance source rule which will broadly provide that, where another group member carries on a non-resident’s business in New Zealand, the non-resident will be deemed to carry on that business itself for the purpose of determining whether its income from New Zealand customers has a New Zealand source; and
*   addressing a potential weakness of the life insurance source rules by ensuring that no deductions are available for the reinsurance of life policies if the premium income on that policy is not taxable in New Zealand, including where the income is not subject to New Zealand tax by operation of a DTA.

5\. **Agree** to strengthen the transfer pricing rules so they align with the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines and Australia’s transfer pricing rules. This involves amending New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules so that:

*   they disregard legal form if it does not align with the actual economic substance of the transaction;
*   they provide Inland Revenue with a power to reconstruct transfer pricing arrangements which are not commercially rational because they include unrealistic terms that third parties would not be willing to agree to;
*   the legislation specifically refers to arm’s length conditions;
*   they refer to the latest OECD transfer pricing guidelines as guidance for how the rules are applied;
*   the new legislation codifies the requirement for large multinationals to provide Inland Revenue with the information required to comply with the OECD’s country-by-country reporting initiative;
*   the time bar that limits Inland Revenue’s ability to adjust a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position is increased to seven years (in line with Australia);
*   the burden of proof for demonstrating that a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position aligns with arm’s length conditions is shifted from Inland Revenue to the taxpayer (consistent with the burden of proof being on the taxpayer for other tax matters); and
*   in addition to applying to transactions between related parties, the transfer pricing rules will also apply when non-resident investors “act in concert” to effectively control a New Zealand entity, such as through a private equity manager.

6\. **Agree** to strengthen Inland Revenue’s powers to investigate large multinationals (with at least EUR €750m of global revenues) that do not cooperate with a tax investigation by amending the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow Inland Revenue to:

*   more readily assess the multinational’s tax position based on the information available to Inland Revenue at the time;
*   collect any tax owed by a member of a large multinational group from any wholly-owned group member, provided the non-resident fails to pay the tax itself;
*   use section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to request information that is held offshore by another group member of the large multinational group;
*   use section 21 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to deem an amount of income to be allocated to a New Zealand group member or PE of a large multinational group in cases where they have failed to adequately respond to an information request in relation to New Zealand sourced income (currently the existing power only applies in respect of deductible payments); and
*   impose a new civil penalty of up to $100,000 for large multinational groups which fail to provide requested information (which replaces the current $12,000 maximum criminal penalty).

7\. **Note** that the fiscal consequences of the above measures are set out in the covering Cabinet paper for the overall BEPS package (_Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting_).

8\. **Delegate** authority to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue to make final decisions on the detailed design of the above measures.

9\. **Agree** that the results of the decisions in recommendations 3-6 and 8 be included in a BEPS taxation bill to be introduced to Parliament before the end of 2017.

The rule proposed in the discussion document was limited to income covered by the PE and royalty articles of our DTAs. We should extend the rule to all types of income that we can tax under a DTA – as Australia does. This ensures we can exercise a taxing right that we have negotiated under a DTA. We will consult further on this wider proposal in the next round of consultation. 29. These recommended changes will not affect the originally forecast revenue from implementing the transfer pricing and PE avoidance measures, which is $25m in 2018/19 and $50m per annum from 2019/20 (some of this revenue has already been included in the Budget 2017 forecasts). 30. We recommend Cabinet delegate authority to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue to make final decisions on the detailed design of the proposed rules. As we continue to design the detail of the proposals there will be further targeted consultation with interested parties. Agency consultation 31. Inland Revenue and Treasury officials have consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment on this Cabinet paper. Financial implications, human rights, administrative impacts, legislative implications, publicity 32. These are set out in the accompanying covering Cabinet paper for the overall BEPS package (Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting). 6 Impact Analysis Requirements 33. Cabinet's Impact Analysis Requirements apply to these proposals and a Regulatory Impact Assessment is required. This has been prepared by Inland Revenue and is attached. 34. The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Regulatory Impact Assessment and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria. Recommendations 35. We recommend that the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee: 1. Note that in March this year the Government released a discussion document called BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance which proposed some detailed measures to improve our ability to tax mult inationals that operate in New Zealand. 2. Note that in response to submissions we have made the proposed measures better targeted at the BEPS concerns without reducing the overall effectiveness of the proposed reforms. 3. Agree to introduce a new PE avoidance rule that will apply to large multinationals that structure their businesses to avoid having a PE (taxable presence) in New Zealand. 4. Agree to expand and strengthen the rules for taxing New Zealand-sourced income by: • deeming certain amounts of income to have a source in New Zealand if New Zealand has a right to tax that income under any applicable DTA; • introducing an anti-avoidance source rule which will broadly provide that, where another group member carries on a non-resident’s business in New Zealand, the non-resident will be deemed to carry on that business itself for the purpose of determining whether its income from New Zealand customers has a New Zealand source; and • addressing a potential weakness of the life insurance source rules by ensuring that no deductions are available for the reinsurance of life policies if the premium income on that policy is not taxable in New Zealand, including where the income is not subject to New Zealand tax by operation of a DTA. 5. Agree to strengthen the transfer pricing rules so they align with the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines and Australia’s transfer pricing rules. This involves amending New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules so that: • they disregard legal form if it does not align with the actual economic substance of the transaction; • they provide Inland Revenue with a power to reconstruct transfer pricing arrangements which are not commercially rational because they include unrealistic terms that third parties would not be willing to agree to; • the legislation specifically refers to arm’s length conditions; 7 • they refer to the latest OECD transfer pricing guidelines as guidance for how the rules are applied; • the new legislation codifies the requirement for large multinationals to provide Inland Revenue with the information required to comply with the OECD’s country-by-country reporting initiative; • the time bar that limits Inland Revenue’s ability to adjust a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position is increased to seven years (in line with Australia); • the burden of proof for demonstrating that a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position aligns with arm’s length conditions is shifted from Inland Revenue to the taxpayer (consistent with the burden of proof being on the taxpayer for other tax matters); and • in addition to applying to transactions between related parties, the transfer pricing rules will also apply when non-resident investors “act in concert” to effectively control a New Zealand entity, such as through a private equity manager. 6. Agree to strengthen Inland Revenue’s powers to investigate large mult inationals (with at least EUR €750m of global revenues) that do not cooperate with a tax investigation by amending the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow Inland Revenue to: • more readily assess the multinational’s tax position based on the information available to Inland Revenue at the time; • collect any tax owed by a member of a large multinational group from any wholly-owned group member, provided the non-resident fails to pay the tax itself; • use section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to request information that is held offshore by another group member of the large multinational group; • use section 21 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to deem an amount of income to be allocated to a New Zealand group member or PE of a large multinational group in cases where they have failed to adequately respond to an information request in relation to New Zealand sourced income (currently the existing power only applies in respect of deductible payments); and • impose a new civil penalty of up to $100,000 for large multinational groups which fail to provide requested information (which replaces the current $12,000 maximum criminal penalty). 7. Note that the fiscal consequences of the above measures are set out in the covering Cabinet paper for the overall BEPS package (Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting). 8. Delegate authority to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue to make final decisio ns on the detailed design of the above measures. 9. Agree that the results of the decisions in recommendations 3-6 and 8 be included in a BEPS taxation bill to be introduced to Parliament before the end of 2017. 8 Authorised for lodgement Hon Steven Joyce Minister of Finance Hon Judith Collins Minister of Revenue
Coversheet: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules Advising agencies The Treasury and Inland Revenue Decision sought This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final tax policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet Proposing Ministers Steven Joyce (Finance) and Hon Judith Collins (Revenue) Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? There are international concerns about multinationals not paying their fair share of tax. This is because some multinationals use base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) strategies to report low taxable profits in New Zealand and other countries in which they operate. These BEPS strategies include arrangements between related parties which shift profits out of New Zealand (usually into a lower taxed jurisdiction). They also include arrangements which are designed to ensure New Zealand is not able to tax any income from sales here despite there being a physical presence in New Zealand in relation to the sales. These particular BEPS strategies are known as transfer pricing and permanent establishment (PE) avoidance. Finally, Inland Revenue faces administrative difficulties in investigating large multinationals. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? The proposed approach is to adopt the package of measures outlined in the Government discussion document BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance (March 2017), with some changes resulting from consultation, as the measures will: •ensure that multinationals cannot structure their affairs for the purpose of avoiding a taxable presence in New Zealand; •stop companies from shifting profits out of the New Zealand tax base through artificial arrangements; and •make it easier for Inland Revenue to investigate such multinationals. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 1 BEPS documents release - August 2017: #18 Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The Government will benefit by receiving an additional $50 million of revenue per annum. Compliant businesses will benefit because the multinationals involved in transfer pricing and PE avoidance activities will no longer be able to achieve a competitive advantage. Also, the measures will support voluntary compliance by protecting the integrity of the tax system. Where do the costs fall? Multinationals which currently engage in BEPS activities will face a medium level of compliance costs. These taxpayers may choose to transition into more tax compliant agreements which will require restructuring costs; or they may apply for advance pricing agreements (APAs). However, the majority of multinationals are compliant and should not be materially affected by the proposals. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? There is a risk that foreign companies investing in New Zealand will view the proposals as complex and onerous, incentivising them to remove their existing personnel from New Zealand or to cease operating in New Zealand altogether. However, most of the affected foreign companies are dependent on having personnel in New Zealand to arrange their sales. Without personnel on the ground, they would not be able to service their New Zealand market. It is also unlikely that they would cease to operate in New Zealand altogether. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. There is no incompatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? There is limited certainty of evidence in relation to the problem of transfer pricing and PE avoidance arrangements. This is because such activities are often not directly observable in the absence of specific audit activity. However, Inland Revenue is aware of about 16 cases involved in these types of BEPS arrangements which are currently under audit. While there are only 20 New Zealand-owned multinationals that earn over the threshold for some of the main proposals (over EUR €750 million of consolidated global revenue), the European Union (EU) has estimated that there may be up to 6,000 multinationals globally Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 2 that do. However, we do not know how many of these global multinationals operate in New Zealand. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules Regulatory Impact Assessment prepared by Inland Revenue and associated supporting material and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer’s comments on earlier versions of the Regulatory Impact Assessment have been incorporated into the final version. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 3 Impact Statement: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final tax policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Evidence of the problem Our analysis has been limited somewhat by our inability to assess the exact size of the transfer pricing and PE avoidance structures in New Zealand. In common with BEPS activities generally, transfer pricing and PE avoidance is difficult to quantify as tax avoidance is often not directly observable. We consider that, while most multinationals are compliant, there is a minority that engage in transfer pricing and PE avoidance. Inland Revenue is aware of about 16 cases of transfer pricing and PE avoidance currently under audit that collectively involve about $100 million per year of disputed tax. These cases show our existing rules are vulnerable and Inland Revenue considers that the use of avoidance arrangements will increase if the weaknesses in the current rules are not addressed. Furthermore, as New Zealand endorses the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS Action Plan), there is an expectation that we will take action against BEPS and implement a number of the OECD’s recommendations. Range of options considered Our analysis of options has been primarily constrained by New Zealand’s double tax agreements (DTAs). Under its DTAs, New Zealand can only tax non-residents on business profits if they have a PE in New Zealand. We have also been somewhat constrained by the fact that New Zealand endorses the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines. Assumptions underpinning impact analysis The estimated impact of the options is dependent on the behavioural response of taxpayers to the introduction of some form of transfer pricing and PE avoidance arrangement rules. Taxpayers may rearrange their affairs to fall outside the scope of any proposed rules, which will have flow-on effects as to efficiency, compliance costs, and revenue implications. Beyond anecdotal information learned through consultation, it is difficult to assess the extent and nature of the behavioural response. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 4 Responsible Manager (signature and date): Carmel Peters Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 13 July 2017 Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 5 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? BEPS BEPS refers to the aggressive tax planning strategies used by some multinationals to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. This outcome is achieved when multinationals exploit gaps and mismatches in countries’ domestic tax rules to avoid tax. BEPS strategies distort investment decisions, allow multinationals to benefit from unintended competitive advantages over more compliant or domestic companies, and result in the loss of substantial corporate tax revenue. More fundamentally, the perceived unfairness resulting from BEPS jeopardises citizens’ trust in the integrity of the tax system as a whole. In 2013, the OECD published its BEPS Action Plan which identified actions needed to address BEPS (including transfer pricing and PE avoidance), set deadlines to implement these actions, and identified the resources needed and the methodology to implement these actions. In 2015, the OECD released its final package of recommended actions for countries to implement to counter BEPS. If no action is taken to counter transfer pricing and PE avoidance arrangements, multinationals that are currently engaging in these types of arrangements will be able to continue, and the number of these types of avoidance cases will continue to increase. New Zealand’s BEPS work New Zealand is a supporter of the OECD/G20 BEPS project to address international avoidance and is advancing a number of the OECD/G20 BEPS recommendations. In September 2016, the Government released the BEPS discussion document Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements. In March 2017, the Government released two further discussion documents: BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules; and BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance; along with the officials’ issues paper New Zealand’s implementation of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS. The BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance discussion document consulted on the Government’s proposal to introduce a new set of tax rules to counter BEPS activities involving transfer pricing and PE avoidance. Many of the proposals follow the OECD’s BEPS Action Plan recommendations (such as updating our transfer pricing legislation to align with the OECD’s new transfer pricing guidelines). Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 6 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? New Zealand’s tax system New Zealand has a broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) taxation framework. This means that tax bases are broad and tax rates are kept as low as possible while remaining consistent with the Government’s distributional objectives. The BBLR framework ensures the tax system is not generally used to deliver incentives or encourage particular behaviours. Having a consistent tax framework such as BBLR does not mean that tax changes are unnecessary. An ongoing policy challenge is to ensure that our tax rules are up to date and result in multinational firms paying a fair and efficient amount of tax in New Zealand. Base protection measures, such as transfer pricing and PE rules, are important to protect the tax base and ensure that New Zealand collects an appropriate amount of tax on non-resident investment. At the same time, it is important that New Zealand continues to be a good place to base a business and that tax does not get in the way of this happening. New Zealand relies heavily on foreign direct investment to fund domestic investment and, as such, the Government is committed to ensuring New Zealand remains an attractive place for non-residents to invest. New Zealand’s PE rules New Zealand’s ability to tax non-residents on their New Zealand sales income is determined by our domestic tax rules in conjunction with our DTAs. Under our DTAs, New Zealand is generally prevented from taxing a non-resident’s business income unless the non-resident has a PE in New Zealand. This is the case even if that income has a source in New Zealand under our domestic legislation. In general, New Zealand can only tax a non-resident multinational group on its sales here if both of the following conditions are met: • The multinational group has a sufficient taxable presence in New Zealand. This means the group must operate in New Zealand either through a New Zealand- resident subsidiary (in which case the subsidiary is taxable on its income) or through a PE of a non-resident group member. A PE is basically a place of business of the non-resident, but it also includes an agent acting for the non-resident. • Where a multinational operates in New Zealand through a PE of a non-resident group member, some of the non-resident’s net profits from its sales can be attributed to its taxable presence here. This involves determining: o The amount of the non-resident’s gross sales income which can be attributed to its PE here; and o The amount of the expenses which can be deducted from that income to determine the net taxable profits in New Zealand. The non-resident must also have a sufficient taxable presence in New Zealand (if a DTA applies) for New Zealand to charge non-resident withholding tax on certain payments by the non-resident (such as a royalty) to other parties in connection with the New Zealand sales income. New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules “Transfer pricing” refers to the use of cross-border payments between associated entities such as a parent and a subsidiary. Transfer pricing rules are therefore concerned with Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 7 determining the conditions, including the price (and therefore the tax liability), for transactions within a multinational group resulting in the allocation of profits to group companies in different jurisdictions. New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation was first introduced in 1995 and is largely focused on the legal form of the transaction and adjusting the consideration that is paid to an arm’s length amount (which can be zero). Due to the increased complexity and tax planning of cross-border intra-group trade over the last 22 years, New Zealand’s existing transfer pricing rules are unable to adequately address some types of profit shifting. General anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) New Zealand also has a general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) which effectively overrides other provisions of the tax legislation to deny the tax benefits of an arrangement when a more than incidental purpose of the arrangement is to obtain a tax benefit. However, the GAAR is unlikely to be effective at addressing all transfer pricing and PE avoidance structures on its own. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The problem of transfer pricing and PE avoidance Some multinational companies operating in New Zealand exploit deficiencies in the current international tax system (both in New Zealand and abroad) by using transfer pricing and PE avoidance strategies to report low taxable profits in New Zealand despite carrying out significant economic activity here. Transfer pricing and PE avoidance can lead to unfairness and the substitution of low-taxed investors for tax-paying investors. This has the potential to reduce national income while doing little or nothing to reduce the overall pre-tax cost of capital to New Zealand or increase the overall level of investment. It also distorts the allocation of investment by favouring foreign investors who set out to game the system. Transfer pricing avoidance One of the major strategies used by multinationals to shift profits out of New Zealand and reduce their worldwide tax bills is transfer pricing. Related parties may agree to pay an artificially high or low price for goods, services, funding, or intangibles compared to the “arm’s length” price or conditions that an unrelated third party would be willing to pay or accept under a similar transaction. By manipulating these transfer prices or conditions, profits can be shifted out of New Zealand and into a lower-taxed country or entity. PE avoidance Some multinationals reduce their New Zealand tax liability by structuring their affairs to avoid a PE arising, despite carrying on significant activity here. Impacted population These rules affect only taxpayers with foreign connections – that is, foreign-owned New Zealand taxpayers, and New Zealand-owned taxpayers with foreign operations. The impacted population is therefore predominately large companies. Many of the proposed measures will apply only to multinational groups with over EUR €750 million of consolidated global revenue. While there are only 20 New Zealand-owned multinationals that earn this much, the EU has estimated that there may be up to 6,000 Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 8 multinationals globally that do. However, we do not know how many of these global multinationals operate in New Zealand. Transfer pricing and PE arrangements in New Zealand Inland Revenue is aware of about 16 cases of transfer pricing and PE avoidance currently under audit that collectively involve about $100 million per year of disputed tax. These cases show our existing rules are vulnerable and Inland Revenue considers that the use of avoidance arrangements will increase if the weaknesses in the current rules are not strengthened. Furthermore, as New Zealand endorses the OECD’s BEPS Action Plan, there is an expectation that we will take action against BEPS and implement a number of the OECD’s recommendations. Inland Revenue’s judgement is that the transfer pricing and PE proposals can expect to add $50 million a year of revenue to the forecasts. This $50 million per year estimate relates to the fact that the proposals will make it more difficult to avoid tax under the transfer pricing and PE rules and easier to find and assess any remaining avoidance cases. This should reduce future avoidance arrangements and free up investigator resources. The changes will also result in more revenue being able to be assessed from any multinationals which continue to use transfer pricing or PE avoidance arrangements. 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? Our analysis of options has been primarily constrained by New Zealand’s DTAs. Under our DTAs, New Zealand can only tax non-residents on business profits if they have a PE in New Zealand. The OECD guidance permits departure from this only in respect of tax avoidance. We have also been somewhat constrained by the fact that New Zealand endorses the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines. 1 Most of the submitters were stakeholder groups, tax advisors, and foreign-owned firms that would be affected by the proposals. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? Submissions on the discussion document The Government received 16 submissions on the discussion document from key stakeholders. 1 We also met with six of the main submitters to discuss their submissions in more detail. Many submitters strongly opposed the proposals that increased Inland Revenue’s power to investigate large multinationals. Others argued that the proposals could have a detrimental effect on New Zealand being an attractive investment destination and should not be implemented. However, most submitters accepted the need for measures to address the transfer pricing and PE avoidance issues identified in the discussion document. Some submitters even welcomed the proposals as a positive step by the Government to ensure multinationals pay their fair share of tax. Further consultation Following Cabinet decisions in July 2017, we are planning to undertake further public Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 9 consultation on outstanding policy issues, technical design details, and an exposure draft of selected parts of the planned BEPS bill. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 10 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? Officials have identified four mutually exclusive options to address the problem: • Option 1 – Status quo • Option 2 – MLI and the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines • Option 3 – Diverted profit tax • Option 4 – Discussion document proposals (as amended through consultation) Option 1 is the only non-regulatory option. The other options involve implementing an international agreement or changing New Zealand tax legislation. Option 1: Status quo This option would retain the existing tax rules for multinationals (as described in the sections above). Under this option, Inland Revenue would continue trying to enforce the existing rules and/or apply the GAAR to challenge tax avoidance arrangements. Option 2: MLI and the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines Option 2 is to rely on the combination of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI) 2 and the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines without amending our domestic law. Under this option, any PE avoidance issues would be addressed under the OECD’s new PE definition in the MLI, and any transfer pricing issues would be addressed by applying the OECD’s new transfer pricing guidelines. Option 3: Diverted profits tax Option 3 is to adopt a diverted profits tax (DPT). A DPT is a separate tax on the “diverted profits” that arise from transfer pricing and PE avoidance. It is levied at a penal rate, compared with income tax, and has greatly enhanced assessment and collection powers. Both the UK and Australia have already implemented a DPT to target multinationals engaging in BEPS strategies. DPTs are intended to incentivise taxpayers to pay the correct amount of income tax under the normal rules rather than to raise revenue by themselves. Option 4: Discussion document proposals (as amended through consultation) This option involves adopting the package of measures proposed in the discussion document, with some changes resulting from consultation. The discussion document proposals have taken certain features of a DPT and combined them with the OECD’s BEPS measures and some domestic law amendments to produce a package of measures that is tailored for the New Zealand environment. The intention is that this approach would be as effective as a DPT in addressing transfer pricing and PE avoidance in New Zealand, but it would do so within our current frameworks and with fewer drawbacks. Under this option, we would introduce: • an anti-avoidance rule that will prevent multinationals from structuring their operations 2 The MLI allows countries to quickly and efficiently implement a number of the OECD’s BEPS Action Plan measures that can only be implemented through changes to DTAs, without having to bilaterally renegotiate their existing DTAs. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 11 to avoid having a PE (a taxable presence) in New Zealand where one exists in substance; • stronger transfer pricing rules which will adjust related party transactions if they do not align with the actual substance of the multinational’s economic activities; shift the burden of proof onto the taxpayer (rather than Inland Revenue) for proving that their related party dealings are consistent with those that would be agreed by third parties operating at arm’s length; and extend the time bar for transfer pricing from four years to seven years; • stronger “source rules” so New Zealand has a greater ability to tax New Zealand- sourced income; and • a range of administrative measures that will strengthen Inland Revenue’s powers to investigate large multinationals (with at least EUR €750m of global revenues) that do not cooperate with a tax investigation (such as allowing Inland Revenue to request information that is held by an offshore group member). Consultation These four options were identified prior to consultation. The discussion document proposed the adoption of a package of reforms combining elements of a DPT with the OECD’s recommendations and some domestic law amendments (option 4). The discussion document discussed the status quo (option 1) and the DPT (option 3). Some submitters proposed that the better approach would be to sign the MLI and apply the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines without amending our domestic law (option 2). In response to consultation we have refined the proposals so they are better targeted at BEPS arrangements with less compliance costs and fewer unintended impacts on compliant taxpayers engaging in ordinary, commercial dealings. Significant changes made as a result of consultation were: • More narrowly targeting the PE avoidance rule at avoidance arrangements (we will consult further on how best to achieve this). • Clarifying that the test for reconstructing an arrangement would be based on the corresponding test in the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines. • The PE avoidance rule will only apply where an applicable DTA does not include the OECD’s widened PE definition (as in cases where the OECD’s new PE definition is included, the proposed PE avoidance rule will be unnecessary). • The anti-avoidance source rule will be more narrowly targeted at the existing issues Inland Revenue has identified with the source rules. • We have decided not to proceed with the proposal to require multinationals to pay disputed tax upfront as we agree with submitters that the existing “use of money interest” rates that Inland Revenue charges on unpaid tax provide a sufficient incentive to pay any tax which has been assessed. The above changes are likely to be welcomed by submitters. Evidence from Australia’s reforms Australia’s recent experience updating their transfer pricing laws (in 2013) and introducing a new Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL) demonstrates the effectiveness of tax reforms Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 12 to address PE avoidance and transfer pricing issues. Australia’s MAAL came into effect on 11 December 2015 and prevents multinationals from structuring their affairs to avoid having a PE in Australia. It is very similar to our proposed PE avoidance rule. As of 4 June 2017, the Australian Tax Office (ATO) had identified 221 taxpayers they believed to be shifting profits to a non-resident group member resident in a low-tax jurisdiction. Of these 221 taxpayers, the ATO has cleared 102. Furthermore, since the MAAL was introduced, 18 companies with PE avoidance structures have restructured their affairs to bring their sales onshore – and a further 11 are currently working with the ATO to restructure. According to the ATO, as a result of the introduction of the MAAL, an additional AUS$6.4 billion worth of assessable income will now be reported in Australia. This translates into $100 million a year in additional tax revenue for Australia. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The generic tax policy process (GTPP) includes a framework for assessing key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals. This framework is consistent with the Government’s vision for the tax and social policy system, and is captured by the following criteria: • Efficiency of compliance – compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as possible; • Efficiency of administration – administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible; • Neutrality – the tax system should bias economic decisions as little as possible; • Fairness and equity – similar taxpayers in similar circumstances should be treated in a similar way; and • Sustainability – the potential for tax evasion and avoidance should be minimised while keeping counteracting measures proportionate to risks involved. In relation to this regulatory proposal, it would be difficult to achieve positive sustainability, neutrality, and fairness impacts without some increase in compliance costs and so there are some trade-offs that were, and continue to be, considered. Through our consultation we have worked with stakeholders to minimise compliance costs as much as possible without sacrificing the benefits of the proposal. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? Two options were ruled out of scope due to their radical nature, namely: • cancel New Zealand’s DTAs; and • prevent multinationals from selling products in New Zealand if they were suspected of involvement in BEPS activities. The former would harm New Zealand exporters and outbound investors. The latter would not only harm New Zealand consumers (as they would no longer be able to import certain goods), but it would also violate New Zealand’s trade agreements.

See below for further details. Efficiency of administration 0 0 We do not expect there will be increased administrative costs under this option as the reforms largely change the way some taxpayers self-assess the income and deductions they report to Inland Revenue. - We expect there will be increased administrative costs under this option as a DPT is a separate tax from an income tax. 0 We do not expect there will be increased administrative costs under this option. T he proposed administrative measures should also make it easier for Inland Revenue to investigate uncooperative multinationals. See below for further details. Neutrality 0 + Option 2 will remove some of the tax benefit of currently observed transfer pricing and PE avoidance opportunities in New Zealand. See below for further details. + Option 3 will remove the tax benefit of currently observed transfer pricing and PE avoidance opportunities involving New Zealand. However, it may have a negative impact on investment certainty for taxpayers. + + Option 4 will remove the tax benefit of all currently observed transfer pricin g and PE avoidance opportunities involving New Zealand. See below for further details. Fairness and equity 0 + Option 2 has some fairness benefits as it ensures that some taxpayers able to use transfer pricing and PE avoidance arrangements cannot reduce their tax liability and pass their tax burden to others. See below for further details. 0 Option 3 has some fairness benefits as it ensures that taxpayers able to use transfer pricing and PE avoidance arrangements cannot reduce their tax liability and pass their tax burden to others. See below for further details. + Option 4 has the most fairness benefits as it ensures that all taxpayers able to use observed transfer pricing and PE avoidance arrangements cannot reduce their tax liability and pass their tax burden to others. Sustainability 0 + Option 2 will remove some, but not all, of the current transfer pricing and PE establishment opportunities involving New Zealand. + Option 3 will remove current transfer pricing and PE establishment opportunities involving New Zealand. See below for further details. + + Option 4 will remove current transfer pricing and PE establishment opportunities involving New Zealand and is well- targeted at the problems that have been observed by Inland Revenue in New Zealand. Overall assessment Not recommended Not recommended Not recommended Recommended Key: ++ much better than doing nothing/the status quo + better than doing nothing/the status quo 0 about the same as doing nothing/the status quo - worse than doing nothing/the status quo - - much worse than doing nothing/the status quo Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 14 Option 2 (MLI and the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines) • Neutrality: The effect of this option will be limited as the MLI will not cover many of our DTAs and New Zealand’s current transfer pricing legislation does not allow us to apply some of the new transfer pricing guidelines. • Fairness and equity: While option 2 has some fairness benefits, it will not prevent all taxpayers from using such arrangements. Option 3 (Diverted profits tax) • Fairness and equity: While option 2 has some fairness benefits, it also has some significant fairness detriments owing to its penal tax rate, reduced taxpayer rights, and wide scope. Further, a DPT could also impact on the perception of the fairness of New Zealand’s tax system for multinationals investing into New Zealand. • Sustainability: Compared to the other options it would provide less certainty for, and impose more compliance costs on, taxpayers. Option 4 (Discussion document proposals (as amended through consultation)) • Efficiency of compliance: It is also highly likely that a number of taxpayers will choose to restructure their affairs and/or apply APAs. • Efficiency of administration: The proposals may place a higher demand on Inland Revenue’s transfer pricing team and more transfer pricing specialists may be required to deal with this. • Neutrality: This option will ensure multinationals engaged in BEPS activities are not tax-advantaged over more compliant domestic and non-resident businesses. This will provide some efficiency gains. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 15 Section 5: Conclusions 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits? We consider that option 4 (discussion document proposals (as amended through consultation)) is the best option to combat transfer pricing and PE avoidance. Option 4 will improve the neutrality of New Zealand’s tax system by eliminating the ability for multinationals to engage in aggressive transfer pricing and PE avoidance schemes to receive tax benefits. Option 4 will: • ensure that multinationals cannot structure their affairs for the purpose of avoiding a taxable presence in New Zealand; • stop companies from shifting profits out of the New Zealand tax base through artificial arrangements; and • make it easier for Inland Revenue to investigate such multinationals. Option 4 will also improve the equity and fairness of New Zealand’s tax system. Multinationals engaging in BEPS activities are currently able to structure their affairs to receive unintended tax benefits placing them at a competitive advantage over more compliant multinationals or domestic companies. As a result, these more compliant multinationals and domestic companies end up suffering a greater tax burden. Option 4 will therefore ensure that the tax burden is shared more equally among taxpayers. While option 4 will impose additional tax and compliance costs on some taxpayers, it is important to note that some of the measures will only apply to large multinational groups with over EUR €750 million of consolidated group turnover. Submitters on the discussion document argued that the imposition of higher tax payments may make New Zealand a less attractive investment location for multinationals engaged in BEPS arrangements. However, as a number of like-minded countries throughout the OECD are undertaking similar BEPS measures, we believe that any impacts on foreign direct investment into New Zealand will not be material and that implementing the proposals in option 4 remains in New Zealand’s best economic interests (see further discussion in section 5.3 below). Option 1 (status quo) was preferred by a number of submitters to the discussion document. However, retaining the current rules would mean that those multinationals engaging in aggressive transfer pricing and PE avoidance structures would be able to continue, and the number of these types of avoidance cases would continue to increase. While New Zealand has a GAAR (see above in section 2.2), i t is unlikely to be effective at addressing all transfer pricing and PE avoidance structures on its own. This is because applying the GAAR often leads to resource-intensive court cases and it may be difficult to show that certain avoidance structures fail the Parliamentary contemplation component of the GAAR. Option 2 (MLI and the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines) was the option suggested by many submitters. However, we consider that adopting the OECD’s recommendations on their own (without corresponding domestic amendments) would not effectively address the issue of transfer pricing and PE avoidance. First, New Zealand’s existing transfer pricing legislation does not contemplate an ability to apply some important aspects of the new OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines. This means that Inland Revenue would only be able to Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 16 apply the guidelines to the extent that our current domestic rules allow. Domestic law changes would likely be needed to adequately address the issue. Second, while option 2 has some fairness benefits, it will not prevent all taxpayers from using such arrangements. This is because the MLI will only apply where both countries choose to adopt it – and many of New Zealand’s trading partners do not intend to adopt it. It is therefore important that New Zealand adopt its own PE avoidance measure to supplement the MLI, otherwise there would still be a gap for multinationals to exploit. Third, the OECD’s BEPS measures do not address issues specific to New Zealand, such as issues with our current source rules and the practical difficulties of taxing multinationals (such as information asymmetry and the administrative costs of taxpayer disputes). Option 3 (diverted profits tax) is not recommended. This option would provide less certainty for, and impose significant compliance costs on, taxpayers. This is because a DPT is a separate tax at a much higher rate than the standard company tax rate and includes stringent enforcement mechanisms. This means an investor may find themselves being charged a much higher rate of tax (plus interest and penalties) that can be difficult to challenge or credit against prior year losses or taxes charged by other countries. This increased risk and uncertainty may reduce their willingness to invest in New Zealand (compared to more certain investments elsewhere). 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non-monetised impacts Evidence certainty (High, medium or low) Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Compliance costs: increased costs understanding the rules and applying them to transactions and structures for multinationals which currently engage in BEPS activities.

Low Low Low Low Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 18 \*Note that the evidence for the $50 million figure is a conservative estimate made in light of the behavioural uncertainty associated with introducing transfer pricing and PE avoidance rules together with the fact that the full extent of these types of avoidance arrangements affecting New Zealand is unknown. The actual revenue generated from these reforms may therefore be significantly higher, but this cannot be estimated with confidence. 5.3 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? During consultation on the discussion document, some submitters raised concerns that adopting the proposed measures would have a detrimental impact on New Zealand being an attractive investment destination. In particular, these submitters were concerned that the proposed measures introduce complex and onerous rules which may incentivise foreign companies to remove their existing personnel from New Zealand, thereby reducing GDP and lowering employment levels. The higher tax payments and compliance obligations resulting from these measures will inevitably make New Zealand a less attractive investment location for multinationals engaged in BEPS arrangements. However, at the same time, these multinationals should not be allowed to exploit weaknesses in our tax rules to achieve a competitive advantage over more compliant multinationals or domestic firms. Furthermore, arbitrary reductions in tax, depending upon the opportunism of taxpayers, are likely to distort the allocation of investment into New Zealand. New Zealand is also undertaking these BEPS measures in line with a number of like-minded countries throughout the OECD. Given this, we believe any impacts on foreign direct investment into New Zealand will not be material and implementing these measures remains in New Zealand’s best economic interests. It is also highly unlikely that foreign companies will remove their existing personnel from New Zealand as a result of these proposals. Most of the affected foreign companies are dependent on having personnel in New Zealand to arrange their sales. Without personnel on the ground, they would not be able to service their New Zealand market. It is also unlikely that they would cease to operate in New Zealand altogether. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’? Yes, option 4 (to adopt the package of measures in the discussion document) conforms to Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 19 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? The preferred option will be given effect through amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. The bill, when introduced, will be accompanied by commentary in order to provide stakeholders with guidance as to the intended application of the provisions. Inland Revenue will also produce guidance on the enacted legislation in its Tax Information Bulletin (TIB). Once implemented, Inland Revenue will be responsible for ongoing operation and enforcement of the new rules. Inland Revenue has not identified any concerns with its ability to implement these reforms. The intended application date for most aspects of the regulatory proposal is for income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. One exception is a grandparenting rule that exempts from application of the rules all advance pricing agreements (APAs) existing prior to the application date. Some submitters on the discussion document argued that there needs to be sufficient lead-in time for these reforms to allow taxpayers to restructure their affairs if necessary. We consider the planned application date of 1 July 2018 (for most of the measures) to be sufficiently prospective when compared with the date of the discussion document release, which is when taxpayers should be regarded to be have been notified of the Government’s intention in this area, and the scheduled date of introduction of the relevant tax bill. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? We do not consider there to be many implementation risks for Inland Revenue. As with any legislative proposal, there is the risk of technical drafting errors and unintended consequences. If and when these arise, they will be dealt with by remedial amendment. In practice, these reforms will mostly involve changes for taxpayers rather than Inland Revenue. There is a risk that some taxpayers may not be able to restructure their arrangements or understand the rules in time to comply with their new obligations. To manage this risk, we plan on meeting with taxpayers and preparing detailed guidance materials. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 20 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation, and review of tax changes would take place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. Existing investigations functions for monitoring the behaviour of taxpayers will continue to be used for the proposed rules of this regulatory proposal. When the MAAL was introduced in Australia, 18 companies restructured their affairs to bring their sales onshore (and a further 11 are currently working with the ATO to restructure). We envisage a similar response to our proposals whereby a number of taxpayers will restructure their affairs to report their sales in New Zealand. We also expect more taxpayers to apply for APAs as a result of the new transfer pricing rules. However, it will be difficult to assess the true impact of the transfer pricing proposals. Inland Revenue are currently considering the appropriate level of information that should be collected to support the proposed rules for this regulatory proposal and for other BEPS proposals. This may be in the form of a disclosure statement made to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or it may form part of existing information gathering tools. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTPP process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. For example, a post- implementation workshop with stakeholders that participated in policy consultation sessions may be appropriate for these rules. In practice, any changes identified as necessary following enactment would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. If it became apparent that an aspect of the proposed rules is significantly unworkable, or if the rules have created unintended consequences whether tax-related or otherwise, this would justify a review of all or part of the legislation.

**BEPS – addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements**

**Proposal**

1.  This paper seeks Cabinet approval to introduce new tax rules to address the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements. This paper is part of a comprehensive package of measures to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). 

**Executive summary**

1.  Hybrid mismatch arrangements are, broadly speaking, cross-border arrangements that exploit differences in the tax treatment of an entity or instrument under the laws of two or more countries. The result of hybrid mismatch arrangements is less aggregate tax revenue collected in the jurisdictions to which the arrangement relates.
2.  The OECD, as part of its base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) Action Plan, published in late 2015 its final report on hybrid mismatch arrangements. This report recommended that countries enact a comprehensive set of rules to neutralise the benefit of hybrid mismatch arrangements affecting their tax base.
3.  The UK has legislated the OECD recommendations into their domestic law and Australia is committed to do the same. The EU has also issued a directive requiring its 28 member states (including the UK) to introduce anti-hybrid rules. We are not aware of any other countries intending to adopt a comprehensive set of rules, although many countries have more targeted anti-hybrid rules.
4.  The OECD recommendations will not apply to the vast majority of taxpayers. They will not apply to purely domestic firms. They apply mainly to related parties of multinational groups and planned arrangements. The expected outcome of the OECD recommendations is that the tax benefit of hybrid mismatch arrangements is eliminated, in most cases influencing taxpayers to switch to more straightforward cross-border financing instruments and structures.
5.  The Government released a discussion document in September 2016 called _Addressing Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements_ which proposed that the OECD recommendations be adopted in New Zealand and asked for feedback on how that should best be done. Since receiving submissions to this document, officials have engaged stakeholders in targeted consultation on specific design issues relating to the proposal. Consultation has resulted in some of the proposals being modified, such as a proposed exclusion from the rules for New Zealand businesses that operate offshore only through a simple branch structure. Nevertheless, many taxpayers affected by these proposals will still oppose them. Some would prefer to see a targeted approach, which would only tackle hybrids that have already been observed in New Zealand.
6.  However, in order to send the clear message that using hybrid mismatch arrangements should not produce a tax advantage, we are recommending that Cabinet agree to a comprehensive adoption of the OECD recommendations on hybrid mismatch arrangements with suitable modifications for the New Zealand context. To do otherwise may simply encourage the ongoing use of hybrids not covered by any targeted proposal. Other issues raised through the consultation process, and which are likely to attract the most comment (such as the application of the rules to foreign trusts) are set out in paragraphs 24-38 of this paper.
7.  We are further recommending that hybrids rules be included in a BEPS taxation bill to be introduced to Parliament before the end of 2017.

**Background**

**_BEPS_**

1.  New Zealand’s BEPS work programme has largely been driven by a wider momentum that has developed since 2012, when the OECD/G20 began work on their BEPS Action Plan,. Its final package of reports was released in October 2015. The Action Plan is a multifaceted approach intending to encourage countries to close many (but not all) of the avenues multinational companies currently use to reduce their worldwide tax liability, and to improve the information available to governments when they deal with multinational companies, without changing the fundamental principles for the taxation of international trade and investment.
2.  As a member of the OECD Council, New Zealand approved the 2015 BEPS final package and has supported the BEPS Action Plan since the OECD’s first declaration on BEPS in 2013.

**_Hybrid mismatch arrangements_**

1.  Hybrid mismatch arrangements are a significant base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) strategy used by some multinational companies to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world on some or all of their income. They are, broadly speaking, cross-border arrangements that exploit differences in the tax treatment of an entity or instrument under the laws of two or more countries to achieve double non-taxation.
2.  One way in which this double non-taxation can arise is through a payment being deductible for a payer in one country but not included as taxable income for the payee in the other country. Another way double non-taxation can arise is by way of a single payment being deducted against different income streams in two countries.
3.  Double non-taxation of this kind is difficult to deal with, because it can be achieved even though both countries’ tax rules are being complied with. However, it clearly reduces fairness, causes harmful distortions in investment patterns, and results in an unintended reduction in aggregate tax revenues. It is often difficult to determine which of the countries involved has lost tax revenue through the use of a hybrid mismatch arrangement, but there is undoubtedly a reduction of worldwide tax paid.

**_The OECD’s response_**

1.  The OECD has made a number of recommendations as to how countries can improve their domestic rules to prevent mismatches arising and neutralise their effect when they do arise. These recommendations relate to Action 2 of the OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan: Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements.
2.  The OECD recommends two kinds of rules. The first are rules specifically designed to reduce the likelihood of hybrid mismatches arising. The second are “linking rules”, which apply to payments that give rise to a deduction in more than one country, or which give rise to a deduction in one country but are not taxed as income in another country due to a hybrid mismatch. These generally only apply to:

*   arrangements between related parties (25% or more commonly owned) or control groups (50% or more commonly owned); or
*   structured arrangements - generally, arrangements between non-associated parties which intentionally exploit such mismatches.

1.  These linking rules are divided into “primary” and “secondary” responses. Primary responses have precedence, with secondary responses being used if the country that has the primary right does not have hybrid rules. This primary/secondary structure is important for ensuring that all hybrids with a connection to New Zealand are effectively countered irrespective of where the counterparty is based.
2.  The OECD has also developed an additional BEPS Action 2 report that makes a number of recommendations as to how countries can deal with the problem of branch mismatch arrangements which is closely related to the hybrid mismatches issue.

**_Other countries_**

1.  The UK has introduced into its domestic law rules that reflect a broad adoption of the OECD recommendations. Australia has proposed to do the same and, as part of its 2017 Budget, committed to introduce rules that are effective by 1 January 2018 or six months following Royal assent.[\[1\]](#footnote-1)
     The EU has issued a directive requiring its 28 member states (including the UK) to introduce anti-hybrid rules by 1 January 2020. We are not aware of any other countries intending to adopt a comprehensive set of rules, although many countries have more targeted anti-hybrid rules.

**_Hybrids discussion document_**

1.  On 6 September 2016, the Government released a discussion document entitled “Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements” seeking feedback on proposals to address hybrid mismatch arrangements in line with the OECD recommendations \[CAB-16-MIN-0442\].
2.  20 submissions were received on the discussion document. Most submitters accepted the need for some hybrid rules, with some submitters expressing support for New Zealand to take action in line with the OECD hybrids package, subject to various provisos, including that it was done in a co-ordinated fashion with other jurisdictions and/or that there should be concessions for hybrid regulatory capital. The majority of submissions argued that we should only implement rules to counter hybrid mismatches actually observed in New Zealand, rather than the full suite of OECD recommendations.

**Comment**

**_Implementing the full OECD hybrids package_**

1.  As set out in the cover Cabinet paper (_Tax measures to counter base erosion and profit shifting_), we are recommending that Cabinet agree to a comprehensive implementation of the OECD’s proposed solutions to the hybrid and branch mismatch problem, , even though there was limited evidence of some of the structures being used in New Zealand. We are of the view that the OECD proposals are in New Zealand’s best interests, as enacting these recommendations will improve fairness, reduce harmful distortions in investment patterns, increase tax revenue, and will also address the risk of taxpayers using new hybrid mismatch opportunities if only the more common techniques are addressed initially.
2.  In making this recommendation, we recognise that these proposals involve considerable complexity, which will not generally be welcomed by those taxpayers affected. However, we are comfortable that there are a number of factors that outweigh these concerns:

*   We are proposing to modify the OECD recommendations when it is appropriate to do so for the New Zealand context. Examples are ensuring New Zealand companies with simple foreign branch structures are not caught by the rules (see “application of hybrids rules to foreign branches” below), not applying the rules to purely domestic firms, and not introducing rules when an adequate New Zealand provision already exists.
*   We are recommending that officials continue to consult on a few particular issues that have the potential to ease the compliance costs of the proposals before we make a final decision on them under Cabinet delegated authority. These consist of elective options which would in effect allow existing hybrids to be treated as simple equity investments.
*   Despite the necessary complexity, the underlying principle is clear – using hybrid mismatches as a tax-efficient means of inbound, outbound or conduit investment is not appropriate.
*   We are recommending that relevant parties be consulted on exposure drafts of key aspects of the legislation. This is intended to facilitate workable legislation that is understandable to those applying it.
*   In almost all cases, the complexity will be optional. Taxpayers can avoid having to deal with these rules by undertaking simple debt or equity funding.

1.  Some of the other more significant issues relating to this proposal are set out below. Those are followed by a brief explanation of each of the OECD recommendations and the principles behind them. The appendix contains a series of detailed aspects of the proposals that we are also seeking Cabinet’s agreement to. These details have been consulted on with interested parties, and are consistent with the general recommendations set out below.

**Significant issues**

_Foreign trusts_

1.  As set out in the cover Cabinet paper, we are recommending that foreign trusts be included within the scope of these rules in circumstances where their treatment outside of New Zealand means income of the trust is not included in a tax calculation anywhere in the world. This is not because they are foreign trusts, but because in those circumstances they are “reverse hybrids” according to the OECD recommendations (see the discussion on OECD Recommendation 5.2, below). The same rule would equally impose tax on New Zealand limited partnerships that fit within the reverse hybrids definition.
2.  We are aware that foreign trusts have recently had a new set of disclosure rules apply to them following the 2016 Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules. In this respect, adding another regulatory regime to the industry now is unfortunate timing. To reflect the fact that these trusts have recently undergone significant compliance costs, and to give the foreign trust and limited partnership industries more time to understand the implications of the proposed rules, we are recommending a delayed effective date for New Zealand reverse hybrids of 1 April 2019.

_Application of hybrid rules to foreign branches_

1.  The way in which the OECD recommendations are written would in some circumstances deny a New Zealand company the ability to offset a loss from its foreign branch against its New Zealand income. This is an issue that some submitters have been very concerned about.
2.  We have made various modifications to the OECD recommendations to address this issue, including clarifying that taxpayers who have simple offshore branch structures do not present a hybrid mismatch problem and so are not covered by the rules.

_Imported mismatches_

1.  OECD recommendation 8 suggests countries include an “imported mismatch” rule when implementing hybrid and branch mismatch rules. Imported mismatch rules apply when the New Zealand resident is not directly involved in the hybrid mismatch, but the benefit of a mismatch is “imported”. Some submitters on the discussion document viewed this particular recommendation as over-reach, highly complex and impractical.
2.  To address these concerns, we recommend that the introduction of the imported mismatch rule be different for “structured” and “unstructured” arrangements. Structured arrangements are deliberately entered into to obtain a tax advantage, so should be implemented at the same time as the rest of the hybrid rules. By contrast, unstructured arrangements are ones where the New Zealand benefit is not the primary reason for entering into the arrangement. We recommend that the unstructured rule has a delayed implementation date of 1 January 2020. By this date, we expect that the EU countries, the UK, and Australia will all have hybrid rules. Delaying the implementation of the unstructured rule until those countries have similar rules will reduce the costs involved in complying with the rule in New Zealand because, by that time, multinationals that are also operating in those countries should already be complying with their equivalent rules, and also because payments to those countries will not be subject to the imported mismatch rule at all. More details regarding the imported mismatch rule are contained later in this paper.

_Over-taxation by reason of the imposition of NRWT_

1.  The OECD recommends that countries apply the hybrid rules without regard to any withholding tax collected on the relevant payments. In situations where New Zealand imposes non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on an interest payment that is also denied a deduction under the hybrid rules, there may be over-taxation.
2.  As far as our officials are aware, Australia is not planning on departing from the OECD approach. An argument for this approach is that in the majority of cases taxpayers can simply switch to simpler structures and arrangements and be subject to only single taxation. The OECD approach is also less complicated. Nevertheless, there has been an argument from some submitters that the hybrid rules should be modified in New Zealand so as to remove this potential over-taxation for taxpayers that choose to remain in hybrid structures.
3.  We recommend that in the case of a hybrid financial instrument, there needs to be further consideration of the possibility of letting taxpayers treat the payment as a dividend. This would allow them to eliminate NRWT by attaching imputation credits to the payment. We recommend that Cabinet delegate the authority to determine the appropriateness of such an approach to us to decide after receiving further advice. For hybrid arrangements other than financial instruments, we are less concerned about the imposition of NRWT. Although there may be some over-taxation, in many cases this will simply be a timing issue.

_Grandparenting for certain instruments issued by banks to the public_

1.  We recommend that there be an exception to the rules for certain hybrid instruments (“hybrid regulatory capital”) issued by banks and insurance companies either directly or indirectly to third party investors, in partial satisfaction of the capital requirements imposed on those companies by regulators (such as the Reserve Bank and its Australian equivalent, APRA). We recommend that such instruments issued before the date of the discussion document release (6 September 2016) should not be subject to the hybrid rules until the first date on which the issuer has an unconditional right to call or otherwise cancel the instruments without penalty.
2.  This grandparenting date is different to the date proposed in Australia, which is 8 May 2017 (the day before their Federal Budget). We consider differing from Australia is justified in this case. The Australian Government had made public the fact that it was considering how such instruments should be taxed, and did not make an announcement until its 2017 Budget. In New Zealand the hybrids discussion document released on 6 September stated that such instruments would be subject to the hybrid rules. To grandparent instruments issued after the New Zealand discussion document may be seen as encouraging taxpayers to enter into aggressive structures after the government has stated an intention to change the rules but before that change is enacted. We are wary of creating an expectation that such arrangements will be grandparented.

_Opaque election for foreign hybrid entities_

1.  The private sector has proposed that a New Zealand investor in a foreign hybrid entity be entitled to elect to treat the entity as tax opaque (like a company) in New Zealand to remove the hybridity and put that entity outside the scope of the rules. Our initial view is that excluding simple branch structures from the rules, and the ability of hybrid participants to restructure their arrangements, may make such an election redundant. Nevertheless, we have asked officials to continue their consideration of how such an election may work in practice, including whether the costs of administering it for what may be a relatively small group are justified. We recommend that Cabinet delegate to us the authority to decide on the appropriateness of an opaque election.

_Application of rules to branch mismatch arrangements_

1.  Consultation on branch mismatches has taken place but has not been as comprehensive as that for the remainder of the hybrid proposals. In part this is because such mismatches are less significant for New Zealand, and in part because the OECD draft report on branches was released at around the same time as the New Zealand discussion document, and the proposal was therefore less well developed. Nevertheless, we recommend that New Zealand implement rules that are consistent with the OECD recommendations on branch mismatches (this is also consistent with the approach that has been taken by the UK and which we understand will be taken by Australia). Branch mismatches arising from foreign branch losses are a double non-taxation risk and to leave them out of these proposals would expose the tax base to future risk. The remainder of the branch mismatch concerns addressed are very unlikely to arise in a New Zealand context. They will apply mostly to deny a deduction for a payment made by a New Zealand taxpayer to a foreign member of the same control group, if that payment is not taxed to the foreign member due to conflicts in branch tax rules between two countries other than New Zealand.

_De minimis rule_

1.  We recommend that there be no general de minimis for the hybrid rules. We believe that a de minimis may cause additional complexity given that other countries are not proposing a de minimis in their hybrid mismatch rules. This means that any de minimis would likely be ineffective in practice because the other country would still counter the hybrid mismatch using their secondary response right. Also, our proposals will ensure that simple branch structures (the most likely beneficiaries of a de minimis) are not within the scope of the rules.
2.  We do however recommend that there should be specific de minimis rules for reverse hybrid entities established in New Zealand (see paragraphs 55-57).

**OECD recommendations**

**_Hybrid financial instrument rules (Recommendations 1 and 2)_**

1.  The following diagram illustrates a typical hybrid financial instrument issued between related parties A Co and B Co.

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

1.  Double non-taxation arises in this situation because the payment on the hybrid financial instrument is deductible (as interest) in Country B but not taxable (because it is treated as an exempt dividend) in Country A.
2.  OECD recommendation 2 is a specific recommendation that countries should amend their domestic law so that dividend payments that are deductible to the payer (B Co) should be treated as ordinary income for the payee (A Co).
3.  New Zealand already has a rule that switches off the general exemption for dividends received by a New Zealand company from a foreign company, if the dividend is deductible to the payer. We recommend that this rule be expanded to also apply if the foreign payer receives tax benefits similar in nature to a deduction.
4.  We also recommend introducing rules in line with the general principles of OECD recommendation 1. This means that, in relation to hybrid financial instruments that are structured or between related parties, we should deny a New Zealand payer a deduction for the payment (when New Zealand is Country B) to the extent it is not taxed to a non-resident payee. It is in respect of this aspect of recommendation 1 that we are considering the election to treat interest payments as dividends. In addition, when New Zealand is Country A and Country B does not have hybrid rules, we should tax the New Zealand payee on the payment as ordinary income, with no entitlement to a tax credit.
5.  We also recommend that when there is a timing mismatch that allows a deduction to be claimed in one country in a period that is significantly earlier than the period in which income is included in the other country, the rules above should also apply.

**_Disregarded hybrid payments rule (Recommendation 3)_**

1.  A hybrid entity is an entity which is transparent for tax purposes in the country of an investor (Country A) but opaque for tax purposes in another country, generally where it is established (Country B). In the following diagram, B Co is the hybrid entity.

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

1.  The interest payment by B Co is deductible in the hybrid entity country (Country B) but disregarded in the investor country (Country A) because Country A sees B Co as being part of A Co and therefore not capable of making a payment to itself. However, as the interest payment by B Co is deductible in Country B, if B Co has no other income, the payment produces a tax loss, which can be grouped with the income of B Sub 1. The payment can therefore reduce taxable income in Country B without giving rise to any income in Country A, because of the different treatment of B Co in each country. This is a deductible/non-includible mismatch.
2.  We recommend introducing rules in line with the general principles of OECD recommendation 3 in order to prevent double non-taxation arising from a payment by a hybrid entity. We recommend that, when New Zealand is Country B and payments are deductible here but are disregarded for tax purposes in Country A (and the payments are part of a structured arrangement or made to a person in the same control group), we should deny a deduction for the payment. Similarly, if New Zealand is Country A and the non-resident payer in Country B has not been denied a deduction for the payment under similar rules, we should tax the receipt by the New Zealand payee as ordinary income.
3.  We recommend that deductions denied and income included by the above rules should be reversible to the extent that the hybrid entity has earned “dual inclusion income”, being income taxed in both Country A and Country B. This is because this dual inclusion income is included as income in both countries so the corresponding deduction should also be allowed in both countries. The dual inclusion income can be earned in the same period as the payment is made, in an earlier period, or in a later period.

**_Reverse hybrid rules (Recommendations 4 and 5)_**

1.  A reverse hybrid entity is an entity which is opaque for tax purposes in the country of an investor (Country A) but transparent for tax purposes in another country, generally where it is established (Country B). In the following diagram, B Co is the reverse hybrid.

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

1.  If B Co (the payee) is a reverse hybrid, double non-taxation arises because the interest payment is deductible to C Co (the payer) and not taxable to either B Co or A Co (the investor). Even on distribution by B Co to A Co it may not be taxable, if protected by an exemption for cross border intra-group dividends. The double non-taxation is due to a hybrid mismatch if the payment would have been taxable had it been made directly from C Co to A Co.
2.  We recommend introducing rules in line with the general principles of OECD recommendation 4 to prevent double non-taxation arising from a payment to a reverse hybrid. We recommend that, when New Zealand is Country C, the New Zealand payer be denied a deduction for a payment to a reverse hybrid if the payment would have been taxed if paid directly to the investor (A Co). This rule would only apply when the payer, payee and investor are all in a control group or the payment is part of a structured arrangement.
3.  OECD recommendation 5.1 is that countries should change their domestic law so that they tax residents on income not taxed in another country due to its being earned by a reverse hybrid. In other words, when New Zealand is Country A, we should tax A Co on the income of B Co if Country B does not tax it (because it treats B Co as transparent for tax purposes).
4.  We recommend that New Zealand should have rules that are in line with the general principles of recommendation 5.1 and other international tax principles. New Zealand already has controlled foreign companies (CFC) rules that in most cases would prevent a reverse hybrid entity mismatch outcome from occurring when a New Zealand resident is the investor (A Co). We recommend that Cabinet delegate authority to us to determine whether our current CFC rules should be enhanced to deal with any forms of reverse hybrid income not currently dealt with, in line with the general principles of recommendation 5.1.
5.  OECD recommendation 5.2 is that countries should change their domestic law so that they tax income which is earned by a reverse hybrid entity established in their country. So, when New Zealand is Country B, we recommend introducing rules in line with the general principles of this recommendation. As set out in the cover Cabinet paper and in paragraphs 24-25, this will require amendments to existing law regarding New Zealand limited partnerships and foreign trusts, which can be reverse hybrid entities depending on the tax treatment in the investor country.
6.  In regards to limited partnerships, we recommend taxing the partnership income of a non-resident partner if they are in a control group with the partnership and not taxed on their share of the partnership income because their jurisdiction views the income as earned by the partnership as a separate taxpayer from the partner. This rule will only apply if the limited partnership has total foreign-sourced income of greater than $10,000 or 20% of its total income. This de minimis rule, and the corresponding one for foreign trusts in the following paragraphs, is consistent with the recently-enacted de minimis rule for foreign sourced income of look-through companies.
7.  In regards to foreign trusts, we recommend taxing the foreign-source trustee income of the trust, provided that the non-resident settlor and trust are all in a control group. Many family trusts would meet this requirement. Foreign source trustee income will only be taxed if the non-resident settlor is not taxed on the trustee income in their residence country simply because the income is earned by the New Zealand trustee rather than the settlor directly. This rule will only apply if the trust has total foreign-sourced income of greater than $10,000 or 20% of its total income.
8.  We also recommend taxing the foreign-source beneficiary income of a non-resident beneficiary of a foreign trust if they are not taxed on the income in their residence country because that country views the income as earned by the trustee and not the beneficiary. This rule will only apply if the trust has total foreign-sourced income of greater than $10,000 or 20% of its total income, and the non-resident beneficiary is part of a control group with the trust/trustee. In relation to both beneficiary and trustee income, tax would only be imposed if there was no-one else in the same control group required to include that income in their taxable income.
9.  OECD recommendation 5.3 is that countries should consider improvements to record keeping and disclosure rules for tax transparent entities established in their country. Following the 2016 Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules, the disclosure rules for foreign trusts have been enhanced. New Zealand is regularly reviewed by the OECD to ensure that we are meeting international standards in this area. The Government will continue to work with the OECD and make improvements to disclosure rules as necessary to ensure compliance with best practice.
10.  We note that Australia has indicated that it is unlikely to implement any of recommendation 5 at this point – this is largely because they see their existing rules as adequate. However, they have reserved the right to do so in the future if integrity concerns arise. We are not as confident that our existing rules in relation to reverse hybrids are adequate to prevent mismatches from occurring. As set out above, we are concerned that leaving ‘gaps’ in our rules exposes our tax base to risks that can be mitigated by following all of the OECD’s recommendations.

**_Hybrid entities – double deductions (Recommendation 6)_**

1.  In addition to being capable of generating a deductible/non-inclusion hybrid mismatch, a hybrid entity can also be used to generate a double deduction mismatch. A diagram illustrating this possibility follows, where B Co is the hybrid entity.

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

1.  Because A Co treats B Co as fiscally transparent, in Country A the interest paid by B Co is deductible against A Co’s other income. In Country B the interest payment can offset income earned by B Sub 1, which is in a tax consolidated group with B Co. This is a double non-taxation outcome because a single payment has been deducted against different income in two countries.
2.  In Budget 2017 Cabinet agreed to restrict the ability of New Zealand businesses to use double deductions of foreign hybrid entities to reduce their tax liabilities in New Zealand \[CAB-17-MIN-0164\]. This means that, when New Zealand is Country A, the deductions in B Co would not flow back to New Zealand if it is possible for that deduction to also offset Country B income that does not flow back to A Co (in this case, the income of B Sub 1).
3.  Nothing in this paper is inconsistent with that specific decision. However, as mentioned in paragraph 26-27, we are recommending a slightly narrowed approach to the OECD recommendation 6, whereby simple structures involving a New Zealand company with only an offshore branch would not fall within the scope of the rules.
4.  We also recommend implementing a rule that would, when New Zealand is Country B, disallow the losses of a foreign-owned New Zealand hybrid entity or branch when the country of the owner (Country A) has not denied the loss.
5.  As with the recommendation 3 rule, denial of a deduction under the recommendation 6 rule should be reversed to the extent that the hybrid entity has dual inclusion income, whether in the current period, an earlier period, or a later period.

**_Dual resident entities (Recommendation 7)_**

1.  OECD recommendation 7 is that countries should deny a deduction to dual resident companies except to the extent of dual inclusion income. Expenditure incurred by a company that is a resident of two different countries can potentially be used in each country to offset non-dual inclusion income, which is income taxed only in that country. This would achieve the same double deduction outcomes that hybrid entities can produce under recommendation 6 (above).
2.  New Zealand tax law already prevents a dual resident company from grouping its losses or forming a tax consolidated group. However, it does not prevent them offsetting expenditure against non-dual inclusion income earned through a reverse hybrid, such as (potentially) a New Zealand limited liability partnership. We recommend that New Zealand amend its existing rules relating to losses incurred by dual resident companies, to ensure they are fully effective to prevent deductions being taken against non-dual inclusion income.

**_Imported mismatches (Recommendation 8)_**

1.  As set out in paragraphs 28-29, we recommend that New Zealand introduce rules in line with OECD recommendation 8 to deny a deduction for a payment that funds another payment under a hybrid mismatch, including a branch mismatch. This is referred to as an imported mismatch rule. An example follows.

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

1.  In this example, New Zealand is Country C. The loan between A Co and B Co generates a deduction in Country B, with no corresponding income inclusion in Country A. This is a double non-taxation outcome. However, this tax mismatch is not counteracted because neither Country A nor Country B has hybrid rules. The tax benefit of the A/B mismatch helps fund the seemingly benign arrangement between B Co and the New Zealand entity (Borrower Co).
2.  The imported mismatch rule would require New Zealand, as Country C, to deny a deduction for interest payments from Borrower Co to B Co to the extend they do not exceed the payments under the hybrid financial instrument between B Co and A Co. This is an integrity measure that prevents New Zealand’s other hybrid rules from being circumvented. Without this rule, businesses in Country A can simply avoid our proposed rules by going from A to C via B.
3.  We recommend that the imported mismatch rule applies to both structured arrangements that are designed to produce an imported mismatch outcome, and unstructured arrangements within a control group. However, because unstructured arrangements may not be deliberately contemplated, we are recommending a delayed implementation for those arrangements until more countries, the EU countries in particular, have hybrids rules in place.

**Agency consultation**

1.  The consultation on this project has been explained in the cover Cabinet paper. Briefly, there have been two rounds of consultation: one on the proposals in the discussion document; and a further round with selected submitters on branch mismatches and some of the detailed aspects set out in this paper.

**Financial implications**

1.  The proposed hybrid rule denying double deductions for foreign hybrid entities is estimated to increase tax revenue by $50 million per year from the 2019-20 year onwards. These amounts are already included in the forecasts as per Budget 2017 (CAB-17-MIN-0164).
2.  In addition, the proposed approach to grandparenting certain hybrid instruments as discussed at paragraphs 33-34 is expected to generate a total of $71 million over four years which is not currently included in the forecasts. This revenue is contingent on taxpayer behaviour after the implementation of the hybrid rules.
3.  The combined revenue impact of all proposals is estimated as:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $ million – increase / (decrease) |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

| Foreign hybrid entity double deductions (already included in forecast) | 0   | 0   | 25  | 50  | 50  | 50  | 50  |

**Human rights, administrative impacts, legislative implications, publicity**

1.  These are set out in the accompanying covering Cabinet paper for the overall BEPS package (_Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting_).

**Impact Analysis Requirements**

1.  Cabinet's Impact Analysis Requirements apply to these proposals and a Regulatory Impact Assessment is required. This has been prepared by Inland Revenue and is attached.
2.  The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Regulatory Impact Assessment and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria.

**Recommendations**

1.  We recommend that Cabinet:

1.  **Agree** that for payments under a financial instrument between related parties or that is a structured arrangement, and that results in a hybrid mismatch:
    1.  to deny a New Zealand payer a deduction for the payment to the extent it is not taxed to a non-resident payee (OECD recommendation 1 primary rule); and
    2.  if a non-resident payer has not been denied a deduction for the payment under similar rules, to tax a New Zealand payee on the payment as ordinary income, with no entitlement to a tax credit (OECD recommendation 1 defensive rule).
2.  **Agree** to expand New Zealand’s current rule which denies a dividend exemption to a deductible dividend paid by a foreign company to a New Zealand company so that it also applies if the foreign payer receives tax benefits similar in nature to a deduction (OECD recommendation 2).

1.  **Agree** that for payments made to a person in the same control group as the payee or pursuant to a structured transaction, where the payment is deductible to the payer but not recognised under the tax law in the payee country because the payment is disregarded under that law:
    1.  to deny a deduction for the payment if made by a New Zealand payer (OECD recommendation 3 primary rule);
    2.  if the payment is made by a non-resident, who is not denied a deduction under similar rules, to a New Zealand resident, to include the payment in ordinary income of the New Zealand resident (OECD recommendation 3 defensive rule);
    3.  to allow any such deduction or income inclusion to be reversed to the extent that the deduction to the payer is set off against income that is included as income in both relevant countries (“dual inclusion income”).

1.  **Agree** to deny a New Zealand payer a deduction in relation to payments made to a reverse hybrid entity in the same control group as the payer or pursuant to a structured transaction, where the payment is deductible to the payer but not included as income under the tax law in the reverse hybrid establishment country or in the country of the entity or person investing in the reverse hybrid entity (OECD recommendation 4).

1.  **Agree** that New Zealand should tax the income of a reverse hybrid established in New Zealand (such as a foreign trust or a limited partnership) to the extent that:
    1.  the reverse hybrid income is not subject to tax in another jurisdiction (OECD recommendation 5.2); and
    2.  the total foreign sourced income of the reverse hybrid exceeds the greater of $10,000 or 20% of the total income of the reverse hybrid.
2.  **Agree** to the following in relation to double deduction outcomes produced by branches and hybrid entity structures:
    1.  disallow the losses of a New Zealand-owned foreign hybrid entity or foreign branch if there is another entity in that foreign country whose income is capable of being offset against the losses of the hybrid entity or branch and that income is not taxable in New Zealand (modified OECD recommendation 6 primary);
    2.  disallow the losses of a foreign-owned New Zealand hybrid entity or branch if the owner of the branch is not denied the loss under recommendation 6 primary rule in another country (OECD recommendation 6 defensive); and
    3.  do not disallow losses (or reverse any previous disallowance) to the extent that the hybrid entity or branch earns dual inclusion income.
3.  **Agree** to deny a deduction claimed in New Zealand by a dual resident company except to the extent that the dual resident company earns dual inclusion income (OECD recommendation 7).

1.  **Agree** to deny a deduction in New Zealand for any payment that imports an offshore hybrid or branch mismatch arrangement into New Zealand, except to the extent that the payment is made to a country that has hybrid mismatch rules (OECD recommendation 8).
2.  **Note** that, consistent with the Budget 2017 Cabinet paper (CAB-17-MIN-0164 refers), the hybrid rules should generally apply from 1 July 2018.
3.  **Agree** that the effective date of the rule relating to unstructured imported mismatches (part of recommendation 8 above) should be delayed until 1 January 2020.
4.  **Agree** that the application of the rule relating to New Zealand reverse hybrids (recommendation 5 above) should be for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2019.
5.  **Agree** that there will be no general grandparenting of hybrid instruments or entities from the application of the hybrid mismatch rules, with the exception of hybrid financial instruments which are entitled to grandparented tax treatment until their next call date provided that they are:

*   1.  issued to satisfy the regulatory capital requirements imposed by New Zealand or Australian law;
    2.  directly to, or are traceable to, issues to the public; and
    3.  issued before the release of the Government’s _Addressing Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements_ discussion document on 6 September 2016.

1.  **Note** that the fiscal consequences of agreeing to recommendation 12 above is set out in the covering Cabinet paper for the overall BEPS package (_Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting_).

1.  **Agree** to the detailed design proposals set out in the appendix to this paper.
2.  **Agree** that the Ministers of Finance and Revenue be authorised to make decisions on further detail of these proposals, or to amend the detail in the appendix, provided any such decisions are not contradictory with the principles set out in recommendations 1 to 12, without further reference to Cabinet.
3.  **Agree** to delegate authority to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue to make final policy decisions on the following policy issues without further reference to Cabinet:
    1.  whether New Zealand’s controlled foreign company (CFC) rules should be modified to include as attributable foreign income all income of a reverse hybrid entity which would have been taxed to the New Zealand investor had it derived the income directly but which is not taxed by the country of the entity because the entity is treated as fiscally transparent in that country (OECD recommendation 5.1);
    2.  whether New Zealand can and should include a tightly targeted and simple optional regime whereby foreign hybrid entities can elect to be treated as opaque entities for New Zealand tax purposes; and
    3.  whether, the payer under a hybrid financial arrangement for which a deduction is denied, should be allowed to treat the payment as a dividend for purposes of both (but not only one of) the non-resident withholding tax and the imputation credit rules.
4.  **Agree** that the results of the decisions in recommendations 1-16 be included in a BEPS taxation bill to be introduced to Parliament before the end of 2017.

**Appendix**

**List of detailed design decisions**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|     | **OECD Recommendations 1 and 2** |
|     | A person who receives a payment which is deductible to the payer in another country will not be entitled to the benefit of any imputation credit attached to the payment. |
|     | When the hybrid rules apply to a hybrid financial instrument issued by a New Zealand taxpayer and denominated in a foreign currency, the deduction denied will take into account any foreign currency fluctuations on the instrument which would otherwise be taken into account for tax purposes, and any net income from the instrument including any foreign currency fluctuations will be non-taxable. |
|     | When the hybrid rules apply to a hybrid financial instrument held by a New Zealand taxpayer and denominated in a foreign currency, the taxpayer will not take into account any foreign currency fluctuations on the instrument, unless the instrument is an interest in a FIF which is subject to the comparative value method. |
|     | To the extent that a payment on a hybrid financial instrument can be proven to give rise to taxation of an investor in the payee entity under another country’s controlled foreign company (CFC) regime, the payer will be allowed a deduction for the payment. |
|     | If a person holds a FIF interest as part of a share repo arrangement, that person will be required to use the comparative value or attributed foreign income method to determine their income from the FIF interest. |
|     | If a person holds New Zealand shares as part of a share repo arrangement, where the borrower is a non-resident, the person is not entitled to the benefit of an imputation credit attached to any dividends on the shares. |
|     | OECD recommendation 1 will only apply to timing mismatches if:<br><br>*   the mismatch arises on an instrument with a term of 3 years or more or on an instrument that has been extended to beyond 3 years; and<br>*   the lender is not accounting for the payment, for tax purposes, on a reasonable accrual basis; and<br>*   it is not reasonable, having regard to the terms of the instrument and the payments made to date, to believe that the expenditure will be included in income in the payee’s accounting period beginning within 24 months of the end of the period in which the expenditure is incurred. |
|     | Amendments be made to the non-resident withholding tax rules so that in determining whether the rules require tax to be withheld on an accrual (rather than payments) basis, amounts for which a deduction is denied or deferred under OECD recommendation 1 are not taken into account unless and until they are deducted. |
|     | Interest that is permanently denied a deduction under recommendation 1 and the debt under which that interest paid is disregarded for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules. |
|     | There will be no exclusion for regulatory capital issued by banks and insurance companies except for some issues made before the release of the discussion document (6 September 2016). |
|     |     |
|     | **OECD Recommendation 3** |
|     | Any foreign currency fluctuations recognised for tax purposes in relation to a financial arrangement denominated in a foreign currency will be taken into account when denying a deduction to a New Zealand payer. |
|     | Dual inclusion income will be calculated in accordance with New Zealand tax principles on the income of the hybrid payer from activities that are taxed in New Zealand, except that it will not include income which is protected from New Zealand tax by a foreign tax credit. |
|     | For the purposes of denying a deduction for a New Zealand payer, full taxation of income under a CFC regime will prevent income being treated as not taxable to a payee and will qualify income as dual inclusion income where it is not otherwise taxed to the payee and is not sheltered from tax by a foreign tax credit. |
|     | When an amount of deemed hybrid income is reversed in a later year because it is offset against dual inclusion income, that will be taken into account in determining the limit on the amount of foreign tax credit for which a New Zealand taxpayer applying the defensive rule is eligible. |
|     | The ability to claim a deduction in relation to a later year due to future dual inclusion income will be lost if there is a more than 51% change in a company’s ownership since the time the relevant deduction was incurred or deemed expenditure arose. |
|     | Amendments be made to the non-resident withholding tax rules so that in determining whether the rules require tax to be withheld on an accrual (rather than payments) basis, amounts for which a deduction is deferred under OECD recommendation 3 are not taken into account unless and until they are deducted. |
|     | Denial of a deduction for interest under recommendation 3 will not affect the amount of recognised interest or amount of debt for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules. |
|     | A deduction would be denied where a branch is treated in the branch country as making a deductible payment to its head office which is not a simple allocation of third party costs. |
|     | Where a New Zealand taxpayer has recognized income as a result of receiving a disregarded payment from a foreign hybrid entity, that income will be reversed in a later year when there is dual inclusion income earned through the hybrid entity. |
|     |     |
|     | **OECD Recommendation 4** |
|     | Diverted branch payments and payments made to a disregarded branch are included within the scope of recommendation 4. |
|     | Recommendation 4 deduction denial in respect of a payment under a foreign currency loan includes foreign currency gains or losses. |
|     | To the extent a payment to a reverse hybrid can be proven to be taxed under the CFC regime of an investor country, a deduction will be allowed. |
|     | Non-resident withholding tax will continue to be applied to payments, despite the denial of the deduction |
|     | Interest that is denied a deduction under recommendation 4 and the debt under which that interest paid is disregarded for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules. |
|     |     |
|     | **OECD Recommendation 5.2** |
|     | Tax the partnership income of a non-resident partner of a New Zealand limited partnership if the non-resident partner is in a control group with the partnership and the non-resident partner is not taxed on their share of the income of the partnership because their jurisdiction views the income as earned by the partnership and not by the partner. |
|     | Tax a New Zealand resident trustee on foreign-sourced beneficiary income allocated to a non-resident beneficiary as if the trustee were a New Zealand resident individual taxpayer to the extent that:<br><br>*   the beneficiary is in the same control group as the trustee; and<br>*   the beneficiary would be taxed on income from the assets giving rise to the beneficiary income if it held the assets directly; and<br>*   the income is not subject to tax as the income of any person other than the trustee (such as the beneficiary or settlor). |
|     | Tax a New Zealand trustee of a foreign trust on foreign-sourced trustee income to the extent that:<br><br>*   the settlor is in the same control group as the trustee;<br>*   the settlor would be taxed on the trustee income if it held the trust assets directly; and<br>*   the income is not subject to tax as the income of any person other than the trustee. |
|     | Include a de minimis so that none of the above recommendation 5.2 rules apply if the total foreign sourced income of the trustee does not exceed the greater of $10,000 and 20% of the total income of the trust. |
|     |     |
|     | **OECD Recommendation 6** |
|     | There will be a transitional rule such that a New Zealand-owned foreign hybrid entity or foreign branch’s accumulated loss is recaptured where that entity or branch’s control group acquires an interest in an entity in the foreign country except in cases where the accumulated loss cannot be offset against current and future income of the newly acquired entity. |
|     | A deduction will be allowed in New Zealand for losses of New Zealand-owned foreign hybrid entities or foreign branches if those losses cannot ever be used in the foreign country |
|     | Income which can be shown to be taxable in the foreign country and in New Zealand under New Zealand’s CFC rules can be regarded as dual inclusion income except to the extent that the income is sheltered by a foreign tax credit. |
|     | Double deduction amounts and dual inclusion income amounts for a foreign hybrid entity or branch will be calculated in accordance with New Zealand tax principles on the income of the foreign hybrid entity/branch/ from activities that are taxed in New Zealand, except that income which is protected from New Zealand tax by a foreign tax credit will not be regarded as dual inclusion income. |
|     | The ability to claim a deduction in relation in a later year due to future dual inclusion income will be lost if there is a more than 51% change in a company’s ownership since the time the relevant deduction was incurred or deemed expenditure arose. |
|     | Amendments will be made to the non-resident withholding tax rules so that in determining whether the rules require tax to be withheld on an accrual (rather than payments) basis, amounts for which a deduction is deferred under OECD recommendations 6 are not taken into account unless and until they are deducted. |
|     | Denial of a deduction for interest under recommendations 6 will not affect the amount of recognised interest or amount of debt for the purposes of thin capitalisation rules. |
|     |     |
|     | **OECD Recommendation 7** |
|     | Amend existing consolidation and loss grouping rules for dual resident company losses to ensure that those losses cannot be offset against income earned by a New Zealand reverse hybrid. |
|     | Double deduction amounts and dual inclusion income amounts will be calculated in accordance with New Zealand tax principles on the income of the dual resident company from activities that are taxed in New Zealand, except that income which is protected from New Zealand tax by a foreign tax credit will not be regarded as dual inclusion income. |
|     | The ability to claim a deduction in relation in a later year due to future dual inclusion income will be lost if there is a more than 51% change in a company’s ownership since the time the relevant deduction was incurred. |
|     | Denial of a deduction for interest will not affect the amount of recognised interest or amount of debt for the purposes of thin capitalisation rules. |
|     |     |
|     | **OECD Recommendation 8** |
|     | When recommendation 8 applies to a payment that imports an offshore hybrid or branch mismatch arrangement into New Zealand, the deduction denied will ignore any foreign currency fluctuations on the instrument. |
|     | Interest that is denied a deduction under recommendation 8 and the debt under which that interest paid is disregarded for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules |
|     |     |
|     | **General design and definitional matters** |
|     | A coordination rule will be included in the hybrid rules to ensure that the hybrid mismatch rules of other countries mesh well with New Zealand’s rules. |
|     | A specific anti-avoidance rule will be included in the hybrid rules to allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to counteract arrangements that have the purpose or effect of defeating the intent or application of the hybrid rules. |

1.  As set out in paragraph 59, Australia has indicated that it is unlikely to implement OECD recommendation 5 at this stage, but may do so in the future if integrity concerns arise. [↑](#footnote-ref-1)
In confidence Office of the Minister of Finance Office of the Minister of Revenue Ca binet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee BEPS – addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements Proposal 1.This paper seeks Cabinet approval to introduce new tax rules to address the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements. This paper is part of a comprehensive package of measures to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). Executive summary 2.Hybrid mismatch arrangements are, broadly speaking, cross-border arrangements that exploit differences in the tax treatment of an entity or instrument under the laws of two or more countries. The result of hybrid mismatch arrangements is less aggregate tax revenue collected in the jurisdictions to which the arrangement relates. 3.The OECD, as part of its base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) Action Plan, published in late 2015 its final report on hybrid mismatch arrangements. This report recommended that countries enact a comprehensive set of rules to neutralise the benefit of hybrid mismatch arrangements affecting their tax base. 4.The UK has legislated the OECD recommendations into their domestic law and Australia is committed to do the same. The EU has also issued a directive requiring its 28 member states (including the UK) to introduce anti-hybrid rules. We are not aware of any other countries intending to adopt a comprehensive set of rules, although many countries have more targeted anti-hybrid rules. 5.Th e OECD recommendations will not apply to the vast majority of taxpayers. They will not apply to purely domestic firms. They apply mainly to related parties of multinational groups and planned arrangements. The expected outcome of the OECD recommendations is that the tax benefit of hybrid mismatch arrangements is eliminated, in most cases influencing taxpayers to switch to more straightforward cross-border financing instruments and structures. 6.Th e Government released a discussion document in September 2016 called Addressing Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements which proposed that the OECD recommendations be adopted in New Zealand and asked for feedback on how that should best be done. Since receiving submissions to this document, officials have engaged stakeholders in targeted consultation on specific design issues relating to the proposal. Consultation has resulted in some of the proposals being modified, such as a proposed exclusion from the rules for New Zealand businesses that operate offshore only through a simple branch structure. Nevertheless, many taxpayers affected by these proposals will still oppose them. Some would prefer to see a targeted approach, which would only tackle hybrids that have already been observed in New Zealand. BEPS documents release - August 2017: #19 2 7. However, in order to send the clear message that using hybrid mismatch arrangements should not produce a tax advantage, we are recommending that Cabinet agree to a comprehensive adoption of the OECD recommendations on hybrid mismatch arrangements with suitable modifications for the New Zealand context. To do otherwise may simply encourage the ongoing use of hybrids not covered by any targeted proposal. Other issues raised through the consultation process, and which are likely to attract the most comment (such as the application of the rules to foreign trusts) are set out in paragraphs 24-38 of this paper. 8. We are further recommending that hybrids rules be included in a BEPS taxation bill to be introduced to Parliament before the end of 2017. Background BEPS 9. New Zealand’s BEPS work programme has largely been driven by a wider momentum that has developed since 2012, when the OECD/G20 began work on their BEPS Action Plan,. Its final package of reports was released in October 2015. The Action Plan is a multifaceted approach intending to encourage countries to close many (but not all) of the avenues multinational companies currently use to reduce their worldwide tax liability, and to improve the information available to governments when they deal with multinational companies, without changing the fundamental principles for the taxation of international trade and investment. 10. As a member of the OECD Council, New Zealand approved the 2015 BEPS final package and has supported the BEPS Action Plan since the OECD’s first declaration on BEPS in 2013. Hybrid mismatch arrangements 11. Hybrid mismatch arrangements are a significant base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) strategy used by some multinational companies to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world on some or all of their income. They are, broadly speaking, cross-border arrangements that exploit differences in the tax treatment of an entity or instrument under the laws of two or more countries to achieve double non-taxation. 12. One way in which this double non-taxation can arise is through a payment being deductible for a payer in one country but not included as taxable income for the payee in the other country. Another way double non-taxation can arise is by way of a single payment being deducted against different income streams in two countries. 13. Double non-taxation of this kind is difficult to deal with, because it can be achieved even though both countries’ tax rules are being complied with. However, it clearly reduces fairness, causes harmful distortions in investment patterns, and results in an unintended reduction in aggregate tax revenues. It is often difficult to determine which of the countries involved has lost tax revenue through the use of a hybrid mismatch arrangement, but there is undoubtedly a reduction of worldwide tax paid. 3 The OECD’s response 14. The OECD has made a number of recommendations as to how countries can improve their domest ic rules to prevent mismatches arising and neutralise their effect when they do arise. These recommendations relate to Action 2 of the OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan: Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements. 15. The OECD recommends two kinds of rules. The first are rules specifically designed to reduce the likelihood of hybrid mismatches arising. The second are “linking rules”, which apply to payments that give rise to a deduction in more than one country, or which give rise to a deduction in one country but are not taxed as income in another country due to a hybrid mismatch. These generally only apply to: • arrangements between related parties (25% or more commonly owned) or control groups (50% or more commonly owned); or • structured arrangements - generally, arrangements between non-associated parties which intentionally exploit such mismatches. 16. These linking rules are divided into “primary” and “secondary” responses. Primary responses have precedence, with secondary responses being used if the country that has the primary right does not have hybrid rules. This primary/secondary structure is important for ensuring that all hybrids with a connection to New Zealand are effectively countered irrespective of where the counterparty is based. 17. The OECD has also developed an addit io nal BEPS Act ion 2 report that makes a number of recommendations as to how countries can deal with the problem of branch mismatch arrangements which is closely related to the hybrid mismatches issue. Other countries 18. The UK has introduced into its domestic law rules that reflect a broad adoption of the OECD recommendations. Australia has proposed to do the same and, as part of its 2017 Budget, committed to introduce rules that are effective by 1 January 2018 or six months following Royal assent. 1 The EU has issued a directive requiring its 28 member states (including the UK) to introduce anti-hybrid rules by 1 January 2020. We are not aware of any other countries intending to adopt a comprehensive set of rules, although many countries have more targeted anti-hybrid rules. Hybrids discussion document 19. On 6 September 2016, the Government released a discussion document ent it led “Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements” seeking feedback on proposals to address hybrid mismatch arrangements in line with the OECD recommendations \[CAB-16-MIN-0442\]. 20. 20 submissions were received on the discussion document. Most submitters accepted the need for some hybrid rules, with some submitters expressing support for New Zealand to take action in line with the OECD hybrids package, subject to various provisos, including that it was done in a co-ordinated fashion with other jurisdictions and/or that there should be concessions for hybrid regulatory capital. The majorit y of submissio ns argued that we should only implement rules to counter hybrid mismatches actually observed in New Zealand, rather than the full suite of OECD recommendations. 1 As set out in paragraph 59, Australia has indicated that it is unlikely to implement OECD recommendation 5 at this stage, but may do so in the future if integrity concerns arise. 4 Comment Implementing the full OECD hybrids package 21. As set out in the cover Cabinet paper (Tax measures to counter base erosion and profit shifting), we are recommending that Cabinet agree to a comprehensive implementation of the OECD’s proposed solutions to the hybrid and branch mismatch problem, , even though there was limited evidence of some of the structures being used in New Zealand. We are of the view that the OECD proposals are in New Zealand’s best interests, as enacting these recommendations will improve fairness, reduce harmful distortions in investment patterns, increase tax revenue, and will also address the risk of taxpayers using new hybrid mismatch opportunities if only the more common techniques are addressed initially. 22. In making this recommendation, we recognise that these proposals involve considerable complexity, which will not generally be welcomed by those taxpayers affected. However, we are comfortable that there are a number of factors that outweigh these concerns: • We are proposing to modify the OECD recommendations when it is appropriate to do so for the New Zealand context. Examples are ensuring New Zealand companies with simple foreign branch structures are not caught by the rules (see “application of hybrids rules to foreign branches” below), not applying the rules to purely domestic firms, and not introducing rules when an adequate New Zealand provision already exists. • We are recommending that officials continue to consult on a few particular issues that have the potential to ease the compliance costs of the proposals before we make a final decision on them under Cabinet delegated authority. These consist of elective options which would in effect allow existing hybrids to be treated as simple equity investments. • Despite the necessary complexity, the underlying principle is clear – using hybrid mismatches as a tax-efficient means of inbound, outbound or conduit investment is not appropriate. • We are recommending that relevant parties be consulted on exposure drafts of key aspects of the legislation. This is intended to facilitate workable legislation that is understandable to those applying it. • In almost all cases, the complexity will be optional. Taxpayers can avoid having to deal with these rules by undertaking simple debt or equity funding. 23. Some o f the other more significant issues relating to this proposal are set out below. Those are followed by a brief explanation of each of the OECD recommendations and the principles behind them. The appendix contains a series of detailed aspects of the proposals that we are also seeking Cabinet’s agreement to. These details have been consulted on wit h interested parties, and are consistent with the general recommendations set out below. 5 Significant issues Foreign trusts 24. As set out in the cover Cabinet paper, we are recommending that foreign trusts be included within the scope of these rules in circumstances where their treatment outside of New Zealand means income of the trust is not included in a tax calculation anywhere in the world. This is not because they are foreign trusts, but because in those circumstances they are “reverse hybrids” according to the OECD recommendations (see the discussion on OECD Recommendation 5.2, below). The same rule would equally impose tax on New Zealand limited partnerships that fit within the reverse hybrids definition. 25. We are aware that foreign trusts have recently had a new set of disclosure rules apply to them following the 2016 Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules. In this respect, adding another regulatory regime to the industry now is unfortunate timing. To reflect the fact that these trusts have recently undergone significant compliance costs, and to give the foreign trust and limited partnership industries more time to understand the implications of the proposed rules, we are recommending a delayed effective date for New Zealand reverse hybrids of 1 April 2019. Application of hybrid rules to foreign branches 26. The way in which the OECD recommendations are written would in some circumstances deny a New Zealand company the ability to offset a loss from its foreig n branch against its New Zealand income. This is an issue that some submitters have been very concerned about. 27. We have made various modifications to the OECD recommendations to address this issue, including clarifying that taxpayers who have simple offshore branch structures do not present a hybrid mismatch problem and so are not covered by the rules. Imported mismatches 28. OECD recommendation 8 suggests countries include an “imported mismatch” rule when implementing hybrid and branch mismatch rules. Imported mismatch rules apply when the New Zealand resident is not directly involved in the hybrid mismatch, but the benefit of a mismatch is “imported”. Some submitters on the discussion document viewed this particular recommendation as over-reach, highly complex and impractical. 29. To address these concerns, we recommend that the introduction of the imported mismatch rule be different for “structured” and “unstructured” arrangements. Structured arrangements are deliberately entered into to obtain a tax advantage, so should be implemented at the same time as the rest of the hybrid rules. By contrast, unstructured arrangements are ones where the New Zealand benefit is not the primary reason for entering into the arrangement. We recommend that the unstructured rule has a delayed implementation date of 1 January 2020. By this date, we expect that the EU countries, the UK, and Australia will all have hybrid rules. Delaying the implementation of the unstructured rule until those countries have similar rules will reduce the costs involved in complying with the rule in New Zealand because, by that time, multinationals that are also operating in those countries should already be complying with their equivalent rules, and also because payments 6 to those countries will not be subject to the imported mismatch rule at all. More details regarding the imported mismatch rule are contained later in this paper. Over-taxation by reason of the imposition of NRWT 30. The OECD recommends that countries apply the hybrid rules without regard to any withholding tax collected on the relevant payments. In situations where New Zealand imposes non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on an interest payment that is also denied a deduction under the hybrid rules, there may be over-taxation. 31. As far as our officials are aware, Australia is not planning on departing from the OECD approach. An argument for this approach is that in the majority of cases taxpayers can simply switch to simpler structures and arrangements and be subject to only single taxation. The OECD approach is also less complicated. Nevertheless, there has been an argument from some submitters that the hybrid rules should be modified in New Zealand so as to remove this potential over-taxation for taxpayers that choose to remain in hybrid structures. 32. We recommend that in the case of a hybrid financial instrument, there needs to be further consideration of the possibility of letting taxpayers treat the payment as a dividend. This would allow them to eliminate NRWT by attaching imputation credits to the payment. We recommend that Cabinet delegate the authority to determine the appropriateness of such an approach to us to decide after receiving further advice. For hybrid arrangements other than financial instruments, we are less concerned about the imposition of NRWT. Although there may be some over-taxation, in many cases this will simply be a timing issue. Grandparenting for certain instruments issued by banks to the public 33. We recommend that there be an exception to the rules for certain hybrid instruments (“hybrid regulatory capital”) issued by banks and insurance companies eit her directly or indirectly to third party investors, in partial satisfaction of the capital requirements imposed on those companies by regulators (such as the Reserve Bank and its Australian equivalent, APRA). We recommend that such instruments issued before the date of the discussion document release (6 September 2016) should not be subject to the hybrid rules until the first date on which the issuer has an unconditional right to call or otherwise cancel the instruments without penalt y. 34. This grandparenting date is different to the date proposed in Australia, which is 8 May 2017 (the day before their Federal Budget). We consider differing from Australia is justified in this case. The Australian Government had made public the fact that it was considering how such instruments should be taxed, and did not make an announcement until its 2017 Budget. In New Zealand the hybrids discussion document released on 6 September stated that such instruments would be subject to the hybrid rules. To grandparent instruments issued after the New Zealand discussion document may be seen as encouraging taxpayers to enter into aggressive structures after the government has stated an intention to change the rules but before that change is enacted. We are wary of creating an expectation that such arrangements will be grandparented. Opaque election for foreign hybrid entities 35. The private sector has proposed that a New Zealand investor in a foreign hybrid entity be entitled to elect to treat the entity as tax opaque (like a company) in New Zealand to remove the hybridity and put that entit y outside the scope of the rules. Our initial view is that 7 excluding simple branch structures from the rules, and the ability of hybrid participants to restructure their arrangements, may make such an election redundant. Nevertheless, we have asked officials to continue their consideration of how such an election may work in practice, including whether the costs of administering it for what may be a relatively small group are justified. We recommend that Cabinet delegate to us the authorit y to decide on the appropriateness of an opaque election. Application of rules to branch mismatch arrangements 36. Consultation on branch mismatches has taken place but has not been as comprehensive as that for the remainder of the hybrid proposals. In part this is because such mismatches are less significant for New Zealand, and in part because the OECD draft report on branches was released at around the same time as the New Zealand discussion document, and the proposal was therefore less well developed. Nevertheless, we recommend that New Zealand implement rules that are consistent with the OECD recommendations on branch mismatches (this is also consistent with the approach that has been taken by the UK and which we understand will be taken by Australia). Branch mismatches arising from foreign branch losses are a double non-taxation risk and to leave them out of these proposals would expose the tax base to future risk. The remainder of the branch mismatch concerns addressed are very unlikely to arise in a New Zealand context. They will apply mostly to deny a deduction for a payment made by a New Zealand taxpayer to a foreign member of the same control group, if that payment is not taxed to the foreign member due to conflicts in branch tax rules between two countries other than New Zealand. De minimis rule 37. We recommend that there be no general de minimis for the hybrid rules. We believe that a de minimis may cause additional complexity given that other countries are not proposing a de minimis in their hybrid mismatch rules. This means that any de minimis would likely be ineffective in practice because the other country would still counter the hybrid mismatch using their secondary response right. Also, our proposals will ensure that simple branch structures (the most likely beneficiaries of a de minimis) are not within the scope of the rules. 38. We do however recommend that there should be specific de minimis rules for reverse hybrid entities established in New Zealand (see paragraphs 55-57). OECD recommendations Hybrid financial instrument rules (Recommendations 1 and 2) 39. The following diagram illustrates a typical hybrid financial instrument issued between related parties A Co and B Co. A Co. B Co. + - H yb rid Financial Instrument Deductible Country B Country A N on-assess able 8 40. Double non-taxation arises in this situation because the payment on the hybrid financial instrument is deductible (as interest) in Country B but not taxable (because it is treated as an exempt dividend) in Country A. 41. OECD recommendation 2 is a specific recommendation that countries should amend their domestic law so that dividend payments that are deductible to the payer (B Co) should be treated as ordinary income for the payee (A Co). 42. New Zealand already has a rule that switches off the general exemption for dividends received by a New Zealand company from a foreign company, if the dividend is deductible to the payer. We recommend that this rule be expanded to also apply if the foreign payer receives tax benefits similar in nature to a deduction. 43. We also recommend introducing rules in line with the general principles of OECD recommendation 1. This means that, in relation to hybrid financial instruments that are structured or between related parties, we should deny a New Zealand payer a deduction for the payment (when New Zealand is Country B) to the extent it is not taxed to a non-resident payee. It is in respect of this aspect of recommendation 1 that we are considering the election to treat interest payments as dividends. In addit io n, when New Zealand is Country A and Country B does not have hybrid rules, we should tax the New Zealand payee on the payment as ordinary income, with no entitlement to a tax credit. 44. We also recommend that when there is a timing mismatch that allows a deduction to be claimed in one country in a period that is significantly earlier than the period in which income is included in the other country, the rules above should also apply. Disregarded hybrid payments rule (Recommendation 3) 45. A hybrid entity is an entity which is transparent for tax purposes in the country of an investor (Country A) but opaque for tax purposes in another country, generally where it is established (Country B). In the following diagram, B Co is the hybrid entity. A Co. + - InterestLoan Country B Country A B Sub 1 B Co. 46. The interest payment by B Co is deductible in the hybrid entity country (Country B) but disregarded in the investor country (Country A) because Country A sees B Co as being part of A Co and therefore not capable of making a payment to itself. However, as the interest payment by B Co is deductible in Country B, if B Co has no other income, the payment produces a tax loss, which can be grouped with the income of B Sub 1. The payment can 9 therefore reduce taxable income in Country B without giving rise to any income in Country A, because of the different treatment of B Co in each country. This is a deductible/non- includible mismatch. 47. We recommend introducing rules in line with the general principles of OECD recommendation 3 in order to prevent double non-taxation arising from a payment by a hybrid entity. We recommend that, when New Zealand is Country B and payments are deductible here but are disregarded for tax purposes in Country A (and the payments are part of a structured arrangement or made to a person in the same control group), we should deny a deduction for the payment. Similarly, if New Zealand is Country A and the non-resident payer in Country B has not been denied a deduction for the payment under similar rules, we should tax the receipt by the New Zealand payee as ordinary income. 48. We recommend that deductions denied and income included by the above rules should be reversible to the extent that the hybrid entity has earned “dual inclusion income”, being income taxed in both Country A and Country B. This is because this dual inclusion income is included as inco me in both countries so the corresponding deduction should also be allowed in both countries. The dual inclusion income can be earned in the same period as the payment is made, in an earlier period, or in a later period. Reverse hybrid rules (Recommendations 4 and 5) 49. A reverse hybrid entity is an entity which is opaque for tax purposes in the country of an investor (Country A) but transparent for tax purposes in another country, generally where it is established (Country B). In the following diagram, B Co is the reverse hybrid. A Co. - Interest Loan Country B Country A B Co. C Co. Country C + 50. If B Co (the payee) is a reverse hybrid, double non-taxation arises because the interest payment is deductible to C Co (the payer) and not taxable to either B Co or A Co (the investor). Even on distribution by B Co to A Co it may not be taxable, if protected by an exemption for cross border intra-group dividends. The double non-taxation is due to a hybrid mismatch if the payment would have been taxable had it been made directly from C Co to A Co. 51. We recommend introducing rules in line with the general principles of OECD recommendation 4 to prevent double non-taxation arising from a payment to a reverse hybrid. We recommend that, when New Zealand is Country C, the New Zealand payer be denied a deduction for a payment to a reverse hybrid if the payment would have been taxed if paid directly to the investor (A Co). This rule would only apply when the payer, payee and investor are all in a control group or the payment is part of a structured arrangement. 10 52. OECD recommendation 5.1 is that countries should change their domestic law so that they tax residents on income not taxed in another country due to its being earned by a reverse hybrid. In other words, when New Zealand is Country A, we should tax A Co on the income of B Co if Country B does not tax it (because it treats B Co as transparent for tax purposes). 53. We recommend that New Zealand should have rules that are in line with the general principles of recommendation 5.1 and other international tax principles. New Zealand already has controlled foreign companies (CFC) rules that in most cases would prevent a reverse hybrid entity mismatch outcome from occurring when a New Zealand resident is the investor (A Co). We recommend that Cabinet delegate authority to us to determine whether our current CFC rules should be enhanced to deal with any forms of reverse hybrid income not currently dealt with, in line with the general principles of recommendation 5.1. 54. OECD recommendation 5.2 is that countries should change their domestic law so that they tax income which is earned by a reverse hybrid entity established in their country. So, when New Zealand is Country B, we recommend introducing rules in line with the general principles of this recommendation. As set out in the cover Cabinet paper and in paragraphs 24-25, this will require amendments to existing law regarding New Zealand limited partnerships and foreign trusts, which can be reverse hybrid entities depending on the tax treatment in the investor country. 55. In regards to limited partnerships, we recommend taxing the partnership income of a non-resident partner if they are in a control group with the partnership and not taxed on their share of the partnership income because their jurisdiction views the income as earned by the partnership as a separate taxpayer from the partner. This rule will only apply if the limited partnership has total foreign-sourced income of greater than $10,000 or 20% of its total income. This de minimis rule, and the corresponding one for foreign trusts in the following paragraphs, is consistent with the recently-enacted de minimis rule for foreign sourced income of look-through companies. 56. In regards to foreign trusts, we recommend taxing the foreign-source trustee income of the trust, provided that the non-resident settlor and trust are all in a control group. Many family trusts would meet this requirement. Foreign source trustee income will only be taxed if the non-resident settlor is not taxed on the trustee income in their residence country simply because the income is earned by the New Zealand trustee rather than the settlor directly. This rule will only apply if the trust has total foreign-sourced income of greater than $10,000 or 20% of its total income. 57. We also recommend taxing the foreign-source beneficiary income of a non-resident beneficiary of a foreign trust if they are not taxed on the income in their residence country because that country views the income as earned by the trustee and not the beneficiary. This rule will only apply if the trust has total foreign-sourced income of greater than $10,000 or 20% of its total income, and the non-resident beneficiary is part of a control group with the trust/trustee. In relation to both beneficiary and trustee income, tax would only be imposed if there was no-one else in the same control group required to include that income in their taxable income. 58. OECD recommendation 5.3 is that countries should consider improvements to record keeping and disclosure rules for tax transparent entities established in their country. Following the 2016 Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules, the disclosure rules for foreign trusts have been enhanced. New Zealand is regularly reviewed by the OECD to ensure that we are meeting international standards in this area. The Government will 11 continue to work with the OECD and make improvements to disclosure rules as necessary to ensure compliance with best practice. 59. We note that Australia has indicated that it is unlikely to implement any of recommendation 5 at this point – this is largely because they see their existing rules as adequate. However, they have reserved the right to do so in the future if integrity concerns arise. We are not as confident that our existing rules in relation to reverse hybrids are adequate to prevent mismatches from occurring. As set out above, we are concerned that leaving ‘gaps’ in our rules exposes our tax base to risks that can be mitigated by following all of the OECD’s recommendations. Hybrid entities – double deductions (Recommendation 6) 60. In addition to being capable of generating a deductible/non-inclusion hybrid mismatch, a hybrid entity can also be used to generate a double deduction mismatch. A diagram illustrating this possibility follows, where B Co is the hybrid entity. A Co. +- Interest Loan Country B Country A B Sub 1 B Co. Bank 61. Because A Co treats B Co as fiscally transparent, in Country A the interest paid by B Co is deductible against A Co’s other income. In Country B the interest payment can offset income earned by B Sub 1, which is in a tax consolidated group with B Co. This is a double non-taxation outcome because a single payment has been deducted against different income in two countries. 62. In Budget 2017 Cabinet agreed to restrict the ability of New Zealand businesses to use double deductions of foreign hybrid entities to reduce their tax liabilities in New Zealand \[CAB-17-MIN-0164\]. This means that, when New Zealand is Country A, the deductions in B Co would not flow back to New Zealand if it is possible for that deduction to also offset Country B income that does not flow back to A Co (in this case, the income of B Sub 1). 63. Nothing in this paper is inconsistent with that specific decision. However, as mentioned in paragraph 26-27, we are recommending a slightly narrowed approach to the OECD recommendation 6, whereby simple structures involving a New Zealand company with only an offshore branch would not fall within the scope of the rules. 64. We also recommend implementing a rule that would, when New Zealand is Country B, disallow the lo sses o f a foreign-owned New Zealand hybrid entity or branch when the country of the owner (Country A) has not denied the loss. 12 65. As with the recommendation 3 rule, denial of a deduction under the recommendation 6 rule should be reversed to the extent that the hybrid entity has dual inclusion income, whether in the current period, an earlier period, or a later period. Dual resident entities (Recommendation 7) 66. OECD recommendation 7 is that countries should deny a deduction to dual resident companies except to the extent of dual inclusion income. Expenditure incurred by a co mpany that is a resident of two different countries can potentially be used in each country to offset non-dual inclusion income, which is income taxed only in that country. This would achieve the same double deduction outcomes that hybrid ent it ies can produce under recommendation 6 (above). 67. New Zealand tax law already prevents a dual resident company from grouping its losses or forming a tax consolidated group. However, it does not prevent them offsetting expenditure against non-dual inclusion income earned through a reverse hybrid, such as (potentially) a New Zealand limited liability partnership. We recommend that New Zealand amend its existing rules relating to losses incurred by dual resident companies, to ensure they are fully effective to prevent deductions being taken against non-dual inclusion income. Imported mismatches (Recommendation 8) 68. As set out in paragraphs 28-29, we recommend that New Zealand introduce rules in line with OECD recommendation 8 to deny a deduction for a payment that funds another payment under a hybrid mismatch, including a branch mismatch. This is referred to as an imported mismatch rule. An example follows. Loan A Co. + - H yb rid Financial Instrument Country B Country A Borrower Co. B Co. Country C - + 69. In this example, New Zealand is Country C. The loan between A Co and B Co generates a deduction in Country B, with no corresponding income inclusion in Country A. This is a double non-taxation outcome. However, this tax mismatch is not counteracted because neither Country A nor Country B has hybrid rules. The tax benefit of the A/B mismatch helps fund the seemingly benign arrangement between B Co and the New Zealand entity (Borrower Co). 70. The imported mismatch rule would require New Zealand, as Country C, to deny a deduction for interest payments from Borrower Co to B Co to the extend they do not exceed the payments under the hybrid financial instrument between B Co and A Co. This is an integrity measure that prevents New Zealand’s other hybrid rules from being circumvented. 13 Without this rule, businesses in Country A can simply avoid our proposed rules by going from A to C via B. 71. We recommend that the imported mismatch rule applies to both structured arrangements that are designed to produce an imported mismatch outcome, and unstructured arrangements within a control group. However, because unstructured arrangements may not be deliberately contemplated, we are recommending a delayed implementation for those arrangements until more countries, the EU countries in particular, have hybrids rules in place. Agency consultation 72. The consultation on this project has been explained in the cover Cabinet paper. Briefly, there have been two rounds of consultation: one on the proposals in the discussion document; and a further round with selected submitters on branch mismatches and some of the detailed aspects set out in this paper. Financial implications 73. The proposed hybrid rule denying double deductions for foreign hybrid entities is estimated to increase tax revenue by $50 million per year from the 2019-20 year onwards. These amounts are already included in the forecasts as per Budget 2017 (CAB-17-MIN- 0164). 74. In addit io n, the proposed approach to grandparenting certain hybrid instruments as discussed at paragraphs 33-34 is expected to generate a total of $71 million over four years which is not currently included in the forecasts. This revenue is contingent on taxpayer behaviour after the implementation of the hybrid rules. 75. The combined revenue impact of all proposals is estimated as: $ million – increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue 2016 /17 2017 /18 2018 /19 2019 /20 2020 /21 2021 /22 2022/23 and out years Foreign hybrid entity double deductions (already included in forecast) 0 0 25 50 50 50 50 Hybrid instruments – grandparenting (new adjustment to forecasts) 0 0 19 19 19 14 0 Total revenue effect 0 0 44 69 69 64 50 Human rights, administrative impacts, legislative implications, publicity 76. These are set out in the accompanying covering Cabinet paper for the overall BEPS package (Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting). 14 Impact Analysis Requirements 77. Cabinet's Impact Analysis Requirements apply to these proposals and a Regulatory Impact Assessment is required. This has been prepared by Inland Revenue and is attached. 78. The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Regulatory Impact Assessment and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria. Recommendations 79. We recommend that Cabinet: 1. Agree that for payments under a financial instrument between related parties or that is a structured arrangement, and that results in a hybrid mismatch: a. to deny a New Zealand payer a deduction for the payment to the extent it is not taxed to a non-resident payee (OECD recommendation 1 primary rule); and b. if a non-resident payer has not been denied a deduction for the payment under similar rules, to tax a New Zealand payee on the payment as ordinary income, with no entitlement to a tax credit (OECD recommendation 1 defensive rule). 2. Agree to expand New Zealand’s current rule which denies a dividend exemption to a deductible dividend paid by a foreign company to a New Zealand company so that it also applies if the foreign payer receives tax benefits similar in nature to a deduction (OECD recommendation 2). 3. Agree that for payments made to a person in the same control group as the payee or pursuant to a structured transaction, where the payment is deductible to the payer but not recognised under the tax law in the payee country because the payment is disregarded under that law: a. to deny a deduction for the payment if made by a New Zealand payer (OECD recommendation 3 primary rule); b. if the payment is made by a non-resident, who is not denied a deduction under similar rules, to a New Zealand resident, to include the payment in ordinary income of the New Zealand resident (OECD recommendation 3 defensive rule); c. to allow any such deduction or income inclusion to be reversed to the extent that the deduction to the payer is set off against income that is included as income in both relevant countries (“dual inclusion income”). 4. Agree to deny a New Zealand payer a deduction in relation to payments made to a reverse hybrid entity in the same control group as the payer or pursuant to a structured transaction, where the payment is deductible to the payer but not included as income under the tax law in the reverse hybrid establishment country or in the country of the entity or person investing in the reverse hybrid entit y (OECD recommendation 4). 15 5. Agree that New Zealand should tax the income of a reverse hybrid established in New Zealand (such as a foreign trust or a limited partnership) to the extent that: a. the reverse hybrid income is not subject to tax in another jurisdiction (OECD recommendation 5.2); and b. the total foreign sourced income of the reverse hybrid exceeds the greater of $10,000 or 20% of the total income of the reverse hybrid. 6. Agree to the following in relation to double deduction outcomes produced by branches and hybrid entity structures: a. disallow the losses of a New Zealand-owned foreign hybrid entity or foreign branch if there is another entity in that foreign country whose income is capable of being offset against the losses of the hybrid entity or branch and that income is not taxable in New Zealand (modified OECD recommendation 6 primary); b. disallow the losses of a foreign-owned New Zealand hybrid entity or branch if the owner of the branch is not denied the loss under recommendation 6 primary rule in another country (OECD recommendation 6 defensive); and c. do not disallow losses (or reverse any previous disallowance) to the extent that the hybrid entity or branch earns dual inclusion income. 7. Agree to deny a deduction claimed in New Zealand by a dual resident company except to the extent that the dual resident company earns dual inclusion income (OECD recommendation 7). 8. Agree to deny a deduction in New Zealand for any payment that imports an offshore hybrid or branch mismatch arrangement into New Zealand, except to the extent that the payment is made to a country that has hybrid mismatch rules (OECD recommendation 8). 9. Note that, consistent with the Budget 2017 Cabinet paper (CAB-17-MIN-0164 refers), the hybrid rules should generally apply from 1 July 2018. 10. Agree that the effective date of the rule relating to unstructured imported mismatches (part of recommendation 8 above) should be delayed until 1 January 2020. 11. Agree that the application of the rule relating to New Zealand reverse hybrids (recommendation 5 above) should be for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2019. 12. Agree that there will be no general grandparenting of hybrid instruments or entities from the application of the hybrid mismatch rules, with the exception of hybrid financial instruments which are entitled to grandparented tax treatment until their next call date provided that they are: a. issued to satisfy the regulatory capital requirements imposed by New Zealand or Australian law; b. directly to, or are traceable to, issues to the public; and c. issued before the release of the Government’s Addressing Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements discussion document on 6 September 2016. 16 13. Note that the fiscal consequences of agreeing to recommendation 12 above is set out in the covering Cabinet paper for the overall BEPS package (Tax measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting). 14. Agree to the detailed design proposals set out in the appendix to this paper. 15. Agree that the Ministers of Finance and Revenue be authorised to make decisions on further detail of these proposals, or to amend the detail in the appendix, provided any such decisions are not contradictory with the principles set out in recommendations 1 to 12, without further reference to Cabinet. 16. Agree to delegate authority to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue to make final policy decisions on the following policy issues wit hout further reference to Cabinet: a. whether New Zealand’s controlled foreign company (CFC) rules should be modified to include as attributable foreign income all inco me of a reverse hybrid entity which would have been taxed to the New Zealand investor had it derived the income directly but which is not taxed by the country of the entity because the entity is treated as fiscally transparent in that country (OECD recommendation 5.1); b. whether New Zealand can and should include a tightly targeted and simple optional regime whereby foreign hybrid entities can elect to be treated as opaque entities for New Zealand tax purposes; and c. whether, the payer under a hybrid financial arrangement for which a deduction is denied, should be allowed to treat the payment as a dividend for purposes of both (but not only one of) the non-resident withholding tax and the imputation credit rules. 17. Agree that the results of the decisions in recommendations 1-16 be included in a BEPS taxation bill to be introduced to Parliament before the end of 2017. Authorised for lodgement Hon Steven Joyce Minister of Finance Hon Judith Collins Minister of Revenue Appendix List of detailed design decisions OECD Recommendations 1 and 2 1. A person who receives a payment which is deductible to the payer in another country will not be entitled to the benefit of any imputation credit attached to the payment. 2. When the hybrid rules apply to a hybrid financial instrument issued by a New Zealand taxpayer and denominated in a foreign currency, the deduction denied will take into account any foreign currency fluctuations on the instrument which would otherwise be taken into account for tax purposes, and any net income from the instrument including any foreign currency fluctuations will be non- taxable. 3. When the hybrid rules apply to a hybrid financial instrument held by a New Zealand taxpayer and denominated in a foreign currency, the taxpayer will not take into account any foreign currency fluctuations on the instrument, unless the instrument is an interest in a FIF which is subject to the comparative value method. 4. To the extent that a payment on a hybrid financial instrument can be proven to give rise to taxation of an investor in the payee entit y under another country’s controlled foreign company (CFC) regime, the payer will be allowed a deduction for the payment. 5. If a person holds a FIF interest as part of a share repo arrangement, that person will be required to use the comparative value or attributed foreign income method to determine their income from the FIF interest. 6. If a person holds New Zealand shares as part of a share repo arrangement, where the borrower is a non-resident, the person is not entitled to the benefit of an imputation credit attached to any dividends on the shares. 7. OECD recommendation 1 will only apply to timing mismatches if: • the mismatch arises on an instrument with a term of 3 years or more or on an instrument that has been extended to beyond 3 years; and • the lender is not accounting for the payment, for tax purposes, on a reasonable accrual basis; and • it is not reasonable, having regard to the terms of the instrument and the payments made to date, to believe that the expenditure will be included in income in the payee’s accounting period beginning within 24 months 18 of the end of the period in which the expenditure is incurred. 8. Amendments be made to the non-resident withholding tax rules so that in determining whether the rules require tax to be withheld on an accrual (rather than payments) basis, amounts for which a deduction is denied or deferred under OECD recommendation 1 are not taken into account unless and until they are deducted. 9. Interest that is permanently denied a deduction under recommendation 1 and the debt under which that interest paid is disregarded for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules. 10. There will be no exclusion for regulatory capital issued by banks and insurance companies except for some issues made before the release of the discussion document (6 September 2016). OECD Recommendation 3 11. Any foreign currency fluctuations recognised for tax purposes in relation to a financial arrangement denominated in a foreign currency will be taken into account when denying a deduction to a New Zealand payer. 12. Dual inclusion income will be calculated in accordance with New Zealand tax principles on the income of the hybrid payer from activities that are taxed in New Zealand, except that it will not include income which is protected from New Zealand tax by a foreign tax credit. 13. For the purposes of denying a deduction for a New Zealand payer, full taxation of income under a CFC regime will prevent income being treated as not taxable to a payee and will qualify income as dual inclusion income where it is not otherwise taxed to the payee and is not sheltered from tax by a foreign tax credit. 14. When an amount of deemed hybrid income is reversed in a later year because it is offset against dual inclusion income, that will be taken into account in determining the limit on the amount of foreign tax credit for which a New Zealand taxpayer applying the defensive rule is eligible. 15. The ability to claim a deduction in relation to a later year due to future dual inclusion income will be lost if there is a more than 51% change in a company’s ownership since the time the relevant deduction was incurred or deemed expenditure arose. 16. Amendments be made to the non-resident withholding tax rules so that in determining whether the rules require tax to be withheld on an accrual (rather than payments) basis, amounts for which a deduction is deferred under OECD recommendation 3 are not taken into account unless and until they are deducted. 19 17. Denial of a deduction for interest under recommendation 3 will not affect the amount of recognised interest or amount of debt for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules. 18. A deduction would be denied where a branch is treated in the branch country as making a deductible payment to its head office which is not a simple allocation of third party costs. 19. Where a New Zealand taxpayer has recognized income as a result of receiving a disregarded payment from a foreign hybrid entity, that income will be reversed in a later year when there is dual inclusion income earned through the hybrid entity. OECD Recommendation 4 20. Diverted branch payments and payments made to a disregarded branch are included within the scope of recommendation 4. 21. Recommendation 4 deduction denial in respect of a payment under a foreign currency loan includes foreign currency gains or losses. 22. To the extent a payment to a reverse hybrid can be proven to be taxed under the CFC regime of an investor country, a deduction will be allowed. 23. Non-resident withholding tax will continue to be applied to payments, despite the denial of the deduction 24. Interest that is denied a deduction under recommendation 4 and the debt under which that interest paid is disregarded for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules. OECD Recommendation 5.2 25. Tax the partnership income of a non-resident partner of a New Zealand limited partnership if the non-resident partner is in a control group with the partnership and the non-resident partner is not taxed on their share of the income of the partnership because their jurisdiction views the income as earned by the partnership and not by the partner. 26. Tax a New Zealand resident trustee on foreign-sourced beneficiary income allocated to a non-resident beneficiary as if the trustee were a New Zealand resident individual taxpayer to the extent that: • the beneficiary is in the same control group as the trustee; and • the beneficiary would be taxed on income from the assets giving rise to the beneficiary income if it held the assets directly; and • the income is not subject to tax as the income of any person other than 20 the trustee (such as the beneficiary or settlor). 27. Tax a New Zealand trustee of a foreign trust on foreign-sourced trustee income to the extent that: • the settlor is in the same control group as the trustee; • the settlor would be taxed on the trustee income if it held the trust assets directly; and • the income is not subject to tax as the income of any person other than the trustee. 28. Include a de minimis so that none of the above recommendation 5.2 rules apply if the total foreign sourced income of the trustee does not exceed the greater of $10,000 and 20% of the total income of the trust. OECD Recommendation 6 29. There will be a transitional rule such that a New Zealand-owned foreign hybrid entity or foreign branch’s accumulated loss is recaptured where that entity or branch’s control group acquires an interest in an entity in the foreign country except in cases where the accumulated loss cannot be offset against current and future income of the newly acquired entity. 30. A deduction will be allowed in New Zealand for losses of New Zealand-owned foreign hybrid entities or foreign branches if those losses cannot ever be used in the foreign country 31. Income which can be shown to be taxable in the foreign country and in New Zealand under New Zealand’s CFC rules can be regarded as dual inclusion income except to the extent that the income is sheltered by a foreign tax credit. 32. Double deduction amounts and dual inclusion income amounts for a foreign hybrid entity or branch will be calculated in accordance with New Zealand tax principles on the income of the foreign hybrid entity/branch/ from activities that are taxed in New Zealand, except that income which is protected from New Zealand tax by a foreign tax credit will not be regarded as dual inclusion income. 33. The ability to claim a deduction in relation in a later year due to future dual inclusion income will be lost if there is a more than 51% change in a company’s ownership since the time the relevant deduction was incurred or deemed expenditure arose. 34. Amendments will be made to the non-resident withholding tax rules so that in determining whether the rules require tax to be withheld on an accrual (rather than payments) basis, amounts for which a deduction is deferred under OECD recommendations 6 are not taken into account unless and until they are 21 deducted. 35. Denial of a deduction for interest under recommendations 6 will not affect the amount of recognised interest or amount of debt for the purposes of thin capitalisation rules. OECD Recommendation 7 36. Amend existing consolidation and loss grouping rules for dual resident company losses to ensure that those losses cannot be offset against income earned by a New Zealand reverse hybrid. 37. Double deduction amounts and dual inclusion income amounts will be calculated in accordance with New Zealand tax principles on the income of the dual resident company from activities that are taxed in New Zealand, except that income which is protected from New Zealand tax by a foreign tax credit will not be regarded as dual inclusion income. 38. The ability to claim a deduction in relation in a later year due to future dual inclusion income will be lost if there is a more than 51% change in a company’s ownership since the time the relevant deduction was incurred. 39. Denial of a deduction for interest will not affect the amount of recognised interest or amount of debt for the purposes of thin capitalisation rules. OECD Recommendation 8 40. When recommendation 8 applies to a payment that imports an offshore hybrid or branch mismatch arrangement into New Zealand, the deduction denied will ignore any foreign currency fluctuations on the instrument. 41. Interest that is denied a deduction under recommendation 8 and the debt under which that interest paid is disregarded for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules General design and definitional matters 42. A coordination rule will be included in the hybrid rules to ensure that the hybrid mismatch rules of other countries mesh well with New Zealand’s rules. 43. A specific anti-avoidance rule will be included in the hybrid rules to allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to counteract arrangements that have the purpose or effect of defeating the intent or application of the hybrid rules.

Why is Government intervention required?The policy problem is that taxpayers can reduce their worldwide tax liability through hybrid mismatch arrangements, which in most cases are deliberately designed to take advantage of the different characterisations countries use for financial instruments and entities. Hybrid mismatch arrangements (which include branch mismatches) result in less group taxation when compared with straightforward arrangements that are seen consistently by the relevant countries. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option?A tailored adoption of the OECD�s BEPS Action 2 recommendations will comprehensively deal with the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements while making modifications and variations to take into account what is appropriate for the New Zealand context. This tailored solution is sustainable and achieves gains to efficiency and fairness, while minimising compliance costs where possible. There will be a significant benefit in adopting a solution which is adopted by other countries and which will therefore be easier for multinational businesses to understand and comply with. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit?The Government will benefit in that new rules to counter hybrid mismatch arrangements are forecast to produce approximately $50 million per year on an ongoing basis. There are also efficiency and fairness benefits to this regulatory proposal which cannot be assigned to particular beneficiaries.  Where do the costs fall? Taxpayers that use hybrid mismatch arrangements will face a medium level of compliance costs. These may be up-front, in the form of restructuring costs to transition to more straightforward (non-hybrid) arrangements, or they may be ongoing in the case of taxpayers that keep their hybrid mismatch arrangements in place and must apply new tax rules in order to comply with the law.  What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? There is some risk of taxpayer noncompliance with the proposed rules. However, the risk of taxpayers being inadvertently caught by the proposed rules has been minimised due to the design of the preferred regulatory option which seeks to exclude the most simple offshore structures (foreign branches). More generally, the impacts have been reduced through the proposals taking into account the New Zealand context and adjusting the OECD-recommended rules as needed. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government�s �Expectations for the design of regulatory systems�. There is no incompatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government�s �Expectations for the design of regulatory systems�.  Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? Not every type of hybrid arrangement that would be countered by the proposals has been observed in New Zealand. However, Inland Revenue is aware of some historic and current hybrid arrangements, and there is a very high likelihood there are others that relate to New Zealand and will be affected by this regulatory proposal. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency:Inland RevenueQuality Assurance Assessment:The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the BEPS � hybrid mismatch arrangements Regulatory Impact Assessment prepared by Inland Revenue and associated supporting material and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria.Reviewer Comments and Recommendations:The reviewer�s comments on earlier versions of the Regulatory Impact Assessment have been incorporated into the final version.Impact Statement: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements Section 1: General information PurposeInland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final tax policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet.� Key Limitations or Constraints on AnalysisEvidence of the problem Our analysis has been limited somewhat by our inability to assess the exact size of the hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements problem in New Zealand. Inland Revenue is aware of some mismatch arrangements, but the full extent of the problem is unknown. This is because evidence of the problem primarily comes from Inland Revenue�s investigations staff. Under current law these staff do not routinely examine offshore tax treatment (and therefore arrangements that lower a group�s worldwide tax obligations), which is an important part of identifying a hybrid mismatch arrangement under the proposals. Range of options considered Our analysis has been constrained by the scope and nature of the OECD�s work on hybrid mismatch arrangements. For reasons of international compatibility it would be unwise for New Zealand to design a largely unique set of hybrid mismatch rules that departs from the principles that the OECD has advocated for. This limitation has been mitigated to a certain extent by New Zealand�s ongoing involvement in the development of the OECD recommendations. Assumptions underpinning impact analysis The estimated impact of the options is dependent on the behavioural response of taxpayers to the introduction of some form of hybrid mismatch arrangement rules. Taxpayers may rearrange their affairs to fall outside the scope of any proposed rules, which will have flow-on effects as to efficiency, compliance costs and revenue implications. Beyond anecdotal information learned through consultation, it is difficult to assess the extent and nature of the behavioural response.Responsible Manager (signature and date): Paul Kilford Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 12 July 2017Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed?BEPS Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) refers to the aggressive tax planning strategies used by some multinational groups to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. This outcome is achieved by exploiting gaps and mismatches in countries� domestic tax rules to avoid tax. BEPS strategies distort investment decisions, allow multinationals to benefit from unintended competitive advantages over more compliant or domestic companies, and result in the loss of substantial corporate tax revenue. More fundamentally, the perceived unfairness resulting from BEPS jeopardises citizens� trust in the integrity of the tax system as a whole. In October 2015, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its final package of 15 recommended tax measures for countries to implement to counter base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). Hybrid mismatch arrangements Hybrid mismatch arrangements arise when taxpayers exploit inconsistencies in the way that jurisdictions treat financial instruments and entities under their respective domestic law. The OECD�s BEPS package includes Action 2: Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements. Hybrid mismatch arrangements are prevalent worldwide and are an important part of the base erosion and profit shifting strategies used by multinational companies. If no action is taken by the international community to counter these types of arrangements they are likely to continue to be used to avoid worldwide taxation and drive economic inefficiencies and unfairly distributed tax burdens. New Zealand�s BEPS work The New Zealand Government has signalled a willingness to address BEPS issues and has taken tangible action in this regard. New Zealand is a supporter of the OECD/G20 BEPS project to address international tax avoidance and is advancing a number of measures that are OECD/G20 BEPS recommendations. In September 2016 the Government released a BEPS discussion document: Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements which proposed adoption of the OECD Action 2 recommendations in New Zealand and sought submissions on how that should be done. In March 2017 the Government released two further discussion documents: BEPS � Strengthening our interest limitation rules; and BEPS � Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance. As part of Budget 2017, the Government decided to proceed with tax law changes to implement one aspect of the hybrid rules. This change is to restrict the ability of New Zealand businesses to use double deductions of foreign hybrid entities to reduce their tax liabilities in New Zealand. This restriction is intended to apply to the most prevalent hybrid structure involving outbound investment by New Zealand based groups, which is the use of financing through Australian limited partnerships to achieve double deductions. At the same time, Cabinet noted that the reforms proposed in the BEPS documents would be progressed, subject to modification in consultation, for implementation from 1 July 2018. Cabinet also noted that officials are continuing to develop and consult on all aspects of the BEPS project and that Cabinet approval will be sought for final policy decisions later in 2017. 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place?New Zealand�s tax system New Zealand has a broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) taxation framework. This means that tax bases are broad and tax rates are kept as low as possible while remaining consistent with the Government�s distributional objectives. The BBLR framework also means that the tax system is not generally used to deliver incentives or encourage particular behaviours. Company tax and international rules The company tax system is designed to be a backstop for taxing the personal income of domestic investors. Company tax is deducted at 28%, but New Zealand based investors can claim imputation credits for tax paid by the company when the income is taxed upon distribution at the personal level. At the same time, the company tax is designed as a final tax on New Zealand-sourced income of foreign investors and foreign-owned companies earning New Zealand-sourced income. Having a consistent tax framework such as BBLR does not mean that tax changes are unnecessary. An ongoing policy challenge in the area of international tax is to ensure that multinational firms pay a fair and efficient amount of tax in New Zealand. Anti-avoidance rules and base protection measures are important part of ensuring that New Zealand collects an appropriate amount of tax on non-resident investment. At the same time, it is important that New Zealand continues to be a good place to base a business and that tax does not get in the way of this happening. New Zealand relies heavily on foreign direct investment (FDI) to fund domestic investment and, as such, the Government is committed to ensuring New Zealand remains an attractive place for non-residents to invest. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements Businesses can use hybrid mismatch arrangements to create tax advantages through exploiting inconsistencies in the way that jurisdictions treat financial instruments and entities under their respective domestic law. For example, using a hybrid entity or a foreign branch, a single expense may be deducted in two different jurisdictions, potentially reducing the tax payable on two different streams of income. Another example is a payment that is tax-deductible in one jurisdiction with no corresponding taxable income in the jurisdiction where the payment is received. However it is achieved, the result of a hybrid mismatch arrangement is less aggregate tax revenue collected in the jurisdictions to which the arrangement relates when compared with a straightforward arrangement that is seen consistently by both relevant countries. Hybrid mismatch arrangements also have the effect of subsidising international investment relative to domestic investment, which distorts the efficiency of global markets. Since releasing its final recommendations on hybrid mismatch arrangements, the OECD expanded the scope of BEPS Action 2 to include branch mismatches. Branch mismatch arrangements are a result of countries approaching the allocation of income and expenses between a branch and a head office in different ways. Branch mismatch arrangements can also result in a reduction in the overall taxation of a corporate group, so are similar in effect to hybrid mismatch arrangements. It is important to note that the policy problem is limited to circumstances when global tax is reduced as a result of a hybrid mismatch. This project does not address other mechanisms that taxpayers may use to lower their global tax liability, such as the use of low-tax jurisdictions to trap income. Hybrid mismatch arrangements in New Zealand New Zealand has a general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) that can, in some instances, neutralise the effects of a hybrid mismatch arrangement. However, the target of the GAAR is arrangements that avoid New Zealand tax. The arrangement must also do so in a manner that is outside Parliament�s contemplation; a classic indicator being that the arrangement gains the advantage in an artificial or contrived way. Although the use of a hybrid mismatch arrangement reduces the overall tax paid by the parties to the arrangement, it is often difficult to determine which country involved has lost tax revenue. Further, the use of a hybrid is not necessarily artificial or contrived in and of itself. Accordingly, the GAAR does not provide a comprehensive solution to counter the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements. New Zealand also has some specific rules in its domestic law that go some way to addressing particular recommendations made by the OECD in relation to hybrid mismatch arrangements. Inland Revenue is aware of a significant volume of hybrid mismatch arrangements involving New Zealand. For example, the amount of tax at issue in recent litigation for a prominent type of hybrid financial instrument was approximately $300 million (across multiple years). In relation to hybrid entities, deductions claimed in New Zealand that are attributable to the most prominent hybrid entity structure results in approximately $50 million less tax revenue for New Zealand per year.  2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? Our analysis has been constrained by the scope and nature of the OECD�s work on hybrid mismatch arrangements. For reasons of international compatibility it would be unwise for New Zealand to design a largely unique set of hybrid mismatch rules that departs from the principles that the OECD has advocated for. This limitation has been mitigated to a certain extent by New Zealand�s ongoing involvement in the development of the OECD recommendations. Consistent with the OECD approach, the analysis has been focused on arrangements between related parties or where a hybrid mismatch has been created through a structured arrangement between unrelated parties. We have also chosen to restrict the policy thinking to cross-border activity. Purely domestic hybrid mismatches (some of which are contemplated by the OECD Action 2 final report) are outside the scope of this regulatory proposal. 2.5 What do stakeholders think?Stakeholders Stakeholders of this regulatory proposal are primarily taxpayers (typically multinational businesses that have hybrid mismatch arrangements) and tax advisors. The proposed rules will be applied to taxpayers� affairs, while tax advisors will assist (taxpayer) clients as to the application of the proposed rules. The proposed rules affect only taxpayers with foreign connections � that is, foreign-owned New Zealand taxpayers, and New Zealand-owned taxpayers with foreign operations. Another stakeholder of this regulatory proposal is the OECD, which is aiming to eradicate hybrid mismatch arrangements to the extent possible. This goal can only be achieved through countries adopting hybrid mismatch rules of some kind and neutralising the mismatches that arise when different sets of rules apply to the same transaction or entity. In addition, other countries that have enacted or are proposing to enact hybrid mismatch rules (for example, Australia and the United Kingdom) will be interested in the interaction between their own hybrid mismatch rules and any rules that New Zealand introduce into law. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is interested in the regulatory proposal to the extent that it affects bank regulatory capital. Submissions to discussion document There were 20 submissions made to the September 2016 Government discussion document. Submissions varied significantly in responding to the proposals both in general views and specific coverage. Some submitters were supportive of New Zealand taking action in line with the OECD hybrids package, subject to various provisos including that it was done in a co-ordinated fashion with other jurisdictions and/or that there should be concessions of some variety. However, a greater number of submitters were in favour of adopting a targeted or phased approach to the OECD hybrids package focused on countering hybrid arrangements that are of most concern to New Zealand. Submissions also covered a number of specific aspects of, and general concerns with, the proposals, including the complexity of the proposals and that New Zealand should not be in the first wave of countries adopting the proposals. Further and ongoing consultation We have engaged in approximately a dozen workshops (with the Corporate Taxpayers Group and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) and attended various other meetings with private sector submitters (including the New Zealand Bankers� Association) in order to discuss specific design issues relating to hybrid mismatch arrangements. We have also consulted with officials representing Australia and the United Kingdom, as well as the OECD secretariat, on an ongoing basis to ensure that the proposed rules work as intended, and do not give rise to inadvertent double taxation or non-taxation. We have also consulted with the Reserve Bank. The Treasury has been heavily involved with the policy development process in their joint role with Inland Revenue as tax policy advisors for the Government. Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem?Four options were considered in the development of this regulatory proposal. These options are mutually exclusive and can be regarded as four points on a decision spectrum measuring how closely (if it all) New Zealand aligns itself with the OECD recommendations in dealing with hybrid mismatch arrangements. None of the options (with the exception of the status quo option) are non-regulatory options. This is because our judgment is that the policy problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements cannot be addressed without changing tax rules, and that is something that can only be done through the use of legislation (as per section 22(a) of the Constitution Act 1986). These options are what we consider other countries dealing with hybrid mismatch arrangements will consider in their policy development process. The United Kingdom and Australia can both be said to have chosen their own version of option 2. Some other countries have had rules to deal with hybrid mismatches that predate the OECD�s work in this area. Status quo: No action This option relies on New Zealand�s existing law (including the GAAR) to counter hybrid mismatch arrangements and avoids the increased compliance costs and administrative costs of the other options. The status quo option also contemplates that other countries have introduced or will introduce their own hybrid mismatch rules, some of which will neutralise hybrid mismatch arrangements relating to New Zealand. Option 1: Strict adoption of OECD recommendations The OECD recommendations as set out in its BEPS Action 2 report are a comprehensive set of principle-based rules to counteract all types of hybrid mismatch arrangements. Option 1 is to strictly adopt those recommendations as described by the OECD into New Zealand domestic law. This option would deal with the range of hybrid mismatch arrangements targeted by the OECD to the extent they are found in or affect New Zealand. It would have the advantage of interacting well with other countries that similarly adopt the OECD recommendations into their domestic law. Option 2: Tailored adoption of OECD recommendations Option 2 is to adopt the core principles of the OECD recommendations with suitable modifications and variations to take into account what is appropriate for the New Zealand context. This option bears close relation to Option 1 as it involves introducing OECD-consistent hybrid rules unless there is a compelling reason to depart from the OECD approach. Thus, this option would solve the policy problem while ensuring that particular New Zealand issues are addressed. Option 2 also recognises that there are some instances where New Zealand�s existing tax laws are sufficient (or can be made sufficient with relatively minor amendment) to achieve the effect intended by an OECD recommendation. Option 3: Targeted hybrid rules Option 3 is to introduce targeted hybrid rules that address only the significant hybrid mismatches that the Government is aware of. This option would solve the policy problem by addressing the current hybrid mismatch arrangements affecting New Zealand. It would avoid enacting rules targeted at arrangements which are not currently seen in New Zealand. Consultation These four options were identified prior to consultation. The September 2016 discussion document proposed adoption of the OECD recommendations (options 1 and 2) and sought feedback on how that should be done. The document stated the Government�s alternative options as option 3 and maintaining the status quo and concluded that they were not the best way forward. Consultation has affected the nature of option 2 in particular and has been helpful for options analysis generally. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration?The generic tax policy process (GTPP) includes a framework for assessing key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals. This framework is consistent with the Government�s vision for the tax and social policy system, and is captured by the following criteria: Efficiency of compliance � compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as possible Efficiency of administration � administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible Neutrality � the tax system should bias economic decisions as little as possible Fairness and equity � similar taxpayers in similar circumstances should be treated in a similar way Sustainability � the potential for tax evasion and avoidance should be minimised while keeping counteracting measures proportionate to risks involved In relation to this regulatory proposal, it would be difficult to achieve positive sustainability, neutrality and fairness impacts without some increase in compliance costs and so there are some trade-offs that were and continue to be considered. Through our consultation we have worked with stakeholders to minimise compliance costs as much as possible without sacrificing the benefits of the proposal. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why?We ruled out designing a largely unique set of hybrid mismatch rules that departs from the principles that the OECD has advocated for. This is for reasons of international compatibility and to save compliance costs. Section 4: Impact Analysis Status quo: No actionOption 1: Strict adoptionOption 2: Tailored adoptionOption 3: Targeted rulesEfficiency of compliance0- - Option 1 has a significant compliance burden because some of the OECD recommendations as drafted would not mesh well with New Zealand�s existing tax laws.- Option 2 imposes increased compliance costs on taxpayers and advisors, but is focused on reducing those costs where possible. - Option 3 imposes increased compliance costs on taxpayers and advisors, but by its nature it reduces those costs in proposing rules that only address currently observed exploitation of hybrid mismatches.Efficiency of administration00 We expect the additional costs to Inland Revenue of administering a tax system with hybrid mismatch rules to be balanced by less resources used disputing hybrid mismatch arrangements using the GAAR.0 We expect the additional costs to Inland Revenue of administering a tax system with hybrid mismatch rules to be balanced by less resources used disputing hybrid mismatch arrangements using the GAAR.0 We expect the additional costs to Inland Revenue of administering a tax system with hybrid mismatch rules to be balanced by less resources used disputing hybrid mismatch arrangements using the GAAR.Neutrality0++ Option 1 will comprehensively remove the benefit of hybrid mismatch opportunities involving New Zealand.

This will likely provide some efficiency gains. However, other hybrid mismatch arrangement opportunities will remain available. This means that, depending on the extent to which taxpayers respond to an option 3 approach by simply moving into �uncovered� tax-efficient hybrid structures, there will still be some inefficient allocations of investment due to ongoing hybrid mismatch arrangements.Fairness and equity0+ Option 1 has fairness and equity benefits as it ensures that taxpayers able to use hybrid mismatch arrangements cannot reduce their tax liability.+ Option 2 has fairness and equity benefits as it ensures that taxpayers able to use hybrid mismatch arrangements cannot reduce their tax liability.+ Option 3 has fairness and equity benefits as it ensures that taxpayers able to use currently observed hybrid mismatch arrangements cannot reduce their tax liability.

It is an internationally consistent, proactive option which delivers net benefits to New Zealand greater than that of the other options considered. Option 2 will improve the neutrality of New Zealand�s tax system. Businesses that are able to exploit hybrid mismatch arrangements can currently operate at lower effective tax rates when compared with other businesses. This can result in a �hybrid� business crowding out more productive investment and making international investment decisions based on whether a mismatch is available rather than commercial grounds. In addition, the imposition of higher taxes elsewhere in order to make up lost tax revenue due to the use of hybrid mismatches is likely to be less efficient than imposing more moderate taxes across all economic actors. By eliminating the tax benefit of hybrid mismatch arrangements in a comprehensive way, these inefficiencies can be removed. In a related sense, option 2 will help to improve the equity and fairness of the New Zealand tax system. Unintended tax benefits that are streamed to some taxpayers who are able to take advantage of hybrid mismatches means that a greater tax burden must fall on other taxpayers (such as purely domestic firms) who do not have the hybrid mismatch opportunities that cross border businesses do. Accordingly, introducing rules to counter hybrid mismatch arrangements will restore some fairness to the tax system as those tax burdens will be shared more equally. Option 2 will also have revenue collection benefits. The New Zealand tax revenue loss caused by the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements is difficult to estimate because the full extent of arrangements involving New Zealand is unknown and because the behavioural effects of introducing hybrid mismatch rules are difficult to ascertain. However, the tax revenue at stake is significant in the cases that Inland Revenue is aware of. Importantly, the case for New Zealand to adopt the OECD recommendations is strengthened by the fact that other countries have enacted, or are proposing to enact, hybrid mismatch rules. This is because a hybrid mismatch arrangement involving a New Zealand counterparty may still be neutralised by the other country if they have a �secondary� right to counteract under OECD principles. In that case, the tax benefit of the hybrid mismatch would be eliminated, but the tax collected would be by the counterparty country. In these circumstances, New Zealand would be better off having its own hybrid mismatch rules so that it can collect revenue when it has the priority to do so under the OECD recommendations. Whether New Zealand or the counterparty country collects any additional revenue as a result of implementing the rules depends on the actions taken by the affected business. Option 2 is ultimately a balance between the positive impacts described above and the trade-off compliance costs. It attempts to introduce a comprehensive set of rules which is adjusted for the New Zealand tax environment. For instance, we identified early in the policy development process that one of the OECD recommendations would not interact smoothly with New Zealand�s approach to the taxation of the foreign branches of New Zealand companies. The recommendation in question had to be modified under option 2 so that the tax treatment of a simple offshore branch structure of a New Zealand company (which is not part of the policy problem) would be unaffected by the introduction of the hybrid mismatch rules. We have also recommended a delay to the effective date of an OECD-recommended rule which applies to what are known as �unstructured imported mismatches�. This rule could cause undue compliance costs if it was to come into effect at the same time as the other rules. Delaying its effective date until a significant number of other countries have introduced hybrid mismatch rules means the associated New Zealand-specific compliance costs will either disappear or will be no greater than the costs faced by a multinational group operating in those other countries. Accordingly, the compliance costs of the regulatory proposal are to be minimised to the extent possible, while still introducing a comprehensive set of rules to deal with the range of OECD-identified hybrid mismatches. This is where option 2 shows its advantage over option 1 which we view as having similar efficiency, fairness and revenue benefits. Option 1 would result in relatively higher compliance costs because the OECD recommendations are designed as a general set of best-practice rules and, in regards to their detail, are not necessarily optimal for individual countries such as New Zealand. When compared with option 1, option 2 ensures that the rules are workable and appropriate for the New Zealand tax environment. It is also important to note that the ongoing compliance costs relating to this regulatory issue are expected to be optional in the majority of cases. The proposed rules will apply to taxpayers who use a hybrid mismatch arrangement after the rules become effective. Those taxpayers will generally have the option of incurring one-off costs to restructure into non-hybrid arrangements and remove themselves from the scope of the proposed rules. Any higher tax payments resulting from the non-status quo options will make cross border investment less attractive for taxpayers using hybrid mismatch arrangements. However, these taxpayers should not be allowed to exploit hybrid mismatches to achieve a competitive advantage over taxpayers that do not use hybrid mismatch arrangements (such as purely domestic firms). Further, a significant number of New Zealand�s major investment partners have introduced or will introduce hybrid mismatch rules. Other countries adopting these rules means that in many cases the tax efficiency of hybrid mismatch arrangements in New Zealand will be negated through the operation of the other country�s rules on the counterparty, As a result, we believe that any impacts on inbound and outbound cross border investment from introducing hybrid mismatch rules in New Zealand will be low. The status quo option would involve the least complexity and lowest compliance costs. However, similar to the cross-border investment discussion above, taxpayers whose groups deal with New Zealand�s major trading partners that are adopting hybrid mismatch rules would have to understand the impact of those rules. The additional complexity of New Zealand having hybrid mismatch rules would therefore be lessened by the international momentum in this area. Option 3 is an option that was preferred by many submitters to the Government discussion document on hybrid mismatch arrangements. Submitters pointed out that many of the structures considered by the OECD to be problematic have not been seen in New Zealand and therefore do not need to be counteracted. They also argued that the OECD recommendations are complex and have the potential for overreach. We do not think a targeted approach would serve New Zealand well when compared with option 2. The OECD recommendations are a coherent package intending to deal to the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements exhaustively. Deliberately omitting aspects of the recommendations from New Zealand�s response may cause taxpayers to exploit those remaining hybrid mismatch opportunities (which may even be seen as tacitly blessed). To the extent that happens, the efficiency, revenue, and fairness benefits of option 3 would be eroded. In addition, other countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia have introduced or are intending to introduce a relatively comprehensive set of hybrid mismatch rules. If New Zealand does the same it will ensure our rules are internationally comparable and that they interact well with the rules of other countries without significant compliance issues. By favouring option 2, we also have consulted extensively on the OECD recommendations and how they should best be introduced into New Zealand law. This consultation has enabled us to design suitable modifications to the OECD recommendations to reduce complexity and compliance costs, limit overreach, and in some cases, increase the efficiency of the outcomes. 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected parties (identify)Comment: nature of cost or benefit (e.g. ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (e.g. compliance rates), risksImpact $m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non-monetised impacts Evidence certainty (High, medium or low) Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no actionRegulated partiesCompliance costs: Increased costs from understanding the rules and applying them to taxpayers� transactions and structures.

The actual revenue generated from these reforms may therefore be higher, but this cannot be estimated with confidence. 5.3 What other impacts is this approach likely to have?As discussed above, allowing the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements is inefficient and unfair, as it results in uneven tax burdens across different businesses. This is an issue in itself, but it may also weaken taxpayer morale. The perception of unfairness that comes from the reported low corporate taxes paid by taxpayers who can take advantage of hybrid mismatch opportunities (and/or employ other BEPS strategies) is an important issue. This perception of unfairness undermines public confidence in the tax system and therefore the willingness of taxpayers to voluntarily comply with their own tax obligations. This integrity factor is difficult to assign to a particular set of stakeholders as it is something that is fundamental to the tax system itself. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government�s �Expectations for the design of regulatory systems�?Yes, option 2 (tailored adoption of OECD recommendations) conforms to the expectations for the design of regulatory systems document. Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice?The preferred option will be given effect through amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. The bill, when introduced, will be accompanied by commentary in order to provide stakeholders with guidance as to the intended application of the provisions. Inland Revenue will also produce guidance on the enacted legislation in its Tax Information Bulletin (TIB). Once implemented, Inland Revenue will be responsible for ongoing operation and enforcement of the new rules. Inland Revenue has not identified any concerns with its ability to implement these reforms. The intended application date for most aspects of the regulatory proposal is for income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. The major exceptions are: the proposed rule for �unstructured imported mismatch arrangements�, which we recommend be delayed until income years starting on or after 1 January 2020; and the proposed rules applying to New Zealand �reverse hybrids�, which we recommend be delayed until income years starting on or after 1 April 2019. Another exception we recommend is a grandparenting rule that exempts from application of the rules (until the next call date) hybrid financial instruments issued by banks as regulatory capital (in Australian or New Zealand) to third party investors before the discussion document release date of September 2016. Some submitters on the discussion document argued that there needs to be sufficient lead-in time for these reforms to allow taxpayers to restructure their affairs if necessary. We consider an application date of 1 July 2018 (for most of the measures) to be sufficiently prospective when compared with the date of the discussion document release, which is when taxpayers should be regarded to be have been notified of the Government�s intention in this area, and the scheduled date of introduction of the relevant tax bill.  6.2 What are the implementation risks?We do not consider there to be many implementation risks for Inland Revenue. Audit staff will need to familiarise themselves with the proposed rules and how they operate in practice. As with any legislative proposal, there is the risk of technical drafting errors and unintended consequences. If and when these arise, they will be dealt with by remedial amendment. In practice, these reforms will mostly involve changes for taxpayers rather than Inland Revenue. There is a risk that some taxpayers may not be able to restructure their hybrid mismatch arrangements or understand the rules in time to comply with their new obligations. To manage this risk, we are minimising compliance costs where possible under our tailored adoption of the OECD recommendations. For example, and as mentioned above, we have delayed the application date of the unstructured imported mismatch rule contained in the OECD recommendations to acknowledge that it would be significantly more difficult and costly to comply with than the other rules if it applied at the outset.Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored?In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of tax changes would take place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. Existing investigations functions for monitoring the behaviour of taxpayers will continue to be used for the proposed rules of this regulatory proposal. However, it may be difficult to assess the true impact of this regulatory proposal. This is because many taxpayers using hybrid mismatch arrangements may rearrange their affairs to fall outside the scope of the proposed rules. It will be difficult to measure the full extent of this behavioural effect. Inland Revenue are currently considering the appropriate level of information that should be collected to support the proposed rules for this regulatory proposal and for other BEPS proposals. This may be in the form of a disclosure statement made to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or it may form part of existing information gathering tools. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTPP process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. For example, a post-implementation workshop with stakeholders that participated in policy consultation sessions may be appropriate for these rules. In practice, any changes identified as necessary following enactment would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. If it became apparent that an aspect of the proposed rules is unworkable, or if the rules have created unintended consequences whether tax-related or otherwise, this would justify a review of all or part of the legislation.     Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements |  PAGE 1  /01C\_\`aq����� 8 9 : ; c d � � �  / n � � �

Coversheet: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements Advising agencies Inland Revenue, The Treasury Decision sought This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final tax policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Proposing Ministers Steven Joyce (Finance) and Hon Judith Collins (Revenue) Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? The policy problem is that taxpayers can reduce their worldwide tax liability through hybrid mismatch arrangements, which in most cases are deliberately designed to take advantage of the different characterisations countries use for financial instruments and entities. Hybrid mismatch arrangements (which include branch mismatches) result in less group taxation when compared with straightforward arrangements that are seen consistently by the relevant countries. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? A tailored adoption of the OECD’s BEPS Action 2 recommendations will comprehensively deal with the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements while making modifications and variations to take into account what is appropriate for the New Zealand context. This tailored solution is sustainable and achieves gains to efficiency and fairness, while minimising compliance costs where possible. There will be a significant benefit in adopting a solution which is adopted by other countries and which will therefore be easier for multinational businesses to understand and comply with. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The Government will benefit in that new rules to counter hybrid mismatch arrangements are forecast to produce approximately $50 m illion per year on an ongoing basis. There are also efficiency and fairness benefits to this regulatory proposal which cannot be assigned to particular beneficiaries. Reg ulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 1 BEPS documents release - August 2017: #20 Where do the costs fall? Taxpayers that use hybrid mismatch arrangements will face a medium level of compliance costs. These may be up-front, in the form of restructuring costs to transition to more straightforward (non-hybrid) arrangements, or they may be ongoing in the case of taxpayers that keep their hybrid mismatch arrangements in place and must apply new tax rules in order to comply with the law. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? There is some risk of taxpayer noncompliance with the proposed rules. However, the risk of taxpayers being inadvertently caught by the proposed rules has been minimised due to the design of the preferred regulatory option which seeks to exclude the most simple offshore structures (foreign branches). More generally, the impacts have been reduced through the proposals taking into account the New Zealand context and adjusting the OECD- recommended rules as needed. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. There is no incompatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? Not every type of hybrid arrangement that would be countered by the proposals has been observed in New Zealand. However, Inland Revenue is aware of some historic and current hybrid arrangements, and there is a very high likelihood there are others that relate to New Zealand and will be affected by this regulatory proposal. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the BEPS – hybrid mismatch arrangements Regulatory Impact Assessment prepared by Inland Revenue and associated supporting material and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer’s comments on earlier versions of the Regulatory Impact Assessment have been incorporated into the final version. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 2 Impact Statement: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final tax policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Evidence of the problem Our analysis has been limited somewhat by our inability to assess the exact size of the hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements problem in New Zealand. Inland Revenue is aware of some mismatch arrangements, but the full extent of the problem is unknown. This is because evidence of the problem pri marily comes from Inland Revenue’s investigations staff. Under current law these staff do not routinely examine offshore tax treatment (and therefore arrangements that lower a group’s worldwide tax obligations) , which is an important part of identifying a hybrid mismatch arrangement under the proposals. Range of options considered Our analysis has been constrained by the scope and nature of the OECD’s work on hybrid mismatch arrangements. For reasons of international compatibility it would be unwise for New Zealand to design a largely unique set of hybrid mismatch rules that departs from the principles that the OECD has advocated for. This limitation has been mitigated to a certain extent by New Zealand’s ongoing involvement in the development of the OECD recommendations. Assumptions underpinning impact analysis The estimated impact of the options is dependent on the behavioural response of taxpayers to the introduction of some form of hybrid mismatch arrangement rules. Taxpayers may rearrange their affairs to fall outside the scope of any proposed rules, which will have flow-on effects as to efficiency, compliance costs and revenue implications. Beyond anecdotal information learned through consultation, it is difficult to assess the extent and nature of the behavioural response. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Paul Kilford Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 12 July 2017 Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 3 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? BEPS Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) refers to the aggressive tax planning strategies used by some multinational groups to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. This outcome is achieved by exploiting gaps and mismatches in countries’ domestic tax rules to avoid tax. BEPS strategies distort investment decisions, allow multinationals to benefit from unintended competitive advantages over more compliant or domestic companies, and result in the loss of substantial corporate tax revenue. More fundamentally, the perceived unfairness resulting from BEPS jeopardises citizens’ trust in the integrity of the tax system as a whole. In October 2015, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its final package of 15 recommended tax measures for countries to implement to counter base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). Hybrid mismatch arrangements Hybrid mismatch arrangements arise when taxpayers exploit inconsistencies in the way that jurisdictions treat financial instruments and entities under their respective domestic law. The OECD’s BEPS package includes Action 2: Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements. Hybrid mismatch arrangements are prevalent worldwide and are an important part of the base erosion and profit shifting strategies used by multinational companies. If no action is taken by the international community to counter these types of arrangements they are likely to continue to be used to avoid worldwide taxation and drive economic inefficiencies and unfairly distributed tax burdens. New Zealand’s BEPS work The New Zealand Government has signalled a willingness to address BEPS issues and has taken tangible action in this regard. New Zealand is a supporter of the OECD/G20 BEPS project to address international tax avoidance and is advancing a number of measures that are OECD/G20 BEPS recommendations. In September 2016 the Government released a BEPS discussion document: Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements which proposed adoption of the OECD Action 2 recommendations in New Zealand and sought submissions on how that should be done. In March 2017 the Government released two further discussion documents: BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules; and BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance. As part of Budget 2017, the Government decided to proceed with tax law changes to implement one aspect of the hybrid rules. This change is to restrict the ability of New Zealand businesses to use double deductions of foreign hybrid entities to reduce their tax liabilities in New Zealand. This restriction is intended to apply to the most prevalent hybrid structure involving outbound investment by New Zealand based groups, which is the use of financing through Australian limited partnerships to achieve double deductions. At the same time, Cabinet noted that the reforms proposed in the BEPS documents would be progressed, subject to modification in consultation, for implementation from 1 July 2018. Cabinet also noted that officials are continuing to develop and consult on all aspects of the BEPS project and that Cabinet approval will be sought for final policy decisions later in 2017. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 4 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? New Zealand’s tax system New Zealand has a broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) taxation framework. This means that tax bases are broad and tax rates are kept as low as possible while remaining consistent with the Government’s distributional objectives. The BBLR framework also means that the tax system is not generally used to deliver incentives or encourage particular behaviours. Company tax and international rules The company tax system is designed to be a backstop for taxing the personal income of domestic investors. Company tax is deducted at 28%, but New Zealand based investors can claim imputation credits for tax paid by the company when the income is taxed upon distribution at the personal level. At the same time, the company tax is designed as a final tax on New Zealand-sourced income of foreign investors and foreign-owned companies earning New Zealand-sourced income. Having a consistent tax framework such as BBLR does not mean that tax changes are unnecessary. An ongoing policy challenge in the area of international tax is to ensure that multinational firms pay a fair and efficient amount of tax in New Zealand. Anti-avoidance rules and base protection measures are important part of ensuring that New Zealand collects an appropriate amount of tax on non-resident investment. At the same time, it is important that New Zealand continues to be a good place to base a business and that tax does not get in the way of this happening. New Zealand relies heavily on foreign direct investment (FDI) to fund domestic investment and, as such, the Government is committed to ensuring New Zealand remains an attractive place for non- residents to invest. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements Businesses can use hybrid mismatch arrangements to create tax advantages through exploiting inconsistencies in the way that jurisdictions treat financial instruments and entities under their respective domestic law. For example, using a hybrid entity or a foreign branch, a single expense may be deducted in two different jurisdictions, potentially reducing the tax payable on two different streams of income. Another example is a payment that is tax- deductible in one jurisdiction with no corresponding taxable income in the jurisdiction where the payment is received. However it is achieved, the result of a hybrid mismatch arrangement is less aggregate tax revenue collected in the jurisdictions to which the arrangement relates when compared with a straightforward arrangement that is seen consistently by both relevant countries. Hybrid mismatch arrangements also have the effect of subsidising international investment relative to domestic investment, which distorts the efficiency of global markets. Since releasing its final recommendations on hybrid mismatch arrangements, the OECD expanded the scope of BEPS Action 2 to include branch mismatches. Branch mismatch arrangements are a result of countries approaching the allocation of income and expenses between a branch and a head office in different ways. Branch mismatch arrangements can also result in a reduction in the overall taxation of a corporate group, so are similar in effect to hybrid mismatch arrangements. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 5 It is important to note that the policy problem is limited to circumstances when global tax is reduced as a result of a hybrid mismatch. This project does not address other mechanisms that taxpayers may use to lower their global tax liability, such as the use of low-tax jurisdictions to trap income. Hybrid mismatch arrangements in New Zealand New Zealand has a general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) that can, in some instances, neutralise the effects of a hybrid mismatch arrangement. However, the target of the GAAR is arrangements that avoid New Zealand tax. The arrangement must also do so in a manner that is outside Parliament’s contemplation; a classic indicator being that the arrangement gains the advantage in an artificial or contrived way. Although the use of a hybrid mismatch arrangement reduces the overall tax paid by the parties to the arrangement, it is often difficult to determine which country involved has lost tax revenue. Further, the use of a hybrid is not necessarily artificial or contrived in and of itself. Accordingly, the GAAR does not provide a comprehensive solution to counter the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements. New Zealand also has some specific rules in its domestic law that go some way to addressing particular recommendations made by the OECD in relation to hybrid mismatch arrangements. Inland Revenue is aware of a significant volume of hybrid mismatch arrangements involving New Zealand. For example, the amount of tax at issue in recent litigation for a prominent type of hybrid financial instrument was approximately $300 million (across multiple years). In relation to hybrid entities, deductions claimed in New Zealand that are attributable to the most prominent hybrid entity structure results in approximately $50 million less tax revenue for New Zealand per year. 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? Our analysis has been constrained by the scope and nature of the OECD’s work on hybrid mismatch arrangements. For reasons of international compatibility it would be unwise for New Zealand to design a largely unique set of hybrid mismatch rules that departs from the principles that the OECD has advocated for. This limitation has been mitigated to a certain extent by New Zealand’s ongoing involvement in the development of the OECD recommendations. Consistent with the OECD approach, the analysis has been focused on arrangements between related parties or where a hybrid mismatch has been created through a structured arrangement between unrelated parties. We have also chosen to restrict the policy thinking to cross-border activity. Purely domestic hybrid mismatches (some of which are contemplated by the OECD Action 2 final report) are outside the scope of this regulatory proposal. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? Stakeholders Stakeholders of this regulatory proposal are primarily taxpayers (typically multinational businesses that have hybrid mismatch arrangements) and tax advisors. The proposed rules will be applied to taxpayers’ affairs, while tax advisors will assist (taxpayer) clients as to the application of the proposed rules. The proposed rules affect only taxpayers with foreign Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 6 connections – that is, foreign-owned New Zealand taxpayers, and New Zealand-owned taxpayers with foreign operations. Another stakeholder of this regulatory proposal is the OECD, which is aiming to eradicate hybrid mismatch arrangements to the extent possible. This goal can only be achieved through countries adopting hybrid mismatch rules of some kind and neutralising the mismatches that arise when different sets of rules apply to the same transaction or entity. In addition, other countries that have enacted or are proposing to enact hybrid mismatch rules (for example, Australia and the United Kingdom) will be interested in the interaction between their own hybrid mismatch rules and any rules that New Zealand introduce into law. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is interested in the regulatory proposal to the extent that it affects bank regulatory capital. Submissions to discussion document There were 20 submissions made to the September 2016 Government discussion document. Submissions varied significantly in responding to the proposals both in general views and specific coverage. Some submitters were supportive of New Zealand taking action in line with the OECD hybrids package, subject to various provisos including that it was done in a co-ordinated fashion with other jurisdictions and/or that there should be concessions of some variety. However, a greater number of submitters were in favour of adopting a targeted or phased approach to the OECD hybrids package focused on countering hybrid arrangements that are of most concern to New Zealand. Submissions also covered a number of specific aspects of, and general concerns with, the proposals, including the complexity of the proposals and that New Zealand should not be in the first wave of countries adopting the proposals. Further and ongoing consultation We have engaged in approximately a dozen workshops (with the Corporate Taxpayers Group and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) and attended various other meetings with private sector submitters (including the New Zealand Bankers’ Association) in order to discuss specific design issues relating to hybrid mismatch arrangements. We have also consulted with officials representing Australia and the United Kingdom, as well as the OECD secretariat, on an ongoing basis to ensure that the proposed rules work as intended, and do not give rise to inadvertent double taxation or non-taxation. We have also consulted with the Reserve Bank. The Treasury has been heavily involved with the policy development process in their joint role with Inland Revenue as tax policy advisors for the Government. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 7 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? Four options were considered in the development of this regulatory proposal. These options are mutually exclusive and can be regarded as four points on a decision spectrum measuring how closely (if it all) New Zealand aligns itself with the OECD recommendations in dealing with hybrid mismatch arrangements. None of the options (with the exception of the status quo option) are non-regulatory options. This is because our judgment is that the policy problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements cannot be addressed without changing tax rules, and that is something that can only be done through the use of legislation (as per section 22(a) of the Constitution Act 1986). These options are what we consider other countries dealing with hybrid mismatch arrangements will consider in their policy development process. The United Kingdom and Australia can both be said to have chosen their own version of option 2. Some other countries have had rules to deal with hybrid mismatches that predate the OECD’s work in this area. Status quo: No action This option relies on New Zealand’s existing law (including the GAAR) to counter hybrid mismatch arrangements and avoids the increased compliance costs and administrative costs of the other options. The status quo option also contemplates that other countries have introduced or will introduce their own hybrid mismatch rules, some of which will neutralise hybrid mismatch arrangements relating to New Zealand. Option 1: Strict adoption of OECD recommendations The OECD recommendations as set out in its BEPS Action 2 report are a comprehensive set of principle-based rules to counteract all types of hybrid mismatch arrangements. Option 1 is to strictly adopt those recommendations as described by the OECD into New Zealand domestic law. This option would deal with the range of hybrid mismatch arrangements targeted by the OECD to the extent they are found in or affect New Zealand. It would have the advantage of interacting well with other countries that similarly adopt the OECD recommendations into their domestic law. Option 2: Tailored adoption of OECD recommendations Option 2 is to adopt the core principles of the OECD recommendations with suitable modifications and variations to take into account what is appropriate for the New Zealand context. This option bears close relation to Option 1 as it involves introducing OECD- consistent hybrid rules unless there is a compelling reason to depart from the OECD approach. Thus, this option would solve the policy problem while ensuring that particular New Zealand issues are addressed. Option 2 also recognises that there are some instances where New Zealand’s existing tax laws are sufficient (or can be made sufficient with relatively minor amendment) to achieve the effect intended by an OECD recommendation. Option 3: Targeted hybrid rules Option 3 is to introduce targeted hybrid rules that address only the significant hybrid mismatches that the Government is aware of. This option would solve the policy problem by addressing the current hybrid mismatch arrangements affecting New Zealand. It would avoid Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 8 enacting rules targeted at arrangements which are not currently seen in New Zealand. Consultation These four options were identified prior to consultation. The September 2016 discussion document proposed adoption of the OECD recommendations (options 1 and 2) and sought feedback on how that should be done. The document stated the Government’s alternative options as option 3 and maintaining the status quo and concluded that they were not the best way forward. Consultation has affected the nature of option 2 in particular and has been helpful for options analysis generally. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The generic tax policy process (GTPP) includes a framework for assessing key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals. This framework is consistent with the Government’s vision for the tax and social policy system, and is captured by the following criteria: • Efficiency of compliance – compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as possible • Efficiency of administration – administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible • Neutrality – the tax system should bias economic decisions as little as possible • Fairness and equity – similar taxpayers in similar circumstances should be treated in a similar way • Sustainability – the potential for tax evasion and avoidance should be minimised while keeping counteracting measures proportionate to risks involved In relation to this regulatory proposal, it would be difficult to achieve positive sustainability, neutrality and fairness impacts without some increase in compliance costs and so there are some trade-offs that were and continue to be considered. Through our consultation we have worked with stakeholders to minimise compliance costs as much as possible without sacrificing the benefits of the proposal. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? We ruled out designing a largely unique set of hybrid mismatch rules that departs from the principles that the OECD has advocated for. This is for reasons of international compatibility and to save compliance costs. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 9 Section 4: Impact Analysis Status quo: No action Option 1: Strict adoption Option 2: Tailored adoption Option 3: Targeted rules Efficiency of compliance 0 - - Option 1 has a significant compliance burden because some of the OECD recommendations as drafted would not mesh well with New Zealand’s existing tax laws. - Option 2 imposes increased compliance costs on taxpayers and advisors, but is focused on reducing those costs where possible. - Option 3 imposes increased compliance costs on taxpayers and advisors, but by its nature it reduces those costs in proposing rules that only address currently observed exploitation of hybrid mismatches. Efficiency of administration 0 0 We expect the additional costs to Inland Revenue of administering a tax system with hybrid mismatch rules to be balanced by less resources used disputing hybrid mismatch arrangements using the GAAR. 0 We expect the additional costs to Inland Revenue of administering a tax system with hybrid mismatch rules to be balanced by less resources used disputing hybrid mismatch arrangements using the GAAR. 0 We expect the additional costs to Inland Revenue of administering a tax system with hybrid mismatch rules to be balanced by less resources used disputing hybrid mismatch arrangements using the GAAR. Neutrality 0 ++ Option 1 will comprehensively remove the benefit of hybrid mismatch opportunities involving New Zealand. This will provide significant efficiency gains. ++ Option 2 will comprehensively remove the benefit of hybrid mismatch opportunities involving New Zealand. This will provide significant efficiency gains. + Option 3 will remove the tax benefit of currently observed hybrid mismatch opportunities involving New Zealand. This will likely provide some efficiency gains. However, other hybrid mismatch arrangement opportunities will remain available. This means that, depending on the extent to which taxpayers respond to an option 3 approach by simply moving into “uncovered” tax-efficient hybrid structures, there will still be some inefficient allocations of investment due to ongoing hybrid mismatch arrangements. Fairness and equity 0 + Option 1 has fairness and equity benefits as it ensures that taxpayers able to use hybrid mismatch arrangements cannot reduce their tax liability. + Option 2 has fairness and equity benefits as it ensures that taxpayers able to use hybrid mismatch arrangements cannot reduce their tax liability. + Option 3 has fairness and equity benefits as it ensures that taxpayers able to use currently observed hybrid mismatch arrangements cannot reduce their tax liability. However, this option’s fairness impact depends on the behavioural effects of introducing these rules to a greater extent than options 1 and 2. Sustainability 0 ++ Option 1 will remove current and future hybrid mismatch arrangement opportunities involving New Zealand. ++ Option 2 will remove current and future hybrid mismatch arrangement opportunities involving New Zealand. + Option 3 will remove currently known hybrid mismatch arrangement opportunities involving New Zealand. However, this option’s sustainability is limited. It will leave some hybrid mismatches unaddressed, which may be exploited at a later date by opportunistic taxpayers. Overall assessment Not recommended Not recommended Recommended Not recommended Key: ++ much better than doing nothing/the status quo + better than doing nothing/the status quo 0 about the same as doing nothing/the status quo - worse than doing nothing/the status quo - - much worse than doing nothing/the status quo Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 10 Section 5: Conclusions 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits? We consider that option 2 is the best option for addressing the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements. It is an internationally consistent, proactive option which delivers net benefits to New Zealand greater than that of the other options considered. Option 2 will improve the neutrality of New Zealand’s tax system. Businesses that are able to exploit hybrid mismatch arrangements can currently operate at lower effective tax rates when compared with other businesses. This can result in a ‘hybrid’ business crowding out more productive investment and making international investment decisions based on whether a mismatch is available rather than commercial grounds. In addition, the imposition of higher taxes elsewhere in order to make up lost tax revenue due to the use of hybrid mismatches is likely to be less efficient than imposing more moderate taxes across all economic actors. By eliminating the tax benefit of hybrid mismatch arrangements in a comprehensive way, these inefficiencies can be removed. In a related sense, option 2 will help to improve the equity and fairness of the New Zealand tax system. Unintended tax benefits that are streamed to some taxpayers who are able to take advantage of hybrid mismatches means that a greater tax burden must fall on other taxpayers (such as purely domestic firms) who do not have the hybrid mismatch opportunities that cross border businesses do. Accordingly, introducing rules to counter hybrid mismatch arrangements will restore some fairness to the tax system as those tax burdens will be shared more equally. Option 2 will also have revenue collection benefits. The New Zealand tax revenue loss caused by the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements is difficult to estimate because the full extent of arrangements involving New Zealand is unknown and because the behavioural effects of introducing hybrid mismatch rules are difficult to ascertain. However, the tax revenue at stake is significant in the cases that Inland Revenue is aware of. Importantly, the case for New Zealand to adopt the OECD recommendations is strengthened by the fact that other countries have enacted, or are proposing to enact, hybrid mismatch rules. This is because a hybrid mismatch arrangement involving a New Zealand counterparty may still be neutralised by the other country if they have a ‘secondary’ right to counteract under OECD principles. In that case, the tax benefit of the hybrid mismatch would be eliminated, but the tax collected would be by the counterparty country. In these circumstances, New Zealand would be better off having its own hybrid mismatch rules so that it can collect revenue when it has the priority to do so under the OECD recommendations. Whether New Zealand or the counterparty country collects any additional revenue as a result of implementing the rules depends on the actions taken by the affected business. Option 2 is ultimately a balance between the positive impacts described above and the trade- off compliance costs. It attempts to introduce a comprehensive set of rules which is adjusted for the New Zealand tax environment. For instance, we identified early in the policy development process that one of the OECD recommendations would not interact smoothly with New Zealand’s approach to the taxation of the foreign branches of New Zealand companies. The recommendation in question had to be modified under option 2 so that the tax treatment of a simple offshore branch structure of a New Zealand company (which is not part of the policy problem) would be unaffected by the introduction of the hybrid mismatch Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 11 rules. We have also recommended a delay to the effective date of an OECD-recommended rule which applies to what are known as “unstructured imported mismatches”. This rule could cause undue compliance costs if it was to come into effect at the same time as the other rules. Delaying its effective date until a significant number of other countries have introduced hybrid mismatch rules means the associated New Zealand-specific compliance costs will either disappear or will be no greater than the costs faced by a multinational group operating in those other countries. Accordingly, the compliance costs of the regulatory proposal are to be minimised to the extent possible, while still introducing a comprehensive set of rules to deal with the range of OECD-identified hybrid mismatches. This is where option 2 shows its advantage over option 1 which we view as having similar efficiency, fairness and revenue benefits. Option 1 would result in relatively higher compliance costs because the OECD recommendations are designed as a general set of best-practice rules and, in regards to their detail, are not necessarily optimal for individual countries such as New Zealand. When compared with option 1, option 2 ensures that the rules are workable and appropriate for the New Zealand tax environment. It is also important to note that the ongoing compliance costs relating to this regulatory issue are expected to be optional in the majority of cases. The proposed rules will apply to taxpayers who use a hybrid mismatch arrangement after the rules become effective. Those taxpayers will generally have the option of incurring one-off costs to restructure into non- hybrid arrangements and remove themselves from the scope of the proposed rules. Any higher tax payments resulting from the non-status quo options will make cross border investment less attractive for taxpayers using hybrid mismatch arrangements. However, these taxpayers should not be allowed to exploit hybrid mismatches to achieve a competitive advantage over taxpayers that do not use hybrid mismatch arrangements (such as purely domestic firms). Further, a significant number of New Zealand’s major investment partners have introduced or will introduce hybrid mismatch rules. Other countries adopting these rules means that in many cases the tax efficiency of hybrid mismatch arrangements in New Zealand will be negated through the operation of the other country’s rules on the counterparty, As a result, we believe that any impacts on inbound and outbound cross border investment from introducing hybrid mismatch rules in New Zealand will be low. The status quo option would involve the least complexity and lowest compliance costs. However, similar to the cross-border investment discussion above, taxpayers whose groups deal with New Zealand’s major trading partners that are adopting hybrid mismatch rules would have to understand the impact of those rules. The additional complexity of New Zealand having hybrid mismatch rules would therefore be lessened by the international momentum in this area. Option 3 is an option that was preferred by many submitters to the Government discussion document on hybrid mismatch arrangements. Submitters pointed out that many of the structures considered by the OECD to be problematic have not been seen in New Zealand and therefore do not need to be counteracted. They also argued that the OECD recommendations are complex and have the potential for overreach. We do not think a targeted approach would serve New Zealand well when compared with option 2. The OECD recommendations are a coherent package intending to deal to the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements exhaustively. Deliberately omitting aspects of the recommendations from New Zealand’s response may cause taxpayers to exploit those remaining hybrid mismatch opportunities (which may even be seen as tacitly blessed). To the extent that happens, the efficiency, revenue, and fairness benefits of option 3 would be eroded. In Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 12 addition, other countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia have introduced or are intending to introduce a relatively comprehensive set of hybrid mismatch rules. If New Zealand does the same it will ensure our rules are internationally comparable and that they interact well with the rules of other countries without significant compliance issues. By favouring option 2, we also have consulted extensively on the OECD recommendations and how they should best be introduced into New Zealand law. This consultation has enabled us to design suitable modifications to the OECD recommendations to reduce complexity and compliance costs, limit overreach, and in some cases, increase the efficiency of the outcomes. 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (e.g. ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (e.g. compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non-monetised impacts Evidence certainty (High, medium or low) Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Compliance costs: Increased costs from understanding the rules and applying them to taxpayers’ transactions and structures.

Low High Wider government Other parties Total Monetised Cost Tax payable Approximately $50 million per year on an ongoing basis Low\* Non-monetised Compliance costs Medium Medium Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 13 \*Note that the evidence for the $50 million figure is strong, but it is a conservative estimate made in light of the behavioural uncertainty associated with introducing hybrid mismatch rules together with the fact that the full extent of hybrid mismatch arrangements affecting New Zealand is unknown. The actual revenue generated from these reforms may therefore be higher, but this cannot be estimated with confidence. 5.3 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? As discussed above, allowing the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements is inefficient and unfair, as it results in uneven tax burdens across different businesses. This is an issue in itself, but it may also weaken taxpayer morale. The perception of unfairness that comes from the reported low corporate taxes paid by taxpayers who can take advantage of hybrid mismatch opportunities (and/or employ other BEPS strategies) is an important issue. This perception of unfairness undermines public confidence in the tax system and therefore the willingness of taxpayers to voluntarily comply with their own tax obligations. This integrity factor is difficult to assign to a particular set of stakeholders as it is something that is fundamental to the tax system itself. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’?

The preferred option will be given effect through amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. The bill, when introduced, will be accompanied by commentary in order to provide stakeholders with guidance as to the intended application of the provisions. Inland Revenue will also produce guidance on the enacted legislation in its Tax Information Bulletin (TIB). Once implemented, Inland Revenue will be responsible for ongoing operation and enforcement of the new rules. Inland Revenue has not identified any concerns with its ability to implement these reforms. The intended application date for most aspects of the regulatory proposal is for income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. The major exceptions are: • the proposed rule for “unstructured imported mismatch arrangements”, which we recommend be delayed until income years starting on or after 1 January 2020; and • the proposed rules applying to New Zealand “reverse hybrids”, which we recommend be delayed until income years starting on or after 1 April 2019. Another exception we recommend is a grandparenting rule that exempts from application of the rules (until the next call date) hybrid financial instruments issued by banks as regulatory capital (in Australian or New Zealand) to third party investors before the discussion document release date of September 2016. Some submitters on the discussion document argued that there needs to be sufficient lead-in time for these reforms to allow taxpayers to restructure their affairs if necessary. We consider an application date of 1 July 2018 (for most of the measures) to be sufficiently prospective when compared with the date of the discussion document release, which is when taxpayers should be regarded to be have been notified of the Government’s intention in this area, and the scheduled date of introduction of the relevant tax bill. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? We do not consider there to be many implementation risks for Inland Revenue. Audit staff will need to familiarise themselves with the proposed rules and how they operate in practice. As with any legislative proposal, there is the risk of technical drafting errors and unintended consequences. If and when these arise, they will be dealt with by remedial amendment. In practice, these reforms will mostly involve changes for taxpayers rather than Inland Revenue. There is a risk that some taxpayers may not be able to restructure their hybrid mismatch arrangements or understand the rules in time to comply with their new obligations. To manage this risk, we are minimising compliance costs where possible under our tailored adoption of the OECD recommendations. For example, and as mentioned above, we have delayed the application date of the unstructured imported mismatch rule contained in the OECD recommendations to acknowledge that it would be significantly more difficult and costly to comply with than the other rules if it applied at the outset. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 15 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of tax changes would take place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. Existing investigations functions for monitoring the behaviour of taxpayers will continue to be used for the proposed rules of this regulatory proposal. However, it may be difficult to assess the true impact of this regulatory proposal. This is because many taxpayers using hybrid mismatch arrangements may rearrange their affairs to fall outside the scope of the proposed rules. It will be difficult to measure the full extent of this behavioural effect. Inland Revenue are currently considering the appropriate level of information that should be collected to support the proposed rules for this regulatory proposal and for other BEPS proposals. This may be in the form of a disclosure statement made to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or it may form part of existing information gathering tools. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTPP process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. For example, a post- implementation workshop with stakeholders that participated in policy consultation sessions may be appropriate for these rules. In practice, any changes identified as necessary following enactment would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. If it became apparent that an aspect of the proposed rules is unworkable, or if the rules have created unintended consequences whether tax-related or otherwise, this would justify a review of all or part of the legislation.

Coversheet: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements Advising agencies Inland Revenue, The Treasury Decision sought This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final tax policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Proposing Ministers Steven Joyce (Finance) and Hon Judith Col/ins (Revenue) Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? - The policy problem is that taxpayers can reduce their worldwide tax liability through hybrid mismatch arrangements, which in most cases are deliberately designed to take advantage of the different characterisations countries use for financial instruments and entities. Hybrid mismatch arrangements (which include branch mismatches) result in less group taxation when compared with straightforward arrangements that are seen consistently by the relevant countries. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? A tailored adoption of the OECD's BEPS Action 2 recommendations will comprehensively deal with the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements while making modifications and variations to take into account what is appropriate for the New Zealand context. This tailored solution is sustainable and achieves gains to efficiency and fairness, while minimising compliance costs where possible. There will be a significant benefit in adopting a solution which is adopted by other countries and which will therefore be easier for multinational businesses to understand and comply with. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The Government will benefit in that new rules to counter hybrid mismatch arrangements are forecast to produce approximately $50 million per year on an ongoing basis. There are also efficiency and fairness benefits to this regulatory proposal which cannot be assigned to particular beneficiaries. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 1 Where do the costs fall? Taxpayers that use hybrid mismatch arrangements will face a medium level of compliance costs. These may be up-front, in the form of restructuring costs to transition to more straightforward (non-hybrid) arrangements, or they may be ongoing in the case of taxpayers that keep their hybrid mismatch arrangements in place and must apply new tax rules in order to comply with the law. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? There is some risk of taxpayer noncompliance with the proposed rules. However, the risk of taxpayers being inadvertently caught by the proposed rules has been minimised due to the design of the preferred regulatory option which seeks to exclude the most simple offshore structures (foreign branches). More generally, the impacts have been reduced through the proposals taking into account the New Zealand context and adjusting the OECD- recommended rules as needed. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government's 'Expectations for the design of regulatory systems'. There is no incompatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government's 'Expectations for the design of regulatory systems'. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? Not every type of hybrid arrangement that would be countered by the proposals has been observed in New Zealand. However, Inland Revenue is aware of some historic and current hybrid arrangements, and there is a very high likelihood there are others that relate to New Zealand and will be affected by this regulatory proposal. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the BEPS -hybrid mismatch arrangements Regulatory Impact Assessment prepared by Inland Revenue and associated supporting material and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer's comments on earlier versions of the Regulatory Impact Assessment have been incorporated into the final version. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 2 Impact Statement: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final tax policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Evidence of the problem Our analysis has been limited somewhat by our inability to assess the exact size of the hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements problem in New Zealand. Inland Revenue is aware of some mismatch arrangements, but the full extent of the problem is unknown. This is because evidence of the problem primarily comes from Inland Revenue's investigations staff. Under current law these staff do not routinely examine offshore tax treatment (and therefore arrangements that lower a group's worldwide tax obligations), which is an important part of identifying a hybrid mismatch arrangement under the proposals. Range of options considered Our analysis has been constrained by the scope and nature of the OECD's work on hybrid mismatch arrangements. For reasons of international compatibility it would be unwise for New Zealand to design a largely unique set of hybrid mismatch rules that departs from the principles that the OECD has advocated for. This limitation has been mitigated to a certain extent by New Zealand's ongoing involvement in the development of the OECD recommendations. Assumptions underpinning impact analysis The estimated impact of the options is dependent on the behavioural response of taxpayers to the introduction of some form of hybrid mismatch arrangement rules. Taxpayers may rearrange their affairs to fall outside the scope of any proposed rules, which will have flow-on effects as to efficiency, compliance costs and revenue implications. Beyond anecdotal information learned through consultation, it is difficult to assess the extent and nature of the behavioural response. Responsible Manager (signature and date): -..........\_\_\_ Paul Kilford Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 12July2017 Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 3 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? BEPS Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) refers to the aggressive tax planning strategies used by some multinational groups to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. This outcome is achieved by exploiting gaps and mismatches in countries' domestic tax rules to avoid tax. BEPS strategies distort investment decisions, allow multinationals to benefit from unintended competitive advantages over more compliant or domestic companies, and result in the loss of substantial corporate tax revenue. More fundamentally, the perceived unfairness resulting from BEPS jeopardises citizens' trust in the integrity of the tax system as a whole. In October 2015, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its final package of 15 recommended tax measures for countries to implement to counter base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). Hybrid mismatch arrangements Hybrid mismatch arrangements arise when taxpayers exploit inconsistencies in the way that jurisdictions treat financial instruments and entities under their respective domestic law. The OECD's BEPS package includes Action 2: Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements. Hybrid mismatch arrangements are prevalent worldwide and are an important part of the base erosion and profit shifting strategies used by multinational companies. If no action is taken by the international community to counter these types of arrangements they are likely to continue to be used to avoid worldwide taxation and drive economic inefficiencies and unfairly distributed tax burdens. New Zealand's BEPS work The New Zealand Government has signalled a willingness to address BEPS issues and has taken tangible action in this regard. New Zealand is a supporter of the OECD/G20 BEPS project to address international tax avoidance and is advancing a number of measures that are OECD/G20 BEPS recommendations. In September 2016 the Government released a BEPS discussion document: Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements which proposed adoption of the OECD Action 2 recommendations in New Zealand and sought submissions on how that should be done. In March 2017 the Government released two further discussion documents: BEPS - Strengthening our interest limitation rules; and BEPS -Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance. As part of Budget 2017, the Government decided to proceed with tax law changes to implement one aspect of the hybrid rules. This change is to restrict the ability of New Zealand businesses to use double deductions of foreign hybrid entities to reduce their tax liabilities in New Zealand. This restriction is intended to apply to the most prevalent hybrid structure involving outbound investment by New Zealand based groups, which is the use of financing through Australian limited partnerships to achieve double deductions. At the same time, Cabinet noted that the reforms proposed in the BEPS documents would be progressed, subject to modification in consultation, for implementation from 1 July 2018. Cabinet also noted that officials are continuing to develop and consult on all aspects of the BEPS project and that Cabinet approval will be sought for final policy decisions later in 2017. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS • Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 4 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? New Zealand's tax system New Zealand has a broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) taxation framework. This means that tax bases are broad and tax rates are kept as low as possible while remaining consistent with the Government's distributional objectives. The BBLR framework also means that the tax system is not generally used to deliver incentives or encourage particular behaviours. Company tax and international rules The company tax system is designed to be a backstop for taxing the personal income of domestic investors. Company tax is deducted at 28%, but New Zealand based investors can claim imputation credits for tax paid by the company when the income is taxed upon distribution at the personal level. At the same time, the company tax is designed as a final tax on New Zealand-sourced income of foreign investors and foreign-owned companies earning New Zealand-sourced income. Having a consistent tax framework such as BBLR does not mean that tax changes are unnecessary. An ongoing policy challenge in the area of international tax is to ensure that multinational firms pay a fair and efficient amount of tax in New Zealand. Anti-avoidance rules and base protection measures are important part of ensuring that New Zealand collects an appropriate amount of tax on non-resident investment. At the same time, it is important that New Zealand continues to be a good place to base a business and that tax does not get in the way of this happening. New Zealand relies heavily on foreign direct investment (FDI) to fund domestic investment and, as such, the Government is committed to ensuring New Zealand remains an attractive place for non- residents to invest. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements Businesses can use hybrid mismatch arrangements to create tax advantages through exploiting inconsistencies in the way that jurisdictions treat financial instruments and entities under their respective domestic law. For example, using a hybrid entity or a foreign branch, a single expense may be deducted in two different jurisdictions, potentially reducing the tax payable on two different streams of income. Another example is a payment that is tax- deductible in one jurisdiction with no corresponding taxable income in the jurisdiction where the payment is received. However it is achieved, the result of a hybrid mismatch arrangement is less aggregate tax revenue collected in the jurisdictions to which the arrangement relates when compared with a straightforward arrangement that is seen consistently by both relevant countries. Hybrid mismatch arrangements also have the effect of subsidising international investment relative to domestic investment, which distorts the efficiency of global markets. Since releasing its final recommendations on hybrid mismatch arrangements, the OECD expanded the scope of BEPS Action 2 to include branch mismatches. Branch mismatch arrangements are a result of countries approaching the allocation of income and expenses between a branch and a head office in different ways. Branch mismatch arrangements can also result in a reduction in the overall taxation of a corporate group, so are similar in effect to hybrid mismatch arrangements. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 5 lt is important to note that the policy problem is limited to circumstances when global tax is reduced as a result of a hybrid mismatch. This project does not address other mechanisms that taxpayers may use to lower their global tax liability, such as the use of low-tax jurisdictions to trap income. Hybrid mismatch arrangements in New Zealand New Zealand has a general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) that can, in some instances, neutralise the effects of a hybrid mismatch arrangement. However, the target of the GAAR is arrangements that avoid New Zealand tax. The arrangement must also do so in a manner that is outside Parliament's contemplation; a classic indicator being that the arrangement gains the advantage in an artificial or contrived way. Although the use of a hybrid mismatch arrangement reduces the overall tax paid by the parties to the arrangement, it is often difficult to determine which country involved has lost tax revenue. Further, the use of a hybrid is not necessarily artificial or contrived in and of itself. Accordingly, the GAAR does not provide a comprehensive solution to counter the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements. New Zealand also has some specific rules in its domestic law that go some way to addressing particular recommendations made by the OECD in relation to hybrid mismatch arrangements. Inland Revenue is aware of a significant volume of hybrid mismatch arrangements involving New Zealand. For example, the amount of tax at issue in recent litigation for a prominent type of hybrid financial instrument was approximately $300 million (across multiple years). In relation to hybrid entities, deductions claimed in New Zealand that are attributable to the most prominent hybrid entity structure results in approximately $50 million less tax revenue for New Zealand per year. 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? Our analysis has been constrained by the scope and nature of the OECD's work on hybrid mismatch arrangements. For reasons of international compatibility it would be unwise for New Zealand to design a largely unique set of hybrid mismatch rules that departs from the principles that the OECD has advocated for. This limitation has been mitigated to a certain extent by New Zealand's ongoing involvement in the development of the OECD recommendations. Consistent with the OECD approach, the analysis has been focused on arrangements between related parties or where a hybrid mismatch has been created through a structured arrangement between unrelated parties. We have also chosen to restrict the policy thinking to cross-border activity. Purely domestic hybrid mismatches (some of which are contemplated by the OECD Action 2 final report) are outside the scope of this regulatory proposal. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? Stakeholders Stakeholders of this regulatory proposal are primarily taxpayers (typically multinational businesses that have hybrid mismatch arrangements) and tax advisors. The proposed rules will be applied to taxpayers' affairs, while tax advisors will assist (taxpayer) clients as to the application of the proposed rules. The proposed rules affect only taxpayers with foreign Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 6 connections - that is, foreign-owned New Zealand taxpayers , and New Zealand-owned taxpayers with foreign operations. Another stakeholder of this regulatory proposal is the OECD, which is aiming to eradicate hybrid mismatch arrangements to the extent possible. This goal can only be achieved through countries adopting hybrid mismatch rules of some kind and neutralising the mismatches that arise when different sets of rules apply to the same transaction or entity . In addition, other countries that have enacted or are proposing to enact hybrid mismatch rules (for example , Australia and the United Kingdom) will be interested in the interaction between their own hybrid mismatch rules and any rules that New Zealand introduce into law . The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is interested in the regulatory proposal to the extent that it affects bank regulatory capital. Submissions to discussion document There were 20 submissions made to the September 2016 Government discussion document. Submissions varied significantly in responding to the proposals both in general views and specific coverage. Some submitters were supportive of New Zealand taking action in line with the OECD hybrids package , subject to various provisos including that it was done in a co-ordinated fashion with other jurisdictions and/or that there should be concessions of some variety. However, a greater number of submitters were in favour of adopting a targeted or phased approach to the OECD hybrids package focused on countering hybrid arrangements that are of most concern to New Zealand. Submissions also covered a number of specific aspects of, and general concerns with, the proposals, including the complexity of the proposals and that New Zealand should not be in the first wave of countries adopting the proposals. Further and ongoing consultation We have engaged in approximately a dozen workshops (with the Corporate Taxpayers Group and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) and attended various other meetings with private sector submitters (including the New Zealand Bankers ' Association) in order to discuss specific design issues relating to hybrid mismatch arrangements. We have also consulted with officials representing Australia and the United Kingdom, as well as the OECD secretariat, on an ongoing basis to ensure that the proposed rules work as intended , and do not give rise to inadvertent double taxation or non-taxation . We have also consulted with the Reserve Bank. The Treasury has been heavily involved with the policy development process in their joint role with Inland Revenue as tax policy advisors for the Government. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 7 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? Four options were considered in the development of this regulatory proposal. These options are mutually exclusive and can be regarded as four points on a decision spectrum measuring how closely (if it all) New Zealand aligns itself with the OECD recommendations in dealing with hybrid mismatch arrangements. None of the options (with the exception of the status quo option) are non-regulatory opt ions. This is because our judgment is that the policy problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements cannot be addressed without changing tax rules, and that is something that can only be done through the use of legislation (as per section 22(a) of the Constitution Act 1986). These options are what we consider other countries dealing with hybrid mismatch arrangements will consider in their policy development process. The United Kingdom and Australia can both be said to have chosen their own version of option 2. Some other countries have had rules to deal with hybrid mismatches that predate the OECD 's work in this area. Status quo: No action This option relies on New Zealand's existing law (including the GAAR) to counter hybrid mismatch arrangements and avoids the increased compliance costs and administrative costs of the other options. The status quo option also contemplates that other countries have introduced or will introduce their own hybrid mismatch rules, some of which will neutralise hybrid mismatch arrangements relating to New Zealand. Option 1: Strict adoption of OECD recommendations The OECD recommendations as set out in its BEPS Action 2 report are a comprehensive set of principle-based rules to counteract all types of hybrid mismatch arrangements. Option 1 is to strictly adopt those recommendations as described by the OECD into New Zealand domestic law. This option would deal with the range of hybrid mismatch arrangements targeted by the OECD to the extent they are found in or affect New Zealand . lt would have the advantage of interacting well with other countries that similarly adopt the OECD recommendations into their domestic law. Option 2: Tailored adoption of OECD recommendations Option 2 is to adopt the core principles of the OECD recommendations with suitable modifications and variations to take into account what is appropriate for the New Zealand context. This option bears close relation to Option 1 as it involves introducing OECD- consistent hybrid rules unless there is a compelling reason to depart from the OECD approach. Thus, this option would solve the policy problem while ensuring that particular New Zealand issues are addressed . Option 2 also recognises that there are some instances where New Zealand's existing tax laws are sufficient (or can be made sufficient with relatively minor amendment) to achieve the effect intended by an OECD recommendation . Option 3: Targeted hybrid rules Option 3 is to introduce targeted hybrid rules that address only the significant hybrid mismatches that the Government is aware of. This option would solve the policy problem by addressing the current hybrid mismatch arrangements affecting New Zealand. lt would avoid Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 8 enacting rules targeted at arrangements which are not currently seen in New Zealand. Consultation These four options were identified prior to consultation. The September 2016 discussion document proposed adoption of the OECD recommendations (options 1 and 2) and sought feedback on how that should be done. The document stated the Government's alternative options as option 3 and maintaining the status quo and concluded that they were not the best way forward. Consultation has affected the nature of option 2 in particular and has been helpful for options analysis generally. ,-------~-- 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The generic tax policy process (GTPP) includes a framework for assessing key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals. This framework is consistent with the Government's vision for the tax and social policy system, and is captured by the following criteria: • Efficiency of compliance -compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as possible • Efficiency of administration -administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible • Neutrality-the tax system should bias economic decisions as little as possible • Fairness and equity-similar taxpayers in similar circumstances should be treated in a similar way • Sustainability-the potential for tax evasion and avoidance should be minimised while keeping counteracting measures proportionate to risks involved In relation to this regulatory proposal, it would be difficult to achieve positive sustainability, neutrality and fairness impacts without some increase in compliance costs and so there are some trade-offs that were and continue to be considered. Through our consultation we have worked with stakeholders to minimise compliance costs as much as possible without sacrificing the benefits of the proposal. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? We ruled out designing a largely unique set of hybrid mismatch rules that departs from the principles that the OECD has advocated for. This is for reasons of international compatibility and to save compliance costs.

Recommended Not recommended Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS • Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 10 Section 5: Conclusions 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits? We consider that option 2 is the best option for addressing the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements. lt is an internationally consistent, proactive option which delivers net benefits to New Zealand greater than that of the other options considered. Option 2 will improve the neutrality of New Zealand's tax system. Businesses that are able to exploit hybrid mismatch arrangements can currently operate at lower effective tax rates when compared with other businesses. This can result in a 'hybrid' business crowding out more productive investment and making international investment decisions based on whether a mismatch is available rather than commercial grounds. In addition, the imposition of higher taxes elsewhere in order to make up lost tax revenue due to the use of hybrid mismatches is likely to be less efficient than imposing more moderate taxes across all economic actors. By eliminating the tax benefit of hybrid mismatch arrangements in a comprehensive way, these inefficiencies can be removed. In a related sense, option 2 will help to improve the equity and fairness of the New Zealand tax system. Unintended tax benefits that are streamed to some taxpayers who are able to take advantage of hybrid mismatches means that a greater tax burden must fall on other taxpayers (such as purely domestic firms) who do not have the hybrid mismatch opportunities that cross border businesses do. Accordingly, introducing rules to counter hybrid mismatch arrangements will restore some fairness to the tax system as those tax burdens will be shared more equally. Option 2 will also have revenue collection benefits. The New Zealand tax revenue loss caused by the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements is difficult to estimate because the full extent of arrangements involving New Zealand is unknown and because the behavioural effects of introducing hybrid mismatch rules are difficult to ascertain. However, the tax revenue at stake is significant in the cases that Inland Revenue is aware of. Importantly, the case for New Zealand to adopt the OECD recommendations is strengthened by the fact that other countries have enacted, or are proposing to enact, hybrid mismatch rules. This is because a hybrid mismatch arrangement involving a New Zealand counterparty may still be neutralised by the other country if they have a 'secondary' right to counteract under OECD principles. In that case, the tax benefit of the hybrid mismatch would be eliminated, but the tax collected would be by the counterparty country. In these circumstances, New Zealand would be better off having its own hybrid mismatch rules so that it can collect revenue when it has the priority to do so under the OECD recommendations. Whether New Zealand or the counterparty country collects any additional revenue as a result of implementing the rules depends on the actions taken by the affected business. Option 2 is ultimately a balance between the positive impacts described above and the trade- off compliance costs. lt attempts to introduce a comprehensive set of rules which is adjusted for the New Zealand tax environment. For instance, we identified early in the policy development process that one of the OECD recommendations would not interact smoothly with New Zealand's approach to the taxation of the foreign branches of New Zealand companies. The recommendation in question had to be modified under option 2 so that the tax treatment of a simple offshore branch structure of a New Zealand company (which is not part of the policy problem) would be unaffected by the introduction of the hybrid mismatch Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 11 rules. We have also recommended a delay to the effective date of an OECD-recommended rule which applies to what are known as "unstructured imported mismatches". This rule could cause undue compliance costs if it was to come into effect at the same time as the other rules. Delaying its effective date until a significant number of other countries have introduced hybrid mismatch rules means the associated New Zealand-specific compliance costs will either disappear or will be no greater than the costs faced by a multinational group operating in those other countries. Accordingly, the compliance costs of the regulatory proposal are to be minimised to the extent possible, while still introducing a comprehensive set of rules to deal with the range of OECD-identified hybrid mismatches. This is where option 2 shows its advantage over option 1 which we view as having similar efficiency, fairness and revenue benefits. Option 1 would result in relatively higher compliance costs because the OECD recommendations are designed as a general set of best-practice rules and, in regards to their detail, are not necessarily optimal for individual countries such as New Zealand. When compared with option 1, option 2 ensures that the rules are workable and appropriate for the New Zealand tax environment. lt is also important to note that the ongoing compliance costs relating to this regulatory issue are expected to be optional in the majority of cases. The proposed rules will apply to taxpayers who use a hybrid mismatch arrangement after the rules become effective. Those taxpayers will generally have the option of incurring one-off costs to restructure into non- hybrid arrangements and remove themselves from the scope of the proposed rules. Any higher tax payments resulting from the non-status quo options will make cross border investment less attractive for taxpayers using hybrid mismatch arrangements. However, these taxpayers should not be allowed to exploit hybrid mismatches to achieve a competitive advantage over taxpayers that do not use hybrid mismatch arrangements (such as purely domestic firms). Further, a significant number of New Zealand's major investment partners have introduced or will introduce hybrid mismatch rules. Other countries adopting these rules means that in many cases the tax efficiency of hybrid mismatch arrangements in New Zealand will be negated through the operation of the other country's rules on the counterparty, As a result, we believe that any impacts on inbound and outbound cross border investment from introducing hybrid mismatch rules in New Zealand will be low. The status quo option would involve the least complexity and lowest compliance costs. However, similar to the cross-border investment discussion above, taxpayers whose groups deal with New Zealand's major trading partners that are adopting hybrid mismatch rules would have to understand the impact of those rules. The additional complexity of New Zealand having hybrid mismatch rules would therefore be lessened by the international momentum in this area. Option 3 is an option that was preferred by many submitters to the Government discussion document on hybrid mismatch arrangements. Submitters pointed out that many of the structures considered by the OECD to be problematic have not been seen in New Zealand and therefore do not need to be counteracted. They also argued that the OECD recommendations are complex and have the potential for overreach. We do not think a targeted approach would serve New Zealand well when compared with option 2. The OECD recommendations are a coherent package intending to deal to the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements exhaustively. Deliberately omitting aspects of the recommendations from New Zealand's response may cause taxpayers to exploit those remaining hybrid mismatch opportunities (which may even be seen as tacitly blessed). To the extent that happens, the efficiency, revenue, and fairness benefits of option 3 would be eroded. In Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS & Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 12 addition, other countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia have introduced or are intending to introduce a relatively comprehensive set of hybrid mismatch rules. If New Zealand does the same it will ensure our rules are internationally comparable and that they interact well with the rules of other countries without significant compliance issues. By favouring option 2, we also have consulted extensively on the OECD recommendations and how they should best be introduced into New Zealand law. This consultation has enabled us to design suitable modifications to the OECD recommendations to reduce complexity and compliance costs, limit overreach, and in some cases, increase the efficiency of the outcomes. \] 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected parties I Comment: nature of cost or Impact Evidence (identify) benefit (e.g. ongoing, one-off), $m present value, certainty evidence and assumption (e.g. for monetised (High, compliance rates), risks impacts; high, medium or medium or low for low) non-monetised impacts Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Compliance costs: Increased costs Medium Medium from understanding the rules and applying them to taxpayers' transactions and structures.

The actual revenue generated from these reforms may therefore be higher, but this cannot be estimated with confidence. 5.3 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? As discussed above, allowing the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements is inefficient and unfair, as it results in uneven tax burdens across different businesses . This is an issue in itself, but it may also weaken taxpayer morale. The perception of unfairness that comes from the reported low corporate taxes paid by taxpayers who can take advantage of hybrid mismatch opportunities (and/or employ other BEPS strategies) is an important issue. This perception of unfairness undermines public confidence in the tax system and therefore the willingness of taxpayers to voluntarily comply with their own tax obligations. This integrity factor is difficult to assign to a particular set of stakeholders as it is something that is fundamental to the tax system itself. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government's 'Expectations for the design of regulatory systems'? Yes, option 2 (tailored adoption of OECD recommendations) conforms to the expectations for the design of regulatory systems document. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS- Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 14 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? The preferred option will be given effect through amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. The bill, when introduced, will be accompanied by commentary in order to provide stakeholders with guidance as to the intended application of the provisions. Inland Revenue will also produce guidance on the enacted legislation in its Tax Information Bulletin (TIB). Once implemented, Inland Revenue will be responsible for ongoing operation and enforcement of the new rules. Inland Revenue has not identified any concerns with its ability to implement these reforms. The intended application date for most aspects of the regulatory proposal is for income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. The major exceptions are: • the proposed rule for "unstructured imported mismatch arrangements", which we recommend be delayed until income years starting on or after 1 January 2020; and • the proposed rules applying to New Zealand "reverse hybrids", which we recommend be delayed until income years starting on or after 1 April 2019. Another exception we recommend is a grandparenting rule that exempts from application of the rules (until the next call date) hybrid financial instruments issued by banks as regulatory capital (in Australian or New Zealand) to third party investors before the discussion document release date of September 2016. Some submitters on the discussion document argued that there needs to be sufficient lead-in time for these reforms to allow taxpayers to restructure their affairs if necessary. We consider an application date of 1 July 2018 (for most of the measures) to be sufficiently prospective when compared with the date of the discussion document release, which is when taxpayers should be regarded to be have been notified of the Government's intention in this area, and the scheduled date of introduction of the relevant tax bill. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? We do not consider there to be many implementation risks for Inland Revenue. Audit staff will need to familiarise themselves with the proposed rules and how they operate in practice. As with any legislative proposal, there is the risk of technical drafting errors and unintended consequences. If and when these arise, they will be dealt with by remedial amendment. In practice, these reforms will mostly involve changes for taxpayers rather than Inland Revenue. There is a risk that some taxpayers may not be able to restructure their hybrid mismatch arrangements or understand the rules in time to comply with their new obligations. To manage this risk, we are minimising compliance costs where possible under our tailored adoption of the OECD recommendations. For example, and as mentioned above, we have delayed the application date of the unstructured imported mismatch rule contained in the OECD recommendations to acknowledge that it would be significantly more difficult and costly to comply with than the other rules if it applied at the outset. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-Hybrid mismatch arrangements 1 15 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of tax changes would take place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. Existing investigations functions for monitoring the behaviour of taxpayers will continue to be used for the proposed rules of this regulatory proposal. However, it may be difficult to assess the true impact of this regulatory proposal. This is because many taxpayers using hybrid mismatch arrangements may rearrange their affairs to fall outside the scope of the proposed rules. lt will be difficult to measure the full extent of this behavioural effect. Inland Revenue are currently considering the appropriate level of information that should be collected to support the proposed rules for this regulatory proposal and for other BEPS proposals. This may be in the form of a disclosure statement made to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or it may form part of existing information gathering tools. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTPP process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. For example, a post- implementation workshop with stakeholders that participated in policy consultation sessions may be appropriate for these rules. In practice, any changes identified as necessary following enactment would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. If it became apparent that an aspect of the proposed rules is unworkable, or if the rules have created unintended consequences whether tax-related or otherwise, this would justify a review of all or part of the legislation.

1 OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 28 October 2016 Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLNGTON 6140 Dear David Re: Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements – a Government discussion document (“the DD”) This is a submission on the above Discussion Document. Submission 1 Foreign trusts should not be reviewed as part of the review of hybrid instruments As you are aware the Government established in April 2016 an Inquiry under section 69(3) of the Inquiries Act 2013 constituting one person, Mr John Shewan. The Shewan Inquiry sought and received submissions on its terms of reference which were broad and policy in nature. The Inquiry reported in June 2016 with detailed recommendations which concluded that New Zealand should retain its existing tax laws relating to foreign trusts but ensure adequate information disclosure. The Government accepted those recommendations. Our first submission is that there should be no additional changes to the tax regime for foreign trusts given the Government’s acceptance of the Shewan Inquiry’s findings. Should the Government now wish to revisit this, there should be a detailed analysis of the Shewan Inquiry and which changes should be made that are inconsistent with that Inquiry. Para 7.29 of the DD Paragraph 7.29 of the DD states the following: There is also an argument in favour of New Zealand taxing the foreign source trustee income of a New Zealand trust to the extent that that income is not taxed in any other country. The non-taxation of foreign-sourced trustee income of a New Zealand foreign trust is premised on the non-residence of the settlor. The trustee income is, in a sense, allocated to the non-resident settlor for the purpose of determining New Olivershaw Limited Level 1, Aviation House 12 Johnston Street WELLINGTON PO Box 30 504 Lower Hutt 5040 Phone: 04 577 2700 Fax: 04 577 2701 #003 OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS Hybrids Page 2 Zealand’s right to tax. Accordingly, if the settlor is in the same control group as the trust, it would seem logical to apply Recommendation 5.2 to tax the trustee income, if it is not taxed to the settlor or any other person. Recommendation 5.2 of the OECD 2015 Final Report “Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements” (the OECD report”) states: A reverse hybrid should be treated as a resident taxpayer in the establishment jurisdiction if the income of the reverse hybrid is not brought within the charge to taxation under the laws of the establishment jurisdiction and the accrued income of a non-resident investor in the same control group as the reverse hybrid is not brought within the charge to taxation under the laws of the investor jurisdiction. A reverse hybrid is defined in recommendation 4 of the OECD report and provides: A reverse hybrid is any person that is treated as a separate entity by an investor and as transparent under the laws of the establishment jurisdiction. Submission 2 A foreign trust is not a reverse hybrid A reverse hybrid is defined in recommendation 4 as stated above. A foreign trust is not transparent for New Zealand tax purposes. Under New Zealand tax legislation, a foreign trust is exempt from New Zealand tax on foreign sourced income. First, this is not transparent, it is not a flow through vehicle. Second, a foreign trust is taxed on New Zealand sourced income. It is not uncommon that a foreign trust has New Zealand sourced income and therefore it has New Zealand tax liabilities. This is clearly not transparent. Paragraph 7.29 above states that “the trustee income is, in a sense, allocated to the non- resident settlor for the purpose of determining New Zealand’s right to tax”. As noted immediately above, this is wrong. A foreign trust has both exempt income and taxable income, namely exempt foreign income and taxable New Zealand income. This is not uncommon as many New Zealand entities have both exempt income and taxable income, clearly they should not be considered to be transparent simply due to having exempt income. For example, New Zealand corporates have exempt income being most dividends received from foreign companies. If a foreign trust is a reverse hybrid, applying the same logic, all New Zealand corporates should also be treated as a reverse hybrid, clearly such an outcome is wrong. Where a foreign trust earns New Zealand source income, the trustees are taxed on that income. Given the above, no changes should be made to the existing tax treatment of foreign trusts in New Zealand. The following submissions points are made for completeness as we do not believe a New Zealand foreign trust is a reverse hybrid. OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS Hybrids Page 3 Submission 3 Settlor being part of a control group As stated in paragraph 7.29, the reverse hybrid rules would only apply where the settlor is in the same control group as the trust. We also note that example 11.1 of the OECD report states the following (emphasis added): As settlor of the trust, A has the sole right, under the terms of the trust deed, to appoint trustees, which is one of the enumerated voting rights described in the related party rules. The fact that the constitutional documents (in this case the trust deed) do not give A the power to authorise distributions or alter the terms of the trust, does not affect the conclusion that A holds 100% of the voting interests in the trust. Voting rights is defined as (recommendation 12 of the OECD report) Voting rights means the right to participate in any decision-making concerning a distribution, a change to the constitution or the appointment of a director. As an initial comment we cannot see how having the right to appoint trustees give voting rights in a trust, let alone how any conclusion can be made that that should be 100% of the voting interests. The above OCED comments are not consistent and demonstrate the issues with this. That is, the voting rights refer to the ability to participate in any decision making concerning a distribution, yet example 11.1 states that with the settlor not having any power to authorise distributions does not affect the conclusion that the settlor holds 100% of the voting interests. Clearly, the trustee(s) has (have) the power to make distributions, and hence it is impossible to conclude that someone who has no such power has 100% of the voting interests. Further complexities will obviously arise where there more than one settlor or where a/the settlor is deceased. For these reasons we cannot see any viable method of applying the control test to most trusts. While we do not believe trusts are transparent, if they were, we can see no basis for concluding that the trust and settlor are in the same control group and therefore conclude that it is not possible to apply the reverse hybrid rules. Submission 4 – Applying reverse hybrid based on settlor home country tax jurisdiction rules The DD concludes “if the settlor is in the same control group as the trust, it would seem logical to apply Recommendation 5.2 to tax the trustee income, if it is not taxed to the settlor or any other person”. It certainly does not seem logical to tax trustee income if the settlor is not taxed. The settlor may have no beneficial interest in the trust, hence the tax treatment of the settlor seems irrelevant. For example, there will be situations where settlors are deceased. Presumably they are not then taxed. This should not result in the trustee being taxed. OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS Hybrids Page 4 On the face of it, it seems more logical to consider the tax treatment of the beneficiaries as they will ultimately be the taxpayers who will be taxed should any such amounts be taxed. That then raises the issue of which beneficiary? Most foreign trusts will have a number of beneficiaries, most of whom may be discretionary, and many will not know they are beneficiaries. Some beneficiaries will be charitable and therefore exempt from tax. We conclude that it is simply not possible to tax trustees based on what the tax treatment is of the settlor or/and beneficiaries. Submission 5 Basis of taxation The DD by implication seems to conclude that given, the tax treatment of New Zealand foreign trusts, they are reverse hybrid instruments. For the reasons noted above, we do not believe this is correct.  Foreign trusts will not be hybrid entities if the country that the settlor/beneficiaries reside in is a country which does not tax foreign income (regardless of the nature of the New Zealand foreign trust).  Foreign trusts that hold equity instruments in foreign operating companies are unlikely to give rise to any tax even if the settlor or beneficiary held those shares directly.  Many foreign trusts do not earn income (profits are simply derived by companies whose shares are held by the foreign trust), when these companies pay dividends to the foreign trust, the foreign trust may make distributions. Many jurisdictions will tax such distributions. It is difficult to conclude why the foreign trust should be seen as a reverse hybrid in such circumstances.  Applying New Zealand tax legislation could result in the trustee having NZ taxable income (say under the FDR regime) whereas there is no foreign tax under this basis (i.e. FDR regime) to the beneficiaries or settlor, they are likely to be taxed (if there is taxation) simply on distributions. This is not a reverse hybrid.  A foreign trust that derives New Zealand source income will be taxable on that income in New Zealand. Submission 6 Compliance costs The compliance costs of determining whether the reverse hybrid rules apply are likely to be substantial and in most cases no tax will be payable. We refer to the Shewan Inquiry which concluded that our tax settings are appropriate however improvements should be made to the disclosure regime. We concur with that conclusion and note that this is being progressed by the government. We see no benefit in now applying the reverse hybrid rules, noting that we do not think they should apply in any event. Conclusion The proposals in the DD affecting trusts are very unclear to the extent that it is not possible to provide useful detailed technical issues. Our fundamental point is that the New Zealand tax treatment of trusts is to treat them as opaque entities (not transparent entities). On that basis OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS Hybrids Page 5 they should not be hybrid instruments and should be outside the ambit of this review which should be limited to its subject matter – hybrid entities and instruments. We note a wider concern which is that the DD seems to be extending the ambit of the hybrid review beyond the already very wide ambit adopted by the OECD. This is reflected in paragraph 7.29 with respect to foreign trusts. The OECD report is explicitly limited to what it describes as deductible/ non-income mismatches in the tax treatment of financial instruments (defined as debt, equity or derivatives of debt and/or equity instruments) and to payments under financial transactions. Thus paragraph 11 states: The hybrid mismatch rules focus on payments and whether the nature of that payment gives rise to a deduction for the payer and ordinary income for the payee. Rules that entitle taxpayers to a unilateral tax deduction for invested equity without requiring the taxpayer to make a payment, such as regimes that grant deemed interest deductions for equity capital, are economically closer to a tax exemption or similar taxpayer specific concessions and do not produce a mismatch in tax outcomes in the sense contemplated Action 2 \[the hybrids project\]. Paragraph 12 notes that mismatches in tax treatment that are attributable to differences in the measurement of the value of payments rather than the character of the payment, can “generally be ignored for the purposes of the hybrid mismatch rules”. An example given is where one country provides a deduction for foreign exchange fluctuations but the other country does not tax such income. Example 1.25 gives the example of a lease treated as a finance lease by the lessor (with taxable income only to the extent of deemed interest) and as an operating lease by the lessee (with deductions for all the payments). The conclusion reached is that the hybrid mismatch rules should not apply to such an arrangement because the country treating the instrument as a financial instrument taxes all the deemed interest as income. This is the case even though the lessee obtains deductions exceeding the interest income taxed to the lessor. It is clear from the above that the OECD report does no intend the hybrid rules to operate so as to tax income or limit deductions just because an entity is tax exempt or exempt on part of its income. It accepts that an entity may get a deduction for equity (deemed interest) that may not be taxable in the hands of an offshore owner. The equity deduction may offset tax on foreign income the entity derives from another party for whom the payment is tax deductible. The report seems to accept that this does not give rise to a tax mismatch that hybrid rules should target. The report notes that a lease may be treated as a finance lease in one country and an operating lease in another giving rise to deductions that exceed the amount returned by the lessor as income but the hybrid rules will not prevent this. In other words the OECD report is sensibly not attempting to use the hybrid rules to force the harmonisation of the tax rules of every country in the world. The OECD report recognises that the hybrid rules will not prevent international transactions that can result in lower overall tax than might be the case if all transactions were limited to one tax jurisdiction. In contrast to the OECD positon the DD, at least with respect to its comments on foreign trusts in paragraph 7.29, seems to suggest that the hybrid rules should be used to, in effect, OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS Hybrids Page 6 remove any tax exemptions that New Zealand might apply or any New Zealand tax law that might produce an outcome different to that which would apply if the laws of some other country applied. The suggestions in the DD would even subject to New Zealand tax the income of a trust when the country of the settlor and beneficiary would not tax such income and where the country of source does not tax the income. In other words the OECD hybrid report seems to be advanced to support New Zealand tax applying when no tax would ever arise apart from the existence of a New Zealand resident trustee. We see no basis justifying this approach in terms of either New Zealand’s interests or the OECD report. We are happy to discuss our submission.

1 28 October 2016 Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Wellington 6140 Dear David Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Government discussion document, Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements. We are grateful for the original ten day extension to the deadline for submissions which was notified to us (but please note our comments below in respect of process and timeframe more generally). We appreciate the Government’s desire to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) that occurs via the use of hybrid entities and instruments. New Zealand is part of a globalised economy and needs to consider its policy settings in that context. We acknowledge that New Zealand needs to protect its global reputation by being a ‘good global citizen’ and that, as a consequence, the Government should consider the effect on other countries of New Zealand’s tax policy settings and any changes to those settings. However, we are not convinced that adopting the OECD’s recommendations for addressing hybrid mismatches in the manner and timeframe envisaged is the correct approach. Rather we are concerned that adoption of the OECD’s very broad recommendations as set out in the Discussion Document in the implied timeframe of the next two years or less would be to the detriment of New Zealand businesses and the New Zealand economy generally. New Zealand’s national interest The proposals seem to be us to be inconsistent with the Government’s role of protecting New Zealand’s national interests and growing the New Zealand economy to maximise the welfare of New Zealanders. New Zealand is a capital importer and is comparatively highly reliant on foreign direct investment. If the proposals were implemented in their entirety or in large measure we would be concerned that they would increase the effective tax rate on inbound investment and adversely affect New Zealand’s competitiveness and productivity. New Zealand competes with many other countries for inbound investors seeking to invest in key commercial and infrastructure projects. Such projects are critical for economic development and tax policy settings must remain competitive to ensure tax does not hinder such investment or raise the cost of that investment so that it becomes infeasible. #004 2 In considering whether to adopt the OECD’s hybrid recommendations the Government must be very careful to achieve the appropriate balance between doing what is good for the New Zealand economy and protecting the New Zealand tax base. New Zealand’s primary focus should not be on protecting the tax bases of other countries. Importance of other countries’ responses As noted in the discussion document, the United Kingdom and Australia have indicated their intentions to adopt the OECD’s hybrid recommendations as has the European Union in respect of intra-EU arrangements. The Discussion Document does not consider the intentions of the United States, Canada, Japan, China and Singapore, for example, which are all significant sources of inbound investment into New Zealand and the home of important trading partners for many New Zealand businesses. The indicative timeframe (draft legislation in 2017 and application from early 2018) is such that we believe there is a real risk that New Zealand could end up being a leader rather than a follower in terms of adopting the OECD’s recommendations. Given that few New Zealand businesses are likely to drive decision-making within corporate groups about group structures and intra-group funding arrangements, it seems inappropriate for New Zealand to be a pioneer or one of the early adopters of the OECD’s recommendations. Such decisions are driven by head offices or regional headquarters based in, for example, the United States, Australia or Singapore. The OECD’s hybrid recommendations are premised on their adoption by a number of countries. Generally in a tax context each country is free to determine its own tax policy settings i.e. national sovereignty is paramount. The hybrid proposals are therefore unusual in the sense that they result in the tax treatment in one country being determined or influenced by the tax treatment in another country. In our view the proposals will achieve the OECD’s desired outcome only if they are adopted in many OECD / G20 countries if not all. On the evidence so far it seems likely that many countries, OECD member nations and others, will either not adopt the proposals or will adopt them in part only, or will be late adopters. The risk that the OECD recommendations are not implemented widely must be factored into New Zealand’s response to those recommendations. This risk should not be ignored. As Professor of International Tax Law, Juergen Luedicke, noted in his article in the Bulletin for International Taxation: “Why a state should pioneer the introduction of anti-hybrid rules seems to be a particularly difficult and open question since it is unrealistic that the community of states will achieve a level playing field by introducing harmonised anti hybrid rules. One may well expect at least some states to make a decision not to act if they believe that anti-hybrid rules are apt to put their own industry or inbound investments at a disadvantage.” 1 1 Bulletin for International Taxation June / July 2014, 300 3 The Government needs to be cognisant of the fact that implementation of the proposals could result in New Zealand taxpayers being denied deductions because of the tax treatment that applies in another country, which may not have adopted the proposals itself. We are not suggesting that New Zealand should not be a ‘good global tax citizen’. Our concern is that New Zealand becomes a leader despite the country’s small size and miniscule share of the global tax base for no other reason than to be seen to be making reforms in line with the OECD’s recommendations. The Government needs to bear in mind that the BEPS project including the hybrids recommendations have been driven by countries with significantly larger economies, which are more attractive because they have significantly larger consumer markets and pools of capital. The solutions offered are primarily designed to assist those economies. The size of those economies means that investment is likely to be ‘stickier’. New Zealand’s economy does not have the same attractiveness. It is naïve to assume that New Zealand subsidiaries of multi-national companies will be able to determine or influence the tax treatment of arrangements and financial instruments and changes to that treatment in other countries. The proposals as part of a broader framework We welcomed the release of the draft Inbound Investment Framework and the strong signal it sent that any changes to New Zealand's tax rules in response to the OECD’s BEPS action plan would be considered in the context of a broader framework that focuses on what is good for the New Zealand economy. We were pleased that the draft Framework made it clear that:  a Government priority is to ensure that New Zealand continues to be a good place to invest;  New Zealand’s tax system has the overarching goal of maximising the welfare of New Zealanders and the Framework should be seen as part of this system;  a balance needs to be struck between: o ensuring that taxes do not unduly discourage foreign investment or increase the cost of capital for New Zealand businesses, and o protecting New Zealand’s tax base and preventing tax avoidance;  any proposals to change current policy settings would be considered within an explicit, robust and coherent economic framework. The Discussion Document makes no reference to the Inbound Investment Framework. This surprises us given the Framework was intended to be the guiding document against which proposals to counter BEPS in New Zealand would be measured. 4 Scope and complexity of proposals The proposals in the Discussion Document are cast very broadly and seem to suggest a fundamental re-think of New Zealand’s taxation of inbound and outbound investment. They have implications for many of New Zealand’s taxing regimes including the rules that apply to:  controlled foreign companies  foreign investment funds  branches  thin capitalisation  withholding taxes  source and residence  tax avoidance (New Zealand’s general anti-avoidance rule). The breadth of the proposals is such that they will affect a large number of taxpayers and will have implications for many ordinary business dealings, including, for example, for every taxpayer operating a foreign branch. The potential scope of the proposals is not limited to large multi-national businesses. The proposals will also affect SMEs, partnerships and individual taxpayers. The Discussion Document does not appear to set out the proposed limits of the hybrid project. Paragraphs 4.7 and 4.8 refer briefly to some of the OECD limitations. In our view the Government should confirm upfront as an underlying principle that the scope of the project is limited to financial arrangements (equity, debt and derivatives) and payments under such instruments. It should confirm that finances leases and any tax exemptions New Zealand may provide in whole or in part are outside the scope of the project. The proposals are also extremely complex. The Discussion Document is 83 pages and it effectively recommends the adoption of the 450 pages of OECD recommendations. In our view the breath and complexity of the proposals mean that there is a high risk of overreach and collateral damage i.e. a high risk that the proposals will affect genuine commercial transactions that are not the target of the OECD’s recommendations. Overreach will create a particular problem if deductions are denied on interest cost necessarily incurred in funding New Zealand business operations. The complexity of the proposals is such that they also risk creating real uncertainty for taxpayers. Legislative amendments to address hybrid mismatch arrangements should be drafted narrowly and as precisely as possible so that the potential for overreach and collateral damage to commercial arrangements is avoided or at least minimised as far as possible. 5 As Luedicke states: “Such countermeasures \[anti-hybrid rules\] should be drafted as narrowly and precisely as possible based on a proper consideration of situations which do indeed raise policy concerns. It is important to consider that any countermeasure is a deviation from the “normal” system of the tax law based on rules chosen by a sovereign legislator. These rules are generally independent of other states’ laws. Countermeasures need to be drafted in a way which avoids unintended economic or juridical) double taxation. ... They should not punish taxpayers for behaviour which is caused by uncoordinated or deficient legislation.” 2 There appears to be an underlying assumption that hybrid instruments are exclusively tax driven so that any overreach or collateral damage can be dismissed. We think this assumption is flawed. Timeframe and process A more considered approach will result in a better quality and sustainable outcome, without compromising New Zealand’s ability to achieve appropriate reforms within OECD preferred timeframes. Indeed, the OECD anticipates that countries will need to move at a pace and scope commensurate with their existing tax systems and with legislative and government priorities. In our view the Government would be better advised to take a targeted approach to addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements. By this we mean an approach whereby any amendments to New Zealand’s domestic tax laws are focused specifically on the use of hybrid entities or instruments in New Zealand that the Government does not believe can be addressed by the existing law including the general anti-avoidance rule. A more targeted approach would result in law reform that is more relevant to the New Zealand ‘context’. It would also be able to take into account that New Zealand already has robust primary rules including the denial of foreign dividend exemptions for deductible dividends and a powerful and judicially supported general ant-avoidance rule. A more considered approach would also ensure New Zealand does not become an early adopter or a leader in this context. We understand that Australia has yet to release draft legislation for consultation or introduce a Bill and is unlikely to do so until next year (which, given the Parliamentary process and the Board of Taxation’s recommendation of an application date 6 months after enactment, would suggest a 2019 application date). As a significant portion of New Zealand’s inbound investment is sourced from Australia, it would seem sensible for the Government to wait until Australia’s legislation has been introduced. This would allow the New Zealand legislation to be aligned with Australia’s rules where appropriate. 2 Ibid, 310 6 Part II Part II of the Discussion Document poses twenty nine questions, almost all of which are open ended. For example:  5B “are there any issues with the proposed approach in applying the secondary rule to hybrid dividends?”  5D “will this approach to CFC inclusion give rise to any practical difficulties?”  5H “are there any issues with providing no exclusion for regulatory capital?”  6D “is it appropriate to depart from the OECD’s recommendations in relation to CFC income as dual inclusion income?”  9A “are there any issues that may arise in relation to the implementation of Recommendation 7 (dual resident payers) in New Zealand?” This approach effectively requires taxpayers to anticipate and suggest solutions to any issues arising from the proposals. In our view this analysis should be undertaken by Officials. A more effective approach would be for the Government, first, to clearly articulate the policy rationale for, and the scope of, the project; secondly, to release more detailed targeted proposals; and, thirdly, to prepare, release and consult on draft legislation. Such an approach would allow the private sector to respond to specific proposals rather than to a set of broad, open-ended questions. It would also ensure that Officials have had the opportunity to turn their minds to the policy rationale for specific amendments, to the practical implications of the proposals in a specifically New Zealand context and to drafting rules that are comprehensible and fit for purpose. We provide below some comments on Part II of the Discussion Document. In the time available and given the broad manner in which the questions in Part II are posed, our comments are necessarily of a high level only. Once Officials have undertaken further work on developing proposals that address the issues in a New Zealand context more specifically and have released draft legislation, we are likely to be in a better position to comment more fully. In the meantime the comments made below should be considered preliminary only. 7 Chapter 5: Hybrid financial instruments Recommendation 2: changes to existing domestic rules Expansion of section CW 9(2) (c) We understand the rationale for expanding section CW 9(c) (2) to deny exemption for a dividend which gives rise to tax relief equivalent to a deduction in the payer jurisdiction. Denial of imputation credits It seems appropriate for the definition of “segment” to be changed so that any payment of a dividend on a share subject to a hybrid transfer is treated as a separate segment of foreign sourced income. Recommendation 1: linking rules We consider that the need for a payment deductible in New Zealand under a cross border financial arrangement to be taxed in the hands of a taxpayer of ordinary status within a reasonable period of time fails to fully recognise that hybrid mismatches are often temporary rather than permanent. Any denial of deduction should occur only when the hybrid mismatch has a permanent effect. Differences in valuation of payments not relevant We agree that the difference in valuation of payment is not relevant as a foreign currency loan will normally give rise to a foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the loan. In respect of optional convertible notes in the New Zealand context we suggest that the issue has been settled. New Zealand financial arrangement rules count foreign currency gains or losses as interest. It is proposed that only the interest component under a hybrid instrument be subject to denial of deduction. This means that any foreign currency gain or loss will need to be excluded. This will add to compliance costs and require changes to some accounting systems. Timing differences The Australian Board of Taxation Report has recommended a three year gap between deduction and inclusion of income and payments. Our preference is for the focus to be on permanent mismatches rather than on temporary timing mismatches between deduction and inclusion. This is particularly the case because chapter 11 proposes that withholding tax should continue to apply. This will create double taxation of the same income. It is inconsistent with New Zealand’s approach to the taxation of equity income. A three year approach, as suggested by the Board of Taxation, may be an acceptable compromise to ensure that shorter timing mismatches are not subject to complex rules. A commercial test, where the loan terms match expected cash-flows, should also be available. 8 We support the Board of Taxation’s carry-forward proposal so double taxation does not occur. We also believe consideration should be given to the UK approach of reasonable, consequential adjustments (carry back adjustments). There also needs to be the ability to allow for correction of treatments as countries’ time frames for implementation of the hybrids recommendations will vary, with some countries unlikely to adopt any or very few of the proposals and others likely to defer adoption for some years. Taxation under other countries’ CFC rules It is likely to be difficult for New Zealand corporates to establish that a payment is subject to tax in the hands of the payee’s owner under a CFC regime. New Zealand entities are often at the ‘bottom’ of corporate structures and, in many cases, payments made by or to New Zealand corporates will be immaterial to the group’s overall position. They will often be unfamiliar with the tax treatments prevailing in the jurisdictions in which other members of the group are located. However, given the target is D/NI income, if a CFC regime overturns that result, the hybrid rules should not apply. In the absence of a CFC exclusion, the result of the hybrid rules applying would be an ND/T double taxation result. We are comfortable that the existing onus on taxpayers would mean that only taxpayers who have appropriate systems or material amounts would be able to use this exclusion. The expected difficulty in complying should not prevent those who can comply from benefitting from a principled rule. Proportion of purchase price treated as payment under a financial arrangement There is no principled justification for this proposal. Hybrid transfers We agree that there should be rules to address share loans or share repos (where the transferor and transferee are both treated as the owner of a financial instrument) that give rise to a hybrid mismatch. Substitute payment We agree that, if a substitute payment gives rise to a hybrid mismatch, the hybrid rules should apply subject to any timing rules. Regulatory capital Further detailed consideration needs to be given to whether New Zealand should exclude regulatory capital from any hybrid rules it implements. The Australian Board of Taxation highlighted the complexities and interactions involved and recommended further work be undertaken on the issues. 9 Applying the secondary rule to hybrid dividends We understand the Government’s reasoning for applying the secondary rule to hybrid dividends. Timing mismatches We understand the desirability of matching the Australian approach to removing any timing advantages should New Zealand not adopt the same deferral period. This will also depend on the carry back or forward treatments introduced. Effect of CFC inclusion on application of Recommendation 1 We predict practical difficulties arising where multiple countries are involved with some having hybrid rules and others having no rules or limited rules. Taxpayers will have to bear significant compliance costs. Taxation of FIF interests We recommend that FIF interests are excluded from any hybrid rules. Although any rules may only affect FIFs with ownership between 25 and 40 percent (see our comments regarding structured arrangements), the exclusion of dividend income is in effect part of the income calculation. The FDR, cost and DRR methods are proxies for income from a share that in the classic sense is a dividend. Transfer of assets: revenue account holders We agree that revenue account holders should be exempt from the rules. Transfer of assets: hybrid transfers The recommendation to amend the income tax treatment of New Zealand residents who hold shares subject to a hybrid transfer appears to be a practical response given New Zealand’s current rules. Other exclusions We consider it desirable that New Zealand gives an exemption to any hybrid rules to which a financial trader is a party. This would be consistent with the UK and Australian proposals. Applying within New Zealand We see no policy rationale for applying any hybrid rules to arrangements within New Zealand. 10 Chapter 6: Disregarded hybrid payments We are concerned at the uncertainty likely to arise in this area. As noted at paragraph 6.7 of the Discussion Document the question of whether an entity is a hybrid payer will not turn on a preordained list of entities and no characteristics in and of themselves would qualify an entity as a hybrid payer. An entity that is considered a hybrid payer in one scenario may not be a hybrid payer under a different scenario. In our view caution is required before such a broad-brush recommendation is implemented. Applying carry forward loss rules to carry forward of disallowed deductions We agree that denied deductions should be able to be carried forward. Applying the current carry forward loss rules to the carrying forward of disallowed deductions is less clearly justified. The effect of the denial is either to treat the deduction as not incurred at that point or as a matching rule with the future income. The principled result seems to be to consider whether there is any net income. As there is not, no taxation should arise. Dual inclusion income A simple dual inclusion income approach would be needed to avoid unnecessary complexity and excessive compliance costs. Carry forward / reversal of defensive rule income Given the potential for over-taxation in the absence of a carry-forward rule for the application of the defensive rule, we believe it is appropriate to depart from the OECD’s recommendations. A reversal rule whereby the defensive rule in the payee country could be reversed (through an allowable deemed deduction) in a later year where there is excess dual inclusion income seems easier to apply than a limitation of the defensive rule. CFC income as dual inclusion income Excluding CFC income from dual inclusion income seems appropriate given the likely infrequency of situations in which inclusion is required and the likely complexity of rules to address the issues. However, we note the likely double taxation effect. The ability to exclude CFC income should therefore be considered (in the knowledge that not all taxpayers who might benefit would incur the costs of compliance). 11 Chapter 7: Reverse hybrids Recommendation 4 One of the difficulties with Recommendation 4 is that a taxpayer making the payment will require detailed knowledge of the tax treatment of the payment in the hands of the payee. This is likely to be more difficult for extended control groups (beyond parent-subsidiary relationships). In addition, to administer these rules, Inland Revenue will need to have a complete understanding of the tax treatment of each payment in each jurisdiction. This seems unlikely. Recommendation 5.1: CFC rules We do not believe it is in New Zealand’s interest to amend its CFC rules. New Zealand’s CFC rules are robust and already meet OECD’s best practice. Furthermore, our CFC rules were amended in 2009 to reduce barriers faced by New Zealand companies and encourage businesses with international operations to remain in, establish or expand their offshore activities. The current CFC rules are extremely complex and impose a compliance and administrative burden on taxpayers. Further amendments to the CFC regime, to impose New Zealand tax on income allocated to a New Zealand resident by a reverse hybrid, will increase the complexity of the rules and the compliance and administrative burden. For some CFCs, financial information may not be available. This could occur when the taxpayer does not control the CFC. These proposals could inhibit the retention or establishment of New Zealand based multi- national businesses. We note that the Australian Board of Taxation’s March 2016 report to the Australian Treasurer recommends that OECD Recommendation 5 not be implemented immediately but that it be left open to implement in the future if integrity concerns arise and after the merits have been given further analysis. Reverse hybrid entities established in New Zealand Foreign trusts First, we do not believe New Zealand foreign trusts should be treated as reverse hybrid entities. Foreign income derived by foreign trusts is exempt, New Zealand foreign trusts are taxed on New Zealand sourced income only. New Zealand taxes trusts (including foreign trusts) as opaque entities. For example, where a foreign trust derives New Zealand source income, the trustee is taxable (not the beneficiaries or settlor). If income is allocated to beneficiaries, the tax liability is on the beneficiaries but that is equivalent to a deduction outside the scope of the hybrid proposals, as per the Discussion Document’s own reference (at para 4.7) to the OECD report. If that were not the case, co-operatives would be reverse hybrids. For these reasons alone, foreign trusts should not be classified as reverse hybrid 12 entities. The fact that New Zealand provides an exemption for the foreign sourced income of foreign trusts is not relevant. The OECD report is clear that the fact that a country provides tax exemptions does not create hybrid mismatches that should be subject to these rules. In our view it is inappropriate for New Zealand to tax foreign sourced trustee income. The income has no connection with New Zealand apart from the existence of a trustee in New Zealand who has no beneficial interest in the income. New Zealand’s current trust regime was established in 1988 and is based on the international model that taxes residents on their worldwide income and non-residents on local income derived from that country. Under this model, non-residents are deliberately not subject to New Zealand tax on their foreign sourced income. The Shewan Inquiry reviewed this outcome and concluded the current tax treatment was appropriate. Applying Recommendation 5.2 to tax trustee income, if it is not taxed to the settlor (assuming a settlor is alive and/or exists) or any other person is unprincipled and changes a fundamental aspect of New Zealand’s tax policy settings. From a New Zealand perspective, there has been no erosion of the tax base. New Zealand branches It is not clear that New Zealand should implement a rule that would have the effect of taxing income, that under current New Zealand tax rules is not taxable, simply because it is treated by another jurisdiction as attributable to a New Zealand branch and not taxable in that jurisdiction. As a small capital importing country New Zealand has to balance following the OECD’s recommendation and being an attractive place for non-residents to invest. The Discussion Document appears to fail to consider the recent amendments to the NRWT rules (narrowing of the onshore branch exemption) included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016-17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Bill. As a result of the proposed amendments interest income derived by a non-resident with a New Zealand branch will be subject to NRWT unless the money lent is used by the non-resident for the purposes of a business it carries on through its New Zealand branch. If interest income derived by a non-resident is made taxable because New Zealand implements the OECD recommendation to neutralise mismatches caused by differences in the allocation of income between the branch and head office, New Zealand’s claim to tax increases to 28%. If that tax increase is passed back to a New Zealand borrower (via a gross-up clause), the New Zealand borrower will suffer an increased cost of funding. The lack of discussion of the NRWT amendments surprises us. In considering whether to adopt the OECD hybrid recommendations, the Discussion Document should have considered the outcomes for all of the tax regimes including NRWT. 13 Chapter 8: Deductible hybrid payments Exemption for active income of foreign branch If foreign branch losses are not able to be deducted against New Zealand income, there should be a matching active income exemption. Alternatively, consideration could be given to including a provision that preserves New Zealand tax if a New Zealand corporation has deducted foreign branch losses from its worldwide income and then once it becomes profitable exchanges its branch assets for foreign corporation shares. 14 Chapter 9: Dual resident payers Recommendation 7: Dual residents In our view the Chapter 9 fails to take into account commercial realities. Paragraph 9.3 states: “However, given that dual residence status is in most cases deliberate rather than accidental, it should be possible for taxpayers to be aware of the possibility of double taxation, and by adopting simpler structures, avoid it”. In our experience “dual residence status” is most often the inevitable result of companies operating cross border where New Zealand statute makes a company resident if either incorporated or managed or controlled from New Zealand. In a trans-Tasman context this inevitably gives rise to dual residence. If New Zealand wants to avoid dual residence of companies it should limit the breadth of our corporate residence test – not punish those who are dual resident as a result of it. As the law now stands a New Zealand incorporated company can unintentionally become a dual resident when New Zealand directors, who manage and control the company, emigrate. Practical difficulties will arise in identifying dual inclusion income where income is recognised at a later point in time. Excess amounts disallowed should be able to be carried forward to set off against dual inclusion income in another period. DTA dual resident rule Before implementing such a rule, the implications of treating a New Zealand entity as a non- resident need to be fully considered. The effect on New Zealand’s revenue base must be considered. The rule would mean that all foreign sourced income derived by a non-resident under a DTA tie-breaker test that breaks the residence to the other country would not be subject to New Zealand tax under New Zealand domestic law. Furthermore, non-resident passive income could be subject to a lower rate of New Zealand tax. 15 Chapter 10: Imported mismatches Recommendation 8: Imported mismatch rule We consider that the imported mismatch rule will impose a significant compliance burden on New Zealand taxpayers (and also on Inland Revenue). As acknowledged at paragraph 10.5 the imported mismatch rule will be complex to apply and will require knowledge of the tax consequences of a wide range of transactions within a group. We strongly disagree that the necessary information will be readily available if a group is structured in a straightforward way and monitors the existence of hybrid mismatches intra-group transactions. Given that most of our major trading partners have not implemented these rules it is unlikely that groups will be monitoring the existence of hybrid mismatches on all intra group transactions. The imported mismatch rule can apply where a New Zealand borrower makes a payment under a (vanilla) loan, and under another arrangement in the series there is a relevant mismatch which is not counteracted by foreign equivalent provisions. New Zealand taxpayers will be expected to follow funding arrangements and work out that a mismatch arises in arrangements between third countries. Difficulties in tracing and apportionment are likely. The source and application of funds is not always clear. Taxpayers will need to keep abreast of any law changes in those foreign countries that may change the New Zealand tax treatment. To administer these rules Inland Revenue will need a complete understanding of the respective tax treatment for each entity in a wider chain of entities involved, including aspects that otherwise have no direct effects or consequences from a New Zealand revenue perspective. Based on the OECD recommendations, the imported mismatch rule contains design thresholds which will make the rule extremely difficult to comply with and administer. Importantly, the imported mismatch rule will breach a fundamental tax policy design principle, namely that the policy is workable for taxpayers and compliance costs are kept to a minimum 3 . Further, the fact that this recommendation is being considered undermines the case for adopting the OECD recommendations. Part 1 concludes that global implementation will likely benefit New Zealand. Recommendation 8 assumes the hybrid rules have not been adopted. CA ANZ strongly recommends that Recommendation 8 is not implemented until a majority of other OECD countries have implemented their own hybrid mismatch rules. If New Zealand implements the hybrid mismatch rule ahead of its trading partners, an unfair compliance burden will fall on New Zealand taxpayers. 3 Recommendation 9 1(h) 16 Chapter 11: Design principles, introduction and transitional rules Design principles At this early stage of proposal development we believe that what is likely to be required is a balance of principles-based drafting, which sets out the policy underpinning the rules, and more precise and prescriptive drafting for issues that require clear boundaries and the provision of certainty to taxpayers. In the absence of more definitive proposals, including draft legislation, it is however, difficult to form a view. Date of introduction In our view New Zealand should defer the introduction of anti-hybrid rules until the approach to be adopted in the majority of other OECD and G20 countries is much clearer. Australia and the United Kingdom have progressed further than other OECD / G20 countries but it is important to see how the United States, Canada, Singapore, Japan and other sources of inbound investment also respond. New Zealand should not get ahead of other countries and particularly Australia which we understand has introduced but not enacted legislation. We note that the Board of Taxation in Australia has recommended that the rules should commence in Australia for payments made on or after the later of 1 January 2018 or six months after the hybrid mismatch legislation receives the Royal assent. At a minimum New Zealand should not contemplate an effective date until after the Australian legislation has become effective. Grand-parenting Existing arrangements have been put in place on the basis of the current rules. Applying very complex new rules to existing arrangements seems unfair and likely to impose high compliance costs. On that basis we suggest arrangements existing at the date of introduction of the new rules in a Bill should be grand-parented. If existing arrangements are not grand-parented New Zealand taxpayers will have to bear the costs of unwinding or restructuring existing arrangements (break costs, advisor fees, foreign exchange adjustments) and the additional funding costs of replacing the arrangements. We note that the Australian Board of Taxation has not recommended grand-parenting as a general rule but has suggested that, as the legislation is developed, there may be certain categories of arrangements that are identified as appropriate for grand-parenting. This approach seems to leave significant scope for uncertainty but may be fairer as it allows scope for appropriate grand-parenting. 17 Transitional rules Given the extremely complex nature of the proposals, and the likelihood that the draft legislation could undergo significant change as it goes through Parliament, transitional rules should be introduced. Again the Australian Board of Taxation did not recommend transitional rules generally but noted that during the legislative design process “it may be identified that particular categories of arrangements require transitional rules” – again an approach that could lead to uncertainty but may be helpful from a fairness perspective. De minimis rules In our view de minimis rules can be useful if they minimise the compliance costs imposed on taxpayers. If, however, such rules require taxpayers to undertake complex calculations and analysis to determine whether they can be relied upon, they cease to be useful. The inclusion of a de minimis rule is likely to be particularly important in the context of the imported mismatch rule, which requires taxpayers to be aware of the tax treatment of different entities and instruments in multiple jurisdictions. Withholding tax In our view imposing withholding tax while denying a deduction for a payment would be inequitable. Such an approach would increase the cost of capital if there is a gross up clause, which will generally be the case 18 Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Level 1, Carlaw Park, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell, PO Box 3334, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140, New Zealand 0800 469 422 P +64 9 430 8859 charteredaccountantsanz.com Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ).

Structured arrangement Paragraph 12.7 proposes to amend New Zealand legislation and include a definition of “structured arrangement”. However, we note that paragraph 12.6, which is integral to the definition of “structured arrangement”, will not be incorporated into New Zealand legislation. Paragraph 12.6 sets out the facts and circumstances which should be taken into account in determining whether or not an arrangement has been designed to produce a hybrid mismatch. On its own, paragraph 12.7 is capable of wide application to common investments. (See the FIF paragraphs at 5.41 which raise that possibility.) We refer to Professor Luedicke’s view quoted at page 4. The anti-hybrid rules should be drafted narrowly and precisely. The proposed definition at 12.7 is neither narrow nor precise. We recommend that paragraph 12.6 be incorporated into New Zealand legislation. We are happy to discuss our submissions with you.
